" the euphoria that dominated after the fall of the berlin wall has largely disappeared , " forsa chief manfred guellner told news agency afp .
only 46 percent of germans in the former communist east said their personal situation had improved .
that number was as high as 71 percent in 1989 .
according to the survey , every fourth person in eastern germany believes that life is worse now in the eastern states than it was under communism until 1989 .
only 39 percent believe they have profited from reunification .
the picture was n't much different in western germany where 40 percent said their lives had improved since the end of communism ; in 1989 that number was 52 percent .
attitudes hardening , expert says guellner said attitudes and prejudices had hardened on both sides .
whereas the eastern germans think they have been exploited and got a raw deal , " western germans have the feeling that they have simply footed the bill for eastern germany , " he said .
helping depressed former east germany has long been a priority for the german government .
the eastern states are still struggling with massive unemployment and under-investment , and has one trillion dollars has already been transferred from west to east since reunification .
separately , the munich-based economic research institute ifo predicted that the financial slowdown would widen the economic gap between eastern and western germany .
" in the short-and long-term , the eastern german states will show worse economic growth rates than the western ones , " ifo economic expert joachim ragnitz told news agency ap .
ragnitz pointed to eastern germany 's rapidly ageing population and the flight of younger people to western states as one of the prime reasons for the development , saying that only larger eastern cities such as dresden , potsdam or leipzig would buck the trend . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the diplomatic path is not promising , " middle east expert james phillips of the conservative us heritage foundation wrote , according to the dpa news agency . a carrot-and-stick policy towards iran holds little hope , he added , because " for iran , a nuclear weapon is the biggest carrot . "
phillips warned obama against meeting with iranian leaders , and said he believed tehran would use the event for propaganda and delay tactics .
he said iran was not interested in dialogue and reconciliation with what it calls " the great satan . "
iran 's real achilles ' heel , he said , was its economy , adding that if hurt by harsher sanctions , the rule of iran 's fundamentalists could be seriously challenged .
german-iranian trade but a new round of sanctions risks magnifying the diverging interests between the us and its allies such as germany , which still has firm financial connections with iranian banks and which continues to do business with the islamic republic of around 70 million inhabitants .
in fact , some 75 percent of all medium and small businesses in iran use german-made equipment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has so far come to the table in passing sanctions against iran such trade elements are not specifically forbidden under un security council sanctions , which only limit the sale of technology that could be used in the weapons industry .
in november , the german-iranian chamber of commerce met in hamburg to discuss the un sanctions and how they could affect german firms doing business in the islamic country .
some of the advice included ways of obtaining german government guarantees for trade with tehran , according to iran 's fars news agency and other media reports .
the reaction to this in the us has been one of growing anger , particularly in the conservative press .
" germany loves iran , " the wall street journal said in a commentary by editorial writer dan schwammenthal .
he pointed out that german-iranian trade had increased 14.1 percent in the first seven months of 2008 .
germany , he said , was less worried about an iranian nuclear bomb than it was about tighting sanctions that could negatively affect trade between the two countries .
german chancellor angela merkel has repeatedly emphasized germany 's special responsibility to protect israel .
she insists that germany is only obliged to obey the un sanctions and will not undertake any further unilateral action against iran at this time .
thus , iranian banks such as the government-owned melli and saderat banks - which have been accused by washington of funding terrorists and weapons research - do flourishing business in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysts are split over whether diplomacy or military action are the best way forward this , despite germany having joined the five veto-wielding un security council members in trying to convince iran to drop its nuclear enrichment program .
uncertainty over enrichment solution with such vested interests , it is a matter of debate among conservative thinkers as to whether a peaceful solution can be found to the iranian question .
phillips , the middle east expert , noted the years-long efforts by europeans as part of talks involving germany , britain and france have showed that negotiations bring nothing .
he added that the situation was not helped by the fact that , for example , the german government still undertook credit guarantees for iranian business .
richard haass , president of the council on foreign relations , said however that direct and unconditional negotiations with the government of iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad were the only way forward , even though " diplomacy is not guaranteed to work . " military action against iran , he said , may gain time but would not solve the nuclear enrichment question and would likely trigger retaliatory attacks by iran against us facilities in iraq and afghanistan .
he said such measures would also undoubtedly push up oil prices .

" the diplomatic path is not promising , " middle east expert james phillips of the conservative us heritage foundation wrote , according to the dpa news agency . a carrot-and-stick policy towards iran holds little hope , he added , because " for iran , a nuclear weapon is the biggest carrot . "
phillips warned obama against meeting with iranian leaders , and said he believed tehran would use the event for propaganda and delay tactics .
he said iran was not interested in dialogue and reconciliation with what it calls " the great satan . "
iran 's real achilles ' heel , he said , was its economy , adding that if hurt by harsher sanctions , the rule of iran 's fundamentalists could be seriously challenged .
german-iranian trade but a new round of sanctions risks magnifying the diverging interests between the us and its allies such as germany , which still has firm financial connections with iranian banks and which continues to do business with the islamic republic of around 70 million inhabitants .
in fact , some 75 percent of all medium and small businesses in iran use german-made equipment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has so far come to the table in passing sanctions against iran such trade elements are not specifically forbidden under un security council sanctions , which only limit the sale of technology that could be used in the weapons industry .
in november , the german-iranian chamber of commerce met in hamburg to discuss the un sanctions and how they could affect german firms doing business in the islamic country .
some of the advice included ways of obtaining german government guarantees for trade with tehran , according to iran 's fars news agency and other media reports .
the reaction to this in the us has been one of growing anger , particularly in the conservative press .
" germany loves iran , " the wall street journal said in a commentary by editorial writer dan schwammenthal .
he pointed out that german-iranian trade had increased 14.1 percent in the first seven months of 2008 .
germany , he said , was less worried about an iranian nuclear bomb than it was about tighting sanctions that could negatively affect trade between the two countries .
german chancellor angela merkel has repeatedly emphasized germany 's special responsibility to protect israel .
she insists that germany is only obliged to obey the un sanctions and will not undertake any further unilateral action against iran at this time .
thus , iranian banks such as the government-owned melli and saderat banks - which have been accused by washington of funding terrorists and weapons research - do flourishing business in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysts are split over whether diplomacy or military action are the best way forward this , despite germany having joined the five veto-wielding un security council members in trying to convince iran to drop its nuclear enrichment program .
uncertainty over enrichment solution with such vested interests , it is a matter of debate among conservative thinkers as to whether a peaceful solution can be found to the iranian question .
phillips , the middle east expert , noted the years-long efforts by europeans as part of talks involving germany , britain and france have showed that negotiations bring nothing .
he added that the situation was not helped by the fact that , for example , the german government still undertook credit guarantees for iranian business .
richard haass , president of the council on foreign relations , said however that direct and unconditional negotiations with the government of iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad were the only way forward , even though " diplomacy is not guaranteed to work . " military action against iran , he said , may gain time but would not solve the nuclear enrichment question and would likely trigger retaliatory attacks by iran against us facilities in iraq and afghanistan .
he said such measures would also undoubtedly push up oil prices .

31 .
refugee arrivals from eastern europe have dwindled to a trickle in recent years , negating the usefulness of such a facility .
the marienfelde camp was set up in 1953 and operated first by us , british and french allied officials and later by west berlin authorities .
initially , the center consisted of 15 structures with space for 1,200 individuals , but as the number of refugees swelled , 11 more buildings were added to the facility in 1955 , increasing its capacity to 2,800 .
the refugees were housed in small , self-contained apartments , complete with kitchens and bathrooms .
a camp official says marienfelde was " a place of transition , " where the average length of stay was one to two weeks - this being the time it took refugees to pass through the 12 stages of vetting .
most refugees were germans fed up with life in communist east germany and eager to start over again in the west .
despite welcoming such disaffected hoards , west german officials remained cautious of just who they were letting in to the west .
in the early years of post-world war two europe , at the height of the cold war , dozens of agents from the communist bloc attempted to infiltrate west germany .
marienfelde inundated bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the situation in east germany worsened , the camp became more important berlin bore the costs of the refugees ' housing and meals , while charities offered advice and were generous with donations .
the lutheran and catholic churches provided counseling services and christened , confirmed and married refugees if asked .
of the four million people who fled westward from east germany between 1949 and 1990 , 1.35 million passed through the marienfelde camp .
in the late 1980s , when the communist world started to unravel , large numbers of refugees again began turning up at the camp .
in the spring of 1989 , the marienfelde camp was deluged with new arrivals , among them people of german origin from russia , kazakhstan , kyrgyzstan and ukraine .
in april 1989 , 6,000 arrived .
in may it was double that number .
by november , the camp was jammed with 100,000 refugees .
new beginnings among them in the spring of that year was katrin lange .
after waiting four years for permission to leave east berlin , she suddenly received word she could depart for the west .
at a mass-transit station in east berlin , she bid farewell to her father and brother before making the crossing .
soon after arriving at the marienfelde camp she learned she would be allowed to remain in the west .
a student who had passed examinations qualifying her for university , lange had been denied university admission by east german authorities she says she was not distraught at having to leave her home in the east .
" i had no painful feelings about leaving , but wondered if i would ever see my relatives again , " she says .
but lange need n't have worried .
less than five months later the berlin wall fell and she was joyously reunited with her mother at a crossing point in southern berlin .
lange was later allowed to attend berlin 's free university and then secured a grant to study in montreal , canada .
she is now a reporter working for berlin newspaper der morgenpost .
memory continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sites of significance during the partition of berlin hold memories for millions while the marienfelde center officially closed on wednesday , a handful of refugees still remain on the premises .
they will stay until alternative accommodation is found for them , said a camp official .
" in any case , we wo n't have to worry about the camp being demolished because it has been placed under protection as an historic building , " says bettina effner , who is involved in arranging exhibitions on the remains of the camp .
" we exist so people can continue to understand the atmosphere of a camp like this . " dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

refugee arrivals from eastern europe have dwindled to a trickle in recent years , negating the usefulness of such a facility .
the marienfelde camp was set up in 1953 and operated first by us , british and french allied officials and later by west berlin authorities .
initially , the center consisted of 15 structures with space for 1,200 individuals , but as the number of refugees swelled , 11 more buildings were added to the facility in 1955 , increasing its capacity to 2,800 .
the refugees were housed in small , self-contained apartments , complete with kitchens and bathrooms .
a camp official says marienfelde was " a place of transition , " where the average length of stay was one to two weeks - this being the time it took refugees to pass through the 12 stages of vetting .
most refugees were germans fed up with life in communist east germany and eager to start over again in the west .
despite welcoming such disaffected hoards , west german officials remained cautious of just who they were letting in to the west .
in the early years of post-world war two europe , at the height of the cold war , dozens of agents from the communist bloc attempted to infiltrate west germany .

of the four million people who fled westward from east germany between 1949 and 1990 , 1.35 million passed through the marienfelde camp .
in the late 1980s , when the communist world started to unravel , large numbers of refugees again began turning up at the camp .
in the spring of 1989 , the marienfelde camp was deluged with new arrivals , among them people of german origin from russia , kazakhstan , kyrgyzstan and ukraine .
in april 1989 , 6,000 arrived .
in may it was double that number .

" the euphoria that dominated after the fall of the berlin wall has largely disappeared , " forsa chief manfred guellner told news agency afp .
only 46 percent of germans in the former communist east said their personal situation had improved .
that number was as high as 71 percent in 1989 .
according to the survey , every fourth person in eastern germany believes that life is worse now in the eastern states than it was under communism until 1989 .
only 39 percent believe they have profited from reunification .
the picture was n't much different in western germany where 40 percent said their lives had improved since the end of communism ; in 1989 that number was 52 percent .
attitudes hardening , expert says guellner said attitudes and prejudices had hardened on both sides .
whereas the eastern germans think they have been exploited and got a raw deal , " western germans have the feeling that they have simply footed the bill for eastern germany , " he said .
helping depressed former east germany has long been a priority for the german government .
the eastern states are still struggling with massive unemployment and under-investment , and has one trillion dollars has already been transferred from west to east since reunification .
separately , the munich-based economic research institute ifo predicted that the financial slowdown would widen the economic gap between eastern and western germany .
" in the short-and long-term , the eastern german states will show worse economic growth rates than the western ones , " ifo economic expert joachim ragnitz told news agency ap .
ragnitz pointed to eastern germany 's rapidly ageing population and the flight of younger people to western states as one of the prime reasons for the development , saying that only larger eastern cities such as dresden , potsdam or leipzig would buck the trend . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the euphoria that dominated after the fall of the berlin wall has largely disappeared , " forsa chief manfred guellner told news agency afp .
only 46 percent of germans in the former communist east said their personal situation had improved .
that number was as high as 71 percent in 1989 .
according to the survey , every fourth person in eastern germany believes that life is worse now in the eastern states than it was under communism until 1989 .
only 39 percent believe they have profited from reunification .
the picture was n't much different in western germany where 40 percent said their lives had improved since the end of communism ; in 1989 that number was 52 percent .
attitudes hardening , expert says guellner said attitudes and prejudices had hardened on both sides .
whereas the eastern germans think they have been exploited and got a raw deal , " western germans have the feeling that they have simply footed the bill for eastern germany , " he said .
helping depressed former east germany has long been a priority for the german government .
the eastern states are still struggling with massive unemployment and under-investment , and has one trillion dollars has already been transferred from west to east since reunification .
separately , the munich-based economic research institute ifo predicted that the financial slowdown would widen the economic gap between eastern and western germany .
" in the short-and long-term , the eastern german states will show worse economic growth rates than the western ones , " ifo economic expert joachim ragnitz told news agency ap .
ragnitz pointed to eastern germany 's rapidly ageing population and the flight of younger people to western states as one of the prime reasons for the development , saying that only larger eastern cities such as dresden , potsdam or leipzig would buck the trend . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 02.01.2009 diverging interests as us , germany tackle iranian question großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad says nuclear enrichment is iran 's right a us think tank has warned that diplomacy would not stop iran 's nuclear program and that harsher sanctions against tehran should be adopted , a move that could drive a wedge between the white house and germany . us president-elect barack obama has vowed to " do everything that is required " to prevent iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon , including harsher sanctions and , if necessary , military action .
" the diplomatic path is not promising , " middle east expert james phillips of the conservative us heritage foundation wrote , according to the dpa news agency . a carrot-and-stick policy towards iran holds little hope , he added , because " for iran , a nuclear weapon is the biggest carrot . "
phillips warned obama against meeting with iranian leaders , and said he believed tehran would use the event for propaganda and delay tactics .
he said iran was not interested in dialogue and reconciliation with what it calls " the great satan . "
iran 's real achilles ' heel , he said , was its economy , adding that if hurt by harsher sanctions , the rule of iran 's fundamentalists could be seriously challenged .
german-iranian trade but a new round of sanctions risks magnifying the diverging interests between the us and its allies such as germany , which still has firm financial connections with iranian banks and which continues to do business with the islamic republic of around 70 million inhabitants .
in fact , some 75 percent of all medium and small businesses in iran use german-made equipment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has so far come to the table in passing sanctions against iran such trade elements are not specifically forbidden under un security council sanctions , which only limit the sale of technology that could be used in the weapons industry .
in november , the german-iranian chamber of commerce met in hamburg to discuss the un sanctions and how they could affect german firms doing business in the islamic country .
some of the advice included ways of obtaining german government guarantees for trade with tehran , according to iran 's fars news agency and other media reports .
the reaction to this in the us has been one of growing anger , particularly in the conservative press .
" germany loves iran , " the wall street journal said in a commentary by editorial writer dan schwammenthal .
he pointed out that german-iranian trade had increased 14.1 percent in the first seven months of 2008 .
germany , he said , was less worried about an iranian nuclear bomb than it was about tighting sanctions that could negatively affect trade between the two countries .
german chancellor angela merkel has repeatedly emphasized germany 's special responsibility to protect israel .
she insists that germany is only obliged to obey the un sanctions and will not undertake any further unilateral action against iran at this time .
thus , iranian banks such as the government-owned melli and saderat banks - which have been accused by washington of funding terrorists and weapons research - do flourishing business in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysts are split over whether diplomacy or military action are the best way forward this , despite germany having joined the five veto-wielding un security council members in trying to convince iran to drop its nuclear enrichment program .
uncertainty over enrichment solution with such vested interests , it is a matter of debate among conservative thinkers as to whether a peaceful solution can be found to the iranian question .
phillips , the middle east expert , noted the years-long efforts by europeans as part of talks involving germany , britain and france have showed that negotiations bring nothing .
he added that the situation was not helped by the fact that , for example , the german government still undertook credit guarantees for iranian business .
richard haass , president of the council on foreign relations , said however that direct and unconditional negotiations with the government of iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad were the only way forward , even though " diplomacy is not guaranteed to work . " military action against iran , he said , may gain time but would not solve the nuclear enrichment question and would likely trigger retaliatory attacks by iran against us facilities in iraq and afghanistan .
he said such measures would also undoubtedly push up oil prices .
as for the role of the europeans in a new sanctions effort , many us analysts believe that they are more worried about keeping the us from invading iran than they are about iran 's development of nuclear weapons . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

refugee arrivals from eastern europe have dwindled to a trickle in recent years , negating the usefulness of such a facility .
the marienfelde camp was set up in 1953 and operated first by us , british and french allied officials and later by west berlin authorities .
initially , the center consisted of 15 structures with space for 1,200 individuals , but as the number of refugees swelled , 11 more buildings were added to the facility in 1955 , increasing its capacity to 2,800 .
the refugees were housed in small , self-contained apartments , complete with kitchens and bathrooms .
a camp official says marienfelde was " a place of transition , " where the average length of stay was one to two weeks - this being the time it took refugees to pass through the 12 stages of vetting .
most refugees were germans fed up with life in communist east germany and eager to start over again in the west .
despite welcoming such disaffected hoards , west german officials remained cautious of just who they were letting in to the west .
in the early years of post-world war two europe , at the height of the cold war , dozens of agents from the communist bloc attempted to infiltrate west germany .

of the four million people who fled westward from east germany between 1949 and 1990 , 1.35 million passed through the marienfelde camp .
in the late 1980s , when the communist world started to unravel , large numbers of refugees again began turning up at the camp .
in the spring of 1989 , the marienfelde camp was deluged with new arrivals , among them people of german origin from russia , kazakhstan , kyrgyzstan and ukraine .
in april 1989 , 6,000 arrived .
in may it was double that number .
by november , the camp was jammed with 100,000 refugees .
new beginnings among them in the spring of that year was katrin lange .
after waiting four years for permission to leave east berlin , she suddenly received word she could depart for the west .
at a mass-transit station in east berlin , she bid farewell to her father and brother before making the crossing .
soon after arriving at the marienfelde camp she learned she would be allowed to remain in the west .
a student who had passed examinations qualifying her for university , lange had been denied university admission by east german authorities she says she was not distraught at having to leave her home in the east .
" i had no painful feelings about leaving , but wondered if i would ever see my relatives again , " she says .
but lange need n't have worried .
less than five months later the berlin wall fell and she was joyously reunited with her mother at a crossing point in southern berlin .
lange was later allowed to attend berlin 's free university and then secured a grant to study in montreal , canada .

" the diplomatic path is not promising , " middle east expert james phillips of the conservative us heritage foundation wrote , according to the dpa news agency . a carrot-and-stick policy towards iran holds little hope , he added , because " for iran , a nuclear weapon is the biggest carrot . "
phillips warned obama against meeting with iranian leaders , and said he believed tehran would use the event for propaganda and delay tactics .
he said iran was not interested in dialogue and reconciliation with what it calls " the great satan . "
iran 's real achilles ' heel , he said , was its economy , adding that if hurt by harsher sanctions , the rule of iran 's fundamentalists could be seriously challenged .
german-iranian trade but a new round of sanctions risks magnifying the diverging interests between the us and its allies such as germany , which still has firm financial connections with iranian banks and which continues to do business with the islamic republic of around 70 million inhabitants .
in fact , some 75 percent of all medium and small businesses in iran use german-made equipment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has so far come to the table in passing sanctions against iran such trade elements are not specifically forbidden under un security council sanctions , which only limit the sale of technology that could be used in the weapons industry .
in november , the german-iranian chamber of commerce met in hamburg to discuss the un sanctions and how they could affect german firms doing business in the islamic country .
some of the advice included ways of obtaining german government guarantees for trade with tehran , according to iran 's fars news agency and other media reports .
the reaction to this in the us has been one of growing anger , particularly in the conservative press .
" germany loves iran , " the wall street journal said in a commentary by editorial writer dan schwammenthal .
he pointed out that german-iranian trade had increased 14.1 percent in the first seven months of 2008 .
germany , he said , was less worried about an iranian nuclear bomb than it was about tighting sanctions that could negatively affect trade between the two countries .
german chancellor angela merkel has repeatedly emphasized germany 's special responsibility to protect israel .
she insists that germany is only obliged to obey the un sanctions and will not undertake any further unilateral action against iran at this time .
thus , iranian banks such as the government-owned melli and saderat banks - which have been accused by washington of funding terrorists and weapons research - do flourishing business in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysts are split over whether diplomacy or military action are the best way forward this , despite germany having joined the five veto-wielding un security council members in trying to convince iran to drop its nuclear enrichment program .
uncertainty over enrichment solution with such vested interests , it is a matter of debate among conservative thinkers as to whether a peaceful solution can be found to the iranian question .
phillips , the middle east expert , noted the years-long efforts by europeans as part of talks involving germany , britain and france have showed that negotiations bring nothing .
he added that the situation was not helped by the fact that , for example , the german government still undertook credit guarantees for iranian business .
richard haass , president of the council on foreign relations , said however that direct and unconditional negotiations with the government of iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad were the only way forward , even though " diplomacy is not guaranteed to work . " military action against iran , he said , may gain time but would not solve the nuclear enrichment question and would likely trigger retaliatory attacks by iran against us facilities in iraq and afghanistan .
he said such measures would also undoubtedly push up oil prices .

refugee arrivals from eastern europe have dwindled to a trickle in recent years , negating the usefulness of such a facility .
the marienfelde camp was set up in 1953 and operated first by us , british and french allied officials and later by west berlin authorities .
initially , the center consisted of 15 structures with space for 1,200 individuals , but as the number of refugees swelled , 11 more buildings were added to the facility in 1955 , increasing its capacity to 2,800 .
the refugees were housed in small , self-contained apartments , complete with kitchens and bathrooms .
a camp official says marienfelde was " a place of transition , " where the average length of stay was one to two weeks - this being the time it took refugees to pass through the 12 stages of vetting .
most refugees were germans fed up with life in communist east germany and eager to start over again in the west .
despite welcoming such disaffected hoards , west german officials remained cautious of just who they were letting in to the west .

of the four million people who fled westward from east germany between 1949 and 1990 , 1.35 million passed through the marienfelde camp .
in the late 1980s , when the communist world started to unravel , large numbers of refugees again began turning up at the camp .
in the spring of 1989 , the marienfelde camp was deluged with new arrivals , among them people of german origin from russia , kazakhstan , kyrgyzstan and ukraine .
in april 1989 , 6,000 arrived .
in may it was double that number .
by november , the camp was jammed with 100,000 refugees .
new beginnings among them in the spring of that year was katrin lange .
after waiting four years for permission to leave east berlin , she suddenly received word she could depart for the west .
at a mass-transit station in east berlin , she bid farewell to her father and brother before making the crossing .
soon after arriving at the marienfelde camp she learned she would be allowed to remain in the west .
a student who had passed examinations qualifying her for university , lange had been denied university admission by east german authorities she says she was not distraught at having to leave her home in the east .
" i had no painful feelings about leaving , but wondered if i would ever see my relatives again , " she says .
but lange need n't have worried .
less than five months later the berlin wall fell and she was joyously reunited with her mother at a crossing point in southern berlin .
lange was later allowed to attend berlin 's free university and then secured a grant to study in montreal , canada .

" the diplomatic path is not promising , " middle east expert james phillips of the conservative us heritage foundation wrote , according to the dpa news agency . a carrot-and-stick policy towards iran holds little hope , he added , because " for iran , a nuclear weapon is the biggest carrot . "
phillips warned obama against meeting with iranian leaders , and said he believed tehran would use the event for propaganda and delay tactics .
he said iran was not interested in dialogue and reconciliation with what it calls " the great satan . "
iran 's real achilles ' heel , he said , was its economy , adding that if hurt by harsher sanctions , the rule of iran 's fundamentalists could be seriously challenged .
german-iranian trade but a new round of sanctions risks magnifying the diverging interests between the us and its allies such as germany , which still has firm financial connections with iranian banks and which continues to do business with the islamic republic of around 70 million inhabitants .
in fact , some 75 percent of all medium and small businesses in iran use german-made equipment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has so far come to the table in passing sanctions against iran such trade elements are not specifically forbidden under un security council sanctions , which only limit the sale of technology that could be used in the weapons industry .
in november , the german-iranian chamber of commerce met in hamburg to discuss the un sanctions and how they could affect german firms doing business in the islamic country .
some of the advice included ways of obtaining german government guarantees for trade with tehran , according to iran 's fars news agency and other media reports .
the reaction to this in the us has been one of growing anger , particularly in the conservative press .
" germany loves iran , " the wall street journal said in a commentary by editorial writer dan schwammenthal .
he pointed out that german-iranian trade had increased 14.1 percent in the first seven months of 2008 .
germany , he said , was less worried about an iranian nuclear bomb than it was about tighting sanctions that could negatively affect trade between the two countries .
german chancellor angela merkel has repeatedly emphasized germany 's special responsibility to protect israel .
she insists that germany is only obliged to obey the un sanctions and will not undertake any further unilateral action against iran at this time .
thus , iranian banks such as the government-owned melli and saderat banks - which have been accused by washington of funding terrorists and weapons research - do flourishing business in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysts are split over whether diplomacy or military action are the best way forward this , despite germany having joined the five veto-wielding un security council members in trying to convince iran to drop its nuclear enrichment program .
uncertainty over enrichment solution with such vested interests , it is a matter of debate among conservative thinkers as to whether a peaceful solution can be found to the iranian question .
phillips , the middle east expert , noted the years-long efforts by europeans as part of talks involving germany , britain and france have showed that negotiations bring nothing .
he added that the situation was not helped by the fact that , for example , the german government still undertook credit guarantees for iranian business .
richard haass , president of the council on foreign relations , said however that direct and unconditional negotiations with the government of iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad were the only way forward , even though " diplomacy is not guaranteed to work . " military action against iran , he said , may gain time but would not solve the nuclear enrichment question and would likely trigger retaliatory attacks by iran against us facilities in iraq and afghanistan .
he said such measures would also undoubtedly push up oil prices .
as for the role of the europeans in a new sanctions effort , many us analysts believe that they are more worried about keeping the us from invading iran than they are about iran 's development of nuclear weapons . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

31 .
refugee arrivals from eastern europe have dwindled to a trickle in recent years , negating the usefulness of such a facility .
the marienfelde camp was set up in 1953 and operated first by us , british and french allied officials and later by west berlin authorities .
initially , the center consisted of 15 structures with space for 1,200 individuals , but as the number of refugees swelled , 11 more buildings were added to the facility in 1955 , increasing its capacity to 2,800 .
the refugees were housed in small , self-contained apartments , complete with kitchens and bathrooms .
a camp official says marienfelde was " a place of transition , " where the average length of stay was one to two weeks - this being the time it took refugees to pass through the 12 stages of vetting .
most refugees were germans fed up with life in communist east germany and eager to start over again in the west .
despite welcoming such disaffected hoards , west german officials remained cautious of just who they were letting in to the west .
in the early years of post-world war two europe , at the height of the cold war , dozens of agents from the communist bloc attempted to infiltrate west germany .
marienfelde inundated bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the situation in east germany worsened , the camp became more important berlin bore the costs of the refugees ' housing and meals , while charities offered advice and were generous with donations .
the lutheran and catholic churches provided counseling services and christened , confirmed and married refugees if asked .
of the four million people who fled westward from east germany between 1949 and 1990 , 1.35 million passed through the marienfelde camp .
in the late 1980s , when the communist world started to unravel , large numbers of refugees again began turning up at the camp .
in the spring of 1989 , the marienfelde camp was deluged with new arrivals , among them people of german origin from russia , kazakhstan , kyrgyzstan and ukraine .
in april 1989 , 6,000 arrived .
in may it was double that number .
by november , the camp was jammed with 100,000 refugees .
new beginnings among them in the spring of that year was katrin lange .
after waiting four years for permission to leave east berlin , she suddenly received word she could depart for the west .
at a mass-transit station in east berlin , she bid farewell to her father and brother before making the crossing .
soon after arriving at the marienfelde camp she learned she would be allowed to remain in the west .
a student who had passed examinations qualifying her for university , lange had been denied university admission by east german authorities she says she was not distraught at having to leave her home in the east .
" i had no painful feelings about leaving , but wondered if i would ever see my relatives again , " she says .
but lange need n't have worried .
less than five months later the berlin wall fell and she was joyously reunited with her mother at a crossing point in southern berlin .
lange was later allowed to attend berlin 's free university and then secured a grant to study in montreal , canada .
she is now a reporter working for berlin newspaper der morgenpost .
memory continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sites of significance during the partition of berlin hold memories for millions while the marienfelde center officially closed on wednesday , a handful of refugees still remain on the premises .
they will stay until alternative accommodation is found for them , said a camp official .
" in any case , we wo n't have to worry about the camp being demolished because it has been placed under protection as an historic building , " says bettina effner , who is involved in arranging exhibitions on the remains of the camp .

31 .
refugee arrivals from eastern europe have dwindled to a trickle in recent years , negating the usefulness of such a facility .
the marienfelde camp was set up in 1953 and operated first by us , british and french allied officials and later by west berlin authorities .
initially , the center consisted of 15 structures with space for 1,200 individuals , but as the number of refugees swelled , 11 more buildings were added to the facility in 1955 , increasing its capacity to 2,800 .
the refugees were housed in small , self-contained apartments , complete with kitchens and bathrooms .
a camp official says marienfelde was " a place of transition , " where the average length of stay was one to two weeks - this being the time it took refugees to pass through the 12 stages of vetting .
most refugees were germans fed up with life in communist east germany and eager to start over again in the west .
despite welcoming such disaffected hoards , west german officials remained cautious of just who they were letting in to the west .
in the early years of post-world war two europe , at the height of the cold war , dozens of agents from the communist bloc attempted to infiltrate west germany .
marienfelde inundated bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the situation in east germany worsened , the camp became more important berlin bore the costs of the refugees ' housing and meals , while charities offered advice and were generous with donations .
the lutheran and catholic churches provided counseling services and christened , confirmed and married refugees if asked .
of the four million people who fled westward from east germany between 1949 and 1990 , 1.35 million passed through the marienfelde camp .
in the late 1980s , when the communist world started to unravel , large numbers of refugees again began turning up at the camp .
in the spring of 1989 , the marienfelde camp was deluged with new arrivals , among them people of german origin from russia , kazakhstan , kyrgyzstan and ukraine .
in april 1989 , 6,000 arrived .
in may it was double that number .
by november , the camp was jammed with 100,000 refugees .
new beginnings among them in the spring of that year was katrin lange .
after waiting four years for permission to leave east berlin , she suddenly received word she could depart for the west .
at a mass-transit station in east berlin , she bid farewell to her father and brother before making the crossing .
soon after arriving at the marienfelde camp she learned she would be allowed to remain in the west .
a student who had passed examinations qualifying her for university , lange had been denied university admission by east german authorities she says she was not distraught at having to leave her home in the east .
" i had no painful feelings about leaving , but wondered if i would ever see my relatives again , " she says .
but lange need n't have worried .
less than five months later the berlin wall fell and she was joyously reunited with her mother at a crossing point in southern berlin .
lange was later allowed to attend berlin 's free university and then secured a grant to study in montreal , canada .
she is now a reporter working for berlin newspaper der morgenpost .

31 .
refugee arrivals from eastern europe have dwindled to a trickle in recent years , negating the usefulness of such a facility .
the marienfelde camp was set up in 1953 and operated first by us , british and french allied officials and later by west berlin authorities .
initially , the center consisted of 15 structures with space for 1,200 individuals , but as the number of refugees swelled , 11 more buildings were added to the facility in 1955 , increasing its capacity to 2,800 .
the refugees were housed in small , self-contained apartments , complete with kitchens and bathrooms .
a camp official says marienfelde was " a place of transition , " where the average length of stay was one to two weeks - this being the time it took refugees to pass through the 12 stages of vetting .
most refugees were germans fed up with life in communist east germany and eager to start over again in the west .
despite welcoming such disaffected hoards , west german officials remained cautious of just who they were letting in to the west .
in the early years of post-world war two europe , at the height of the cold war , dozens of agents from the communist bloc attempted to infiltrate west germany .
marienfelde inundated bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the situation in east germany worsened , the camp became more important berlin bore the costs of the refugees ' housing and meals , while charities offered advice and were generous with donations .
the lutheran and catholic churches provided counseling services and christened , confirmed and married refugees if asked .
of the four million people who fled westward from east germany between 1949 and 1990 , 1.35 million passed through the marienfelde camp .
in the late 1980s , when the communist world started to unravel , large numbers of refugees again began turning up at the camp .
in the spring of 1989 , the marienfelde camp was deluged with new arrivals , among them people of german origin from russia , kazakhstan , kyrgyzstan and ukraine .
in april 1989 , 6,000 arrived .
in may it was double that number .
by november , the camp was jammed with 100,000 refugees .
new beginnings among them in the spring of that year was katrin lange .
after waiting four years for permission to leave east berlin , she suddenly received word she could depart for the west .
at a mass-transit station in east berlin , she bid farewell to her father and brother before making the crossing .
soon after arriving at the marienfelde camp she learned she would be allowed to remain in the west .
a student who had passed examinations qualifying her for university , lange had been denied university admission by east german authorities she says she was not distraught at having to leave her home in the east .
" i had no painful feelings about leaving , but wondered if i would ever see my relatives again , " she says .
but lange need n't have worried .
less than five months later the berlin wall fell and she was joyously reunited with her mother at a crossing point in southern berlin .
lange was later allowed to attend berlin 's free university and then secured a grant to study in montreal , canada .
she is now a reporter working for berlin newspaper der morgenpost .
memory continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sites of significance during the partition of berlin hold memories for millions while the marienfelde center officially closed on wednesday , a handful of refugees still remain on the premises .
they will stay until alternative accommodation is found for them , said a camp official .
" in any case , we wo n't have to worry about the camp being demolished because it has been placed under protection as an historic building , " says bettina effner , who is involved in arranging exhibitions on the remains of the camp .

refugee arrivals from eastern europe have dwindled to a trickle in recent years , negating the usefulness of such a facility .
the marienfelde camp was set up in 1953 and operated first by us , british and french allied officials and later by west berlin authorities .
initially , the center consisted of 15 structures with space for 1,200 individuals , but as the number of refugees swelled , 11 more buildings were added to the facility in 1955 , increasing its capacity to 2,800 .
the refugees were housed in small , self-contained apartments , complete with kitchens and bathrooms .

most refugees were germans fed up with life in communist east germany and eager to start over again in the west .
despite welcoming such disaffected hoards , west german officials remained cautious of just who they were letting in to the west .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 02.01.2009 diverging interests as us , germany tackle iranian question großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad says nuclear enrichment is iran 's right a us think tank has warned that diplomacy would not stop iran 's nuclear program and that harsher sanctions against tehran should be adopted , a move that could drive a wedge between the white house and germany . us president-elect barack obama has vowed to " do everything that is required " to prevent iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon , including harsher sanctions and , if necessary , military action .
" the diplomatic path is not promising , " middle east expert james phillips of the conservative us heritage foundation wrote , according to the dpa news agency . a carrot-and-stick policy towards iran holds little hope , he added , because " for iran , a nuclear weapon is the biggest carrot . "
phillips warned obama against meeting with iranian leaders , and said he believed tehran would use the event for propaganda and delay tactics .
he said iran was not interested in dialogue and reconciliation with what it calls " the great satan . "
iran 's real achilles ' heel , he said , was its economy , adding that if hurt by harsher sanctions , the rule of iran 's fundamentalists could be seriously challenged .
german-iranian trade but a new round of sanctions risks magnifying the diverging interests between the us and its allies such as germany , which still has firm financial connections with iranian banks and which continues to do business with the islamic republic of around 70 million inhabitants .
in fact , some 75 percent of all medium and small businesses in iran use german-made equipment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has so far come to the table in passing sanctions against iran such trade elements are not specifically forbidden under un security council sanctions , which only limit the sale of technology that could be used in the weapons industry .
in november , the german-iranian chamber of commerce met in hamburg to discuss the un sanctions and how they could affect german firms doing business in the islamic country .
some of the advice included ways of obtaining german government guarantees for trade with tehran , according to iran 's fars news agency and other media reports .
the reaction to this in the us has been one of growing anger , particularly in the conservative press .
" germany loves iran , " the wall street journal said in a commentary by editorial writer dan schwammenthal .
he pointed out that german-iranian trade had increased 14.1 percent in the first seven months of 2008 .
germany , he said , was less worried about an iranian nuclear bomb than it was about tighting sanctions that could negatively affect trade between the two countries .
german chancellor angela merkel has repeatedly emphasized germany 's special responsibility to protect israel .
she insists that germany is only obliged to obey the un sanctions and will not undertake any further unilateral action against iran at this time .
thus , iranian banks such as the government-owned melli and saderat banks - which have been accused by washington of funding terrorists and weapons research - do flourishing business in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysts are split over whether diplomacy or military action are the best way forward this , despite germany having joined the five veto-wielding un security council members in trying to convince iran to drop its nuclear enrichment program .
uncertainty over enrichment solution with such vested interests , it is a matter of debate among conservative thinkers as to whether a peaceful solution can be found to the iranian question .
phillips , the middle east expert , noted the years-long efforts by europeans as part of talks involving germany , britain and france have showed that negotiations bring nothing .
he added that the situation was not helped by the fact that , for example , the german government still undertook credit guarantees for iranian business .
richard haass , president of the council on foreign relations , said however that direct and unconditional negotiations with the government of iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad were the only way forward , even though " diplomacy is not guaranteed to work . " military action against iran , he said , may gain time but would not solve the nuclear enrichment question and would likely trigger retaliatory attacks by iran against us facilities in iraq and afghanistan .
he said such measures would also undoubtedly push up oil prices .
as for the role of the europeans in a new sanctions effort , many us analysts believe that they are more worried about keeping the us from invading iran than they are about iran 's development of nuclear weapons . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the diplomatic path is not promising , " middle east expert james phillips of the conservative us heritage foundation wrote , according to the dpa news agency . a carrot-and-stick policy towards iran holds little hope , he added , because " for iran , a nuclear weapon is the biggest carrot . "
phillips warned obama against meeting with iranian leaders , and said he believed tehran would use the event for propaganda and delay tactics .
he said iran was not interested in dialogue and reconciliation with what it calls " the great satan . "
iran 's real achilles ' heel , he said , was its economy , adding that if hurt by harsher sanctions , the rule of iran 's fundamentalists could be seriously challenged .
german-iranian trade but a new round of sanctions risks magnifying the diverging interests between the us and its allies such as germany , which still has firm financial connections with iranian banks and which continues to do business with the islamic republic of around 70 million inhabitants .
in fact , some 75 percent of all medium and small businesses in iran use german-made equipment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has so far come to the table in passing sanctions against iran such trade elements are not specifically forbidden under un security council sanctions , which only limit the sale of technology that could be used in the weapons industry .
in november , the german-iranian chamber of commerce met in hamburg to discuss the un sanctions and how they could affect german firms doing business in the islamic country .
some of the advice included ways of obtaining german government guarantees for trade with tehran , according to iran 's fars news agency and other media reports .
the reaction to this in the us has been one of growing anger , particularly in the conservative press .
" germany loves iran , " the wall street journal said in a commentary by editorial writer dan schwammenthal .
he pointed out that german-iranian trade had increased 14.1 percent in the first seven months of 2008 .
germany , he said , was less worried about an iranian nuclear bomb than it was about tighting sanctions that could negatively affect trade between the two countries .
german chancellor angela merkel has repeatedly emphasized germany 's special responsibility to protect israel .
she insists that germany is only obliged to obey the un sanctions and will not undertake any further unilateral action against iran at this time .
thus , iranian banks such as the government-owned melli and saderat banks - which have been accused by washington of funding terrorists and weapons research - do flourishing business in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysts are split over whether diplomacy or military action are the best way forward this , despite germany having joined the five veto-wielding un security council members in trying to convince iran to drop its nuclear enrichment program .
uncertainty over enrichment solution with such vested interests , it is a matter of debate among conservative thinkers as to whether a peaceful solution can be found to the iranian question .
phillips , the middle east expert , noted the years-long efforts by europeans as part of talks involving germany , britain and france have showed that negotiations bring nothing .
he added that the situation was not helped by the fact that , for example , the german government still undertook credit guarantees for iranian business .
richard haass , president of the council on foreign relations , said however that direct and unconditional negotiations with the government of iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad were the only way forward , even though " diplomacy is not guaranteed to work . " military action against iran , he said , may gain time but would not solve the nuclear enrichment question and would likely trigger retaliatory attacks by iran against us facilities in iraq and afghanistan .
he said such measures would also undoubtedly push up oil prices .
as for the role of the europeans in a new sanctions effort , many us analysts believe that they are more worried about keeping the us from invading iran than they are about iran 's development of nuclear weapons . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he said iran was not interested in dialogue and reconciliation with what it calls " the great satan . "
iran 's real achilles ' heel , he said , was its economy , adding that if hurt by harsher sanctions , the rule of iran 's fundamentalists could be seriously challenged .
german-iranian trade but a new round of sanctions risks magnifying the diverging interests between the us and its allies such as germany , which still has firm financial connections with iranian banks and which continues to do business with the islamic republic of around 70 million inhabitants .
in fact , some 75 percent of all medium and small businesses in iran use german-made equipment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has so far come to the table in passing sanctions against iran such trade elements are not specifically forbidden under un security council sanctions , which only limit the sale of technology that could be used in the weapons industry .
in november , the german-iranian chamber of commerce met in hamburg to discuss the un sanctions and how they could affect german firms doing business in the islamic country .
some of the advice included ways of obtaining german government guarantees for trade with tehran , according to iran 's fars news agency and other media reports .
the reaction to this in the us has been one of growing anger , particularly in the conservative press .
" germany loves iran , " the wall street journal said in a commentary by editorial writer dan schwammenthal .
he pointed out that german-iranian trade had increased 14.1 percent in the first seven months of 2008 .
germany , he said , was less worried about an iranian nuclear bomb than it was about tighting sanctions that could negatively affect trade between the two countries .
german chancellor angela merkel has repeatedly emphasized germany 's special responsibility to protect israel .
she insists that germany is only obliged to obey the un sanctions and will not undertake any further unilateral action against iran at this time .
thus , iranian banks such as the government-owned melli and saderat banks - which have been accused by washington of funding terrorists and weapons research - do flourishing business in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysts are split over whether diplomacy or military action are the best way forward this , despite germany having joined the five veto-wielding un security council members in trying to convince iran to drop its nuclear enrichment program .
uncertainty over enrichment solution with such vested interests , it is a matter of debate among conservative thinkers as to whether a peaceful solution can be found to the iranian question .
phillips , the middle east expert , noted the years-long efforts by europeans as part of talks involving germany , britain and france have showed that negotiations bring nothing .
he added that the situation was not helped by the fact that , for example , the german government still undertook credit guarantees for iranian business .
richard haass , president of the council on foreign relations , said however that direct and unconditional negotiations with the government of iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad were the only way forward , even though " diplomacy is not guaranteed to work . " military action against iran , he said , may gain time but would not solve the nuclear enrichment question and would likely trigger retaliatory attacks by iran against us facilities in iraq and afghanistan .
he said such measures would also undoubtedly push up oil prices .
as for the role of the europeans in a new sanctions effort , many us analysts believe that they are more worried about keeping the us from invading iran than they are about iran 's development of nuclear weapons . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the euphoria that dominated after the fall of the berlin wall has largely disappeared , " forsa chief manfred guellner told news agency afp .
only 46 percent of germans in the former communist east said their personal situation had improved .
that number was as high as 71 percent in 1989 .
according to the survey , every fourth person in eastern germany believes that life is worse now in the eastern states than it was under communism until 1989 .
only 39 percent believe they have profited from reunification .
the picture was n't much different in western germany where 40 percent said their lives had improved since the end of communism ; in 1989 that number was 52 percent .
attitudes hardening , expert says guellner said attitudes and prejudices had hardened on both sides .
whereas the eastern germans think they have been exploited and got a raw deal , " western germans have the feeling that they have simply footed the bill for eastern germany , " he said .
helping depressed former east germany has long been a priority for the german government .
the eastern states are still struggling with massive unemployment and under-investment , and has one trillion dollars has already been transferred from west to east since reunification .
separately , the munich-based economic research institute ifo predicted that the financial slowdown would widen the economic gap between eastern and western germany .
" in the short-and long-term , the eastern german states will show worse economic growth rates than the western ones , " ifo economic expert joachim ragnitz told news agency ap .
ragnitz pointed to eastern germany 's rapidly ageing population and the flight of younger people to western states as one of the prime reasons for the development , saying that only larger eastern cities such as dresden , potsdam or leipzig would buck the trend . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

31 .
refugee arrivals from eastern europe have dwindled to a trickle in recent years , negating the usefulness of such a facility .
the marienfelde camp was set up in 1953 and operated first by us , british and french allied officials and later by west berlin authorities .
initially , the center consisted of 15 structures with space for 1,200 individuals , but as the number of refugees swelled , 11 more buildings were added to the facility in 1955 , increasing its capacity to 2,800 .
the refugees were housed in small , self-contained apartments , complete with kitchens and bathrooms .
a camp official says marienfelde was " a place of transition , " where the average length of stay was one to two weeks - this being the time it took refugees to pass through the 12 stages of vetting .
most refugees were germans fed up with life in communist east germany and eager to start over again in the west .
despite welcoming such disaffected hoards , west german officials remained cautious of just who they were letting in to the west .
in the early years of post-world war two europe , at the height of the cold war , dozens of agents from the communist bloc attempted to infiltrate west germany .

the lutheran and catholic churches provided counseling services and christened , confirmed and married refugees if asked .
of the four million people who fled westward from east germany between 1949 and 1990 , 1.35 million passed through the marienfelde camp .
in the late 1980s , when the communist world started to unravel , large numbers of refugees again began turning up at the camp .
in the spring of 1989 , the marienfelde camp was deluged with new arrivals , among them people of german origin from russia , kazakhstan , kyrgyzstan and ukraine .
in april 1989 , 6,000 arrived .
in may it was double that number .
by november , the camp was jammed with 100,000 refugees .
new beginnings among them in the spring of that year was katrin lange .
after waiting four years for permission to leave east berlin , she suddenly received word she could depart for the west .
at a mass-transit station in east berlin , she bid farewell to her father and brother before making the crossing .
soon after arriving at the marienfelde camp she learned she would be allowed to remain in the west .
a student who had passed examinations qualifying her for university , lange had been denied university admission by east german authorities she says she was not distraught at having to leave her home in the east .
" i had no painful feelings about leaving , but wondered if i would ever see my relatives again , " she says .
but lange need n't have worried .
less than five months later the berlin wall fell and she was joyously reunited with her mother at a crossing point in southern berlin .
lange was later allowed to attend berlin 's free university and then secured a grant to study in montreal , canada .
she is now a reporter working for berlin newspaper der morgenpost .

they will stay until alternative accommodation is found for them , said a camp official .
" in any case , we wo n't have to worry about the camp being demolished because it has been placed under protection as an historic building , " says bettina effner , who is involved in arranging exhibitions on the remains of the camp .

" the euphoria that dominated after the fall of the berlin wall has largely disappeared , " forsa chief manfred guellner told news agency afp .
only 46 percent of germans in the former communist east said their personal situation had improved .
that number was as high as 71 percent in 1989 .
according to the survey , every fourth person in eastern germany believes that life is worse now in the eastern states than it was under communism until 1989 .
only 39 percent believe they have profited from reunification .
the picture was n't much different in western germany where 40 percent said their lives had improved since the end of communism ; in 1989 that number was 52 percent .
attitudes hardening , expert says guellner said attitudes and prejudices had hardened on both sides .
whereas the eastern germans think they have been exploited and got a raw deal , " western germans have the feeling that they have simply footed the bill for eastern germany , " he said .
helping depressed former east germany has long been a priority for the german government .
the eastern states are still struggling with massive unemployment and under-investment , and has one trillion dollars has already been transferred from west to east since reunification .

" the diplomatic path is not promising , " middle east expert james phillips of the conservative us heritage foundation wrote , according to the dpa news agency . a carrot-and-stick policy towards iran holds little hope , he added , because " for iran , a nuclear weapon is the biggest carrot . "
phillips warned obama against meeting with iranian leaders , and said he believed tehran would use the event for propaganda and delay tactics .
he said iran was not interested in dialogue and reconciliation with what it calls " the great satan . "
iran 's real achilles ' heel , he said , was its economy , adding that if hurt by harsher sanctions , the rule of iran 's fundamentalists could be seriously challenged .
german-iranian trade but a new round of sanctions risks magnifying the diverging interests between the us and its allies such as germany , which still has firm financial connections with iranian banks and which continues to do business with the islamic republic of around 70 million inhabitants .
in fact , some 75 percent of all medium and small businesses in iran use german-made equipment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has so far come to the table in passing sanctions against iran such trade elements are not specifically forbidden under un security council sanctions , which only limit the sale of technology that could be used in the weapons industry .
in november , the german-iranian chamber of commerce met in hamburg to discuss the un sanctions and how they could affect german firms doing business in the islamic country .
some of the advice included ways of obtaining german government guarantees for trade with tehran , according to iran 's fars news agency and other media reports .
the reaction to this in the us has been one of growing anger , particularly in the conservative press .
" germany loves iran , " the wall street journal said in a commentary by editorial writer dan schwammenthal .
he pointed out that german-iranian trade had increased 14.1 percent in the first seven months of 2008 .
germany , he said , was less worried about an iranian nuclear bomb than it was about tighting sanctions that could negatively affect trade between the two countries .
german chancellor angela merkel has repeatedly emphasized germany 's special responsibility to protect israel .
she insists that germany is only obliged to obey the un sanctions and will not undertake any further unilateral action against iran at this time .
thus , iranian banks such as the government-owned melli and saderat banks - which have been accused by washington of funding terrorists and weapons research - do flourishing business in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysts are split over whether diplomacy or military action are the best way forward this , despite germany having joined the five veto-wielding un security council members in trying to convince iran to drop its nuclear enrichment program .
uncertainty over enrichment solution with such vested interests , it is a matter of debate among conservative thinkers as to whether a peaceful solution can be found to the iranian question .
phillips , the middle east expert , noted the years-long efforts by europeans as part of talks involving germany , britain and france have showed that negotiations bring nothing .
he added that the situation was not helped by the fact that , for example , the german government still undertook credit guarantees for iranian business .
richard haass , president of the council on foreign relations , said however that direct and unconditional negotiations with the government of iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad were the only way forward , even though " diplomacy is not guaranteed to work . " military action against iran , he said , may gain time but would not solve the nuclear enrichment question and would likely trigger retaliatory attacks by iran against us facilities in iraq and afghanistan .
he said such measures would also undoubtedly push up oil prices .
as for the role of the europeans in a new sanctions effort , many us analysts believe that they are more worried about keeping the us from invading iran than they are about iran 's development of nuclear weapons . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the diplomatic path is not promising , " middle east expert james phillips of the conservative us heritage foundation wrote , according to the dpa news agency . a carrot-and-stick policy towards iran holds little hope , he added , because " for iran , a nuclear weapon is the biggest carrot . "
phillips warned obama against meeting with iranian leaders , and said he believed tehran would use the event for propaganda and delay tactics .
he said iran was not interested in dialogue and reconciliation with what it calls " the great satan . "
iran 's real achilles ' heel , he said , was its economy , adding that if hurt by harsher sanctions , the rule of iran 's fundamentalists could be seriously challenged .
german-iranian trade but a new round of sanctions risks magnifying the diverging interests between the us and its allies such as germany , which still has firm financial connections with iranian banks and which continues to do business with the islamic republic of around 70 million inhabitants .
in fact , some 75 percent of all medium and small businesses in iran use german-made equipment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has so far come to the table in passing sanctions against iran such trade elements are not specifically forbidden under un security council sanctions , which only limit the sale of technology that could be used in the weapons industry .
in november , the german-iranian chamber of commerce met in hamburg to discuss the un sanctions and how they could affect german firms doing business in the islamic country .
some of the advice included ways of obtaining german government guarantees for trade with tehran , according to iran 's fars news agency and other media reports .
the reaction to this in the us has been one of growing anger , particularly in the conservative press .
" germany loves iran , " the wall street journal said in a commentary by editorial writer dan schwammenthal .
he pointed out that german-iranian trade had increased 14.1 percent in the first seven months of 2008 .
germany , he said , was less worried about an iranian nuclear bomb than it was about tighting sanctions that could negatively affect trade between the two countries .
german chancellor angela merkel has repeatedly emphasized germany 's special responsibility to protect israel .
she insists that germany is only obliged to obey the un sanctions and will not undertake any further unilateral action against iran at this time .
thus , iranian banks such as the government-owned melli and saderat banks - which have been accused by washington of funding terrorists and weapons research - do flourishing business in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysts are split over whether diplomacy or military action are the best way forward this , despite germany having joined the five veto-wielding un security council members in trying to convince iran to drop its nuclear enrichment program .
uncertainty over enrichment solution with such vested interests , it is a matter of debate among conservative thinkers as to whether a peaceful solution can be found to the iranian question .
phillips , the middle east expert , noted the years-long efforts by europeans as part of talks involving germany , britain and france have showed that negotiations bring nothing .
he added that the situation was not helped by the fact that , for example , the german government still undertook credit guarantees for iranian business .
richard haass , president of the council on foreign relations , said however that direct and unconditional negotiations with the government of iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad were the only way forward , even though " diplomacy is not guaranteed to work . " military action against iran , he said , may gain time but would not solve the nuclear enrichment question and would likely trigger retaliatory attacks by iran against us facilities in iraq and afghanistan .
he said such measures would also undoubtedly push up oil prices .
as for the role of the europeans in a new sanctions effort , many us analysts believe that they are more worried about keeping the us from invading iran than they are about iran 's development of nuclear weapons . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the euphoria that dominated after the fall of the berlin wall has largely disappeared , " forsa chief manfred guellner told news agency afp .
only 46 percent of germans in the former communist east said their personal situation had improved .
that number was as high as 71 percent in 1989 .
according to the survey , every fourth person in eastern germany believes that life is worse now in the eastern states than it was under communism until 1989 .
only 39 percent believe they have profited from reunification .
the picture was n't much different in western germany where 40 percent said their lives had improved since the end of communism ; in 1989 that number was 52 percent .
attitudes hardening , expert says guellner said attitudes and prejudices had hardened on both sides .
whereas the eastern germans think they have been exploited and got a raw deal , " western germans have the feeling that they have simply footed the bill for eastern germany , " he said .
helping depressed former east germany has long been a priority for the german government .
the eastern states are still struggling with massive unemployment and under-investment , and has one trillion dollars has already been transferred from west to east since reunification .
separately , the munich-based economic research institute ifo predicted that the financial slowdown would widen the economic gap between eastern and western germany .
" in the short-and long-term , the eastern german states will show worse economic growth rates than the western ones , " ifo economic expert joachim ragnitz told news agency ap .
ragnitz pointed to eastern germany 's rapidly ageing population and the flight of younger people to western states as one of the prime reasons for the development , saying that only larger eastern cities such as dresden , potsdam or leipzig would buck the trend . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the diplomatic path is not promising , " middle east expert james phillips of the conservative us heritage foundation wrote , according to the dpa news agency . a carrot-and-stick policy towards iran holds little hope , he added , because " for iran , a nuclear weapon is the biggest carrot . "
phillips warned obama against meeting with iranian leaders , and said he believed tehran would use the event for propaganda and delay tactics .
he said iran was not interested in dialogue and reconciliation with what it calls " the great satan . "
iran 's real achilles ' heel , he said , was its economy , adding that if hurt by harsher sanctions , the rule of iran 's fundamentalists could be seriously challenged .

the reaction to this in the us has been one of growing anger , particularly in the conservative press .
" germany loves iran , " the wall street journal said in a commentary by editorial writer dan schwammenthal .
he pointed out that german-iranian trade had increased 14.1 percent in the first seven months of 2008 .
germany , he said , was less worried about an iranian nuclear bomb than it was about tighting sanctions that could negatively affect trade between the two countries .
german chancellor angela merkel has repeatedly emphasized germany 's special responsibility to protect israel .
she insists that germany is only obliged to obey the un sanctions and will not undertake any further unilateral action against iran at this time .

phillips , the middle east expert , noted the years-long efforts by europeans as part of talks involving germany , britain and france have showed that negotiations bring nothing .
he added that the situation was not helped by the fact that , for example , the german government still undertook credit guarantees for iranian business .
richard haass , president of the council on foreign relations , said however that direct and unconditional negotiations with the government of iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad were the only way forward , even though " diplomacy is not guaranteed to work . " military action against iran , he said , may gain time but would not solve the nuclear enrichment question and would likely trigger retaliatory attacks by iran against us facilities in iraq and afghanistan .

" the diplomatic path is not promising , " middle east expert james phillips of the conservative us heritage foundation wrote , according to the dpa news agency . a carrot-and-stick policy towards iran holds little hope , he added , because " for iran , a nuclear weapon is the biggest carrot . "
phillips warned obama against meeting with iranian leaders , and said he believed tehran would use the event for propaganda and delay tactics .
he said iran was not interested in dialogue and reconciliation with what it calls " the great satan . "
iran 's real achilles ' heel , he said , was its economy , adding that if hurt by harsher sanctions , the rule of iran 's fundamentalists could be seriously challenged .
german-iranian trade but a new round of sanctions risks magnifying the diverging interests between the us and its allies such as germany , which still has firm financial connections with iranian banks and which continues to do business with the islamic republic of around 70 million inhabitants .
in fact , some 75 percent of all medium and small businesses in iran use german-made equipment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has so far come to the table in passing sanctions against iran such trade elements are not specifically forbidden under un security council sanctions , which only limit the sale of technology that could be used in the weapons industry .
in november , the german-iranian chamber of commerce met in hamburg to discuss the un sanctions and how they could affect german firms doing business in the islamic country .
some of the advice included ways of obtaining german government guarantees for trade with tehran , according to iran 's fars news agency and other media reports .
the reaction to this in the us has been one of growing anger , particularly in the conservative press .
" germany loves iran , " the wall street journal said in a commentary by editorial writer dan schwammenthal .
he pointed out that german-iranian trade had increased 14.1 percent in the first seven months of 2008 .
germany , he said , was less worried about an iranian nuclear bomb than it was about tighting sanctions that could negatively affect trade between the two countries .
german chancellor angela merkel has repeatedly emphasized germany 's special responsibility to protect israel .
she insists that germany is only obliged to obey the un sanctions and will not undertake any further unilateral action against iran at this time .
thus , iranian banks such as the government-owned melli and saderat banks - which have been accused by washington of funding terrorists and weapons research - do flourishing business in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysts are split over whether diplomacy or military action are the best way forward this , despite germany having joined the five veto-wielding un security council members in trying to convince iran to drop its nuclear enrichment program .
uncertainty over enrichment solution with such vested interests , it is a matter of debate among conservative thinkers as to whether a peaceful solution can be found to the iranian question .
phillips , the middle east expert , noted the years-long efforts by europeans as part of talks involving germany , britain and france have showed that negotiations bring nothing .
he added that the situation was not helped by the fact that , for example , the german government still undertook credit guarantees for iranian business .
richard haass , president of the council on foreign relations , said however that direct and unconditional negotiations with the government of iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad were the only way forward , even though " diplomacy is not guaranteed to work .

31 .
refugee arrivals from eastern europe have dwindled to a trickle in recent years , negating the usefulness of such a facility .
the marienfelde camp was set up in 1953 and operated first by us , british and french allied officials and later by west berlin authorities .
initially , the center consisted of 15 structures with space for 1,200 individuals , but as the number of refugees swelled , 11 more buildings were added to the facility in 1955 , increasing its capacity to 2,800 .
the refugees were housed in small , self-contained apartments , complete with kitchens and bathrooms .
a camp official says marienfelde was " a place of transition , " where the average length of stay was one to two weeks - this being the time it took refugees to pass through the 12 stages of vetting .
most refugees were germans fed up with life in communist east germany and eager to start over again in the west .
despite welcoming such disaffected hoards , west german officials remained cautious of just who they were letting in to the west .
in the early years of post-world war two europe , at the height of the cold war , dozens of agents from the communist bloc attempted to infiltrate west germany .
marienfelde inundated bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the situation in east germany worsened , the camp became more important berlin bore the costs of the refugees ' housing and meals , while charities offered advice and were generous with donations .
the lutheran and catholic churches provided counseling services and christened , confirmed and married refugees if asked .
of the four million people who fled westward from east germany between 1949 and 1990 , 1.35 million passed through the marienfelde camp .
in the late 1980s , when the communist world started to unravel , large numbers of refugees again began turning up at the camp .
in the spring of 1989 , the marienfelde camp was deluged with new arrivals , among them people of german origin from russia , kazakhstan , kyrgyzstan and ukraine .
in april 1989 , 6,000 arrived .
in may it was double that number .
by november , the camp was jammed with 100,000 refugees .
new beginnings among them in the spring of that year was katrin lange .
after waiting four years for permission to leave east berlin , she suddenly received word she could depart for the west .
at a mass-transit station in east berlin , she bid farewell to her father and brother before making the crossing .
soon after arriving at the marienfelde camp she learned she would be allowed to remain in the west .
a student who had passed examinations qualifying her for university , lange had been denied university admission by east german authorities she says she was not distraught at having to leave her home in the east .
" i had no painful feelings about leaving , but wondered if i would ever see my relatives again , " she says .
but lange need n't have worried .
less than five months later the berlin wall fell and she was joyously reunited with her mother at a crossing point in southern berlin .
lange was later allowed to attend berlin 's free university and then secured a grant to study in montreal , canada .
she is now a reporter working for berlin newspaper der morgenpost .
memory continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sites of significance during the partition of berlin hold memories for millions while the marienfelde center officially closed on wednesday , a handful of refugees still remain on the premises .
they will stay until alternative accommodation is found for them , said a camp official .
" in any case , we wo n't have to worry about the camp being demolished because it has been placed under protection as an historic building , " says bettina effner , who is involved in arranging exhibitions on the remains of the camp .
" we exist so people can continue to understand the atmosphere of a camp like this . " dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

31 .
refugee arrivals from eastern europe have dwindled to a trickle in recent years , negating the usefulness of such a facility .
the marienfelde camp was set up in 1953 and operated first by us , british and french allied officials and later by west berlin authorities .
initially , the center consisted of 15 structures with space for 1,200 individuals , but as the number of refugees swelled , 11 more buildings were added to the facility in 1955 , increasing its capacity to 2,800 .
the refugees were housed in small , self-contained apartments , complete with kitchens and bathrooms .
a camp official says marienfelde was " a place of transition , " where the average length of stay was one to two weeks - this being the time it took refugees to pass through the 12 stages of vetting .
most refugees were germans fed up with life in communist east germany and eager to start over again in the west .
despite welcoming such disaffected hoards , west german officials remained cautious of just who they were letting in to the west .
in the early years of post-world war two europe , at the height of the cold war , dozens of agents from the communist bloc attempted to infiltrate west germany .
marienfelde inundated bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the situation in east germany worsened , the camp became more important berlin bore the costs of the refugees ' housing and meals , while charities offered advice and were generous with donations .
the lutheran and catholic churches provided counseling services and christened , confirmed and married refugees if asked .
of the four million people who fled westward from east germany between 1949 and 1990 , 1.35 million passed through the marienfelde camp .
in the late 1980s , when the communist world started to unravel , large numbers of refugees again began turning up at the camp .
in the spring of 1989 , the marienfelde camp was deluged with new arrivals , among them people of german origin from russia , kazakhstan , kyrgyzstan and ukraine .
in april 1989 , 6,000 arrived .
in may it was double that number .
by november , the camp was jammed with 100,000 refugees .
new beginnings among them in the spring of that year was katrin lange .
after waiting four years for permission to leave east berlin , she suddenly received word she could depart for the west .
at a mass-transit station in east berlin , she bid farewell to her father and brother before making the crossing .
soon after arriving at the marienfelde camp she learned she would be allowed to remain in the west .
a student who had passed examinations qualifying her for university , lange had been denied university admission by east german authorities she says she was not distraught at having to leave her home in the east .
" i had no painful feelings about leaving , but wondered if i would ever see my relatives again , " she says .
but lange need n't have worried .
less than five months later the berlin wall fell and she was joyously reunited with her mother at a crossing point in southern berlin .
lange was later allowed to attend berlin 's free university and then secured a grant to study in montreal , canada .
she is now a reporter working for berlin newspaper der morgenpost .
memory continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sites of significance during the partition of berlin hold memories for millions while the marienfelde center officially closed on wednesday , a handful of refugees still remain on the premises .
they will stay until alternative accommodation is found for them , said a camp official .
" in any case , we wo n't have to worry about the camp being demolished because it has been placed under protection as an historic building , " says bettina effner , who is involved in arranging exhibitions on the remains of the camp .

" the euphoria that dominated after the fall of the berlin wall has largely disappeared , " forsa chief manfred guellner told news agency afp .
only 46 percent of germans in the former communist east said their personal situation had improved .
that number was as high as 71 percent in 1989 .
according to the survey , every fourth person in eastern germany believes that life is worse now in the eastern states than it was under communism until 1989 .
only 39 percent believe they have profited from reunification .
the picture was n't much different in western germany where 40 percent said their lives had improved since the end of communism ; in 1989 that number was 52 percent .
attitudes hardening , expert says guellner said attitudes and prejudices had hardened on both sides .
whereas the eastern germans think they have been exploited and got a raw deal , " western germans have the feeling that they have simply footed the bill for eastern germany , " he said .
helping depressed former east germany has long been a priority for the german government .
the eastern states are still struggling with massive unemployment and under-investment , and has one trillion dollars has already been transferred from west to east since reunification .
separately , the munich-based economic research institute ifo predicted that the financial slowdown would widen the economic gap between eastern and western germany .
" in the short-and long-term , the eastern german states will show worse economic growth rates than the western ones , " ifo economic expert joachim ragnitz told news agency ap .
ragnitz pointed to eastern germany 's rapidly ageing population and the flight of younger people to western states as one of the prime reasons for the development , saying that only larger eastern cities such as dresden , potsdam or leipzig would buck the trend . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the diplomatic path is not promising , " middle east expert james phillips of the conservative us heritage foundation wrote , according to the dpa news agency . a carrot-and-stick policy towards iran holds little hope , he added , because " for iran , a nuclear weapon is the biggest carrot . "
phillips warned obama against meeting with iranian leaders , and said he believed tehran would use the event for propaganda and delay tactics .
he said iran was not interested in dialogue and reconciliation with what it calls " the great satan . "
iran 's real achilles ' heel , he said , was its economy , adding that if hurt by harsher sanctions , the rule of iran 's fundamentalists could be seriously challenged .
german-iranian trade but a new round of sanctions risks magnifying the diverging interests between the us and its allies such as germany , which still has firm financial connections with iranian banks and which continues to do business with the islamic republic of around 70 million inhabitants .
in fact , some 75 percent of all medium and small businesses in iran use german-made equipment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has so far come to the table in passing sanctions against iran such trade elements are not specifically forbidden under un security council sanctions , which only limit the sale of technology that could be used in the weapons industry .
in november , the german-iranian chamber of commerce met in hamburg to discuss the un sanctions and how they could affect german firms doing business in the islamic country .
some of the advice included ways of obtaining german government guarantees for trade with tehran , according to iran 's fars news agency and other media reports .
the reaction to this in the us has been one of growing anger , particularly in the conservative press .
" germany loves iran , " the wall street journal said in a commentary by editorial writer dan schwammenthal .
he pointed out that german-iranian trade had increased 14.1 percent in the first seven months of 2008 .
germany , he said , was less worried about an iranian nuclear bomb than it was about tighting sanctions that could negatively affect trade between the two countries .
german chancellor angela merkel has repeatedly emphasized germany 's special responsibility to protect israel .
she insists that germany is only obliged to obey the un sanctions and will not undertake any further unilateral action against iran at this time .
thus , iranian banks such as the government-owned melli and saderat banks - which have been accused by washington of funding terrorists and weapons research - do flourishing business in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysts are split over whether diplomacy or military action are the best way forward this , despite germany having joined the five veto-wielding un security council members in trying to convince iran to drop its nuclear enrichment program .
uncertainty over enrichment solution with such vested interests , it is a matter of debate among conservative thinkers as to whether a peaceful solution can be found to the iranian question .
phillips , the middle east expert , noted the years-long efforts by europeans as part of talks involving germany , britain and france have showed that negotiations bring nothing .
he added that the situation was not helped by the fact that , for example , the german government still undertook credit guarantees for iranian business .
richard haass , president of the council on foreign relations , said however that direct and unconditional negotiations with the government of iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad were the only way forward , even though " diplomacy is not guaranteed to work . " military action against iran , he said , may gain time but would not solve the nuclear enrichment question and would likely trigger retaliatory attacks by iran against us facilities in iraq and afghanistan .
he said such measures would also undoubtedly push up oil prices .
as for the role of the europeans in a new sanctions effort , many us analysts believe that they are more worried about keeping the us from invading iran than they are about iran 's development of nuclear weapons . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

31 .
refugee arrivals from eastern europe have dwindled to a trickle in recent years , negating the usefulness of such a facility .
the marienfelde camp was set up in 1953 and operated first by us , british and french allied officials and later by west berlin authorities .
initially , the center consisted of 15 structures with space for 1,200 individuals , but as the number of refugees swelled , 11 more buildings were added to the facility in 1955 , increasing its capacity to 2,800 .
the refugees were housed in small , self-contained apartments , complete with kitchens and bathrooms .
a camp official says marienfelde was " a place of transition , " where the average length of stay was one to two weeks - this being the time it took refugees to pass through the 12 stages of vetting .
most refugees were germans fed up with life in communist east germany and eager to start over again in the west .
despite welcoming such disaffected hoards , west german officials remained cautious of just who they were letting in to the west .
in the early years of post-world war two europe , at the height of the cold war , dozens of agents from the communist bloc attempted to infiltrate west germany .

the lutheran and catholic churches provided counseling services and christened , confirmed and married refugees if asked .
of the four million people who fled westward from east germany between 1949 and 1990 , 1.35 million passed through the marienfelde camp .
in the late 1980s , when the communist world started to unravel , large numbers of refugees again began turning up at the camp .
in the spring of 1989 , the marienfelde camp was deluged with new arrivals , among them people of german origin from russia , kazakhstan , kyrgyzstan and ukraine .
in april 1989 , 6,000 arrived .
in may it was double that number .
by november , the camp was jammed with 100,000 refugees .
new beginnings among them in the spring of that year was katrin lange .
after waiting four years for permission to leave east berlin , she suddenly received word she could depart for the west .
at a mass-transit station in east berlin , she bid farewell to her father and brother before making the crossing .
soon after arriving at the marienfelde camp she learned she would be allowed to remain in the west .
a student who had passed examinations qualifying her for university , lange had been denied university admission by east german authorities she says she was not distraught at having to leave her home in the east .
" i had no painful feelings about leaving , but wondered if i would ever see my relatives again , " she says .
but lange need n't have worried .
less than five months later the berlin wall fell and she was joyously reunited with her mother at a crossing point in southern berlin .
lange was later allowed to attend berlin 's free university and then secured a grant to study in montreal , canada .
she is now a reporter working for berlin newspaper der morgenpost .

they will stay until alternative accommodation is found for them , said a camp official .

31 .
refugee arrivals from eastern europe have dwindled to a trickle in recent years , negating the usefulness of such a facility .
the marienfelde camp was set up in 1953 and operated first by us , british and french allied officials and later by west berlin authorities .
initially , the center consisted of 15 structures with space for 1,200 individuals , but as the number of refugees swelled , 11 more buildings were added to the facility in 1955 , increasing its capacity to 2,800 .
the refugees were housed in small , self-contained apartments , complete with kitchens and bathrooms .
a camp official says marienfelde was " a place of transition , " where the average length of stay was one to two weeks - this being the time it took refugees to pass through the 12 stages of vetting .
most refugees were germans fed up with life in communist east germany and eager to start over again in the west .
despite welcoming such disaffected hoards , west german officials remained cautious of just who they were letting in to the west .
in the early years of post-world war two europe , at the height of the cold war , dozens of agents from the communist bloc attempted to infiltrate west germany .
marienfelde inundated bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the situation in east germany worsened , the camp became more important berlin bore the costs of the refugees ' housing and meals , while charities offered advice and were generous with donations .
the lutheran and catholic churches provided counseling services and christened , confirmed and married refugees if asked .
of the four million people who fled westward from east germany between 1949 and 1990 , 1.35 million passed through the marienfelde camp .
in the late 1980s , when the communist world started to unravel , large numbers of refugees again began turning up at the camp .
in the spring of 1989 , the marienfelde camp was deluged with new arrivals , among them people of german origin from russia , kazakhstan , kyrgyzstan and ukraine .
in april 1989 , 6,000 arrived .
in may it was double that number .
by november , the camp was jammed with 100,000 refugees .
new beginnings among them in the spring of that year was katrin lange .
after waiting four years for permission to leave east berlin , she suddenly received word she could depart for the west .
at a mass-transit station in east berlin , she bid farewell to her father and brother before making the crossing .
soon after arriving at the marienfelde camp she learned she would be allowed to remain in the west .
a student who had passed examinations qualifying her for university , lange had been denied university admission by east german authorities she says she was not distraught at having to leave her home in the east .
" i had no painful feelings about leaving , but wondered if i would ever see my relatives again , " she says .
but lange need n't have worried .
less than five months later the berlin wall fell and she was joyously reunited with her mother at a crossing point in southern berlin .
lange was later allowed to attend berlin 's free university and then secured a grant to study in montreal , canada .
she is now a reporter working for berlin newspaper der morgenpost .
memory continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sites of significance during the partition of berlin hold memories for millions while the marienfelde center officially closed on wednesday , a handful of refugees still remain on the premises .
they will stay until alternative accommodation is found for them , said a camp official .
" in any case , we wo n't have to worry about the camp being demolished because it has been placed under protection as an historic building , " says bettina effner , who is involved in arranging exhibitions on the remains of the camp .

but financial mathematician ernst eberlein says math holds the key to preventing a repeat . with a whole host of new investment products , such as swaps , derivatives and futures , the math professor from the university of freiburg says it is harder than ever to identify and understand risks in the financial markets .

he 's already been a guest on the show a couple of times in this year of mathematics . dw-tv : first of all , we 've got the granddaddy of computers here .
this is an abacus .
can you tell us a little about the principle behind it ?
günther ziegler : well of course , i do n't have any practice in working with this , but this is singletons , 1,2,3,4 5 ; and these mean fives , and two fives make a ten , which would be in the next row .
so basically , it 's very close to how we compute and how we calculate in everyday life .
dw-tv : now let 's get back to julia ruscher here .
there are a few similarities between the two of you .
you both finished university very quickly , you won prizes , offered jobs at a very young age .
but you , i understand , are a big fan of literature .
is it really important for mathematicians to have other hobbies ?
günther ziegler : i think mathematics is close to life and it 's connected to many things , but of course , you do n't want to just study one subject like mathematics .
and you have to concentrate on it a lot , but you do n't want to do this one thing only in your life .
and so i think ... the mathematicians i know have many interests and many hobbies .
many of them are good in music , many of them read , some of them write .
it 's all part of mathematics , and it connects to mathematics .
dw-tv : yes , music also of course having a lot to do with mathematics .
what i was wondering though is whether or not there are a lot of women , .. math is traditionally considered a boy 's science .
are there a lot of women in your department , or is julia an exception ?
günther ziegler : i think we have two women on the faculty , in the department , but we have fifty percent women in the students and in the beginners , and i think the stereotype is breaking and is changing , and we are working on that .
and math is a women 's science as much as a men 's science , and we need them all .
i mean , maths is an important subject and if we somehow exclude half of the people from doing it , then we lose a lot .
dw-tv : right .
now it is , though , pretty hard to make math riveting for students in the way that maybe some other subjects can be .
a lot of people find math classes boring , or just difficult to understand .
how can we really make math attractive to young people ?
günther ziegler : i mean , math is difficult and that 's just one of the truths that we just have to confront .
on the other hand , maths is many different things .
and so if we explain maths , when we present maths , we have to show that .
and math is not only calculating with larger and larger numbers. but maths is the science of structures , it 's the science of patterns , there 's geometry , it connects to art , all of this is math .
and when we teach math , we have to teach these connections and we have to show these connections , we have to connect to history , we have to connect to everything that is math .
dw-tv : all right günther ziegler , that was our third red in a row , what are the chances that the next one 's going to be black ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther ziegler : well , just a bit less than a half , but exactly the same probability as that it 's red .
dw-tv : so it does n't matter how many times you 've had red before , the chances are the same ?
günther ziegler : exactly , if the roulette table is correct , then that does n't influence the chances .
dw-tv : now gambling always involves chance , but do mathematicians have a certain advantage when it comes to calculating the probabilities , or do they just trust their instincts when they 're at the table ?
günther ziegler : i mean , calculating the probabilities , mathematicians should have an advantage , but they do n't change the probabilities .
so at roulette , everybody has the same chances , and in the end , it 's only the casino that wins .
dw-tv : do you have a lucky number ?
günther ziegler : 42 .
dw-tv : why ?
günther ziegler : well , it 's the answer to the question about life , the universe and everything .
dw-tv : douglas adams !
günther ziegler : that 's what the hitch hikers guide says , yes .
dw-tv : well , here 's a philosophical question for you : is math independent of observation or are we somehow just making up as we go along to explain the universe ?
günther ziegler : no , i do n't think we make it up .
eugene wigner , nobel prize winner in physics , talked in the 60s about the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences .
so math , mathematical equations like einstein 's gravitation theory , can really describe the universe , can describe nature .
and so that shows that math is ingrained in the universe and in how nature works .
we do n't make it up .
dw-tv : what is the next eldorado of math ?
where 's the discipline headed ?
günther ziegler : i do n't know .
i think there 's still the huge old miracles or mysteries like the prime number distribution , that we will still have to solve , but also there 's things coming up like mathematical biology .
i think mathematics is getting more and more effective in biology , and that 's something that 's really coming up as a development .
dw-tv : do you think math will in the future become even more important to our daily lives than it is today ?
günther ziegler : i think so .
it 's already very important now , even if we do n't realise that .
it 's in all the hi tech that 's around us and so on , and that will continue to grow . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and math is not only calculating with larger and larger numbers. but maths is the science of structures , it 's the science of patterns , there 's geometry , it connects to art , all of this is math .
and when we teach math , we have to teach these connections and we have to show these connections , we have to connect to history , we have to connect to everything that is math .
dw-tv : all right günther ziegler , that was our third red in a row , what are the chances that the next one 's going to be black ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther ziegler : well , just a bit less than a half , but exactly the same probability as that it 's red .
dw-tv : so it does n't matter how many times you 've had red before , the chances are the same ?
günther ziegler : exactly , if the roulette table is correct , then that does n't influence the chances .
dw-tv : now gambling always involves chance , but do mathematicians have a certain advantage when it comes to calculating the probabilities , or do they just trust their instincts when they 're at the table ?
günther ziegler : i mean , calculating the probabilities , mathematicians should have an advantage , but they do n't change the probabilities .
so at roulette , everybody has the same chances , and in the end , it 's only the casino that wins .
dw-tv : do you have a lucky number ?
günther ziegler : 42 .
dw-tv : why ?
günther ziegler : well , it 's the answer to the question about life , the universe and everything .
dw-tv : douglas adams !
günther ziegler : that 's what the hitch hikers guide says , yes .
dw-tv : well , here 's a philosophical question for you : is math independent of observation or are we somehow just making up as we go along to explain the universe ?
günther ziegler : no , i do n't think we make it up .
eugene wigner , nobel prize winner in physics , talked in the 60s about the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences .
so math , mathematical equations like einstein 's gravitation theory , can really describe the universe , can describe nature .
and so that shows that math is ingrained in the universe and in how nature works .
we do n't make it up .
dw-tv : what is the next eldorado of math ?
where 's the discipline headed ?
günther ziegler : i do n't know .
i think there 's still the huge old miracles or mysteries like the prime number distribution , that we will still have to solve , but also there 's things coming up like mathematical biology .
i think mathematics is getting more and more effective in biology , and that 's something that 's really coming up as a development .
dw-tv : do you think math will in the future become even more important to our daily lives than it is today ?
günther ziegler : i think so .
it 's already very important now , even if we do n't realise that .
it 's in all the hi tech that 's around us and so on , and that will continue to grow . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

can you work it out in your head ?
and can you do it in under 12 seconds ?
if so , you could compete at the world mental arithmetic championships . gerd mittring says he knows what it takes to become a math whiz .
the it specialist and psychologist from bonn organized the competition and is a former world mental arithmetic champion himself .
he says math ability is linked to emotion .
if you want to be good at math , you have to enjoy it .
kinjal shah from india is one of the youngest world champions in mental arithmetic .
in second place - max weber from germany .
the school pupil max weber counts : " 145 times 145 ?
easy , i know that 144 times 144 is 20,736 .
so i just have to double the square root of 20,736 , then add one .
then i add the result to 144 squared , and that gives me 145 times 145 and that ’ s 21,025 . "
quickfire mental arithmetic .
is it a talent or a trick ?
do you need a brilliant mind or simply a good teacher ?
for this math genius , the answer is clear : you need a bit of both .
but , he says , it ’ s much more than just a numbers game .
mental arithmetic world champion gerd mittring thinks : " what goes on in my mind is more than plain calculations .
there are also emotions that are sometimes pleasant and sometimes unpleasant .
for instance , if i don ’ t feel comfortable when i ’ m performing , then my arithmetic performance suffers – unlike when i am at ease .
human beings are much more complex than pocket calculators . " + + + andreas is another mathematician who solves mind-boggling math problems on stage .
here , he ’ s multiplying two five-digit numbers .
at the max planck institute for human cognitive and brain sciences , roland friedrich is trying to establish whether excelling in arithmetic is linked to a person ’ s genes or brain .
using a special brain scanner , he takes a glimpse behind the scenes at test subjects to see what happens during mental arithmetic calculations .
the test subjects are given math problems to solve , while he observes brain activity .
friedrich found to his surprise that brain activity is similar in math whizzes and less gifted people .
maths geniuses are simply able to solve problems quicker and in a more automated way .
but the brain function is essentially the same .
another finding - the brain doesn ’ t have a single area responsible for calculation .
instead , a number of regions are used during mental arithmetic ... regions that are also used to perform other tasks .
roland friedrich from the max planck institute for cognitive and brain sciences is sure that there is no single gene that determines math ability : " there are probably combinations of genes that influence certain things , such as the plasticity of the brain ... in other words , how the brain responds to mental training .
those good at math are certainly more developed at that point , and that ’ s genetically determined .
but it ’ d have to affect a number of regions . "

then i add the result to 144 squared , and that gives me 145 times 145 and that ’ s 21,025 . "
quickfire mental arithmetic .
is it a talent or a trick ?
do you need a brilliant mind or simply a good teacher ?
for this math genius , the answer is clear : you need a bit of both .
but , he says , it ’ s much more than just a numbers game .
mental arithmetic world champion gerd mittring thinks : " what goes on in my mind is more than plain calculations .
there are also emotions that are sometimes pleasant and sometimes unpleasant .
for instance , if i don ’ t feel comfortable when i ’ m performing , then my arithmetic performance suffers – unlike when i am at ease .
human beings are much more complex than pocket calculators . " + + + andreas is another mathematician who solves mind-boggling math problems on stage .
here , he ’ s multiplying two five-digit numbers .
at the max planck institute for human cognitive and brain sciences , roland friedrich is trying to establish whether excelling in arithmetic is linked to a person ’ s genes or brain .
using a special brain scanner , he takes a glimpse behind the scenes at test subjects to see what happens during mental arithmetic calculations .
the test subjects are given math problems to solve , while he observes brain activity .
friedrich found to his surprise that brain activity is similar in math whizzes and less gifted people .
maths geniuses are simply able to solve problems quicker and in a more automated way .
but the brain function is essentially the same .
another finding - the brain doesn ’ t have a single area responsible for calculation .
instead , a number of regions are used during mental arithmetic ... regions that are also used to perform other tasks .
roland friedrich from the max planck institute for cognitive and brain sciences is sure that there is no single gene that determines math ability : " there are probably combinations of genes that influence certain things , such as the plasticity of the brain ... in other words , how the brain responds to mental training .
those good at math are certainly more developed at that point , and that ’ s genetically determined .
but it ’ d have to affect a number of regions . "
so you don ’ t need special genes or a super brain to become a human calculator .
the most important thing you can have is a passion for math as a child . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the euphoria that dominated after the fall of the berlin wall has largely disappeared , " forsa chief manfred guellner told news agency afp .
only 46 percent of germans in the former communist east said their personal situation had improved .
that number was as high as 71 percent in 1989 .
according to the survey , every fourth person in eastern germany believes that life is worse now in the eastern states than it was under communism until 1989 .
only 39 percent believe they have profited from reunification .
the picture was n't much different in western germany where 40 percent said their lives had improved since the end of communism ; in 1989 that number was 52 percent .
attitudes hardening , expert says guellner said attitudes and prejudices had hardened on both sides .
whereas the eastern germans think they have been exploited and got a raw deal , " western germans have the feeling that they have simply footed the bill for eastern germany , " he said .
helping depressed former east germany has long been a priority for the german government .
the eastern states are still struggling with massive unemployment and under-investment , and has one trillion dollars has already been transferred from west to east since reunification .
separately , the munich-based economic research institute ifo predicted that the financial slowdown would widen the economic gap between eastern and western germany .
" in the short-and long-term , the eastern german states will show worse economic growth rates than the western ones , " ifo economic expert joachim ragnitz told news agency ap .
ragnitz pointed to eastern germany 's rapidly ageing population and the flight of younger people to western states as one of the prime reasons for the development , saying that only larger eastern cities such as dresden , potsdam or leipzig would buck the trend . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the diplomatic path is not promising , " middle east expert james phillips of the conservative us heritage foundation wrote , according to the dpa news agency . a carrot-and-stick policy towards iran holds little hope , he added , because " for iran , a nuclear weapon is the biggest carrot . "
phillips warned obama against meeting with iranian leaders , and said he believed tehran would use the event for propaganda and delay tactics .
he said iran was not interested in dialogue and reconciliation with what it calls " the great satan . "
iran 's real achilles ' heel , he said , was its economy , adding that if hurt by harsher sanctions , the rule of iran 's fundamentalists could be seriously challenged .
german-iranian trade but a new round of sanctions risks magnifying the diverging interests between the us and its allies such as germany , which still has firm financial connections with iranian banks and which continues to do business with the islamic republic of around 70 million inhabitants .
in fact , some 75 percent of all medium and small businesses in iran use german-made equipment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has so far come to the table in passing sanctions against iran such trade elements are not specifically forbidden under un security council sanctions , which only limit the sale of technology that could be used in the weapons industry .
in november , the german-iranian chamber of commerce met in hamburg to discuss the un sanctions and how they could affect german firms doing business in the islamic country .
some of the advice included ways of obtaining german government guarantees for trade with tehran , according to iran 's fars news agency and other media reports .
the reaction to this in the us has been one of growing anger , particularly in the conservative press .
" germany loves iran , " the wall street journal said in a commentary by editorial writer dan schwammenthal .
he pointed out that german-iranian trade had increased 14.1 percent in the first seven months of 2008 .
germany , he said , was less worried about an iranian nuclear bomb than it was about tighting sanctions that could negatively affect trade between the two countries .
german chancellor angela merkel has repeatedly emphasized germany 's special responsibility to protect israel .
she insists that germany is only obliged to obey the un sanctions and will not undertake any further unilateral action against iran at this time .
thus , iranian banks such as the government-owned melli and saderat banks - which have been accused by washington of funding terrorists and weapons research - do flourishing business in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysts are split over whether diplomacy or military action are the best way forward this , despite germany having joined the five veto-wielding un security council members in trying to convince iran to drop its nuclear enrichment program .
uncertainty over enrichment solution with such vested interests , it is a matter of debate among conservative thinkers as to whether a peaceful solution can be found to the iranian question .
phillips , the middle east expert , noted the years-long efforts by europeans as part of talks involving germany , britain and france have showed that negotiations bring nothing .
he added that the situation was not helped by the fact that , for example , the german government still undertook credit guarantees for iranian business .
richard haass , president of the council on foreign relations , said however that direct and unconditional negotiations with the government of iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad were the only way forward , even though " diplomacy is not guaranteed to work . " military action against iran , he said , may gain time but would not solve the nuclear enrichment question and would likely trigger retaliatory attacks by iran against us facilities in iraq and afghanistan .
he said such measures would also undoubtedly push up oil prices .
as for the role of the europeans in a new sanctions effort , many us analysts believe that they are more worried about keeping the us from invading iran than they are about iran 's development of nuclear weapons . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the diplomatic path is not promising , " middle east expert james phillips of the conservative us heritage foundation wrote , according to the dpa news agency . a carrot-and-stick policy towards iran holds little hope , he added , because " for iran , a nuclear weapon is the biggest carrot . "
phillips warned obama against meeting with iranian leaders , and said he believed tehran would use the event for propaganda and delay tactics .
he said iran was not interested in dialogue and reconciliation with what it calls " the great satan . "
iran 's real achilles ' heel , he said , was its economy , adding that if hurt by harsher sanctions , the rule of iran 's fundamentalists could be seriously challenged .
german-iranian trade but a new round of sanctions risks magnifying the diverging interests between the us and its allies such as germany , which still has firm financial connections with iranian banks and which continues to do business with the islamic republic of around 70 million inhabitants .
in fact , some 75 percent of all medium and small businesses in iran use german-made equipment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has so far come to the table in passing sanctions against iran such trade elements are not specifically forbidden under un security council sanctions , which only limit the sale of technology that could be used in the weapons industry .
in november , the german-iranian chamber of commerce met in hamburg to discuss the un sanctions and how they could affect german firms doing business in the islamic country .
some of the advice included ways of obtaining german government guarantees for trade with tehran , according to iran 's fars news agency and other media reports .
the reaction to this in the us has been one of growing anger , particularly in the conservative press .
" germany loves iran , " the wall street journal said in a commentary by editorial writer dan schwammenthal .
he pointed out that german-iranian trade had increased 14.1 percent in the first seven months of 2008 .
germany , he said , was less worried about an iranian nuclear bomb than it was about tighting sanctions that could negatively affect trade between the two countries .
german chancellor angela merkel has repeatedly emphasized germany 's special responsibility to protect israel .
she insists that germany is only obliged to obey the un sanctions and will not undertake any further unilateral action against iran at this time .
thus , iranian banks such as the government-owned melli and saderat banks - which have been accused by washington of funding terrorists and weapons research - do flourishing business in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysts are split over whether diplomacy or military action are the best way forward this , despite germany having joined the five veto-wielding un security council members in trying to convince iran to drop its nuclear enrichment program .
uncertainty over enrichment solution with such vested interests , it is a matter of debate among conservative thinkers as to whether a peaceful solution can be found to the iranian question .
phillips , the middle east expert , noted the years-long efforts by europeans as part of talks involving germany , britain and france have showed that negotiations bring nothing .
he added that the situation was not helped by the fact that , for example , the german government still undertook credit guarantees for iranian business .
richard haass , president of the council on foreign relations , said however that direct and unconditional negotiations with the government of iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad were the only way forward , even though " diplomacy is not guaranteed to work . " military action against iran , he said , may gain time but would not solve the nuclear enrichment question and would likely trigger retaliatory attacks by iran against us facilities in iraq and afghanistan .
he said such measures would also undoubtedly push up oil prices .
as for the role of the europeans in a new sanctions effort , many us analysts believe that they are more worried about keeping the us from invading iran than they are about iran 's development of nuclear weapons . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the euphoria that dominated after the fall of the berlin wall has largely disappeared , " forsa chief manfred guellner told news agency afp .
only 46 percent of germans in the former communist east said their personal situation had improved .
that number was as high as 71 percent in 1989 .
according to the survey , every fourth person in eastern germany believes that life is worse now in the eastern states than it was under communism until 1989 .
only 39 percent believe they have profited from reunification .
the picture was n't much different in western germany where 40 percent said their lives had improved since the end of communism ; in 1989 that number was 52 percent .
attitudes hardening , expert says guellner said attitudes and prejudices had hardened on both sides .
whereas the eastern germans think they have been exploited and got a raw deal , " western germans have the feeling that they have simply footed the bill for eastern germany , " he said .
helping depressed former east germany has long been a priority for the german government .
the eastern states are still struggling with massive unemployment and under-investment , and has one trillion dollars has already been transferred from west to east since reunification .
separately , the munich-based economic research institute ifo predicted that the financial slowdown would widen the economic gap between eastern and western germany .
" in the short-and long-term , the eastern german states will show worse economic growth rates than the western ones , " ifo economic expert joachim ragnitz told news agency ap .
ragnitz pointed to eastern germany 's rapidly ageing population and the flight of younger people to western states as one of the prime reasons for the development , saying that only larger eastern cities such as dresden , potsdam or leipzig would buck the trend . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 02.01.2009 diverging interests as us , germany tackle iranian question großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad says nuclear enrichment is iran 's right a us think tank has warned that diplomacy would not stop iran 's nuclear program and that harsher sanctions against tehran should be adopted , a move that could drive a wedge between the white house and germany . us president-elect barack obama has vowed to " do everything that is required " to prevent iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon , including harsher sanctions and , if necessary , military action .
" the diplomatic path is not promising , " middle east expert james phillips of the conservative us heritage foundation wrote , according to the dpa news agency . a carrot-and-stick policy towards iran holds little hope , he added , because " for iran , a nuclear weapon is the biggest carrot . "
phillips warned obama against meeting with iranian leaders , and said he believed tehran would use the event for propaganda and delay tactics .
he said iran was not interested in dialogue and reconciliation with what it calls " the great satan . "
iran 's real achilles ' heel , he said , was its economy , adding that if hurt by harsher sanctions , the rule of iran 's fundamentalists could be seriously challenged .
german-iranian trade but a new round of sanctions risks magnifying the diverging interests between the us and its allies such as germany , which still has firm financial connections with iranian banks and which continues to do business with the islamic republic of around 70 million inhabitants .
in fact , some 75 percent of all medium and small businesses in iran use german-made equipment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has so far come to the table in passing sanctions against iran such trade elements are not specifically forbidden under un security council sanctions , which only limit the sale of technology that could be used in the weapons industry .
in november , the german-iranian chamber of commerce met in hamburg to discuss the un sanctions and how they could affect german firms doing business in the islamic country .
some of the advice included ways of obtaining german government guarantees for trade with tehran , according to iran 's fars news agency and other media reports .
the reaction to this in the us has been one of growing anger , particularly in the conservative press .
" germany loves iran , " the wall street journal said in a commentary by editorial writer dan schwammenthal .
he pointed out that german-iranian trade had increased 14.1 percent in the first seven months of 2008 .
germany , he said , was less worried about an iranian nuclear bomb than it was about tighting sanctions that could negatively affect trade between the two countries .
german chancellor angela merkel has repeatedly emphasized germany 's special responsibility to protect israel .
she insists that germany is only obliged to obey the un sanctions and will not undertake any further unilateral action against iran at this time .
thus , iranian banks such as the government-owned melli and saderat banks - which have been accused by washington of funding terrorists and weapons research - do flourishing business in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysts are split over whether diplomacy or military action are the best way forward this , despite germany having joined the five veto-wielding un security council members in trying to convince iran to drop its nuclear enrichment program .
uncertainty over enrichment solution with such vested interests , it is a matter of debate among conservative thinkers as to whether a peaceful solution can be found to the iranian question .
phillips , the middle east expert , noted the years-long efforts by europeans as part of talks involving germany , britain and france have showed that negotiations bring nothing .
he added that the situation was not helped by the fact that , for example , the german government still undertook credit guarantees for iranian business .
richard haass , president of the council on foreign relations , said however that direct and unconditional negotiations with the government of iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad were the only way forward , even though " diplomacy is not guaranteed to work . " military action against iran , he said , may gain time but would not solve the nuclear enrichment question and would likely trigger retaliatory attacks by iran against us facilities in iraq and afghanistan .
he said such measures would also undoubtedly push up oil prices .
as for the role of the europeans in a new sanctions effort , many us analysts believe that they are more worried about keeping the us from invading iran than they are about iran 's development of nuclear weapons . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the diplomatic path is not promising , " middle east expert james phillips of the conservative us heritage foundation wrote , according to the dpa news agency . a carrot-and-stick policy towards iran holds little hope , he added , because " for iran , a nuclear weapon is the biggest carrot . "
phillips warned obama against meeting with iranian leaders , and said he believed tehran would use the event for propaganda and delay tactics .
he said iran was not interested in dialogue and reconciliation with what it calls " the great satan . "
iran 's real achilles ' heel , he said , was its economy , adding that if hurt by harsher sanctions , the rule of iran 's fundamentalists could be seriously challenged .
german-iranian trade but a new round of sanctions risks magnifying the diverging interests between the us and its allies such as germany , which still has firm financial connections with iranian banks and which continues to do business with the islamic republic of around 70 million inhabitants .
in fact , some 75 percent of all medium and small businesses in iran use german-made equipment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has so far come to the table in passing sanctions against iran such trade elements are not specifically forbidden under un security council sanctions , which only limit the sale of technology that could be used in the weapons industry .
in november , the german-iranian chamber of commerce met in hamburg to discuss the un sanctions and how they could affect german firms doing business in the islamic country .
some of the advice included ways of obtaining german government guarantees for trade with tehran , according to iran 's fars news agency and other media reports .
the reaction to this in the us has been one of growing anger , particularly in the conservative press .
" germany loves iran , " the wall street journal said in a commentary by editorial writer dan schwammenthal .
he pointed out that german-iranian trade had increased 14.1 percent in the first seven months of 2008 .
germany , he said , was less worried about an iranian nuclear bomb than it was about tighting sanctions that could negatively affect trade between the two countries .
german chancellor angela merkel has repeatedly emphasized germany 's special responsibility to protect israel .
she insists that germany is only obliged to obey the un sanctions and will not undertake any further unilateral action against iran at this time .
thus , iranian banks such as the government-owned melli and saderat banks - which have been accused by washington of funding terrorists and weapons research - do flourishing business in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysts are split over whether diplomacy or military action are the best way forward this , despite germany having joined the five veto-wielding un security council members in trying to convince iran to drop its nuclear enrichment program .
uncertainty over enrichment solution with such vested interests , it is a matter of debate among conservative thinkers as to whether a peaceful solution can be found to the iranian question .
phillips , the middle east expert , noted the years-long efforts by europeans as part of talks involving germany , britain and france have showed that negotiations bring nothing .
he added that the situation was not helped by the fact that , for example , the german government still undertook credit guarantees for iranian business .
richard haass , president of the council on foreign relations , said however that direct and unconditional negotiations with the government of iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad were the only way forward , even though " diplomacy is not guaranteed to work . " military action against iran , he said , may gain time but would not solve the nuclear enrichment question and would likely trigger retaliatory attacks by iran against us facilities in iraq and afghanistan .
he said such measures would also undoubtedly push up oil prices .
as for the role of the europeans in a new sanctions effort , many us analysts believe that they are more worried about keeping the us from invading iran than they are about iran 's development of nuclear weapons . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the diplomatic path is not promising , " middle east expert james phillips of the conservative us heritage foundation wrote , according to the dpa news agency . a carrot-and-stick policy towards iran holds little hope , he added , because " for iran , a nuclear weapon is the biggest carrot . "
phillips warned obama against meeting with iranian leaders , and said he believed tehran would use the event for propaganda and delay tactics .
he said iran was not interested in dialogue and reconciliation with what it calls " the great satan . "
iran 's real achilles ' heel , he said , was its economy , adding that if hurt by harsher sanctions , the rule of iran 's fundamentalists could be seriously challenged .
german-iranian trade but a new round of sanctions risks magnifying the diverging interests between the us and its allies such as germany , which still has firm financial connections with iranian banks and which continues to do business with the islamic republic of around 70 million inhabitants .
in fact , some 75 percent of all medium and small businesses in iran use german-made equipment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has so far come to the table in passing sanctions against iran such trade elements are not specifically forbidden under un security council sanctions , which only limit the sale of technology that could be used in the weapons industry .
in november , the german-iranian chamber of commerce met in hamburg to discuss the un sanctions and how they could affect german firms doing business in the islamic country .
some of the advice included ways of obtaining german government guarantees for trade with tehran , according to iran 's fars news agency and other media reports .
the reaction to this in the us has been one of growing anger , particularly in the conservative press .
" germany loves iran , " the wall street journal said in a commentary by editorial writer dan schwammenthal .
he pointed out that german-iranian trade had increased 14.1 percent in the first seven months of 2008 .
germany , he said , was less worried about an iranian nuclear bomb than it was about tighting sanctions that could negatively affect trade between the two countries .
german chancellor angela merkel has repeatedly emphasized germany 's special responsibility to protect israel .
she insists that germany is only obliged to obey the un sanctions and will not undertake any further unilateral action against iran at this time .
thus , iranian banks such as the government-owned melli and saderat banks - which have been accused by washington of funding terrorists and weapons research - do flourishing business in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysts are split over whether diplomacy or military action are the best way forward this , despite germany having joined the five veto-wielding un security council members in trying to convince iran to drop its nuclear enrichment program .
uncertainty over enrichment solution with such vested interests , it is a matter of debate among conservative thinkers as to whether a peaceful solution can be found to the iranian question .
phillips , the middle east expert , noted the years-long efforts by europeans as part of talks involving germany , britain and france have showed that negotiations bring nothing .
he added that the situation was not helped by the fact that , for example , the german government still undertook credit guarantees for iranian business .
richard haass , president of the council on foreign relations , said however that direct and unconditional negotiations with the government of iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad were the only way forward , even though " diplomacy is not guaranteed to work . " military action against iran , he said , may gain time but would not solve the nuclear enrichment question and would likely trigger retaliatory attacks by iran against us facilities in iraq and afghanistan .
he said such measures would also undoubtedly push up oil prices .
as for the role of the europeans in a new sanctions effort , many us analysts believe that they are more worried about keeping the us from invading iran than they are about iran 's development of nuclear weapons . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

refugee arrivals from eastern europe have dwindled to a trickle in recent years , negating the usefulness of such a facility .
the marienfelde camp was set up in 1953 and operated first by us , british and french allied officials and later by west berlin authorities .
initially , the center consisted of 15 structures with space for 1,200 individuals , but as the number of refugees swelled , 11 more buildings were added to the facility in 1955 , increasing its capacity to 2,800 .
the refugees were housed in small , self-contained apartments , complete with kitchens and bathrooms .
a camp official says marienfelde was " a place of transition , " where the average length of stay was one to two weeks - this being the time it took refugees to pass through the 12 stages of vetting .
most refugees were germans fed up with life in communist east germany and eager to start over again in the west .
despite welcoming such disaffected hoards , west german officials remained cautious of just who they were letting in to the west .
in the early years of post-world war two europe , at the height of the cold war , dozens of agents from the communist bloc attempted to infiltrate west germany .

the lutheran and catholic churches provided counseling services and christened , confirmed and married refugees if asked .
of the four million people who fled westward from east germany between 1949 and 1990 , 1.35 million passed through the marienfelde camp .
in the late 1980s , when the communist world started to unravel , large numbers of refugees again began turning up at the camp .
in the spring of 1989 , the marienfelde camp was deluged with new arrivals , among them people of german origin from russia , kazakhstan , kyrgyzstan and ukraine .
in april 1989 , 6,000 arrived .
in may it was double that number .
by november , the camp was jammed with 100,000 refugees .
new beginnings among them in the spring of that year was katrin lange .
after waiting four years for permission to leave east berlin , she suddenly received word she could depart for the west .
at a mass-transit station in east berlin , she bid farewell to her father and brother before making the crossing .
soon after arriving at the marienfelde camp she learned she would be allowed to remain in the west .
a student who had passed examinations qualifying her for university , lange had been denied university admission by east german authorities she says she was not distraught at having to leave her home in the east .
" i had no painful feelings about leaving , but wondered if i would ever see my relatives again , " she says .
but lange need n't have worried .
less than five months later the berlin wall fell and she was joyously reunited with her mother at a crossing point in southern berlin .
lange was later allowed to attend berlin 's free university and then secured a grant to study in montreal , canada .
she is now a reporter working for berlin newspaper der morgenpost .

31 .
refugee arrivals from eastern europe have dwindled to a trickle in recent years , negating the usefulness of such a facility .
the marienfelde camp was set up in 1953 and operated first by us , british and french allied officials and later by west berlin authorities .
initially , the center consisted of 15 structures with space for 1,200 individuals , but as the number of refugees swelled , 11 more buildings were added to the facility in 1955 , increasing its capacity to 2,800 .
the refugees were housed in small , self-contained apartments , complete with kitchens and bathrooms .
a camp official says marienfelde was " a place of transition , " where the average length of stay was one to two weeks - this being the time it took refugees to pass through the 12 stages of vetting .
most refugees were germans fed up with life in communist east germany and eager to start over again in the west .
despite welcoming such disaffected hoards , west german officials remained cautious of just who they were letting in to the west .
in the early years of post-world war two europe , at the height of the cold war , dozens of agents from the communist bloc attempted to infiltrate west germany .

the lutheran and catholic churches provided counseling services and christened , confirmed and married refugees if asked .
of the four million people who fled westward from east germany between 1949 and 1990 , 1.35 million passed through the marienfelde camp .
in the late 1980s , when the communist world started to unravel , large numbers of refugees again began turning up at the camp .
in the spring of 1989 , the marienfelde camp was deluged with new arrivals , among them people of german origin from russia , kazakhstan , kyrgyzstan and ukraine .
in april 1989 , 6,000 arrived .
in may it was double that number .
by november , the camp was jammed with 100,000 refugees .
new beginnings among them in the spring of that year was katrin lange .
after waiting four years for permission to leave east berlin , she suddenly received word she could depart for the west .
at a mass-transit station in east berlin , she bid farewell to her father and brother before making the crossing .
soon after arriving at the marienfelde camp she learned she would be allowed to remain in the west .
a student who had passed examinations qualifying her for university , lange had been denied university admission by east german authorities she says she was not distraught at having to leave her home in the east .
" i had no painful feelings about leaving , but wondered if i would ever see my relatives again , " she says .
but lange need n't have worried .
less than five months later the berlin wall fell and she was joyously reunited with her mother at a crossing point in southern berlin .
lange was later allowed to attend berlin 's free university and then secured a grant to study in montreal , canada .
she is now a reporter working for berlin newspaper der morgenpost .

" the euphoria that dominated after the fall of the berlin wall has largely disappeared , " forsa chief manfred guellner told news agency afp .
only 46 percent of germans in the former communist east said their personal situation had improved .
that number was as high as 71 percent in 1989 .
according to the survey , every fourth person in eastern germany believes that life is worse now in the eastern states than it was under communism until 1989 .
only 39 percent believe they have profited from reunification .
the picture was n't much different in western germany where 40 percent said their lives had improved since the end of communism ; in 1989 that number was 52 percent .
attitudes hardening , expert says guellner said attitudes and prejudices had hardened on both sides .
whereas the eastern germans think they have been exploited and got a raw deal , " western germans have the feeling that they have simply footed the bill for eastern germany , " he said .
helping depressed former east germany has long been a priority for the german government .
the eastern states are still struggling with massive unemployment and under-investment , and has one trillion dollars has already been transferred from west to east since reunification .
separately , the munich-based economic research institute ifo predicted that the financial slowdown would widen the economic gap between eastern and western germany .
" in the short-and long-term , the eastern german states will show worse economic growth rates than the western ones , " ifo economic expert joachim ragnitz told news agency ap .
ragnitz pointed to eastern germany 's rapidly ageing population and the flight of younger people to western states as one of the prime reasons for the development , saying that only larger eastern cities such as dresden , potsdam or leipzig would buck the trend . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

can you work it out in your head ?
and can you do it in under 12 seconds ?
if so , you could compete at the world mental arithmetic championships . gerd mittring says he knows what it takes to become a math whiz .
the it specialist and psychologist from bonn organized the competition and is a former world mental arithmetic champion himself .
he says math ability is linked to emotion .
if you want to be good at math , you have to enjoy it .
kinjal shah from india is one of the youngest world champions in mental arithmetic .
in second place - max weber from germany .
the school pupil max weber counts : " 145 times 145 ?
easy , i know that 144 times 144 is 20,736 .
so i just have to double the square root of 20,736 , then add one .
then i add the result to 144 squared , and that gives me 145 times 145 and that ’ s 21,025 . "
quickfire mental arithmetic .
is it a talent or a trick ?
do you need a brilliant mind or simply a good teacher ?
for this math genius , the answer is clear : you need a bit of both .
but , he says , it ’ s much more than just a numbers game .
mental arithmetic world champion gerd mittring thinks : " what goes on in my mind is more than plain calculations .
there are also emotions that are sometimes pleasant and sometimes unpleasant .
for instance , if i don ’ t feel comfortable when i ’ m performing , then my arithmetic performance suffers – unlike when i am at ease .
human beings are much more complex than pocket calculators . " + + + andreas is another mathematician who solves mind-boggling math problems on stage .
here , he ’ s multiplying two five-digit numbers .
at the max planck institute for human cognitive and brain sciences , roland friedrich is trying to establish whether excelling in arithmetic is linked to a person ’ s genes or brain .
using a special brain scanner , he takes a glimpse behind the scenes at test subjects to see what happens during mental arithmetic calculations .
the test subjects are given math problems to solve , while he observes brain activity .
friedrich found to his surprise that brain activity is similar in math whizzes and less gifted people .
maths geniuses are simply able to solve problems quicker and in a more automated way .
but the brain function is essentially the same .
another finding - the brain doesn ’ t have a single area responsible for calculation .
instead , a number of regions are used during mental arithmetic ... regions that are also used to perform other tasks .
roland friedrich from the max planck institute for cognitive and brain sciences is sure that there is no single gene that determines math ability : " there are probably combinations of genes that influence certain things , such as the plasticity of the brain ... in other words , how the brain responds to mental training .
those good at math are certainly more developed at that point , and that ’ s genetically determined .
but it ’ d have to affect a number of regions . "
so you don ’ t need special genes or a super brain to become a human calculator .
the most important thing you can have is a passion for math as a child . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv tomorrow today interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de mathematics -pipe- 02.01.2009 our studio guest : prof. günter m. ziegler , mathematician , berlin technical university . großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther ziegler , one of julia 's professors and the president of the german mathematical society .
he 's already been a guest on the show a couple of times in this year of mathematics . dw-tv : first of all , we 've got the granddaddy of computers here .
this is an abacus .
can you tell us a little about the principle behind it ?
günther ziegler : well of course , i do n't have any practice in working with this , but this is singletons , 1,2,3,4 5 ; and these mean fives , and two fives make a ten , which would be in the next row .
so basically , it 's very close to how we compute and how we calculate in everyday life .
dw-tv : now let 's get back to julia ruscher here .
there are a few similarities between the two of you .
you both finished university very quickly , you won prizes , offered jobs at a very young age .
but you , i understand , are a big fan of literature .
is it really important for mathematicians to have other hobbies ?
günther ziegler : i think mathematics is close to life and it 's connected to many things , but of course , you do n't want to just study one subject like mathematics .
and you have to concentrate on it a lot , but you do n't want to do this one thing only in your life .
and so i think ... the mathematicians i know have many interests and many hobbies .
many of them are good in music , many of them read , some of them write .
it 's all part of mathematics , and it connects to mathematics .
dw-tv : yes , music also of course having a lot to do with mathematics .
what i was wondering though is whether or not there are a lot of women , .. math is traditionally considered a boy 's science .
are there a lot of women in your department , or is julia an exception ?
günther ziegler : i think we have two women on the faculty , in the department , but we have fifty percent women in the students and in the beginners , and i think the stereotype is breaking and is changing , and we are working on that .
and math is a women 's science as much as a men 's science , and we need them all .
i mean , maths is an important subject and if we somehow exclude half of the people from doing it , then we lose a lot .
dw-tv : right .
now it is , though , pretty hard to make math riveting for students in the way that maybe some other subjects can be .
a lot of people find math classes boring , or just difficult to understand .
how can we really make math attractive to young people ?
günther ziegler : i mean , math is difficult and that 's just one of the truths that we just have to confront .
on the other hand , maths is many different things .
and so if we explain maths , when we present maths , we have to show that .
and math is not only calculating with larger and larger numbers. but maths is the science of structures , it 's the science of patterns , there 's geometry , it connects to art , all of this is math .
and when we teach math , we have to teach these connections and we have to show these connections , we have to connect to history , we have to connect to everything that is math .
dw-tv : all right günther ziegler , that was our third red in a row , what are the chances that the next one 's going to be black ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther ziegler : well , just a bit less than a half , but exactly the same probability as that it 's red .
dw-tv : so it does n't matter how many times you 've had red before , the chances are the same ?
günther ziegler : exactly , if the roulette table is correct , then that does n't influence the chances .
dw-tv : now gambling always involves chance , but do mathematicians have a certain advantage when it comes to calculating the probabilities , or do they just trust their instincts when they 're at the table ?
günther ziegler : i mean , calculating the probabilities , mathematicians should have an advantage , but they do n't change the probabilities .
so at roulette , everybody has the same chances , and in the end , it 's only the casino that wins .
dw-tv : do you have a lucky number ?
günther ziegler : 42 .
dw-tv : why ?
günther ziegler : well , it 's the answer to the question about life , the universe and everything .
dw-tv : douglas adams !
günther ziegler : that 's what the hitch hikers guide says , yes .
dw-tv : well , here 's a philosophical question for you : is math independent of observation or are we somehow just making up as we go along to explain the universe ?
günther ziegler : no , i do n't think we make it up .
eugene wigner , nobel prize winner in physics , talked in the 60s about the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences .
so math , mathematical equations like einstein 's gravitation theory , can really describe the universe , can describe nature .
and so that shows that math is ingrained in the universe and in how nature works .
we do n't make it up .
dw-tv : what is the next eldorado of math ?
where 's the discipline headed ?
günther ziegler : i do n't know .
i think there 's still the huge old miracles or mysteries like the prime number distribution , that we will still have to solve , but also there 's things coming up like mathematical biology .
i think mathematics is getting more and more effective in biology , and that 's something that 's really coming up as a development .
dw-tv : do you think math will in the future become even more important to our daily lives than it is today ?
günther ziegler : i think so .
it 's already very important now , even if we do n't realise that .
it 's in all the hi tech that 's around us and so on , and that will continue to grow . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deloitte says 200 outlets that had been due to shut on friday will now also remain open on saturday , because there is still some stock to sell .
the remaining 200 stores will now close on 6 january , also a day later than originally planned .

and , as part of a new bbc show entitled your country needs you , the 60-year-old will also help select a performer to compete in moscow in may .
viewers can vote on who they want to represent them out of six acts who have already been lined up for the series .
lloyd webber says he does not expect to win eurovision what made you want to take part in the eurovision song contest ?
i thought it would be fun .
we 're not going to win it , let 's face it .
i do n't think that 's possible , but at the same time we could have a laugh along the way .
it 's eurovision .
i think secretly everybody watches it and secretly everybody has a bit of a laugh about it .
i 'm just looking forward to being in moscow with graham , because i know we 'll get up to no good .
during recording the show you travelled to russia to meet with prime minister valdimir putin - what did you talk about ?
i have his personal vote for the uk .
i tried to get him to guarantee the nation 's vote , but he was at pains to point out that russia is a democratic country these days , and he could n't speak for his people .
at which point i asked him what he was going to do about this .
but you 'll see all this in my interview , because i pointed out that russia ca n't vote for itself , and it would be helpful in my view , for uk and russia to work together .
why do you think eurovision has such a poor reputation in the uk ?
it 's because our entries have been absolute and total rubbish .
i get a little bit of an advantage because i 've got quite a lot of shows running round europe so i have got a kind of grass roots support .
i canvassed all the casts in my shows and they said the reason why they do n't vote for britain is because we do n't bother .
they resent it .
let 's face it , some of the acts have been rather ludicrous , but from their point of view , what we 've done to eurovision is almost worse .
what is the secret to a good eurovision song ?
i 'm just looking forward to being in moscow with graham , because i know we 'll get up to no good andrew lloyd webber i do n't plan to follow any rules like including a key change or following a structure .
you know every country is going to include everything from roller-skating to pole vaulting .
i do n't think we should go that way .
i think that if we 've got a chance to do anything , then we should really be about the song and the performer .
i 'm quite pleased because i think the final acts that we 've got there are potentially several artists with a long-term career .
but last year 's contestant andy abraham did not use gimmicks and he still came joint last .
i did n't actually see that one , but i did hear the song and i do n't think that 's really quite what we want .
what we have to is get the best song that we possibly can do , find the best artist we possibly can and then stage it in the best possible way .
now , if that means we need a thousand roller-skaters behind us , then that 's what we 'll have to do , but i somehow doubt it .
what sort of act are you hoping to put forward ?
well the six acts are so different that it would n't be possible to describe how different they are .
and it would be wrong for me to say what they are at the moment , because you 'll see when the show starts .
do you think people care enough about eurovision to want to vote ?
we 'll see , i do n't know .
i rather feel it 's a slight make or break and i think it would be a shame if it ended .
it would be good if it got back to be what it was intended to be , which was a song contest .
people forget that it has thrown up some extremely good songs over the years .
particularly in the early years of its existence .
andy abraham came joint last in 2008 's eurovision contest it launched abba , and the success of abba may not have happened if it had not been for eurovision .
what 's your favourite eurovision song ?
a song that no one would remember .
a song called are you sure ? by the allisons , who came second .
i remember that , because i was a kid in school at the time , and i remember thinking what a shame it was that britain did n't win it that year .
it is a very , very good song .
are you worried the public may vote for the underdog in the series just like they did in strictly come dancing ?
i do n't think so , because with my shows so far the public has voted for the best candidate .
all of the acts we 've got could do it .
are you worried the public have lost trust in voting for bbc shows after various phoneline scandals ?
i can tell you that the bbc have n't really done anything wrong here .
they just got some things muddled up .
in fact what the bbc have done is entirely honourable .
they saw a mathematical problem and a lot of programmes would n't have even mentioned it .
so , if i was to say anything about the bbc , they 're too honest about these things .
your country needs you begins on bbc one at 1910 gmt on 3 january .

i get a little bit of an advantage because i 've got quite a lot of shows running round europe so i have got a kind of grass roots support .
i canvassed all the casts in my shows and they said the reason why they do n't vote for britain is because we do n't bother .
they resent it .
let 's face it , some of the acts have been rather ludicrous , but from their point of view , what we 've done to eurovision is almost worse .
what is the secret to a good eurovision song ?
i 'm just looking forward to being in moscow with graham , because i know we 'll get up to no good andrew lloyd webber i do n't plan to follow any rules like including a key change or following a structure .
you know every country is going to include everything from roller-skating to pole vaulting .
i do n't think we should go that way .
i think that if we 've got a chance to do anything , then we should really be about the song and the performer .
i 'm quite pleased because i think the final acts that we 've got there are potentially several artists with a long-term career .
but last year 's contestant andy abraham did not use gimmicks and he still came joint last .
i did n't actually see that one , but i did hear the song and i do n't think that 's really quite what we want .
what we have to is get the best song that we possibly can do , find the best artist we possibly can and then stage it in the best possible way .
now , if that means we need a thousand roller-skaters behind us , then that 's what we 'll have to do , but i somehow doubt it .
what sort of act are you hoping to put forward ?
well the six acts are so different that it would n't be possible to describe how different they are .
and it would be wrong for me to say what they are at the moment , because you 'll see when the show starts .
do you think people care enough about eurovision to want to vote ?
we 'll see , i do n't know .
i rather feel it 's a slight make or break and i think it would be a shame if it ended .
it would be good if it got back to be what it was intended to be , which was a song contest .
people forget that it has thrown up some extremely good songs over the years .
particularly in the early years of its existence .
andy abraham came joint last in 2008 's eurovision contest it launched abba , and the success of abba may not have happened if it had not been for eurovision .
what 's your favourite eurovision song ?
a song that no one would remember .
a song called are you sure ? by the allisons , who came second .
i remember that , because i was a kid in school at the time , and i remember thinking what a shame it was that britain did n't win it that year .
it is a very , very good song .
are you worried the public may vote for the underdog in the series just like they did in strictly come dancing ?
i do n't think so , because with my shows so far the public has voted for the best candidate .
all of the acts we 've got could do it .
are you worried the public have lost trust in voting for bbc shows after various phoneline scandals ?
i can tell you that the bbc have n't really done anything wrong here .
they just got some things muddled up .
in fact what the bbc have done is entirely honourable .
they saw a mathematical problem and a lot of programmes would n't have even mentioned it .
so , if i was to say anything about the bbc , they 're too honest about these things .
your country needs you begins on bbc one at 1910 gmt on 3 january .

viewers can vote on who they want to represent them out of six acts who have already been lined up for the series .
lloyd webber says he does not expect to win eurovision what made you want to take part in the eurovision song contest ?
i thought it would be fun .
we 're not going to win it , let 's face it .
i do n't think that 's possible , but at the same time we could have a laugh along the way .
it 's eurovision .
i think secretly everybody watches it and secretly everybody has a bit of a laugh about it .
i 'm just looking forward to being in moscow with graham , because i know we 'll get up to no good .
during recording the show you travelled to russia to meet with prime minister valdimir putin - what did you talk about ?
i have his personal vote for the uk .
i tried to get him to guarantee the nation 's vote , but he was at pains to point out that russia is a democratic country these days , and he could n't speak for his people .
at which point i asked him what he was going to do about this .
but you 'll see all this in my interview , because i pointed out that russia ca n't vote for itself , and it would be helpful in my view , for uk and russia to work together .
why do you think eurovision has such a poor reputation in the uk ?
it 's because our entries have been absolute and total rubbish .
i get a little bit of an advantage because i 've got quite a lot of shows running round europe so i have got a kind of grass roots support .
i canvassed all the casts in my shows and they said the reason why they do n't vote for britain is because we do n't bother .
they resent it .
let 's face it , some of the acts have been rather ludicrous , but from their point of view , what we 've done to eurovision is almost worse .
what is the secret to a good eurovision song ?
i 'm just looking forward to being in moscow with graham , because i know we 'll get up to no good andrew lloyd webber i do n't plan to follow any rules like including a key change or following a structure .
you know every country is going to include everything from roller-skating to pole vaulting .
i do n't think we should go that way .
i think that if we 've got a chance to do anything , then we should really be about the song and the performer .
i 'm quite pleased because i think the final acts that we 've got there are potentially several artists with a long-term career .
but last year 's contestant andy abraham did not use gimmicks and he still came joint last .
i did n't actually see that one , but i did hear the song and i do n't think that 's really quite what we want .
what we have to is get the best song that we possibly can do , find the best artist we possibly can and then stage it in the best possible way .
now , if that means we need a thousand roller-skaters behind us , then that 's what we 'll have to do , but i somehow doubt it .
what sort of act are you hoping to put forward ?
well the six acts are so different that it would n't be possible to describe how different they are .
and it would be wrong for me to say what they are at the moment , because you 'll see when the show starts .
do you think people care enough about eurovision to want to vote ?
we 'll see , i do n't know .
i rather feel it 's a slight make or break and i think it would be a shame if it ended .
it would be good if it got back to be what it was intended to be , which was a song contest .
people forget that it has thrown up some extremely good songs over the years .
particularly in the early years of its existence .
andy abraham came joint last in 2008 's eurovision contest it launched abba , and the success of abba may not have happened if it had not been for eurovision .
what 's your favourite eurovision song ?
a song that no one would remember .
a song called are you sure ? by the allisons , who came second .
i remember that , because i was a kid in school at the time , and i remember thinking what a shame it was that britain did n't win it that year .
it is a very , very good song .
are you worried the public may vote for the underdog in the series just like they did in strictly come dancing ?
i do n't think so , because with my shows so far the public has voted for the best candidate .
all of the acts we 've got could do it .
are you worried the public have lost trust in voting for bbc shows after various phoneline scandals ?
i can tell you that the bbc have n't really done anything wrong here .
they just got some things muddled up .
in fact what the bbc have done is entirely honourable .
they saw a mathematical problem and a lot of programmes would n't have even mentioned it .
so , if i was to say anything about the bbc , they 're too honest about these things .
your country needs you begins on bbc one at 1910 gmt on 3 january .

it was 2001 and the party was furiously debating whether to adopt all-women shortlists for parliamentary candidates .
the venerable ex-cabinet minister baroness williams was arguing in favour , using the traditional , rhetorical approach to win over waverers .
on the other side , a recent university graduate called jo swinson adopted a more direct tactic .
she wore a t-shirt proclaiming : " i am not a token woman . "
' do n't call me baby ' fast forward seven years and ms swinson is the member of parliament for east dunbartonshire .
if she had a t-shirt on now , rather than a suit , the slogan might be : " i am not a token young person . "
ms swinson , at 28 , is the first mp to have been born in the 1980s .
the term " baby of the house " is sometimes used to describe the uk 's youngest legislator .
but ms swinson said : " i do n't like that at all .
i would just call myself the youngest mp . "
liberal leader david steel was 26 when he became an mp with some honourable members in their eighties and plenty in their sixties and seventies , the commons is not the most youthful working environment .
ms swinson , sitting in the cramped westminster office she shares with her researcher , said : " sometimes i think i 'm pigeonholed .
it still amazes me what excuses people use to bring up my age .
" once i was asking about the minimum wage for young people and a government minister joked that i was interested because i was one of them .
" another time i was talking about the desperate unpopularity of the poll tax in scotland .
a tory said that , surely , i was too young to remember .
" but it was such an awful time that , even though i was only about 10 years old at the time , i could recall it vividly . "
' forever young ' ms swinson studied at the london school of economics and worked in the marketing department of the hull radio station viking fm before entering full-time politics .
she follows in a tradition of young liberal , sdp or lib dem mps .
former lib dem leader charles kennedy was elected at 23 , while liberal predecessor david steel entered parliament a week before his 27th birthday .
ms swinson said : " in parliament and politics it seems that people think you are young forever .
at 40 you are considered young .
i would reduce the age at which someone can run for parliament to 16 jo swinson " but look at what other 28-year-olds are doing .
my sister became a consultant at the age of 33 .
when i worked in the media , the programme director was 25 .
at 28 , a lot of people have done a lot in their professions . "
ms swinson first ran for parliament in 2001 , aged 21 , contesting the seemingly unwinnable hull east seat of the then deputy prime minister , john prescott .
part-time working she said : " during the whole campaign i never met him .
i suppose he was busy at the time .
" i was , too , as i had to work part-time in the mornings and campaign for the rest of the day .
i never expected to win it , though .
" despite losing , it was that campaign that made me decide i really wanted to be an mp .
" politics had always been a hobby rather than a profession for me .
i only ran the first time after someone suggested i had a go .
but as the campaign went on it took hold of me and i realised what i really cared about was politics . "
emily benn is a parliamentary candidate at the age of 19 in the 2005 election ms swinson contested the seat of dunbartonshire east , where she had grown up .
she took it from labour with a 4,061 majority .
ms swinson said : " while i was campaigning i had to move back in with my parents for eight months , working part-time .
i could n't have afforded to run for parliament and pay the rent .
" i think it 's hard for anyone .
it 's often forgotten that candidates do n't get paid .
" if you spoke to losing candidates after elections , you would find many of them in a large amount of debt . "
in 2006 the minimum age for becoming an mp was cut from 21 to 18 , raising the prospect of teenagers in parliament .
tony benn 's 19-year-old granddaughter emily benn has been selected as the labour candidate for east worthing and shoreham .
ms swinson said : " good on her .
i hope we get a lot more young candidates .
i also think people should be able to vote at 16 .
" in fact i also would reduce the age at which someone can run for parliament to 16 .
i do n't see why we should call for one and not the other . "
shared experiences she added : " i think we need a diversity .
we need more people from all backgrounds .
" there are a huge number of oxbridge-educated lawyers elected as mps when they are middle-aged .
there is not a single mp who has paid tuition fees .
" we have a large part of the population with debts from these or who face working well into old age because of pension changes , but there is no person in parliament who shares , or will share , their experience .
" in general there 's a real bubble around westminster .
for instance , when we talk about the credit crunch , it is about the large-scale economics and the theory .
" it 's when you hold a constituency surgery and sit across the table from someone who 's having real problems that it brings it to life . "
ms swinson recently became a lib dem foreign affairs spokeswoman and is a member of the commons environmental audit committee .
surely it must be a little tiresome having so much to do when other people of the same age are out enjoying themselves ?
' frustrating ' " the hours of the job have an impact on your life .
if i want to go to a friend 's wedding , i have to make sure months in advance that i do n't have a surgery scheduled .
but i 'm lucky that i 'm doing something i love .
" there are bits of the job that are dry and the pace of progress can be frustrating .
people can take years to get the government to change their minds .
" i think one of the problems with politics now is that people are getting used to having an impact on things instantly .
" if you vote on x-factor , the results come out soon afterwards .
if you vote in a general election , things take a lot longer to change . "
one benefit of being the youngest mp is that there is a good chance of a career long enough to make a difference .
will ms swinson try to match some of the titans of the commons such as winston churchill , who served for 65 years , save for a few career breaks provided by the electorate .
or will she go for the record of charles villiers , wolverhampton 's mp for 63 years continuously from 1835 ?
she said : " the short answer is that i do n't know .
i suppose i want to stay an mp as long as i think i can contribute something and my constituents still want to elect me . "
at least ms swinson has the comfort of knowing that - if she wins again at the next election - it should be someone else 's job to wear the t-shirt of anti-tokenism .

it was 2001 and the party was furiously debating whether to adopt all-women shortlists for parliamentary candidates .
the venerable ex-cabinet minister baroness williams was arguing in favour , using the traditional , rhetorical approach to win over waverers .
on the other side , a recent university graduate called jo swinson adopted a more direct tactic .
she wore a t-shirt proclaiming : " i am not a token woman . "
' do n't call me baby ' fast forward seven years and ms swinson is the member of parliament for east dunbartonshire .
if she had a t-shirt on now , rather than a suit , the slogan might be : " i am not a token young person . "
ms swinson , at 28 , is the first mp to have been born in the 1980s .
the term " baby of the house " is sometimes used to describe the uk 's youngest legislator .
but ms swinson said : " i do n't like that at all .
i would just call myself the youngest mp . "
liberal leader david steel was 26 when he became an mp with some honourable members in their eighties and plenty in their sixties and seventies , the commons is not the most youthful working environment .
ms swinson , sitting in the cramped westminster office she shares with her researcher , said : " sometimes i think i 'm pigeonholed .
it still amazes me what excuses people use to bring up my age .
" once i was asking about the minimum wage for young people and a government minister joked that i was interested because i was one of them .
" another time i was talking about the desperate unpopularity of the poll tax in scotland .
a tory said that , surely , i was too young to remember .
" but it was such an awful time that , even though i was only about 10 years old at the time , i could recall it vividly . "
' forever young ' ms swinson studied at the london school of economics and worked in the marketing department of the hull radio station viking fm before entering full-time politics .
she follows in a tradition of young liberal , sdp or lib dem mps .
former lib dem leader charles kennedy was elected at 23 , while liberal predecessor david steel entered parliament a week before his 27th birthday .
ms swinson said : " in parliament and politics it seems that people think you are young forever .
at 40 you are considered young .
i would reduce the age at which someone can run for parliament to 16 jo swinson " but look at what other 28-year-olds are doing .
my sister became a consultant at the age of 33 .
when i worked in the media , the programme director was 25 .
at 28 , a lot of people have done a lot in their professions . "
ms swinson first ran for parliament in 2001 , aged 21 , contesting the seemingly unwinnable hull east seat of the then deputy prime minister , john prescott .
part-time working she said : " during the whole campaign i never met him .
i suppose he was busy at the time .
" i was , too , as i had to work part-time in the mornings and campaign for the rest of the day .
i never expected to win it , though .
" despite losing , it was that campaign that made me decide i really wanted to be an mp .
" politics had always been a hobby rather than a profession for me .
i only ran the first time after someone suggested i had a go .
but as the campaign went on it took hold of me and i realised what i really cared about was politics . "
emily benn is a parliamentary candidate at the age of 19 in the 2005 election ms swinson contested the seat of dunbartonshire east , where she had grown up .
she took it from labour with a 4,061 majority .
ms swinson said : " while i was campaigning i had to move back in with my parents for eight months , working part-time .
i could n't have afforded to run for parliament and pay the rent .
" i think it 's hard for anyone .
it 's often forgotten that candidates do n't get paid .
" if you spoke to losing candidates after elections , you would find many of them in a large amount of debt . "
in 2006 the minimum age for becoming an mp was cut from 21 to 18 , raising the prospect of teenagers in parliament .
tony benn 's 19-year-old granddaughter emily benn has been selected as the labour candidate for east worthing and shoreham .
ms swinson said : " good on her .
i hope we get a lot more young candidates .
i also think people should be able to vote at 16 .
" in fact i also would reduce the age at which someone can run for parliament to 16 .
i do n't see why we should call for one and not the other . "
shared experiences she added : " i think we need a diversity .
we need more people from all backgrounds .
" there are a huge number of oxbridge-educated lawyers elected as mps when they are middle-aged .
there is not a single mp who has paid tuition fees .
" we have a large part of the population with debts from these or who face working well into old age because of pension changes , but there is no person in parliament who shares , or will share , their experience .
" in general there 's a real bubble around westminster .
for instance , when we talk about the credit crunch , it is about the large-scale economics and the theory .
" it 's when you hold a constituency surgery and sit across the table from someone who 's having real problems that it brings it to life . "
ms swinson recently became a lib dem foreign affairs spokeswoman and is a member of the commons environmental audit committee .
surely it must be a little tiresome having so much to do when other people of the same age are out enjoying themselves ?
' frustrating ' " the hours of the job have an impact on your life .
if i want to go to a friend 's wedding , i have to make sure months in advance that i do n't have a surgery scheduled .
but i 'm lucky that i 'm doing something i love .
" there are bits of the job that are dry and the pace of progress can be frustrating .
people can take years to get the government to change their minds .
" i think one of the problems with politics now is that people are getting used to having an impact on things instantly .
" if you vote on x-factor , the results come out soon afterwards .
if you vote in a general election , things take a lot longer to change . "
one benefit of being the youngest mp is that there is a good chance of a career long enough to make a difference .
will ms swinson try to match some of the titans of the commons such as winston churchill , who served for 65 years , save for a few career breaks provided by the electorate .
or will she go for the record of charles villiers , wolverhampton 's mp for 63 years continuously from 1835 ?
she said : " the short answer is that i do n't know .
i suppose i want to stay an mp as long as i think i can contribute something and my constituents still want to elect me . "
at least ms swinson has the comfort of knowing that - if she wins again at the next election - it should be someone else 's job to wear the t-shirt of anti-tokenism .

it was 2001 and the party was furiously debating whether to adopt all-women shortlists for parliamentary candidates .
the venerable ex-cabinet minister baroness williams was arguing in favour , using the traditional , rhetorical approach to win over waverers .
on the other side , a recent university graduate called jo swinson adopted a more direct tactic .
she wore a t-shirt proclaiming : " i am not a token woman . "
' do n't call me baby ' fast forward seven years and ms swinson is the member of parliament for east dunbartonshire .
if she had a t-shirt on now , rather than a suit , the slogan might be : " i am not a token young person . "
ms swinson , at 28 , is the first mp to have been born in the 1980s .
the term " baby of the house " is sometimes used to describe the uk 's youngest legislator .
but ms swinson said : " i do n't like that at all .
i would just call myself the youngest mp . "
liberal leader david steel was 26 when he became an mp with some honourable members in their eighties and plenty in their sixties and seventies , the commons is not the most youthful working environment .
ms swinson , sitting in the cramped westminster office she shares with her researcher , said : " sometimes i think i 'm pigeonholed .
it still amazes me what excuses people use to bring up my age .
" once i was asking about the minimum wage for young people and a government minister joked that i was interested because i was one of them .
" another time i was talking about the desperate unpopularity of the poll tax in scotland .
a tory said that , surely , i was too young to remember .
" but it was such an awful time that , even though i was only about 10 years old at the time , i could recall it vividly . "
' forever young ' ms swinson studied at the london school of economics and worked in the marketing department of the hull radio station viking fm before entering full-time politics .
she follows in a tradition of young liberal , sdp or lib dem mps .
former lib dem leader charles kennedy was elected at 23 , while liberal predecessor david steel entered parliament a week before his 27th birthday .
ms swinson said : " in parliament and politics it seems that people think you are young forever .
at 40 you are considered young .
i would reduce the age at which someone can run for parliament to 16 jo swinson " but look at what other 28-year-olds are doing .
my sister became a consultant at the age of 33 .
when i worked in the media , the programme director was 25 .
at 28 , a lot of people have done a lot in their professions . "
ms swinson first ran for parliament in 2001 , aged 21 , contesting the seemingly unwinnable hull east seat of the then deputy prime minister , john prescott .
part-time working she said : " during the whole campaign i never met him .
i suppose he was busy at the time .
" i was , too , as i had to work part-time in the mornings and campaign for the rest of the day .
i never expected to win it , though .
" despite losing , it was that campaign that made me decide i really wanted to be an mp .
" politics had always been a hobby rather than a profession for me .
i only ran the first time after someone suggested i had a go .
but as the campaign went on it took hold of me and i realised what i really cared about was politics . "
emily benn is a parliamentary candidate at the age of 19 in the 2005 election ms swinson contested the seat of dunbartonshire east , where she had grown up .
she took it from labour with a 4,061 majority .
ms swinson said : " while i was campaigning i had to move back in with my parents for eight months , working part-time .
i could n't have afforded to run for parliament and pay the rent .
" i think it 's hard for anyone .
it 's often forgotten that candidates do n't get paid .
" if you spoke to losing candidates after elections , you would find many of them in a large amount of debt . "
in 2006 the minimum age for becoming an mp was cut from 21 to 18 , raising the prospect of teenagers in parliament .
tony benn 's 19-year-old granddaughter emily benn has been selected as the labour candidate for east worthing and shoreham .
ms swinson said : " good on her .
i hope we get a lot more young candidates .
i also think people should be able to vote at 16 .
" in fact i also would reduce the age at which someone can run for parliament to 16 .
i do n't see why we should call for one and not the other . "
shared experiences she added : " i think we need a diversity .
we need more people from all backgrounds .
" there are a huge number of oxbridge-educated lawyers elected as mps when they are middle-aged .
there is not a single mp who has paid tuition fees .
" we have a large part of the population with debts from these or who face working well into old age because of pension changes , but there is no person in parliament who shares , or will share , their experience .
" in general there 's a real bubble around westminster .
for instance , when we talk about the credit crunch , it is about the large-scale economics and the theory .
" it 's when you hold a constituency surgery and sit across the table from someone who 's having real problems that it brings it to life . "
ms swinson recently became a lib dem foreign affairs spokeswoman and is a member of the commons environmental audit committee .
surely it must be a little tiresome having so much to do when other people of the same age are out enjoying themselves ?
' frustrating ' " the hours of the job have an impact on your life .
if i want to go to a friend 's wedding , i have to make sure months in advance that i do n't have a surgery scheduled .
but i 'm lucky that i 'm doing something i love .
" there are bits of the job that are dry and the pace of progress can be frustrating .
people can take years to get the government to change their minds .
" i think one of the problems with politics now is that people are getting used to having an impact on things instantly .
" if you vote on x-factor , the results come out soon afterwards .
if you vote in a general election , things take a lot longer to change . "
one benefit of being the youngest mp is that there is a good chance of a career long enough to make a difference .
will ms swinson try to match some of the titans of the commons such as winston churchill , who served for 65 years , save for a few career breaks provided by the electorate .
or will she go for the record of charles villiers , wolverhampton 's mp for 63 years continuously from 1835 ?
she said : " the short answer is that i do n't know .
i suppose i want to stay an mp as long as i think i can contribute something and my constituents still want to elect me . "
at least ms swinson has the comfort of knowing that - if she wins again at the next election - it should be someone else 's job to wear the t-shirt of anti-tokenism .

she lives in a havana flat that belongs to her husband 's grandparents .
cuba 's housing stock : inadequate and in poor repair for the last seven years she and her husband have shared a bedroom with their two children .
maria julia - not her real name - fears her relationship with her husband will not withstand the pressures of their living arrangements for much longer .
she says she has only one chance of securing a separate flat in havana for her family and saving her relationship - and it is drastic .
" the only option i have is to divorce my husband , and to marry a man who has legal title to a flat .
i will pay him .
then in two years , he will sign over the property to me , we will get divorced and i will marry my husband again . "
this complicated transaction will cost maria julia $ 10,000 -lrb- £ 6,800 -rrb- .
it is a fortune in cuba , but the minimum going rate .
her sister has sent her the money from the us , and maria julia has it hidden - in cash - somewhere in havana .
maria julia 's plan to buy a flat is illegal , which is why we can not identify her .
in cuba , only the state has the right to sell property .
private buyers - or sellers - may end up having their home confiscated altogether by the state if they are caught .
swap shop there was already a shortfall of more than half a million homes before three hurricanes wrought widespread destruction in 2008 .
everybody 's losing .
and for me , as an economist , it 's frustrating .
today if you want to buy your home , you have to use the black market juan triana overall , the housing stock is in a dilapidated state .
the precariousness of the cuban economy , which the government says is partly due to the impact of the us trade embargo , means the new building programme is not keeping up with demand .
so the black market is thriving .
" it 's the biggest , really the biggest in cuba , " says juan triana , an economist at the centre for the study of the cuban economy .
mr triana is unwilling to guess at what the housing black market is worth in cash terms , but he is troubled .
" everybody 's losing .
and for me , as an economist , it 's frustrating .
today if you want to buy your home , you have to use the black market . "
looking for a property swap at the paseo del prado although cubans are not allowed to buy and sell properties privately , they are permitted to swap .
and on a saturday morning , hundreds of people gather on the paseo del prado in central havana in the hope of finding someone they can exchange homes with .
officially no money should change hands .
yet in practice , swapping a smaller property for something larger will mean parting with several thousand dollars .
but maria julia has no property to swap - her husband 's grandparents hold the legal title to the flat she lives in .
so a bogus marriage is the only way she can see of changing her circumstances .
maria julia has used an illicit middleman , known as a corredor - literally , a runner - to find her new home .
she is busy working and has no time to do it herself .
if the deal goes through , she will pay him $ 500 .
property chain the transaction will take time , because the man she will buy from in havana is still securing his own new property .
" he has a girlfriend in santiago de cuba , " she says .
" they have seen somewhere in santiago they want to buy .
and his girlfriend is going to have to marry a very old man in his 80s to get that property .
" they will have to pay the old man too , with the money that i am going to give them .
it is a really long chain . "
cuba is marking the 50th anniversary of its revolution .
one of the most popular moves of fidel castro in his early years of government was housing reform .
many tenants got legal title to their homes and rents were capped .
i have a worry ... that i 'll solve the housing problem for me and my children , but my relationship with my husband wo n't survive maria julia multiple property ownership was prohibited : cubans can still only legally own one home in the town where they live and another in the countryside .
but 50 years on from those heady , optimistic beginnings , housing is close to the top of the list of complaints among cubans .
juan marcos mendez , the vice president of the government 's national housing institute , does not deny there are huge challenges .
but he maintains that the answer does not lie in privatising housing .
" housing is social property .
we do n't believe it 's right for people to make a profit from it .
of course , some people still have n't understood the reasons why we have these rules and they try to get ahead illegally .
" but it 's only possible to improve the situation by continuing our building programme - although the united states blockade has a serious impact on that .
we may have problems in cuba but we do n't have people sleeping under bridges . "
and that is true .
but the impact of the housing shortage is distorting family life for many people .
now maria julia is worried that the deal she has set in motion will further sour her relationship with her husband .
" it 's one thing to accept the fact you have to make a bogus marriage as an idea , but quite another to actually do it .
" i have a worry - maybe it 's a premonition - that i 'll solve the housing problem for me and my children , but my relationship with my husband wo n't survive . "

she lives in a havana flat that belongs to her husband 's grandparents .
cuba 's housing stock : inadequate and in poor repair for the last seven years she and her husband have shared a bedroom with their two children .
maria julia - not her real name - fears her relationship with her husband will not withstand the pressures of their living arrangements for much longer .
she says she has only one chance of securing a separate flat in havana for her family and saving her relationship - and it is drastic .
" the only option i have is to divorce my husband , and to marry a man who has legal title to a flat .
i will pay him .
then in two years , he will sign over the property to me , we will get divorced and i will marry my husband again . "
this complicated transaction will cost maria julia $ 10,000 -lrb- £ 6,800 -rrb- .
it is a fortune in cuba , but the minimum going rate .
her sister has sent her the money from the us , and maria julia has it hidden - in cash - somewhere in havana .
maria julia 's plan to buy a flat is illegal , which is why we can not identify her .
in cuba , only the state has the right to sell property .
private buyers - or sellers - may end up having their home confiscated altogether by the state if they are caught .
swap shop there was already a shortfall of more than half a million homes before three hurricanes wrought widespread destruction in 2008 .
everybody 's losing .
and for me , as an economist , it 's frustrating .
today if you want to buy your home , you have to use the black market juan triana overall , the housing stock is in a dilapidated state .
the precariousness of the cuban economy , which the government says is partly due to the impact of the us trade embargo , means the new building programme is not keeping up with demand .
so the black market is thriving .
" it 's the biggest , really the biggest in cuba , " says juan triana , an economist at the centre for the study of the cuban economy .
mr triana is unwilling to guess at what the housing black market is worth in cash terms , but he is troubled .
" everybody 's losing .
and for me , as an economist , it 's frustrating .
today if you want to buy your home , you have to use the black market . "
looking for a property swap at the paseo del prado although cubans are not allowed to buy and sell properties privately , they are permitted to swap .
and on a saturday morning , hundreds of people gather on the paseo del prado in central havana in the hope of finding someone they can exchange homes with .
officially no money should change hands .
yet in practice , swapping a smaller property for something larger will mean parting with several thousand dollars .
but maria julia has no property to swap - her husband 's grandparents hold the legal title to the flat she lives in .
so a bogus marriage is the only way she can see of changing her circumstances .
maria julia has used an illicit middleman , known as a corredor - literally , a runner - to find her new home .
she is busy working and has no time to do it herself .
if the deal goes through , she will pay him $ 500 .
property chain the transaction will take time , because the man she will buy from in havana is still securing his own new property .
" he has a girlfriend in santiago de cuba , " she says .
" they have seen somewhere in santiago they want to buy .
and his girlfriend is going to have to marry a very old man in his 80s to get that property .
" they will have to pay the old man too , with the money that i am going to give them .
it is a really long chain . "
cuba is marking the 50th anniversary of its revolution .
one of the most popular moves of fidel castro in his early years of government was housing reform .
many tenants got legal title to their homes and rents were capped .
i have a worry ... that i 'll solve the housing problem for me and my children , but my relationship with my husband wo n't survive maria julia multiple property ownership was prohibited : cubans can still only legally own one home in the town where they live and another in the countryside .
but 50 years on from those heady , optimistic beginnings , housing is close to the top of the list of complaints among cubans .
juan marcos mendez , the vice president of the government 's national housing institute , does not deny there are huge challenges .
but he maintains that the answer does not lie in privatising housing .
" housing is social property .
we do n't believe it 's right for people to make a profit from it .
of course , some people still have n't understood the reasons why we have these rules and they try to get ahead illegally .
" but it 's only possible to improve the situation by continuing our building programme - although the united states blockade has a serious impact on that .
we may have problems in cuba but we do n't have people sleeping under bridges . "

i will pay him .
then in two years , he will sign over the property to me , we will get divorced and i will marry my husband again . "
this complicated transaction will cost maria julia $ 10,000 -lrb- £ 6,800 -rrb- .
it is a fortune in cuba , but the minimum going rate .
her sister has sent her the money from the us , and maria julia has it hidden - in cash - somewhere in havana .
maria julia 's plan to buy a flat is illegal , which is why we can not identify her .
in cuba , only the state has the right to sell property .
private buyers - or sellers - may end up having their home confiscated altogether by the state if they are caught .
swap shop there was already a shortfall of more than half a million homes before three hurricanes wrought widespread destruction in 2008 .
everybody 's losing .
and for me , as an economist , it 's frustrating .
today if you want to buy your home , you have to use the black market juan triana overall , the housing stock is in a dilapidated state .
the precariousness of the cuban economy , which the government says is partly due to the impact of the us trade embargo , means the new building programme is not keeping up with demand .
so the black market is thriving .
" it 's the biggest , really the biggest in cuba , " says juan triana , an economist at the centre for the study of the cuban economy .
mr triana is unwilling to guess at what the housing black market is worth in cash terms , but he is troubled .
" everybody 's losing .
and for me , as an economist , it 's frustrating .
today if you want to buy your home , you have to use the black market . "
looking for a property swap at the paseo del prado although cubans are not allowed to buy and sell properties privately , they are permitted to swap .
and on a saturday morning , hundreds of people gather on the paseo del prado in central havana in the hope of finding someone they can exchange homes with .
officially no money should change hands .
yet in practice , swapping a smaller property for something larger will mean parting with several thousand dollars .
but maria julia has no property to swap - her husband 's grandparents hold the legal title to the flat she lives in .
so a bogus marriage is the only way she can see of changing her circumstances .
maria julia has used an illicit middleman , known as a corredor - literally , a runner - to find her new home .
she is busy working and has no time to do it herself .
if the deal goes through , she will pay him $ 500 .
property chain the transaction will take time , because the man she will buy from in havana is still securing his own new property .
" he has a girlfriend in santiago de cuba , " she says .
" they have seen somewhere in santiago they want to buy .
and his girlfriend is going to have to marry a very old man in his 80s to get that property .
" they will have to pay the old man too , with the money that i am going to give them .
it is a really long chain . "
cuba is marking the 50th anniversary of its revolution .
one of the most popular moves of fidel castro in his early years of government was housing reform .
many tenants got legal title to their homes and rents were capped .
i have a worry ... that i 'll solve the housing problem for me and my children , but my relationship with my husband wo n't survive maria julia multiple property ownership was prohibited : cubans can still only legally own one home in the town where they live and another in the countryside .
but 50 years on from those heady , optimistic beginnings , housing is close to the top of the list of complaints among cubans .
juan marcos mendez , the vice president of the government 's national housing institute , does not deny there are huge challenges .
but he maintains that the answer does not lie in privatising housing .
" housing is social property .
we do n't believe it 's right for people to make a profit from it .
of course , some people still have n't understood the reasons why we have these rules and they try to get ahead illegally .
" but it 's only possible to improve the situation by continuing our building programme - although the united states blockade has a serious impact on that .
we may have problems in cuba but we do n't have people sleeping under bridges . "
and that is true .
but the impact of the housing shortage is distorting family life for many people .
now maria julia is worried that the deal she has set in motion will further sour her relationship with her husband .
" it 's one thing to accept the fact you have to make a bogus marriage as an idea , but quite another to actually do it .
" i have a worry - maybe it 's a premonition - that i 'll solve the housing problem for me and my children , but my relationship with my husband wo n't survive . "

" we sincerely apologise ... and we beg your forgiveness , " read the note from 22 dairy firms , led by sanlu , china 's state news agency said .
at least six babies died and 290,000 became ill from melamine contamination in milk products made by the companies .
melamine was added so the milk appeared to have a higher protein content .
" we are deeply sorry for the harm caused to the children and the society , " the text message said .
" we sincerely apologise for that and we beg your forgiveness . "
it said a compensation fund had been established for the victims , including the families of thousands of babies still suffering from urinary problems such as kidney stones .
standing trial the chairwoman of sanlu , tian wenhua , pleaded guilty to selling fake or substandard products at a trial that recently concluded in northern china . "
for some parents , text message apologies , trials and compensation funds are n't enough " the bbc 's james reynolds james reynolds ' blog she is expected to be sentenced to life imprisonment although a verdict may not be reached for several weeks , the official beijing news said .
earlier reports indicated that the 66-year-old executive could face the death penalty .
in the past week , another 17 people involved in producing , selling , buying and adding melamine to raw milk have also gone on trial .
sanlu said it discovered the problem in may and reported it to authorities in hebei province on 2 august .
but nothing became public until early september , when the new zealand government said it brought complaints by sanlu 's partner , fonterra , to the attention of the chinese government .
parents ' protests meanwhile a group of parents whose children drank the tainted milk have reportedly been detained by police . "
we are asking for research on how much damage melamine can wreak " jiang yalin timeline : china milk scandal a father of one ill child said beijing police tried to block them from holding a news conference , and added that some of the group - including him - were detained for a while and are now under house arrest .
but a small press briefing did go ahead on a beijing pavement , with parents complaining about lack of government support .
" the government said all the medical care is free , but when it comes to the local level , things change .
i have already paid more than 50,000 yuan -lrb- $ 7,300 , £ 5,000 -rrb- , " one man from sichuan province told reuters .
" we are here today to claim rights for our babies , " lan juanxian , the mother of 14-month-old twin sons , told the bbc .
" our babies have been diagnosed with kidney stones , but we do n't know what other diseases they will contract when they grow up , " she added .
" the issue of adding melamine into food is a new problem , no one has scientific information or evidence , " added 33-year-old jiang yalin .
" we are asking for research on how much damage melamine can wreak , " she told reporters .
