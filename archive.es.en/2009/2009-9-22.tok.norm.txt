china has become the world 's largest emitter of carbon dioxide and the country 's climate policy is being closely watched in the run-up to the copenhagen climate summit taking place at the end of the year .
hu jintao pledged to " vigorously " develop renewable energies , which will account for 15 percent of china 's energy mix by 2020 , as well as to boost nuclear energy . china currently has 11 nuclear reactors , which generate nine gigawatts of energy , enough to provide 1 percent of the country ’ s energy .
24 are in the making right now and 18 more are planned in the future .
by 2020 , 70 gigawatts of nuclear energy will be generated - enough to power 70 cities the size of san francisco .
zhou dadi from the energy research institute of the national development and reform commission in beijing says : “ nuclear energy can help restrict pollution , protect the environment and optimise our energy supply .
our studies show that china sees nuclear energy as an important means of reducing pollution , acquiring more energy and reducing our dependence on coal .
nuclear energy is going to develop very fast in the future . ”
china still gets most of its energy - over 70 percent - from coal .
but coal-powered stations can not meet the demand .
the electricity grid often collapses .
there are power cuts in summer particularly because of the intense use of air conditioning .
on top of that , the power stations are old and pollute the atmosphere heavily .
little public debate about risks as china is turning to nuclear energy as a long-term alternative , there is more and more talk of the risks involved .
but nuclear expert zhou dadi thinks there is no need to worry : “ we are learning from the experiences in the united states , japan and europe .
in europe , the nuclear power stations are built near the cities .
it ’ s very important to choose the right technology and to ensure conditions are safe .
when we make decisions we will choose places which are not heavily populated .
i am sure that china will choose the most advanced technology . ”
although beijing is insistent that high safety standards should be met , this is not always the case in the provinces where corruption is high .
there is also very little public debate about nuclear power - about its advantages and about the risks involved .
critics of nuclear energy are often faced with reprisals .
nuclear waste causing concern wang , a student of english in beijing , says she is “ very much afraid of living close to a nuclear power plant .
there are many natural disasters such as earthquakes and landslides .
i don ’ t know how to prevent being exposed to radiation .
i don ’ t think we have enough knowledge about the dangers or bad effects of nuclear power . ”
nuclear waste is also causing concern but zhou dadi once again dismisses fears : “ we are thinking about how to recycle nuclear liquids .
we ’ re looking at the same methods as the international community - for example storing the waste deep underground .
china will act responsibly . "
a plan to store nuclear waste in the gobi desert has now been rejected .
there is still no alternative .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 22.09.2009 china plans to reduce carbon emissions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daya bay nuclear electricity plant in shenzhen in china 's southern guangdong province at a un climate conference in new york , chinese president hu jintao vowed to reduce the chinese economy 's carbon intensity by a " notable margin " by 2020 on tuesday .
china has become the world 's largest emitter of carbon dioxide and the country 's climate policy is being closely watched in the run-up to the copenhagen climate summit taking place at the end of the year .
hu jintao pledged to " vigorously " develop renewable energies , which will account for 15 percent of china 's energy mix by 2020 , as well as to boost nuclear energy . china currently has 11 nuclear reactors , which generate nine gigawatts of energy , enough to provide 1 percent of the country ’ s energy .
24 are in the making right now and 18 more are planned in the future .
by 2020 , 70 gigawatts of nuclear energy will be generated - enough to power 70 cities the size of san francisco .
zhou dadi from the energy research institute of the national development and reform commission in beijing says : “ nuclear energy can help restrict pollution , protect the environment and optimise our energy supply .
our studies show that china sees nuclear energy as an important means of reducing pollution , acquiring more energy and reducing our dependence on coal .
nuclear energy is going to develop very fast in the future . ”
china still gets most of its energy - over 70 percent - from coal .
but coal-powered stations can not meet the demand .
the electricity grid often collapses .
there are power cuts in summer particularly because of the intense use of air conditioning .
on top of that , the power stations are old and pollute the atmosphere heavily .
little public debate about risks as china is turning to nuclear energy as a long-term alternative , there is more and more talk of the risks involved .
but nuclear expert zhou dadi thinks there is no need to worry : “ we are learning from the experiences in the united states , japan and europe .
in europe , the nuclear power stations are built near the cities .
it ’ s very important to choose the right technology and to ensure conditions are safe .
when we make decisions we will choose places which are not heavily populated .
i am sure that china will choose the most advanced technology . ”
although beijing is insistent that high safety standards should be met , this is not always the case in the provinces where corruption is high .
there is also very little public debate about nuclear power - about its advantages and about the risks involved .
critics of nuclear energy are often faced with reprisals .
nuclear waste causing concern wang , a student of english in beijing , says she is “ very much afraid of living close to a nuclear power plant .

hainer played in attack , while zeitz was goalkeeper .
the game was meant to bring a symbolic end to one of germany 's most infamous family feuds , which began in 1948 when a row between brothers rudolf and adolf dassler split the family sportswear business , already a major supplier in the field , into two camps .
rudolf founded puma in 1948 , while adolf , or adi , dassler founded adidas in 1949 .
their rivalry divided the dasslers ' home town of 23,000 people , where competing factories were built on opposite sides of the aurach river .

monday 's football match was the first conciliatory gesture between the two companies , even though neither has belonged to the dassler family for years .
both companies have become international leaders in the sportswear field , with puma signing a sponsorship deal with record-breaking sprinter usain bolt .
for its part , adidas recently extended its partnership with the football organization uefa , providing equipment for all international football tournaments until 2017 .

ciulli rejected the demand .
" this is not an anti-semitic piece , but one that addresses the subject of anti-semitism , " he said , stressing the " autonomy of theatric art . "
he stressed that the play would premiere , as planned , on october 1 at his theater in the western germany city of muelheim .
it is slated to be one of three works by fassbinder to be shown in a three-hour evening performance set .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the play presents cliches , some jewish leaders say play staged in new york , tel aviv the play has never been performed in germany , but has been staged in new york , tel aviv and european cities .
jewish groups said the play revived stereotypes of jews , with one main character being a " rich jew " who amasses great wealth through property speculation .
in the piece , the man regularly visits a prostitute , whose father was a nazi during the third reich and co-responsible for the decimation of jews .
the prostitute becomes an object for the jew 's revenge ; her murder is ultimately covered up by the police .
murder , brutal homosexuality and sexual and psychic perversions are all part of the play , which was written in 1975 .
the " usual cliches " the central council of jews said the play presented characters " as stereotypes burdened with the usual cliches , " and said the piece should not be staged " out of respect for the small number of holocaust survivors and the millions who died . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fassbinder was known for his shocking works the play was originally scheduled to be performed in frankfurt in1985 , but was cancelled when protestors and members of the central council of jews - wearing concentration camp prisoner garb - stormed the stage , rejecting the presentation of a jew as murderer .
another attempt to stage the play in berlin 13 years later was likewise abandoned .
this is not the first time works by the late fassbinder have unnerved audiences .
the writer and director is known for his socially critical works , and is most famous for his film " the marriage of maria braun . "
he died in 1982 at the age of 37 from heart failure related to drugs. als / dpa / epd editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the camp was used as a base for risky attempts to reach britain . britain 's home secretary alan johnson said the action taken in calais would " disrupt illegal immigration and people-trafficking routes . "
french police cleared and then bulldozed the makeshift forest camp - known as the " jungle " - near the northern city of calais on tuesday morning .
" i welcome the swift and decisive steps that the french government has taken today to close the " jungle " in calais , " johnson said .
the prefect of the region told journalists after the two-hour operation that 278 migrants had been taken into custody , nearly half of them minors .
the adults were temporarily jailed , while the minors were placed in " specialized centers , " he said .
the immigrants , mostly afghans , had hoped to travel the 35 kilometers across the english channel into britain .
an end to criminal trafficking the operation by hundreds of police officers was the final step in a months-long undertaking by the french government to remove the camp .
britain and france had agreed earlier this year to step up efforts against illegal migrants by strengthening border security with state-of-the-art technology and closer cooperation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : besson warned of more raids to come on nearby squatter camps france 's immigration minister eric besson told rtl radio that the dismantling of the camp was justified , calling the site a " base camp for human traffickers . "
the police operation " targeted the tools of the criminal gangs who sell migrants passage to britain , exploit them and have them living in what had become an open air garbage dump , " he said .
besson said that each migrant would be offered an " individual solution " and given the choice to leave voluntarily , apply for asylum or be forcibly deported .
aid groups predict , though , that many of the immigrants will simply end up back on the streets .
" they are going to be scattered across the countryside , at the mercy of traffickers , " said jean-claude lenoir of the salam migrant support group .
" at least here , the young people had built a kind of community .
it 's tragic . "
problem of illegal immigration continues the un refugee agency unhcr said it recognized the need to combat smuggling and trafficking of persons and the right of the french government to maintain public order .
" closing the so-called jungle camp does , however , not address the phenomenon of mixed and irregular migration , nor does it solve the problems of the people concerned , amongst whom there may be many with protection needs , " unhcr spokesman andrej mahecic said at a press briefing in geneva on tuesday .
bildunterschrift : the migrants had gathered before their evacuation to demonstrate their plight unhcr called on the french authorities to ensure that those who wish to apply for refugee protection were given access to " a full and fair asylum procedure , " mahecic said .
" the situation in calais underscores , once again , the need for governments in europe to intensify efforts to arrive at a common european asylum system , not only on paper , but also in practice , " he said .
besson said the calais crisis was partly caused by the lack of a coherent european union migration policy .
he said states should agree to share the asylum burden more fairly , while boosting the powers of the eu border police , frontex. sac / ap / afp / dpa editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ciulli rejected the demand .
" this is not an anti-semitic piece , but one that addresses the subject of anti-semitism , " he said , stressing the " autonomy of theatric art . "
he stressed that the play would premiere , as planned , on october 1 at his theater in the western germany city of muelheim .
it is slated to be one of three works by fassbinder to be shown in a three-hour evening performance set .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the play presents cliches , some jewish leaders say play staged in new york , tel aviv the play has never been performed in germany , but has been staged in new york , tel aviv and european cities .
jewish groups said the play revived stereotypes of jews , with one main character being a " rich jew " who amasses great wealth through property speculation .
in the piece , the man regularly visits a prostitute , whose father was a nazi during the third reich and co-responsible for the decimation of jews .
the prostitute becomes an object for the jew 's revenge ; her murder is ultimately covered up by the police .
murder , brutal homosexuality and sexual and psychic perversions are all part of the play , which was written in 1975 .
the " usual cliches " the central council of jews said the play presented characters " as stereotypes burdened with the usual cliches , " and said the piece should not be staged " out of respect for the small number of holocaust survivors and the millions who died . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fassbinder was known for his shocking works the play was originally scheduled to be performed in frankfurt in1985 , but was cancelled when protestors and members of the central council of jews - wearing concentration camp prisoner garb - stormed the stage , rejecting the presentation of a jew as murderer .
another attempt to stage the play in berlin 13 years later was likewise abandoned .
this is not the first time works by the late fassbinder have unnerved audiences .
the writer and director is known for his socially critical works , and is most famous for his film " the marriage of maria braun . "
he died in 1982 at the age of 37 from heart failure related to drugs. als / dpa / epd editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while losses were observed across the board , exports to the united states and russia fell most sharply . the german federal statistical office published the report showing that exports to european union countries were 24 percent lower than during the same period last year , while exports to countries outside of the eu were nearly 22 percent lower on average .
the wiesbaden-based office said exports to some countries within the eu was better than to others .
export volumes to ireland , spain , hungary and the uk were " above average " , according to official figures released on tuesday .
outside of the eu , " very sharp falls were observed for deliveries to russia and to turkey , ” the report said .
exports to the us and japan were down 27 and 23 percent respectively , the report added .
the latest data point to the prolongation of a gloomy outlook for the world ’ s largest exporter .
exports rebounded in july the second quarter export figures come close on the heels of relatively encouraging data published earlier this month by the federal statistics office .
germany ’ s trade surplus jumped 12 percent in july and exports rose by more than two percent over the previous month to over 70 billion euros .
analysts said that the july trade surplus was driven largely by a solid surge in exports to asia , in particular .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite huge losses , germany remains europe 's most promising economy no quick recovery in sight on monday , the head of germany ’ s central bank warned that the economy , battered by the financial market chaos , would not recover to its pre-crisis levels for another four years . “ the economic recovery will take a while .
the german economy will not reach the level of prosperity it enjoyed in 2008 until , probably , 2013 , " bundesbank president axel weber told the frankfurter rundschau newspaper .
the road ahead would remain “ bumpy " , he added . nevertheless , he said that germany had exited the " free fall " phase . economy on the mend notwithstanding the drastic fall in exports , the german economy emerged from recession during the second quarter of this year , much earlier than previously forecast .
ing bank economist carsten brzeski said germany 's economic performance in recent months was a positive sign for the future .
" for the near term , the outlook for the german economy looks bright .
it has the potential to lead europe out of the recession , " he said .
however , the rollout of extensive stimulus packages designed to help the country out of the crisis , has left gaping holes in the national budget .
since the beginning of the year , germany has built up a deficit of over 17 billion euros , compared to a budget surplus of seven billion euros during the same period last year .
this amounts to around 1.5 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- – well within the three percent limit for the 16 countries that use europe 's common currency , the euro. glb / rb / dpa / reuters / afp editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and both have said they do n't want to continue this uneasy union .
failing a large enough majority to rule alone , they 'd each rather pick a smaller party to govern with . for chancellor merkel 's cdu the partner-of-choice is the pro-business fdp , while frank-walter steinmeier 's spd would pick the greens for their electoral pas-de-deux .
but what about the far-left left party , poised to become a vocal opposition to whoever will make it to the chancellery ? dw-world.de angela merkel : from shy physicist to re-elected stateswoman just ahead of german elections , the polls are heavily favoring the reelection of chancellor angela merkel .

as the fabled northeast passage comes a step closer to reality , some say it may end up a road seldom traveled . the two vessels successfully navigated the narrow strip of water off russia 's northern coast last week . the vessels had delivered their cargo of heavy industrial equipment , loaded in south korea , to novy port in western siberia , and were now continuing their voyage to nigeria , where they were due to deliver a shipment of steel pipes picked up in the russian port of arkhangelsk , according to the beluga shipping company , which owns the vessels . the voyage only became possible because of climate change . melting arctic sea ice has opened the way for ships to navigate the arctic waters and avoid the icebergs , floes and pack ice that have confounded previous attempts to use the route for trade . the arctic 's sea ice thawed to its third-lowest level on record this summer .
on sept .
12 , it covered around 5.1 million square kilometers -lrb- 2 million square miles -rrb- - around a million square kilometers more than in 2007 , which had the lowest coverage since records began some 30 years ago . the beluga fraternity and beluga foresight are the first western commercial ships to transit the northeast passage successfully , according to the bremen-based shipping company . until now , only parts of the route have been navigable at any given time , and they were only used by russian shipping companies .
the fraternity and foresight were accompanied by russian icebreakers , but never needed to call upon them for assistance . despite the fact that the trip took a long time to clear with russian authorities , who demanded large fees in return for their approval , the beluga shipping company said it was satisfied with the trip . " we have saved not only voyage time - around 10 days , worth around $ 200,000 - but also , we 've been able to save fossil fuels in the amount of around 200 tons per ship , and at a cost of around $ 90,000 , " said company spokesperson verena beckhusen . bildunterschrift : the northeast passage could shave some 5,400 km off some traditional routes time is money but savings in time and cash are n't likely to unleash an armada of merchant shipping on the arctic . the route is only practical for european trade with northeast asia , a fraction of the region 's total volume .
furthermore , only certain kinds of cargo will be worth sending via the northeast passage , said max johns , spokesperson for the german ship owners association . " container ships will always take the southern route because there are many more ports , " he said .
" container ships work a little bit like buses in a city .
they have to go from port to port and collect and deliver containers in every possible port otherwise it is not worthwhile running them . " the northeast passage makes most sense for specialist deliveries of heavy-lift cargo , or bulk quantities of commodities like coal , iron ore and oil , johns added . added complications , new attractions the passage is also only open for a six- to eight-week window each summer .
then there is the challenge of dealing with an expensive , and byzantine , russian bureaucracy : the beluga shipping company only won final approval for its voyage in august following an application process that took nearly a year . one underplayed aspect of beluga 's successful voyage is that it makes resource extraction in the region more attractive . " the extraction is the real attraction now when the ice melts , and especially russia has a very keen eye on that , " johns said .
" for us , as service providers , it may be interesting to transport that cargo to where it is being needed . " environmental hazard bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has been keen to stake its claim to parts of the arctic vast quantities of energy resources are believed to be located in the arctic .
with some countries already gearing up to exploit them , this is precisely the kind of cargo that concerns environmentalists most . " if there were an oil spill , either from shipping or from the extraction work which will also increase when the ice is going ... then combating it would be very difficult , " said ulrich claussen , who leads the german federal environment 's agency 's efforts to protect marine life . the cold and stormy weather conditions would complicate clean-up efforts from a technical point of view and would also hinder the region 's natural capacity to absorb damage , claussen added . " normally bacteria can degrade the oil , but the colder it is the less active bacteria normally are , " he said .
" there might be a very slow reaction from the environment .
in alaska , where the spill from the exxon valdez was , we can still see some signs of non-recovery now . " the beluga shipping company , however , is already planning another voyage through the northeastern passage for next year .
next year 's trip , again on behalf of general electric , will be an even bigger exercise , requiring ships around double the size of the fraternity and foresight . nathan witkop editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he tells politicians there are better ways to spend billions than on fighting climate change . the author of " the skeptical environmentalist , " bjorn lomborg , has had public disagreements with climate activists including al gore and sir nicholas stern .
lomborg 's harshest criticism , however , is aimed at the international community for spending billions on what he says are ineffective measures intended to fight climate change . he talked to deutsche welle about ongoing climate negotiations and how economists at the copenhagen consensus center , a think tank he heads , suggest spending aid and development money . deutsche welle : what do you think will emerge from the climate talks taking place at the united nations on tuesday ? bjorn lomborg : first of all , i think it 's important to recognize that probably nothing will come out of this , simply because they are so far away from the different nations on what they want to achieve . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lomborg , a danish statistician , questions environmental orthodoxy it 's always good to talk about the problem , and i think it 's good to reaffirm to everybody that we need a deal in copenhagen by the end of this year .
the problem is the focus on cutting carbon emissions is actually one that both makes it very hard for everyone to agree because the chinese and the indians do n't want to cut and while the europeans and the americans claim they want to cut , they actually also know that it 's going to cost them a lot , and it 's going to have very little benefit even in the far-off future .
that 's why they are all playing for the gallery but nobody is actually willing to really commit . the chinese leader has said he will present china 's new plans for tackling global warming at the summit .
is n't that a positive signal ? it could be .
but let 's remember that the chinese have been doing a lot of posturing on climate change and coming out and suggesting that we might even see china 's emissions maxing out in 2050 or maybe even in 2040 .
but let 's not base our hopes for a climate deal on things that will happen in 20 or 40 years . if you had to give tips to the participants , what would you advise them to talk about ? we 've run what we call the copenhagen consensus for climate , where we ask top economists , including three nobel laureates " where do you do the most good for climate with the money you 're going to be spending ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could salt particulates help cool the earth in the short-term ?
what they told us was do n't focus on cutting carbon emissions .
it 's very expensive and does very little good for the climate even 100 years from now .
in the short and medium-term , we should recognize that nothing we do will change the temperature development except looking into geo-engineering , essentially making the planet cooler - for instance by spraying up salt particulates in the atmosphere , which will amplify natural processes , make more white clouds and hence make the world a little more reflective - especially over the south pacific .
that would be very cheap and could potentially avoid global warming for the next 100 years . this is still a band-aid , so what you also need to do is more toward a situation where we can actually get people to not just talk about cutting carbon emissions but actually doing so , and we will only do that if cutting carbon emissions and green energy technologies become much , much cheaper .
that 's why their second solution was to focus on making much cheaper green energy technologies - cheaper solar panels , cheaper windmills - that will actually work . those two in conjunction is what i would like to see world leaders focus on a lot more , if we actually care about fixing climate change not just making beautiful speeches . at the moment we also have to concentrate on adaptation to climate change .
its effects are already becoming very visible .
where would your priorities lie in that area ? i 'm referring to top economists , rather than my own private opinions .
what they found is we are very often being told that there is a huge amount of impacts from climate change right now , and it 's certainly true that there are a lot of good pictures out there where you can show here 's a catastrophe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lomborg says poverty impacts people 's lives more than climate change but what we fail to recognize is that the vast majority of the impact that we are seeing right now - climate impacts and other impacts - are impacts that have been there for hundreds of years .
most of this world 's population is poor and they 're ill-prepared to deal with any contingency that the world throws at them .
what we need to focus on is not just adaption specifically for climate change , which is a small part of the problems most people live with right now , but simply making better lives for people that is focusing on getting them more food , getting them better healthcare and making sure their kids get educated . the world 's doctors have said failure to tackle climate change in copenhagen could be catastrophic for health .
is it possible to separate climate change from issues like health , food security or a safe water supply ? we do n't need to separate them in the sense that we probably all agree we should tackle some of the really big problems that are out there right now .
i 'm simply concerned that many people latch on to talking about global warming and that the most important this is spending money on adaptation to global warming . but the main problem in bangladesh or myanmar is not future sea-level rises , it 's the fact that the countries are so poor right now that they are already getting inundated .
it 's not about climate-proofing it in 100 years , it 's about dealing with the vulnerability to climate right now , which has nothing to do with climate change but simply something to do with them being very poor . it 's more about an emphasis on focusing where you can actually deal with real problems right now rather than a possible problem in 100 years . interview : irene quaile -lrb- sms -rrb- editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

greece took in almost 6.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.25 billion -rrb- more from the eu 's budget than it paid into it in 2008 , according to the commission .
the bulk of that money came in payments to greek farmers and in eu funding for infrastructure projects such as highways and ports .
greece was far ahead of eu newcomer poland in the eu 's net handouts list .
poland 's net income from the eu 's budget actually fell by some three-quarters of a billion euros to 4.4 billion euros last year .
the drop owed largely to a reduction in eu payments to polish farmers .
observers say this is likely to provoke heated comments from warsaw , which has frequently accused the eu of treating the countries that joined in 2004 and 2007 less generously than older member states .
german payments hit historic highs at the other end of the scale , germany , the eu 's biggest member , paid almost 8.8 billion euros more into the budget than it received .
this marks the biggest contribution by the country in the last 10 years .
germany 's payment amounts to more than double that of the next biggest contributors , italy and france , which paid around a net 4 billion euros to the fund each .
the three countries are , however , far ahead of the eu 's other heavyweight , britain , whose net contribution fell from over 4 billion euros in 2007 to under 1 billion euros in 2008 .
in terms of absolute receipts , france maintained its position as the largest recipient of eu funds , ahead of spain , germany and italy .
britain , the eu 's third-largest economy , was only the seventh-largest recipient of funding .
the news comes as the the european commission is drawing up plans to reform the bloc 's budgetary process in a move that analysts say will likely spark a rancorous debate between countries which receive the most money from the bloc and those who pay the most into it. rb / dpa / reuters editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hainer played in attack , while zeitz was goalkeeper .
the game was meant to bring a symbolic end to one of germany 's most infamous family feuds , which began in 1948 when a row between brothers rudolf and adolf dassler split the family sportswear business , already a major supplier in the field , into two camps .
rudolf founded puma in 1948 , while adolf , or adi , dassler founded adidas in 1949 .
their rivalry divided the dasslers ' home town of 23,000 people , where competing factories were built on opposite sides of the aurach river .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adidas provides the soccer balls for the world cup skeletons in the sportswear closet there are plenty of rumors about the cause of the split , including the story that rudolf had an affair with adolf 's wife kaethe in 1940 .
monday 's football match was the first conciliatory gesture between the two companies , even though neither has belonged to the dassler family for years .
both companies have become international leaders in the sportswear field , with puma signing a sponsorship deal with record-breaking sprinter usain bolt .
for its part , adidas recently extended its partnership with the football organization uefa , providing equipment for all international football tournaments until 2017 .
according to the german financial newspaper handelsblatt , adidas is currently the second biggest sportswear manufacturer in the world behind nike , while puma is third .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de france -pipe- 22.09.2009 french police evacuate calais migrant camp großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : officials say the camp has increasingly unsavory conditions riot police have launched an operation at a camp near calais to force the remaining migrants – up to 300 afghan males – to leave .
the migrants , meanwhile , are pleading with french authorities for shelter and protection . the operation began at dawn in the tent city , located on a patch of sandy scrubland in the channel port of calais .
with camera crews flooding the scene at " the jungle , " riot police detained 278 migrants in the raid , a top state official confirmed .
the migrants were then loaded into buses .
the french immigration ministry has said it will close the camp by the end of the week .
but it has also promised to find an " individual solution " for each migrant .
" there wo n't be any forced returns to unsafe conditions , " said immigration minister eric besson .
" whether a voluntary return home , an asylum request , or explusion , we will deal with each migrant on an individual basis . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the migrants say they have no where else to go last remaining migrants thousands of migrants from afghanistan , iraq , and other troubled parts of the world have made the voyage to calais over the last ten years .
of these , most have now ventured on to other places in europe - like britain , belgium , holland , and norway .
workers for the several aid groups in calais say those who remain in the ' jungle ' have no where else to go .
" those still here are mostly minors who can not be deported , or others who simply do n't have the money or connections to leave , " said vincent lenoir , of the salam migrant support group .
one of the migrants , bashir , a 24-year-old english teacher from northern afghanistan , paid $ 15,000 -lrb- 10,000 euros -rrb- to make the trip via pakistan and istanbul .
" we have no idea what the police will do , if they will take us or let us go free , but here we already made our place .
here we have our houses , our showers and our mosque , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : calais residents have been repulsed by the squalor of the jungle locals outraged by camp but government officials say the " jungle " has become a no-go zone for locals , and squalid conditions have been blamed for a recent outbreak of scabies .
city officials also support the police operation , saying the situation has become unbearable .
french authorities operated a center for migrants at sangatte , near calais , but closed it in 2002 because of crime and accusations from london that it was acting as a magnet for migrants headed for britain .
the french government says it is determined to stop illegal immigrants from entering the country , which it says is part of its stand against the practice of human trafficking .
paris says it has planned several spike operations – like this one in calais – to be carried out in the near future. glb / afp / reuters editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : the long road to copenhagen experts express little optimism ahead of copenhagen summit brown , sarkozy propose multi-billion-dollar climate fund for poor nations hacker scandal sends ripples through climate-science community world leaders favor delaying a binding climate change deal climate -pipe- 22.09.2009 cutting carbon emissions wo n't stop climate change , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lomborg says the world faces more pressing problems than emissions as world leaders meet at the un to discuss climate change , bjorn lomborg tells dw he expects little to come from the talks .
he tells politicians there are better ways to spend billions than on fighting climate change . the author of " the skeptical environmentalist , " bjorn lomborg , has had public disagreements with climate activists including al gore and sir nicholas stern .
lomborg 's harshest criticism , however , is aimed at the international community for spending billions on what he says are ineffective measures intended to fight climate change . he talked to deutsche welle about ongoing climate negotiations and how economists at the copenhagen consensus center , a think tank he heads , suggest spending aid and development money . deutsche welle : what do you think will emerge from the climate talks taking place at the united nations on tuesday ? bjorn lomborg : first of all , i think it 's important to recognize that probably nothing will come out of this , simply because they are so far away from the different nations on what they want to achieve . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lomborg , a danish statistician , questions environmental orthodoxy it 's always good to talk about the problem , and i think it 's good to reaffirm to everybody that we need a deal in copenhagen by the end of this year .
the problem is the focus on cutting carbon emissions is actually one that both makes it very hard for everyone to agree because the chinese and the indians do n't want to cut and while the europeans and the americans claim they want to cut , they actually also know that it 's going to cost them a lot , and it 's going to have very little benefit even in the far-off future .
that 's why they are all playing for the gallery but nobody is actually willing to really commit . the chinese leader has said he will present china 's new plans for tackling global warming at the summit .
is n't that a positive signal ? it could be .
but let 's remember that the chinese have been doing a lot of posturing on climate change and coming out and suggesting that we might even see china 's emissions maxing out in 2050 or maybe even in 2040 .
but let 's not base our hopes for a climate deal on things that will happen in 20 or 40 years . if you had to give tips to the participants , what would you advise them to talk about ? we 've run what we call the copenhagen consensus for climate , where we ask top economists , including three nobel laureates " where do you do the most good for climate with the money you 're going to be spending ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could salt particulates help cool the earth in the short-term ?
what they told us was do n't focus on cutting carbon emissions .
it 's very expensive and does very little good for the climate even 100 years from now .
in the short and medium-term , we should recognize that nothing we do will change the temperature development except looking into geo-engineering , essentially making the planet cooler - for instance by spraying up salt particulates in the atmosphere , which will amplify natural processes , make more white clouds and hence make the world a little more reflective - especially over the south pacific .
that would be very cheap and could potentially avoid global warming for the next 100 years . this is still a band-aid , so what you also need to do is more toward a situation where we can actually get people to not just talk about cutting carbon emissions but actually doing so , and we will only do that if cutting carbon emissions and green energy technologies become much , much cheaper .
that 's why their second solution was to focus on making much cheaper green energy technologies - cheaper solar panels , cheaper windmills - that will actually work . those two in conjunction is what i would like to see world leaders focus on a lot more , if we actually care about fixing climate change not just making beautiful speeches . at the moment we also have to concentrate on adaptation to climate change .
its effects are already becoming very visible .
where would your priorities lie in that area ? i 'm referring to top economists , rather than my own private opinions .
what they found is we are very often being told that there is a huge amount of impacts from climate change right now , and it 's certainly true that there are a lot of good pictures out there where you can show here 's a catastrophe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lomborg says poverty impacts people 's lives more than climate change but what we fail to recognize is that the vast majority of the impact that we are seeing right now - climate impacts and other impacts - are impacts that have been there for hundreds of years .
most of this world 's population is poor and they 're ill-prepared to deal with any contingency that the world throws at them .
what we need to focus on is not just adaption specifically for climate change , which is a small part of the problems most people live with right now , but simply making better lives for people that is focusing on getting them more food , getting them better healthcare and making sure their kids get educated . the world 's doctors have said failure to tackle climate change in copenhagen could be catastrophic for health .
is it possible to separate climate change from issues like health , food security or a safe water supply ? we do n't need to separate them in the sense that we probably all agree we should tackle some of the really big problems that are out there right now .
i 'm simply concerned that many people latch on to talking about global warming and that the most important this is spending money on adaptation to global warming . but the main problem in bangladesh or myanmar is not future sea-level rises , it 's the fact that the countries are so poor right now that they are already getting inundated .
it 's not about climate-proofing it in 100 years , it 's about dealing with the vulnerability to climate right now , which has nothing to do with climate change but simply something to do with them being very poor . it 's more about an emphasis on focusing where you can actually deal with real problems right now rather than a possible problem in 100 years . interview : irene quaile -lrb- sms -rrb- editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

greece took in almost 6.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.25 billion -rrb- more from the eu 's budget than it paid into it in 2008 , according to the commission .
the bulk of that money came in payments to greek farmers and in eu funding for infrastructure projects such as highways and ports .
greece was far ahead of eu newcomer poland in the eu 's net handouts list .
poland 's net income from the eu 's budget actually fell by some three-quarters of a billion euros to 4.4 billion euros last year .
the drop owed largely to a reduction in eu payments to polish farmers .
observers say this is likely to provoke heated comments from warsaw , which has frequently accused the eu of treating the countries that joined in 2004 and 2007 less generously than older member states .
german payments hit historic highs at the other end of the scale , germany , the eu 's biggest member , paid almost 8.8 billion euros more into the budget than it received .
this marks the biggest contribution by the country in the last 10 years .
germany 's payment amounts to more than double that of the next biggest contributors , italy and france , which paid around a net 4 billion euros to the fund each .
the three countries are , however , far ahead of the eu 's other heavyweight , britain , whose net contribution fell from over 4 billion euros in 2007 to under 1 billion euros in 2008 .
in terms of absolute receipts , france maintained its position as the largest recipient of eu funds , ahead of spain , germany and italy .
britain , the eu 's third-largest economy , was only the seventh-largest recipient of funding .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : the long road to copenhagen experts express little optimism ahead of copenhagen summit brown , sarkozy propose multi-billion-dollar climate fund for poor nations hacker scandal sends ripples through climate-science community world leaders favor delaying a binding climate change deal climate -pipe- 22.09.2009 cutting carbon emissions wo n't stop climate change , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lomborg says the world faces more pressing problems than emissions as world leaders meet at the un to discuss climate change , bjorn lomborg tells dw he expects little to come from the talks .
he tells politicians there are better ways to spend billions than on fighting climate change . the author of " the skeptical environmentalist , " bjorn lomborg , has had public disagreements with climate activists including al gore and sir nicholas stern .
lomborg 's harshest criticism , however , is aimed at the international community for spending billions on what he says are ineffective measures intended to fight climate change . he talked to deutsche welle about ongoing climate negotiations and how economists at the copenhagen consensus center , a think tank he heads , suggest spending aid and development money . deutsche welle : what do you think will emerge from the climate talks taking place at the united nations on tuesday ? bjorn lomborg : first of all , i think it 's important to recognize that probably nothing will come out of this , simply because they are so far away from the different nations on what they want to achieve . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lomborg , a danish statistician , questions environmental orthodoxy it 's always good to talk about the problem , and i think it 's good to reaffirm to everybody that we need a deal in copenhagen by the end of this year .
the problem is the focus on cutting carbon emissions is actually one that both makes it very hard for everyone to agree because the chinese and the indians do n't want to cut and while the europeans and the americans claim they want to cut , they actually also know that it 's going to cost them a lot , and it 's going to have very little benefit even in the far-off future .
that 's why they are all playing for the gallery but nobody is actually willing to really commit . the chinese leader has said he will present china 's new plans for tackling global warming at the summit .
is n't that a positive signal ? it could be .
but let 's remember that the chinese have been doing a lot of posturing on climate change and coming out and suggesting that we might even see china 's emissions maxing out in 2050 or maybe even in 2040 .
but let 's not base our hopes for a climate deal on things that will happen in 20 or 40 years . if you had to give tips to the participants , what would you advise them to talk about ? we 've run what we call the copenhagen consensus for climate , where we ask top economists , including three nobel laureates " where do you do the most good for climate with the money you 're going to be spending ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could salt particulates help cool the earth in the short-term ?
what they told us was do n't focus on cutting carbon emissions .
it 's very expensive and does very little good for the climate even 100 years from now .
in the short and medium-term , we should recognize that nothing we do will change the temperature development except looking into geo-engineering , essentially making the planet cooler - for instance by spraying up salt particulates in the atmosphere , which will amplify natural processes , make more white clouds and hence make the world a little more reflective - especially over the south pacific .
that would be very cheap and could potentially avoid global warming for the next 100 years . this is still a band-aid , so what you also need to do is more toward a situation where we can actually get people to not just talk about cutting carbon emissions but actually doing so , and we will only do that if cutting carbon emissions and green energy technologies become much , much cheaper .
that 's why their second solution was to focus on making much cheaper green energy technologies - cheaper solar panels , cheaper windmills - that will actually work . those two in conjunction is what i would like to see world leaders focus on a lot more , if we actually care about fixing climate change not just making beautiful speeches . at the moment we also have to concentrate on adaptation to climate change .
its effects are already becoming very visible .
where would your priorities lie in that area ? i 'm referring to top economists , rather than my own private opinions .
what they found is we are very often being told that there is a huge amount of impacts from climate change right now , and it 's certainly true that there are a lot of good pictures out there where you can show here 's a catastrophe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lomborg says poverty impacts people 's lives more than climate change but what we fail to recognize is that the vast majority of the impact that we are seeing right now - climate impacts and other impacts - are impacts that have been there for hundreds of years .
most of this world 's population is poor and they 're ill-prepared to deal with any contingency that the world throws at them .
what we need to focus on is not just adaption specifically for climate change , which is a small part of the problems most people live with right now , but simply making better lives for people that is focusing on getting them more food , getting them better healthcare and making sure their kids get educated . the world 's doctors have said failure to tackle climate change in copenhagen could be catastrophic for health .
is it possible to separate climate change from issues like health , food security or a safe water supply ? we do n't need to separate them in the sense that we probably all agree we should tackle some of the really big problems that are out there right now .
i 'm simply concerned that many people latch on to talking about global warming and that the most important this is spending money on adaptation to global warming . but the main problem in bangladesh or myanmar is not future sea-level rises , it 's the fact that the countries are so poor right now that they are already getting inundated .
it 's not about climate-proofing it in 100 years , it 's about dealing with the vulnerability to climate right now , which has nothing to do with climate change but simply something to do with them being very poor . it 's more about an emphasis on focusing where you can actually deal with real problems right now rather than a possible problem in 100 years . interview : irene quaile -lrb- sms -rrb- editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the bulk of that money came in payments to greek farmers and in eu funding for infrastructure projects such as highways and ports .
greece was far ahead of eu newcomer poland in the eu 's net handouts list .
poland 's net income from the eu 's budget actually fell by some three-quarters of a billion euros to 4.4 billion euros last year .
the drop owed largely to a reduction in eu payments to polish farmers .
observers say this is likely to provoke heated comments from warsaw , which has frequently accused the eu of treating the countries that joined in 2004 and 2007 less generously than older member states .
german payments hit historic highs at the other end of the scale , germany , the eu 's biggest member , paid almost 8.8 billion euros more into the budget than it received .
this marks the biggest contribution by the country in the last 10 years .
germany 's payment amounts to more than double that of the next biggest contributors , italy and france , which paid around a net 4 billion euros to the fund each .
the three countries are , however , far ahead of the eu 's other heavyweight , britain , whose net contribution fell from over 4 billion euros in 2007 to under 1 billion euros in 2008 .
in terms of absolute receipts , france maintained its position as the largest recipient of eu funds , ahead of spain , germany and italy .
britain , the eu 's third-largest economy , was only the seventh-largest recipient of funding .
the news comes as the the european commission is drawing up plans to reform the bloc 's budgetary process in a move that analysts say will likely spark a rancorous debate between countries which receive the most money from the bloc and those who pay the most into it. rb / dpa / reuters editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the camp was used as a base for risky attempts to reach britain . britain 's home secretary alan johnson said the action taken in calais would " disrupt illegal immigration and people-trafficking routes . "
french police cleared and then bulldozed the makeshift forest camp - known as the " jungle " - near the northern city of calais on tuesday morning .
" i welcome the swift and decisive steps that the french government has taken today to close the " jungle " in calais , " johnson said .
the prefect of the region told journalists after the two-hour operation that 278 migrants had been taken into custody , nearly half of them minors .
the adults were temporarily jailed , while the minors were placed in " specialized centers , " he said .
the immigrants , mostly afghans , had hoped to travel the 35 kilometers across the english channel into britain .
an end to criminal trafficking the operation by hundreds of police officers was the final step in a months-long undertaking by the french government to remove the camp .
britain and france had agreed earlier this year to step up efforts against illegal migrants by strengthening border security with state-of-the-art technology and closer cooperation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : besson warned of more raids to come on nearby squatter camps france 's immigration minister eric besson told rtl radio that the dismantling of the camp was justified , calling the site a " base camp for human traffickers . "
the police operation " targeted the tools of the criminal gangs who sell migrants passage to britain , exploit them and have them living in what had become an open air garbage dump , " he said .
besson said that each migrant would be offered an " individual solution " and given the choice to leave voluntarily , apply for asylum or be forcibly deported .
aid groups predict , though , that many of the immigrants will simply end up back on the streets .
" they are going to be scattered across the countryside , at the mercy of traffickers , " said jean-claude lenoir of the salam migrant support group .
" at least here , the young people had built a kind of community .
it 's tragic . "
problem of illegal immigration continues the un refugee agency unhcr said it recognized the need to combat smuggling and trafficking of persons and the right of the french government to maintain public order .
" closing the so-called jungle camp does , however , not address the phenomenon of mixed and irregular migration , nor does it solve the problems of the people concerned , amongst whom there may be many with protection needs , " unhcr spokesman andrej mahecic said at a press briefing in geneva on tuesday .
bildunterschrift : the migrants had gathered before their evacuation to demonstrate their plight unhcr called on the french authorities to ensure that those who wish to apply for refugee protection were given access to " a full and fair asylum procedure , " mahecic said .
" the situation in calais underscores , once again , the need for governments in europe to intensify efforts to arrive at a common european asylum system , not only on paper , but also in practice , " he said .

french police cleared and then bulldozed the makeshift forest camp - known as the " jungle " - near the northern city of calais on tuesday morning .
" i welcome the swift and decisive steps that the french government has taken today to close the " jungle " in calais , " johnson said .
the prefect of the region told journalists after the two-hour operation that 278 migrants had been taken into custody , nearly half of them minors .
the adults were temporarily jailed , while the minors were placed in " specialized centers , " he said .
the immigrants , mostly afghans , had hoped to travel the 35 kilometers across the english channel into britain .
an end to criminal trafficking the operation by hundreds of police officers was the final step in a months-long undertaking by the french government to remove the camp .
britain and france had agreed earlier this year to step up efforts against illegal migrants by strengthening border security with state-of-the-art technology and closer cooperation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : besson warned of more raids to come on nearby squatter camps france 's immigration minister eric besson told rtl radio that the dismantling of the camp was justified , calling the site a " base camp for human traffickers . "
the police operation " targeted the tools of the criminal gangs who sell migrants passage to britain , exploit them and have them living in what had become an open air garbage dump , " he said .
besson said that each migrant would be offered an " individual solution " and given the choice to leave voluntarily , apply for asylum or be forcibly deported .
aid groups predict , though , that many of the immigrants will simply end up back on the streets .
" they are going to be scattered across the countryside , at the mercy of traffickers , " said jean-claude lenoir of the salam migrant support group .

problem of illegal immigration continues the un refugee agency unhcr said it recognized the need to combat smuggling and trafficking of persons and the right of the french government to maintain public order .
" closing the so-called jungle camp does , however , not address the phenomenon of mixed and irregular migration , nor does it solve the problems of the people concerned , amongst whom there may be many with protection needs , " unhcr spokesman andrej mahecic said at a press briefing in geneva on tuesday .
bildunterschrift : the migrants had gathered before their evacuation to demonstrate their plight unhcr called on the french authorities to ensure that those who wish to apply for refugee protection were given access to " a full and fair asylum procedure , " mahecic said .
" the situation in calais underscores , once again , the need for governments in europe to intensify efforts to arrive at a common european asylum system , not only on paper , but also in practice , " he said .
besson said the calais crisis was partly caused by the lack of a coherent european union migration policy .

hainer played in attack , while zeitz was goalkeeper .
the game was meant to bring a symbolic end to one of germany 's most infamous family feuds , which began in 1948 when a row between brothers rudolf and adolf dassler split the family sportswear business , already a major supplier in the field , into two camps .
rudolf founded puma in 1948 , while adolf , or adi , dassler founded adidas in 1949 .

monday 's football match was the first conciliatory gesture between the two companies , even though neither has belonged to the dassler family for years .
both companies have become international leaders in the sportswear field , with puma signing a sponsorship deal with record-breaking sprinter usain bolt .

ciulli rejected the demand .
" this is not an anti-semitic piece , but one that addresses the subject of anti-semitism , " he said , stressing the " autonomy of theatric art . "
he stressed that the play would premiere , as planned , on october 1 at his theater in the western germany city of muelheim .
it is slated to be one of three works by fassbinder to be shown in a three-hour evening performance set .

jewish groups said the play revived stereotypes of jews , with one main character being a " rich jew " who amasses great wealth through property speculation .
in the piece , the man regularly visits a prostitute , whose father was a nazi during the third reich and co-responsible for the decimation of jews .
the prostitute becomes an object for the jew 's revenge ; her murder is ultimately covered up by the police .
murder , brutal homosexuality and sexual and psychic perversions are all part of the play , which was written in 1975 .
the " usual cliches " the central council of jews said the play presented characters " as stereotypes burdened with the usual cliches , " and said the piece should not be staged " out of respect for the small number of holocaust survivors and the millions who died . "

another attempt to stage the play in berlin 13 years later was likewise abandoned .
this is not the first time works by the late fassbinder have unnerved audiences .
the writer and director is known for his socially critical works , and is most famous for his film " the marriage of maria braun . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de france -pipe- 22.09.2009 french police evacuate calais migrant camp großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : officials say the camp has increasingly unsavory conditions riot police have launched an operation at a camp near calais to force the remaining migrants – up to 300 afghan males – to leave .
the migrants , meanwhile , are pleading with french authorities for shelter and protection . the operation began at dawn in the tent city , located on a patch of sandy scrubland in the channel port of calais .
with camera crews flooding the scene at " the jungle , " riot police detained 278 migrants in the raid , a top state official confirmed .
the migrants were then loaded into buses .
the french immigration ministry has said it will close the camp by the end of the week .
but it has also promised to find an " individual solution " for each migrant .
" there wo n't be any forced returns to unsafe conditions , " said immigration minister eric besson .
" whether a voluntary return home , an asylum request , or explusion , we will deal with each migrant on an individual basis . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the migrants say they have no where else to go last remaining migrants thousands of migrants from afghanistan , iraq , and other troubled parts of the world have made the voyage to calais over the last ten years .
of these , most have now ventured on to other places in europe - like britain , belgium , holland , and norway .
workers for the several aid groups in calais say those who remain in the ' jungle ' have no where else to go .
" those still here are mostly minors who can not be deported , or others who simply do n't have the money or connections to leave , " said vincent lenoir , of the salam migrant support group .
one of the migrants , bashir , a 24-year-old english teacher from northern afghanistan , paid $ 15,000 -lrb- 10,000 euros -rrb- to make the trip via pakistan and istanbul .
" we have no idea what the police will do , if they will take us or let us go free , but here we already made our place .
here we have our houses , our showers and our mosque , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : calais residents have been repulsed by the squalor of the jungle locals outraged by camp but government officials say the " jungle " has become a no-go zone for locals , and squalid conditions have been blamed for a recent outbreak of scabies .
city officials also support the police operation , saying the situation has become unbearable .
french authorities operated a center for migrants at sangatte , near calais , but closed it in 2002 because of crime and accusations from london that it was acting as a magnet for migrants headed for britain .
the french government says it is determined to stop illegal immigrants from entering the country , which it says is part of its stand against the practice of human trafficking .
paris says it has planned several spike operations – like this one in calais – to be carried out in the near future. glb / afp / reuters editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

failing a large enough majority to rule alone , they 'd each rather pick a smaller party to govern with . for chancellor merkel 's cdu the partner-of-choice is the pro-business fdp , while frank-walter steinmeier 's spd would pick the greens for their electoral pas-de-deux .
but what about the far-left left party , poised to become a vocal opposition to whoever will make it to the chancellery ? dw-world.de angela merkel : from shy physicist to re-elected stateswoman just ahead of german elections , the polls are heavily favoring the reelection of chancellor angela merkel .

-lrb- 24.08.2009 -rrb- the free democrats : kingmakers in waiting ?
thrust into the position of germany 's opposition party by default , the liberal , pro-business free democrats have been slowly gaining ground on their much larger political rivals and could soon be in power once again .
-lrb- 25.08.2009 -rrb- the green party : getting used to opposition having spent seven years in government with the social democratic party , the greens had to use the last legislature creating a meaningful opposition to its former partner .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de france -pipe- 22.09.2009 french police evacuate calais migrant camp großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : officials say the camp has increasingly unsavory conditions riot police have launched an operation at a camp near calais to force the remaining migrants – up to 300 afghan males – to leave .
the migrants , meanwhile , are pleading with french authorities for shelter and protection . the operation began at dawn in the tent city , located on a patch of sandy scrubland in the channel port of calais .
with camera crews flooding the scene at " the jungle , " riot police detained 278 migrants in the raid , a top state official confirmed .
the migrants were then loaded into buses .
the french immigration ministry has said it will close the camp by the end of the week .
but it has also promised to find an " individual solution " for each migrant .
" there wo n't be any forced returns to unsafe conditions , " said immigration minister eric besson .
" whether a voluntary return home , an asylum request , or explusion , we will deal with each migrant on an individual basis . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the migrants say they have no where else to go last remaining migrants thousands of migrants from afghanistan , iraq , and other troubled parts of the world have made the voyage to calais over the last ten years .
of these , most have now ventured on to other places in europe - like britain , belgium , holland , and norway .
workers for the several aid groups in calais say those who remain in the ' jungle ' have no where else to go .
" those still here are mostly minors who can not be deported , or others who simply do n't have the money or connections to leave , " said vincent lenoir , of the salam migrant support group .
one of the migrants , bashir , a 24-year-old english teacher from northern afghanistan , paid $ 15,000 -lrb- 10,000 euros -rrb- to make the trip via pakistan and istanbul .
" we have no idea what the police will do , if they will take us or let us go free , but here we already made our place .
here we have our houses , our showers and our mosque , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : calais residents have been repulsed by the squalor of the jungle locals outraged by camp but government officials say the " jungle " has become a no-go zone for locals , and squalid conditions have been blamed for a recent outbreak of scabies .
city officials also support the police operation , saying the situation has become unbearable .
french authorities operated a center for migrants at sangatte , near calais , but closed it in 2002 because of crime and accusations from london that it was acting as a magnet for migrants headed for britain .
the french government says it is determined to stop illegal immigrants from entering the country , which it says is part of its stand against the practice of human trafficking .
paris says it has planned several spike operations – like this one in calais – to be carried out in the near future. glb / afp / reuters editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not all of them .
a quirk in the german electoral process awards larger parties a disproportionate number of parliamentary seats .
that increases the size of parliament and could give the cdu a decisive advantage in the coming vote . germany 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have repeated their warning that a new coalition led by chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- would be " illegitimate " if it were dependent upon winning additional seats that are awarded through an anomaly of the country 's election laws .
germans elect their representatives in a complicated process .
it involves dividing up the 598 seats in the bundestag , or parliament , into two groups , which are filled using two votes .
the first vote is for an actual candidate : each electoral district has candidates from one or several parties that campaign for a seat .
these seats are handed out in a simple , first-past-the-post majority , a system that often places smaller parties at a disadvantage .
two-vote system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier derided a coalition won on overhang seats the other 299 seats are allocated based on the second vote , which is for a party .
the votes of the 62 million germans eligible to take part in the election are added up and then divided by the number of parties .
those seats are then handed out to the people each party has put on a list , which is divided up among all 16 german states .
an example : in 2005 the conservative cdu and its bavarian sister party the csu took 35.2 percent of the vote for parties .
but 150 of their candidates were elected directly .
under german electoral law , if a party wins more direct seats than they would be entitled to under the votes cast for the party lists , then they are allowed to keep those extra seats and the total number in the bundestag simply goes up .
this is known as the ueberhangmandate , or " overhang seats . "
thus , the conservatives were awarded 246 parliamentary seats - some five percent more than the proportion of the party votes cast for them . if we take a local example , we see that the cdu won 31 out of 35 districts in the state of baden-wuerttemberg , which means they were entitled to 31 seats .
however , when its share of the second vote was tallied , it was actually only supposed to get 28 of the state 's 74 seats , meaning it got three extra seats .
at the moment , there are 611 seats in the bundestag , which include the 13 overhang seats that were created by the 2005 election .
the amount of overhang seats is determined anew by each election .
last week , merkel sparked debate by saying she was prepared to form a government with a coalition whose majority was based purely on these additional seats .
' not a second-class mandate ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to merkel , any win is a good win " a mandate based on overhang seats is no second class mandate , " the chancellor said during a press conference .
the spd 's parliamentary leader thomas oppermann responded that , if this were to happen , " for the first time in germany there would be a government which the voters did n't choose and did n't want . "
normally , this is n't a big deal .
back in 2005 it was n't enough to give the cdu anything close to a clear majority and they were forced to form a grand coalition with the spd .
however , in 1994 the cdu was granted 12 extra overhang seats , allowing helmut kohl to maintain his position as chancellor. mrm / dpa / reuters / afp editor : tony dunham send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 22.09.2009 german voting anomaly is center of latest election debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how many of these seats were actually voted for ?
not all of them .
a quirk in the german electoral process awards larger parties a disproportionate number of parliamentary seats .
that increases the size of parliament and could give the cdu a decisive advantage in the coming vote . germany 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have repeated their warning that a new coalition led by chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- would be " illegitimate " if it were dependent upon winning additional seats that are awarded through an anomaly of the country 's election laws .
germans elect their representatives in a complicated process .
it involves dividing up the 598 seats in the bundestag , or parliament , into two groups , which are filled using two votes .
the first vote is for an actual candidate : each electoral district has candidates from one or several parties that campaign for a seat .
these seats are handed out in a simple , first-past-the-post majority , a system that often places smaller parties at a disadvantage .
two-vote system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier derided a coalition won on overhang seats the other 299 seats are allocated based on the second vote , which is for a party .
the votes of the 62 million germans eligible to take part in the election are added up and then divided by the number of parties .
those seats are then handed out to the people each party has put on a list , which is divided up among all 16 german states .
an example : in 2005 the conservative cdu and its bavarian sister party the csu took 35.2 percent of the vote for parties .
but 150 of their candidates were elected directly .
under german electoral law , if a party wins more direct seats than they would be entitled to under the votes cast for the party lists , then they are allowed to keep those extra seats and the total number in the bundestag simply goes up .
this is known as the ueberhangmandate , or " overhang seats . "
thus , the conservatives were awarded 246 parliamentary seats - some five percent more than the proportion of the party votes cast for them . if we take a local example , we see that the cdu won 31 out of 35 districts in the state of baden-wuerttemberg , which means they were entitled to 31 seats .
however , when its share of the second vote was tallied , it was actually only supposed to get 28 of the state 's 74 seats , meaning it got three extra seats .
at the moment , there are 611 seats in the bundestag , which include the 13 overhang seats that were created by the 2005 election .
the amount of overhang seats is determined anew by each election .
last week , merkel sparked debate by saying she was prepared to form a government with a coalition whose majority was based purely on these additional seats .
' not a second-class mandate ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to merkel , any win is a good win " a mandate based on overhang seats is no second class mandate , " the chancellor said during a press conference .
the spd 's parliamentary leader thomas oppermann responded that , if this were to happen , " for the first time in germany there would be a government which the voters did n't choose and did n't want . "
normally , this is n't a big deal .
back in 2005 it was n't enough to give the cdu anything close to a clear majority and they were forced to form a grand coalition with the spd .
however , in 1994 the cdu was granted 12 extra overhang seats , allowing helmut kohl to maintain his position as chancellor. mrm / dpa / reuters / afp editor : tony dunham send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 22.09.2009 german freighters blaze trail through arctic großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mv beluga foresight did n't need to call on its ice-breaking escort two german freighters have successfully travelled from asia to europe via the arctic waters above russia .
as the fabled northeast passage comes a step closer to reality , some say it may end up a road seldom traveled . the two vessels successfully navigated the narrow strip of water off russia 's northern coast last week . the vessels had delivered their cargo of heavy industrial equipment , loaded in south korea , to novy port in western siberia , and were now continuing their voyage to nigeria , where they were due to deliver a shipment of steel pipes picked up in the russian port of arkhangelsk , according to the beluga shipping company , which owns the vessels . the voyage only became possible because of climate change . melting arctic sea ice has opened the way for ships to navigate the arctic waters and avoid the icebergs , floes and pack ice that have confounded previous attempts to use the route for trade . the arctic 's sea ice thawed to its third-lowest level on record this summer .
on sept .
12 , it covered around 5.1 million square kilometers -lrb- 2 million square miles -rrb- - around a million square kilometers more than in 2007 , which had the lowest coverage since records began some 30 years ago . the beluga fraternity and beluga foresight are the first western commercial ships to transit the northeast passage successfully , according to the bremen-based shipping company . until now , only parts of the route have been navigable at any given time , and they were only used by russian shipping companies .
the fraternity and foresight were accompanied by russian icebreakers , but never needed to call upon them for assistance . despite the fact that the trip took a long time to clear with russian authorities , who demanded large fees in return for their approval , the beluga shipping company said it was satisfied with the trip . " we have saved not only voyage time - around 10 days , worth around $ 200,000 - but also , we 've been able to save fossil fuels in the amount of around 200 tons per ship , and at a cost of around $ 90,000 , " said company spokesperson verena beckhusen . bildunterschrift : the northeast passage could shave some 5,400 km off some traditional routes time is money but savings in time and cash are n't likely to unleash an armada of merchant shipping on the arctic . the route is only practical for european trade with northeast asia , a fraction of the region 's total volume .
furthermore , only certain kinds of cargo will be worth sending via the northeast passage , said max johns , spokesperson for the german ship owners association . " container ships will always take the southern route because there are many more ports , " he said .
" container ships work a little bit like buses in a city .
they have to go from port to port and collect and deliver containers in every possible port otherwise it is not worthwhile running them . " the northeast passage makes most sense for specialist deliveries of heavy-lift cargo , or bulk quantities of commodities like coal , iron ore and oil , johns added . added complications , new attractions the passage is also only open for a six- to eight-week window each summer .
then there is the challenge of dealing with an expensive , and byzantine , russian bureaucracy : the beluga shipping company only won final approval for its voyage in august following an application process that took nearly a year . one underplayed aspect of beluga 's successful voyage is that it makes resource extraction in the region more attractive . " the extraction is the real attraction now when the ice melts , and especially russia has a very keen eye on that , " johns said .
" for us , as service providers , it may be interesting to transport that cargo to where it is being needed . " environmental hazard bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has been keen to stake its claim to parts of the arctic vast quantities of energy resources are believed to be located in the arctic .
with some countries already gearing up to exploit them , this is precisely the kind of cargo that concerns environmentalists most . " if there were an oil spill , either from shipping or from the extraction work which will also increase when the ice is going ... then combating it would be very difficult , " said ulrich claussen , who leads the german federal environment 's agency 's efforts to protect marine life . the cold and stormy weather conditions would complicate clean-up efforts from a technical point of view and would also hinder the region 's natural capacity to absorb damage , claussen added . " normally bacteria can degrade the oil , but the colder it is the less active bacteria normally are , " he said .
" there might be a very slow reaction from the environment .

as the fabled northeast passage comes a step closer to reality , some say it may end up a road seldom traveled . the two vessels successfully navigated the narrow strip of water off russia 's northern coast last week . the vessels had delivered their cargo of heavy industrial equipment , loaded in south korea , to novy port in western siberia , and were now continuing their voyage to nigeria , where they were due to deliver a shipment of steel pipes picked up in the russian port of arkhangelsk , according to the beluga shipping company , which owns the vessels . the voyage only became possible because of climate change . melting arctic sea ice has opened the way for ships to navigate the arctic waters and avoid the icebergs , floes and pack ice that have confounded previous attempts to use the route for trade . the arctic 's sea ice thawed to its third-lowest level on record this summer .
on sept .
12 , it covered around 5.1 million square kilometers -lrb- 2 million square miles -rrb- - around a million square kilometers more than in 2007 , which had the lowest coverage since records began some 30 years ago . the beluga fraternity and beluga foresight are the first western commercial ships to transit the northeast passage successfully , according to the bremen-based shipping company . until now , only parts of the route have been navigable at any given time , and they were only used by russian shipping companies .
the fraternity and foresight were accompanied by russian icebreakers , but never needed to call upon them for assistance . despite the fact that the trip took a long time to clear with russian authorities , who demanded large fees in return for their approval , the beluga shipping company said it was satisfied with the trip . " we have saved not only voyage time - around 10 days , worth around $ 200,000 - but also , we 've been able to save fossil fuels in the amount of around 200 tons per ship , and at a cost of around $ 90,000 , " said company spokesperson verena beckhusen . bildunterschrift : the northeast passage could shave some 5,400 km off some traditional routes time is money but savings in time and cash are n't likely to unleash an armada of merchant shipping on the arctic . the route is only practical for european trade with northeast asia , a fraction of the region 's total volume .
furthermore , only certain kinds of cargo will be worth sending via the northeast passage , said max johns , spokesperson for the german ship owners association . " container ships will always take the southern route because there are many more ports , " he said .
" container ships work a little bit like buses in a city .
they have to go from port to port and collect and deliver containers in every possible port otherwise it is not worthwhile running them . " the northeast passage makes most sense for specialist deliveries of heavy-lift cargo , or bulk quantities of commodities like coal , iron ore and oil , johns added . added complications , new attractions the passage is also only open for a six- to eight-week window each summer .
then there is the challenge of dealing with an expensive , and byzantine , russian bureaucracy : the beluga shipping company only won final approval for its voyage in august following an application process that took nearly a year . one underplayed aspect of beluga 's successful voyage is that it makes resource extraction in the region more attractive . " the extraction is the real attraction now when the ice melts , and especially russia has a very keen eye on that , " johns said .
" for us , as service providers , it may be interesting to transport that cargo to where it is being needed . " environmental hazard bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has been keen to stake its claim to parts of the arctic vast quantities of energy resources are believed to be located in the arctic .
with some countries already gearing up to exploit them , this is precisely the kind of cargo that concerns environmentalists most . " if there were an oil spill , either from shipping or from the extraction work which will also increase when the ice is going ... then combating it would be very difficult , " said ulrich claussen , who leads the german federal environment 's agency 's efforts to protect marine life . the cold and stormy weather conditions would complicate clean-up efforts from a technical point of view and would also hinder the region 's natural capacity to absorb damage , claussen added . " normally bacteria can degrade the oil , but the colder it is the less active bacteria normally are , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 22.09.2009 german freighters blaze trail through arctic großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mv beluga foresight did n't need to call on its ice-breaking escort two german freighters have successfully travelled from asia to europe via the arctic waters above russia .
as the fabled northeast passage comes a step closer to reality , some say it may end up a road seldom traveled . the two vessels successfully navigated the narrow strip of water off russia 's northern coast last week . the vessels had delivered their cargo of heavy industrial equipment , loaded in south korea , to novy port in western siberia , and were now continuing their voyage to nigeria , where they were due to deliver a shipment of steel pipes picked up in the russian port of arkhangelsk , according to the beluga shipping company , which owns the vessels . the voyage only became possible because of climate change . melting arctic sea ice has opened the way for ships to navigate the arctic waters and avoid the icebergs , floes and pack ice that have confounded previous attempts to use the route for trade . the arctic 's sea ice thawed to its third-lowest level on record this summer .
on sept .
12 , it covered around 5.1 million square kilometers -lrb- 2 million square miles -rrb- - around a million square kilometers more than in 2007 , which had the lowest coverage since records began some 30 years ago . the beluga fraternity and beluga foresight are the first western commercial ships to transit the northeast passage successfully , according to the bremen-based shipping company . until now , only parts of the route have been navigable at any given time , and they were only used by russian shipping companies .
the fraternity and foresight were accompanied by russian icebreakers , but never needed to call upon them for assistance . despite the fact that the trip took a long time to clear with russian authorities , who demanded large fees in return for their approval , the beluga shipping company said it was satisfied with the trip . " we have saved not only voyage time - around 10 days , worth around $ 200,000 - but also , we 've been able to save fossil fuels in the amount of around 200 tons per ship , and at a cost of around $ 90,000 , " said company spokesperson verena beckhusen . bildunterschrift : the northeast passage could shave some 5,400 km off some traditional routes time is money but savings in time and cash are n't likely to unleash an armada of merchant shipping on the arctic . the route is only practical for european trade with northeast asia , a fraction of the region 's total volume .
furthermore , only certain kinds of cargo will be worth sending via the northeast passage , said max johns , spokesperson for the german ship owners association . " container ships will always take the southern route because there are many more ports , " he said .
" container ships work a little bit like buses in a city .
they have to go from port to port and collect and deliver containers in every possible port otherwise it is not worthwhile running them . " the northeast passage makes most sense for specialist deliveries of heavy-lift cargo , or bulk quantities of commodities like coal , iron ore and oil , johns added . added complications , new attractions the passage is also only open for a six- to eight-week window each summer .
then there is the challenge of dealing with an expensive , and byzantine , russian bureaucracy : the beluga shipping company only won final approval for its voyage in august following an application process that took nearly a year . one underplayed aspect of beluga 's successful voyage is that it makes resource extraction in the region more attractive . " the extraction is the real attraction now when the ice melts , and especially russia has a very keen eye on that , " johns said .
" for us , as service providers , it may be interesting to transport that cargo to where it is being needed . " environmental hazard bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has been keen to stake its claim to parts of the arctic vast quantities of energy resources are believed to be located in the arctic .
with some countries already gearing up to exploit them , this is precisely the kind of cargo that concerns environmentalists most . " if there were an oil spill , either from shipping or from the extraction work which will also increase when the ice is going ... then combating it would be very difficult , " said ulrich claussen , who leads the german federal environment 's agency 's efforts to protect marine life . the cold and stormy weather conditions would complicate clean-up efforts from a technical point of view and would also hinder the region 's natural capacity to absorb damage , claussen added . " normally bacteria can degrade the oil , but the colder it is the less active bacteria normally are , " he said .
" there might be a very slow reaction from the environment .
in alaska , where the spill from the exxon valdez was , we can still see some signs of non-recovery now . " the beluga shipping company , however , is already planning another voyage through the northeastern passage for next year .

the camp was used as a base for risky attempts to reach britain . britain 's home secretary alan johnson said the action taken in calais would " disrupt illegal immigration and people-trafficking routes . "
french police cleared and then bulldozed the makeshift forest camp - known as the " jungle " - near the northern city of calais on tuesday morning .
" i welcome the swift and decisive steps that the french government has taken today to close the " jungle " in calais , " johnson said .
the prefect of the region told journalists after the two-hour operation that 278 migrants had been taken into custody , nearly half of them minors .
the adults were temporarily jailed , while the minors were placed in " specialized centers , " he said .
the immigrants , mostly afghans , had hoped to travel the 35 kilometers across the english channel into britain .
an end to criminal trafficking the operation by hundreds of police officers was the final step in a months-long undertaking by the french government to remove the camp .
britain and france had agreed earlier this year to step up efforts against illegal migrants by strengthening border security with state-of-the-art technology and closer cooperation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : besson warned of more raids to come on nearby squatter camps france 's immigration minister eric besson told rtl radio that the dismantling of the camp was justified , calling the site a " base camp for human traffickers . "
the police operation " targeted the tools of the criminal gangs who sell migrants passage to britain , exploit them and have them living in what had become an open air garbage dump , " he said .
besson said that each migrant would be offered an " individual solution " and given the choice to leave voluntarily , apply for asylum or be forcibly deported .
aid groups predict , though , that many of the immigrants will simply end up back on the streets .
" they are going to be scattered across the countryside , at the mercy of traffickers , " said jean-claude lenoir of the salam migrant support group .
" at least here , the young people had built a kind of community .
it 's tragic . "
problem of illegal immigration continues the un refugee agency unhcr said it recognized the need to combat smuggling and trafficking of persons and the right of the french government to maintain public order .
" closing the so-called jungle camp does , however , not address the phenomenon of mixed and irregular migration , nor does it solve the problems of the people concerned , amongst whom there may be many with protection needs , " unhcr spokesman andrej mahecic said at a press briefing in geneva on tuesday .
bildunterschrift : the migrants had gathered before their evacuation to demonstrate their plight unhcr called on the french authorities to ensure that those who wish to apply for refugee protection were given access to " a full and fair asylum procedure , " mahecic said .
" the situation in calais underscores , once again , the need for governments in europe to intensify efforts to arrive at a common european asylum system , not only on paper , but also in practice , " he said .
besson said the calais crisis was partly caused by the lack of a coherent european union migration policy .
he said states should agree to share the asylum burden more fairly , while boosting the powers of the eu border police , frontex. sac / ap / afp / dpa editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the camp was used as a base for risky attempts to reach britain . britain 's home secretary alan johnson said the action taken in calais would " disrupt illegal immigration and people-trafficking routes . "
french police cleared and then bulldozed the makeshift forest camp - known as the " jungle " - near the northern city of calais on tuesday morning .
" i welcome the swift and decisive steps that the french government has taken today to close the " jungle " in calais , " johnson said .
the prefect of the region told journalists after the two-hour operation that 278 migrants had been taken into custody , nearly half of them minors .
the adults were temporarily jailed , while the minors were placed in " specialized centers , " he said .
the immigrants , mostly afghans , had hoped to travel the 35 kilometers across the english channel into britain .
an end to criminal trafficking the operation by hundreds of police officers was the final step in a months-long undertaking by the french government to remove the camp .
britain and france had agreed earlier this year to step up efforts against illegal migrants by strengthening border security with state-of-the-art technology and closer cooperation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : besson warned of more raids to come on nearby squatter camps france 's immigration minister eric besson told rtl radio that the dismantling of the camp was justified , calling the site a " base camp for human traffickers . "
the police operation " targeted the tools of the criminal gangs who sell migrants passage to britain , exploit them and have them living in what had become an open air garbage dump , " he said .
besson said that each migrant would be offered an " individual solution " and given the choice to leave voluntarily , apply for asylum or be forcibly deported .
aid groups predict , though , that many of the immigrants will simply end up back on the streets .
" they are going to be scattered across the countryside , at the mercy of traffickers , " said jean-claude lenoir of the salam migrant support group .
" at least here , the young people had built a kind of community .
it 's tragic . "
problem of illegal immigration continues the un refugee agency unhcr said it recognized the need to combat smuggling and trafficking of persons and the right of the french government to maintain public order .
" closing the so-called jungle camp does , however , not address the phenomenon of mixed and irregular migration , nor does it solve the problems of the people concerned , amongst whom there may be many with protection needs , " unhcr spokesman andrej mahecic said at a press briefing in geneva on tuesday .
bildunterschrift : the migrants had gathered before their evacuation to demonstrate their plight unhcr called on the french authorities to ensure that those who wish to apply for refugee protection were given access to " a full and fair asylum procedure , " mahecic said .
" the situation in calais underscores , once again , the need for governments in europe to intensify efforts to arrive at a common european asylum system , not only on paper , but also in practice , " he said .
besson said the calais crisis was partly caused by the lack of a coherent european union migration policy .

hainer played in attack , while zeitz was goalkeeper .
the game was meant to bring a symbolic end to one of germany 's most infamous family feuds , which began in 1948 when a row between brothers rudolf and adolf dassler split the family sportswear business , already a major supplier in the field , into two camps .
rudolf founded puma in 1948 , while adolf , or adi , dassler founded adidas in 1949 .
their rivalry divided the dasslers ' home town of 23,000 people , where competing factories were built on opposite sides of the aurach river .

monday 's football match was the first conciliatory gesture between the two companies , even though neither has belonged to the dassler family for years .
both companies have become international leaders in the sportswear field , with puma signing a sponsorship deal with record-breaking sprinter usain bolt .
for its part , adidas recently extended its partnership with the football organization uefa , providing equipment for all international football tournaments until 2017 .

she eliminated her main rival , egyptian culture minister farouk hosny , after five rounds of voting by the paris-based agency 's executive council .
bokova , a former communist turned europhile , has represented bulgaria on unesco 's board since 2007 and is also her country 's ambassador to france and monaco .
the process of finding a successor for incumbent director general koichira matsuura has been plagued by controversy from the start , primarily due to hosny 's nomination .
anti-semitic remarks the 71-year-old hosny , who had hoped to become the first arab to head the un agency , has been accused of anti-semitism because he has publicly derided israeli culture .
last year , he said he would personally burn any israeli book found in the library of alexandria .
he has since apologized for his statements , but has not been able to satisfy his detractors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hosny outraged many jews with his 2008 comments vowing to burn israeli books the latest public personality to come out against hosny 's candidature was former french minister and auschwitz survivor simone weil , who was quoted in tuesday 's edition of the daily ‘ liberation ' as saying that hosny 's statements " raise many questions for me . "
the controversial egyptian minister and the bulgarian diplomat were the only candidates remaining in the race after the first four rounds of voting .
in monday 's fourth round , bokova and hosni both received 29 votes from the 58-member executive board , setting up a tense finish to what turned out to be an historic election .
first woman chief 57-year-old bokova will become the first woman to head the agency after unesco 's general conference , which consists of representatives of member states , approves her appointment when it meets in october .

hainer played in attack , while zeitz was goalkeeper .
the game was meant to bring a symbolic end to one of germany 's most infamous family feuds , which began in 1948 when a row between brothers rudolf and adolf dassler split the family sportswear business , already a major supplier in the field , into two camps .
rudolf founded puma in 1948 , while adolf , or adi , dassler founded adidas in 1949 .
their rivalry divided the dasslers ' home town of 23,000 people , where competing factories were built on opposite sides of the aurach river .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adidas provides the soccer balls for the world cup skeletons in the sportswear closet there are plenty of rumors about the cause of the split , including the story that rudolf had an affair with adolf 's wife kaethe in 1940 .
monday 's football match was the first conciliatory gesture between the two companies , even though neither has belonged to the dassler family for years .
both companies have become international leaders in the sportswear field , with puma signing a sponsorship deal with record-breaking sprinter usain bolt .
for its part , adidas recently extended its partnership with the football organization uefa , providing equipment for all international football tournaments until 2017 .
according to the german financial newspaper handelsblatt , adidas is currently the second biggest sportswear manufacturer in the world behind nike , while puma is third .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : puma makes usain bolt 's running shoes the sporting event was held in support of the peace one day initiative , set up by film-maker jeremy gilley in 1999 .
the initiative , which was adopted in 2001 as part of the un 's international day of peace on september 21 , was meant to establish an annual day of global ceasefire and non-violence with a fixed calendar date. bk / afp / reuters / ap editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

greece took in almost 6.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.25 billion -rrb- more from the eu 's budget than it paid into it in 2008 , according to the commission .
the bulk of that money came in payments to greek farmers and in eu funding for infrastructure projects such as highways and ports .
greece was far ahead of eu newcomer poland in the eu 's net handouts list .
poland 's net income from the eu 's budget actually fell by some three-quarters of a billion euros to 4.4 billion euros last year .
the drop owed largely to a reduction in eu payments to polish farmers .
observers say this is likely to provoke heated comments from warsaw , which has frequently accused the eu of treating the countries that joined in 2004 and 2007 less generously than older member states .
german payments hit historic highs at the other end of the scale , germany , the eu 's biggest member , paid almost 8.8 billion euros more into the budget than it received .
this marks the biggest contribution by the country in the last 10 years .
germany 's payment amounts to more than double that of the next biggest contributors , italy and france , which paid around a net 4 billion euros to the fund each .
the three countries are , however , far ahead of the eu 's other heavyweight , britain , whose net contribution fell from over 4 billion euros in 2007 to under 1 billion euros in 2008 .
in terms of absolute receipts , france maintained its position as the largest recipient of eu funds , ahead of spain , germany and italy .
britain , the eu 's third-largest economy , was only the seventh-largest recipient of funding .
the news comes as the the european commission is drawing up plans to reform the bloc 's budgetary process in a move that analysts say will likely spark a rancorous debate between countries which receive the most money from the bloc and those who pay the most into it. rb / dpa / reuters editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

greece took in almost 6.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.25 billion -rrb- more from the eu 's budget than it paid into it in 2008 , according to the commission .
the bulk of that money came in payments to greek farmers and in eu funding for infrastructure projects such as highways and ports .
greece was far ahead of eu newcomer poland in the eu 's net handouts list .
poland 's net income from the eu 's budget actually fell by some three-quarters of a billion euros to 4.4 billion euros last year .
the drop owed largely to a reduction in eu payments to polish farmers .
observers say this is likely to provoke heated comments from warsaw , which has frequently accused the eu of treating the countries that joined in 2004 and 2007 less generously than older member states .
german payments hit historic highs at the other end of the scale , germany , the eu 's biggest member , paid almost 8.8 billion euros more into the budget than it received .
this marks the biggest contribution by the country in the last 10 years .
germany 's payment amounts to more than double that of the next biggest contributors , italy and france , which paid around a net 4 billion euros to the fund each .
the three countries are , however , far ahead of the eu 's other heavyweight , britain , whose net contribution fell from over 4 billion euros in 2007 to under 1 billion euros in 2008 .
in terms of absolute receipts , france maintained its position as the largest recipient of eu funds , ahead of spain , germany and italy .
britain , the eu 's third-largest economy , was only the seventh-largest recipient of funding .
the news comes as the the european commission is drawing up plans to reform the bloc 's budgetary process in a move that analysts say will likely spark a rancorous debate between countries which receive the most money from the bloc and those who pay the most into it. rb / dpa / reuters editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hainer played in attack , while zeitz was goalkeeper .
the game was meant to bring a symbolic end to one of germany 's most infamous family feuds , which began in 1948 when a row between brothers rudolf and adolf dassler split the family sportswear business , already a major supplier in the field , into two camps .
rudolf founded puma in 1948 , while adolf , or adi , dassler founded adidas in 1949 .
their rivalry divided the dasslers ' home town of 23,000 people , where competing factories were built on opposite sides of the aurach river .

monday 's football match was the first conciliatory gesture between the two companies , even though neither has belonged to the dassler family for years .

greece took in almost 6.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.25 billion -rrb- more from the eu 's budget than it paid into it in 2008 , according to the commission .
the bulk of that money came in payments to greek farmers and in eu funding for infrastructure projects such as highways and ports .
greece was far ahead of eu newcomer poland in the eu 's net handouts list .
poland 's net income from the eu 's budget actually fell by some three-quarters of a billion euros to 4.4 billion euros last year .
the drop owed largely to a reduction in eu payments to polish farmers .
observers say this is likely to provoke heated comments from warsaw , which has frequently accused the eu of treating the countries that joined in 2004 and 2007 less generously than older member states .
german payments hit historic highs at the other end of the scale , germany , the eu 's biggest member , paid almost 8.8 billion euros more into the budget than it received .
this marks the biggest contribution by the country in the last 10 years .
germany 's payment amounts to more than double that of the next biggest contributors , italy and france , which paid around a net 4 billion euros to the fund each .
the three countries are , however , far ahead of the eu 's other heavyweight , britain , whose net contribution fell from over 4 billion euros in 2007 to under 1 billion euros in 2008 .
in terms of absolute receipts , france maintained its position as the largest recipient of eu funds , ahead of spain , germany and italy .
britain , the eu 's third-largest economy , was only the seventh-largest recipient of funding .
the news comes as the the european commission is drawing up plans to reform the bloc 's budgetary process in a move that analysts say will likely spark a rancorous debate between countries which receive the most money from the bloc and those who pay the most into it. rb / dpa / reuters editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

greece took in almost 6.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.25 billion -rrb- more from the eu 's budget than it paid into it in 2008 , according to the commission .
the bulk of that money came in payments to greek farmers and in eu funding for infrastructure projects such as highways and ports .
greece was far ahead of eu newcomer poland in the eu 's net handouts list .
poland 's net income from the eu 's budget actually fell by some three-quarters of a billion euros to 4.4 billion euros last year .
the drop owed largely to a reduction in eu payments to polish farmers .
observers say this is likely to provoke heated comments from warsaw , which has frequently accused the eu of treating the countries that joined in 2004 and 2007 less generously than older member states .
german payments hit historic highs at the other end of the scale , germany , the eu 's biggest member , paid almost 8.8 billion euros more into the budget than it received .
this marks the biggest contribution by the country in the last 10 years .
germany 's payment amounts to more than double that of the next biggest contributors , italy and france , which paid around a net 4 billion euros to the fund each .
the three countries are , however , far ahead of the eu 's other heavyweight , britain , whose net contribution fell from over 4 billion euros in 2007 to under 1 billion euros in 2008 .
in terms of absolute receipts , france maintained its position as the largest recipient of eu funds , ahead of spain , germany and italy .
britain , the eu 's third-largest economy , was only the seventh-largest recipient of funding .
the news comes as the the european commission is drawing up plans to reform the bloc 's budgetary process in a move that analysts say will likely spark a rancorous debate between countries which receive the most money from the bloc and those who pay the most into it. rb / dpa / reuters editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hainer played in attack , while zeitz was goalkeeper .
the game was meant to bring a symbolic end to one of germany 's most infamous family feuds , which began in 1948 when a row between brothers rudolf and adolf dassler split the family sportswear business , already a major supplier in the field , into two camps .
rudolf founded puma in 1948 , while adolf , or adi , dassler founded adidas in 1949 .
their rivalry divided the dasslers ' home town of 23,000 people , where competing factories were built on opposite sides of the aurach river .

while some say the discussions are necessary , others say the time for action , not talk , has come . representatives from around the world are gathering in the united states for a week 's worth of climate talks .
on tuesday , un secretary-general ban ki-moon is staging his own climate summit , ahead of two-days of g-20 talks in pittsburgh , pennsylvania , beginning thursday . the most recent in a long series of formal meetings and informal pow-wows , the meetings provide international leaders with further opportunities to share their views on how to counter climate change in the run-up to the key un climate conference in copenhagen in december . " there are more and more climate conferences that are getting more and more complex and including more and more issues , " said miranda schreurs , a professor at berlin 's free university and a member of the german environmental advisory board .
" it can sometimes be overwhelming both for the public and the negotiators , who are working long days and traveling from one conference to another . " the sheer number of places to meet can even be overwhelming .
what 's come to be called " climate week " kicked off in washington last thursday , continues at the un in new york and concludes when g-20 leaders meet in pittsburgh for two days of talks beginning thursday .
the un 's climate secretariat , the unfccc , will hold further talks in bangkok and barcelona ahead of the copenhagen event . ample opportunity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists say politians are dragging their heels the abundance of places to present a position has not yet led to a clear improvement in countries ' ability to reach an agreement , according to some environmental groups . " this is a unique opportunity to show political will and face up to global warming , " said kim carstensen , head of the wwf 's global climate initiative .
" without new , powerful political impetus at the meetings in september , the climate negotiations could be doomed . " the united nations ' goal is to have environment ministers gather in copenhagen in december and agree to a new round of greenhouse gas emissions cuts that would be introduced when the kyoto protocol expires in 2012 .
however , the prospect of an agreement to cut emissions by up to 40 percent by 2020 , as scientists have called for , appears very distant . " the ongoing negotiations have been stuck in a dead end for months because industrialized nations refuse to make a fair contribution to protecting the global climate , " jan kowalzig , a climate expert at oxfam germany , said in a statement . conferences large and small bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ultimately , heads of government need to come to the table un secretary-general ban ki-moon has also warned that climate change will have severe effects on the entire planet if world leaders ca n't reach a compromise .

china has become the world 's largest emitter of carbon dioxide and the country 's climate policy is being closely watched in the run-up to the copenhagen climate summit taking place at the end of the year .
hu jintao pledged to " vigorously " develop renewable energies , which will account for 15 percent of china 's energy mix by 2020 , as well as to boost nuclear energy . china currently has 11 nuclear reactors , which generate nine gigawatts of energy , enough to provide 1 percent of the country ’ s energy .
24 are in the making right now and 18 more are planned in the future .
by 2020 , 70 gigawatts of nuclear energy will be generated - enough to power 70 cities the size of san francisco .
zhou dadi from the energy research institute of the national development and reform commission in beijing says : “ nuclear energy can help restrict pollution , protect the environment and optimise our energy supply .
our studies show that china sees nuclear energy as an important means of reducing pollution , acquiring more energy and reducing our dependence on coal .
nuclear energy is going to develop very fast in the future . ”
china still gets most of its energy - over 70 percent - from coal .
but coal-powered stations can not meet the demand .
the electricity grid often collapses .
there are power cuts in summer particularly because of the intense use of air conditioning .
on top of that , the power stations are old and pollute the atmosphere heavily .
little public debate about risks as china is turning to nuclear energy as a long-term alternative , there is more and more talk of the risks involved .
but nuclear expert zhou dadi thinks there is no need to worry : “ we are learning from the experiences in the united states , japan and europe .
in europe , the nuclear power stations are built near the cities .
it ’ s very important to choose the right technology and to ensure conditions are safe .
when we make decisions we will choose places which are not heavily populated .
i am sure that china will choose the most advanced technology . ”
although beijing is insistent that high safety standards should be met , this is not always the case in the provinces where corruption is high .
there is also very little public debate about nuclear power - about its advantages and about the risks involved .
critics of nuclear energy are often faced with reprisals .
nuclear waste causing concern wang , a student of english in beijing , says she is “ very much afraid of living close to a nuclear power plant .
there are many natural disasters such as earthquakes and landslides .
i don ’ t know how to prevent being exposed to radiation .
i don ’ t think we have enough knowledge about the dangers or bad effects of nuclear power . ”
nuclear waste is also causing concern but zhou dadi once again dismisses fears : “ we are thinking about how to recycle nuclear liquids .
we ’ re looking at the same methods as the international community - for example storing the waste deep underground .
china will act responsibly . "
a plan to store nuclear waste in the gobi desert has now been rejected .
there is still no alternative .

zhou dadi from the energy research institute of the national development and reform commission in beijing says : “ nuclear energy can help restrict pollution , protect the environment and optimise our energy supply .
our studies show that china sees nuclear energy as an important means of reducing pollution , acquiring more energy and reducing our dependence on coal .
nuclear energy is going to develop very fast in the future . ”
china still gets most of its energy - over 70 percent - from coal .
but coal-powered stations can not meet the demand .
the electricity grid often collapses .
there are power cuts in summer particularly because of the intense use of air conditioning .
on top of that , the power stations are old and pollute the atmosphere heavily .
little public debate about risks as china is turning to nuclear energy as a long-term alternative , there is more and more talk of the risks involved .
but nuclear expert zhou dadi thinks there is no need to worry : “ we are learning from the experiences in the united states , japan and europe .
in europe , the nuclear power stations are built near the cities .
it ’ s very important to choose the right technology and to ensure conditions are safe .
when we make decisions we will choose places which are not heavily populated .
i am sure that china will choose the most advanced technology . ”
although beijing is insistent that high safety standards should be met , this is not always the case in the provinces where corruption is high .
there is also very little public debate about nuclear power - about its advantages and about the risks involved .
critics of nuclear energy are often faced with reprisals .
nuclear waste causing concern wang , a student of english in beijing , says she is “ very much afraid of living close to a nuclear power plant .
there are many natural disasters such as earthquakes and landslides .
i don ’ t know how to prevent being exposed to radiation .
i don ’ t think we have enough knowledge about the dangers or bad effects of nuclear power . ”
nuclear waste is also causing concern but zhou dadi once again dismisses fears : “ we are thinking about how to recycle nuclear liquids .
we ’ re looking at the same methods as the international community - for example storing the waste deep underground .
china will act responsibly . "
a plan to store nuclear waste in the gobi desert has now been rejected .
there is still no alternative .

he tells politicians there are better ways to spend billions than on fighting climate change . the author of " the skeptical environmentalist , " bjorn lomborg , has had public disagreements with climate activists including al gore and sir nicholas stern .
lomborg 's harshest criticism , however , is aimed at the international community for spending billions on what he says are ineffective measures intended to fight climate change . he talked to deutsche welle about ongoing climate negotiations and how economists at the copenhagen consensus center , a think tank he heads , suggest spending aid and development money . deutsche welle : what do you think will emerge from the climate talks taking place at the united nations on tuesday ? bjorn lomborg : first of all , i think it 's important to recognize that probably nothing will come out of this , simply because they are so far away from the different nations on what they want to achieve . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lomborg , a danish statistician , questions environmental orthodoxy it 's always good to talk about the problem , and i think it 's good to reaffirm to everybody that we need a deal in copenhagen by the end of this year .
the problem is the focus on cutting carbon emissions is actually one that both makes it very hard for everyone to agree because the chinese and the indians do n't want to cut and while the europeans and the americans claim they want to cut , they actually also know that it 's going to cost them a lot , and it 's going to have very little benefit even in the far-off future .
that 's why they are all playing for the gallery but nobody is actually willing to really commit . the chinese leader has said he will present china 's new plans for tackling global warming at the summit .
is n't that a positive signal ? it could be .
but let 's remember that the chinese have been doing a lot of posturing on climate change and coming out and suggesting that we might even see china 's emissions maxing out in 2050 or maybe even in 2040 .
but let 's not base our hopes for a climate deal on things that will happen in 20 or 40 years . if you had to give tips to the participants , what would you advise them to talk about ? we 've run what we call the copenhagen consensus for climate , where we ask top economists , including three nobel laureates " where do you do the most good for climate with the money you 're going to be spending ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could salt particulates help cool the earth in the short-term ?
what they told us was do n't focus on cutting carbon emissions .
it 's very expensive and does very little good for the climate even 100 years from now .
in the short and medium-term , we should recognize that nothing we do will change the temperature development except looking into geo-engineering , essentially making the planet cooler - for instance by spraying up salt particulates in the atmosphere , which will amplify natural processes , make more white clouds and hence make the world a little more reflective - especially over the south pacific .
that would be very cheap and could potentially avoid global warming for the next 100 years . this is still a band-aid , so what you also need to do is more toward a situation where we can actually get people to not just talk about cutting carbon emissions but actually doing so , and we will only do that if cutting carbon emissions and green energy technologies become much , much cheaper .
that 's why their second solution was to focus on making much cheaper green energy technologies - cheaper solar panels , cheaper windmills - that will actually work . those two in conjunction is what i would like to see world leaders focus on a lot more , if we actually care about fixing climate change not just making beautiful speeches . at the moment we also have to concentrate on adaptation to climate change .
its effects are already becoming very visible .
where would your priorities lie in that area ? i 'm referring to top economists , rather than my own private opinions .
what they found is we are very often being told that there is a huge amount of impacts from climate change right now , and it 's certainly true that there are a lot of good pictures out there where you can show here 's a catastrophe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lomborg says poverty impacts people 's lives more than climate change but what we fail to recognize is that the vast majority of the impact that we are seeing right now - climate impacts and other impacts - are impacts that have been there for hundreds of years .
most of this world 's population is poor and they 're ill-prepared to deal with any contingency that the world throws at them .
what we need to focus on is not just adaption specifically for climate change , which is a small part of the problems most people live with right now , but simply making better lives for people that is focusing on getting them more food , getting them better healthcare and making sure their kids get educated . the world 's doctors have said failure to tackle climate change in copenhagen could be catastrophic for health .
is it possible to separate climate change from issues like health , food security or a safe water supply ? we do n't need to separate them in the sense that we probably all agree we should tackle some of the really big problems that are out there right now .
i 'm simply concerned that many people latch on to talking about global warming and that the most important this is spending money on adaptation to global warming . but the main problem in bangladesh or myanmar is not future sea-level rises , it 's the fact that the countries are so poor right now that they are already getting inundated .
it 's not about climate-proofing it in 100 years , it 's about dealing with the vulnerability to climate right now , which has nothing to do with climate change but simply something to do with them being very poor . it 's more about an emphasis on focusing where you can actually deal with real problems right now rather than a possible problem in 100 years . interview : irene quaile -lrb- sms -rrb- editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he tells politicians there are better ways to spend billions than on fighting climate change . the author of " the skeptical environmentalist , " bjorn lomborg , has had public disagreements with climate activists including al gore and sir nicholas stern .
lomborg 's harshest criticism , however , is aimed at the international community for spending billions on what he says are ineffective measures intended to fight climate change . he talked to deutsche welle about ongoing climate negotiations and how economists at the copenhagen consensus center , a think tank he heads , suggest spending aid and development money . deutsche welle : what do you think will emerge from the climate talks taking place at the united nations on tuesday ? bjorn lomborg : first of all , i think it 's important to recognize that probably nothing will come out of this , simply because they are so far away from the different nations on what they want to achieve . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lomborg , a danish statistician , questions environmental orthodoxy it 's always good to talk about the problem , and i think it 's good to reaffirm to everybody that we need a deal in copenhagen by the end of this year .
the problem is the focus on cutting carbon emissions is actually one that both makes it very hard for everyone to agree because the chinese and the indians do n't want to cut and while the europeans and the americans claim they want to cut , they actually also know that it 's going to cost them a lot , and it 's going to have very little benefit even in the far-off future .
that 's why they are all playing for the gallery but nobody is actually willing to really commit . the chinese leader has said he will present china 's new plans for tackling global warming at the summit .
is n't that a positive signal ? it could be .
but let 's remember that the chinese have been doing a lot of posturing on climate change and coming out and suggesting that we might even see china 's emissions maxing out in 2050 or maybe even in 2040 .
but let 's not base our hopes for a climate deal on things that will happen in 20 or 40 years . if you had to give tips to the participants , what would you advise them to talk about ? we 've run what we call the copenhagen consensus for climate , where we ask top economists , including three nobel laureates " where do you do the most good for climate with the money you 're going to be spending ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could salt particulates help cool the earth in the short-term ?
what they told us was do n't focus on cutting carbon emissions .
it 's very expensive and does very little good for the climate even 100 years from now .
in the short and medium-term , we should recognize that nothing we do will change the temperature development except looking into geo-engineering , essentially making the planet cooler - for instance by spraying up salt particulates in the atmosphere , which will amplify natural processes , make more white clouds and hence make the world a little more reflective - especially over the south pacific .
that would be very cheap and could potentially avoid global warming for the next 100 years . this is still a band-aid , so what you also need to do is more toward a situation where we can actually get people to not just talk about cutting carbon emissions but actually doing so , and we will only do that if cutting carbon emissions and green energy technologies become much , much cheaper .
that 's why their second solution was to focus on making much cheaper green energy technologies - cheaper solar panels , cheaper windmills - that will actually work . those two in conjunction is what i would like to see world leaders focus on a lot more , if we actually care about fixing climate change not just making beautiful speeches . at the moment we also have to concentrate on adaptation to climate change .
its effects are already becoming very visible .
where would your priorities lie in that area ? i 'm referring to top economists , rather than my own private opinions .
what they found is we are very often being told that there is a huge amount of impacts from climate change right now , and it 's certainly true that there are a lot of good pictures out there where you can show here 's a catastrophe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lomborg says poverty impacts people 's lives more than climate change but what we fail to recognize is that the vast majority of the impact that we are seeing right now - climate impacts and other impacts - are impacts that have been there for hundreds of years .
most of this world 's population is poor and they 're ill-prepared to deal with any contingency that the world throws at them .
what we need to focus on is not just adaption specifically for climate change , which is a small part of the problems most people live with right now , but simply making better lives for people that is focusing on getting them more food , getting them better healthcare and making sure their kids get educated . the world 's doctors have said failure to tackle climate change in copenhagen could be catastrophic for health .
is it possible to separate climate change from issues like health , food security or a safe water supply ? we do n't need to separate them in the sense that we probably all agree we should tackle some of the really big problems that are out there right now .
i 'm simply concerned that many people latch on to talking about global warming and that the most important this is spending money on adaptation to global warming . but the main problem in bangladesh or myanmar is not future sea-level rises , it 's the fact that the countries are so poor right now that they are already getting inundated .
it 's not about climate-proofing it in 100 years , it 's about dealing with the vulnerability to climate right now , which has nothing to do with climate change but simply something to do with them being very poor . it 's more about an emphasis on focusing where you can actually deal with real problems right now rather than a possible problem in 100 years . interview : irene quaile -lrb- sms -rrb- editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that would be very cheap and could potentially avoid global warming for the next 100 years . this is still a band-aid , so what you also need to do is more toward a situation where we can actually get people to not just talk about cutting carbon emissions but actually doing so , and we will only do that if cutting carbon emissions and green energy technologies become much , much cheaper .
that 's why their second solution was to focus on making much cheaper green energy technologies - cheaper solar panels , cheaper windmills - that will actually work . those two in conjunction is what i would like to see world leaders focus on a lot more , if we actually care about fixing climate change not just making beautiful speeches . at the moment we also have to concentrate on adaptation to climate change .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : the long road to copenhagen experts express little optimism ahead of copenhagen summit brown , sarkozy propose multi-billion-dollar climate fund for poor nations hacker scandal sends ripples through climate-science community world leaders favor delaying a binding climate change deal climate -pipe- 22.09.2009 cutting carbon emissions wo n't stop climate change , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lomborg says the world faces more pressing problems than emissions as world leaders meet at the un to discuss climate change , bjorn lomborg tells dw he expects little to come from the talks .
he tells politicians there are better ways to spend billions than on fighting climate change . the author of " the skeptical environmentalist , " bjorn lomborg , has had public disagreements with climate activists including al gore and sir nicholas stern .
lomborg 's harshest criticism , however , is aimed at the international community for spending billions on what he says are ineffective measures intended to fight climate change . he talked to deutsche welle about ongoing climate negotiations and how economists at the copenhagen consensus center , a think tank he heads , suggest spending aid and development money . deutsche welle : what do you think will emerge from the climate talks taking place at the united nations on tuesday ? bjorn lomborg : first of all , i think it 's important to recognize that probably nothing will come out of this , simply because they are so far away from the different nations on what they want to achieve . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lomborg , a danish statistician , questions environmental orthodoxy it 's always good to talk about the problem , and i think it 's good to reaffirm to everybody that we need a deal in copenhagen by the end of this year .
the problem is the focus on cutting carbon emissions is actually one that both makes it very hard for everyone to agree because the chinese and the indians do n't want to cut and while the europeans and the americans claim they want to cut , they actually also know that it 's going to cost them a lot , and it 's going to have very little benefit even in the far-off future .
that 's why they are all playing for the gallery but nobody is actually willing to really commit . the chinese leader has said he will present china 's new plans for tackling global warming at the summit .
is n't that a positive signal ? it could be .
but let 's remember that the chinese have been doing a lot of posturing on climate change and coming out and suggesting that we might even see china 's emissions maxing out in 2050 or maybe even in 2040 .
but let 's not base our hopes for a climate deal on things that will happen in 20 or 40 years . if you had to give tips to the participants , what would you advise them to talk about ? we 've run what we call the copenhagen consensus for climate , where we ask top economists , including three nobel laureates " where do you do the most good for climate with the money you 're going to be spending ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could salt particulates help cool the earth in the short-term ?
what they told us was do n't focus on cutting carbon emissions .
it 's very expensive and does very little good for the climate even 100 years from now .
in the short and medium-term , we should recognize that nothing we do will change the temperature development except looking into geo-engineering , essentially making the planet cooler - for instance by spraying up salt particulates in the atmosphere , which will amplify natural processes , make more white clouds and hence make the world a little more reflective - especially over the south pacific .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 22.09.2009 german voting anomaly is center of latest election debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how many of these seats were actually voted for ?
not all of them .
a quirk in the german electoral process awards larger parties a disproportionate number of parliamentary seats .
that increases the size of parliament and could give the cdu a decisive advantage in the coming vote . germany 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have repeated their warning that a new coalition led by chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- would be " illegitimate " if it were dependent upon winning additional seats that are awarded through an anomaly of the country 's election laws .
germans elect their representatives in a complicated process .
it involves dividing up the 598 seats in the bundestag , or parliament , into two groups , which are filled using two votes .
the first vote is for an actual candidate : each electoral district has candidates from one or several parties that campaign for a seat .
these seats are handed out in a simple , first-past-the-post majority , a system that often places smaller parties at a disadvantage .
two-vote system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier derided a coalition won on overhang seats the other 299 seats are allocated based on the second vote , which is for a party .
the votes of the 62 million germans eligible to take part in the election are added up and then divided by the number of parties .
those seats are then handed out to the people each party has put on a list , which is divided up among all 16 german states .
an example : in 2005 the conservative cdu and its bavarian sister party the csu took 35.2 percent of the vote for parties .
but 150 of their candidates were elected directly .
under german electoral law , if a party wins more direct seats than they would be entitled to under the votes cast for the party lists , then they are allowed to keep those extra seats and the total number in the bundestag simply goes up .
this is known as the ueberhangmandate , or " overhang seats . "
thus , the conservatives were awarded 246 parliamentary seats - some five percent more than the proportion of the party votes cast for them . if we take a local example , we see that the cdu won 31 out of 35 districts in the state of baden-wuerttemberg , which means they were entitled to 31 seats .
however , when its share of the second vote was tallied , it was actually only supposed to get 28 of the state 's 74 seats , meaning it got three extra seats .
at the moment , there are 611 seats in the bundestag , which include the 13 overhang seats that were created by the 2005 election .
the amount of overhang seats is determined anew by each election .
last week , merkel sparked debate by saying she was prepared to form a government with a coalition whose majority was based purely on these additional seats .
' not a second-class mandate ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to merkel , any win is a good win " a mandate based on overhang seats is no second class mandate , " the chancellor said during a press conference .
the spd 's parliamentary leader thomas oppermann responded that , if this were to happen , " for the first time in germany there would be a government which the voters did n't choose and did n't want . "
normally , this is n't a big deal .
back in 2005 it was n't enough to give the cdu anything close to a clear majority and they were forced to form a grand coalition with the spd .
however , in 1994 the cdu was granted 12 extra overhang seats , allowing helmut kohl to maintain his position as chancellor. mrm / dpa / reuters / afp editor : tony dunham send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not all of them .
a quirk in the german electoral process awards larger parties a disproportionate number of parliamentary seats .
that increases the size of parliament and could give the cdu a decisive advantage in the coming vote . germany 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have repeated their warning that a new coalition led by chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- would be " illegitimate " if it were dependent upon winning additional seats that are awarded through an anomaly of the country 's election laws .
germans elect their representatives in a complicated process .
it involves dividing up the 598 seats in the bundestag , or parliament , into two groups , which are filled using two votes .
the first vote is for an actual candidate : each electoral district has candidates from one or several parties that campaign for a seat .
these seats are handed out in a simple , first-past-the-post majority , a system that often places smaller parties at a disadvantage .
two-vote system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier derided a coalition won on overhang seats the other 299 seats are allocated based on the second vote , which is for a party .
the votes of the 62 million germans eligible to take part in the election are added up and then divided by the number of parties .
those seats are then handed out to the people each party has put on a list , which is divided up among all 16 german states .
an example : in 2005 the conservative cdu and its bavarian sister party the csu took 35.2 percent of the vote for parties .
but 150 of their candidates were elected directly .
under german electoral law , if a party wins more direct seats than they would be entitled to under the votes cast for the party lists , then they are allowed to keep those extra seats and the total number in the bundestag simply goes up .
this is known as the ueberhangmandate , or " overhang seats . "
thus , the conservatives were awarded 246 parliamentary seats - some five percent more than the proportion of the party votes cast for them . if we take a local example , we see that the cdu won 31 out of 35 districts in the state of baden-wuerttemberg , which means they were entitled to 31 seats .
however , when its share of the second vote was tallied , it was actually only supposed to get 28 of the state 's 74 seats , meaning it got three extra seats .
at the moment , there are 611 seats in the bundestag , which include the 13 overhang seats that were created by the 2005 election .
the amount of overhang seats is determined anew by each election .
last week , merkel sparked debate by saying she was prepared to form a government with a coalition whose majority was based purely on these additional seats .
' not a second-class mandate ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to merkel , any win is a good win " a mandate based on overhang seats is no second class mandate , " the chancellor said during a press conference .
the spd 's parliamentary leader thomas oppermann responded that , if this were to happen , " for the first time in germany there would be a government which the voters did n't choose and did n't want . "
normally , this is n't a big deal .
back in 2005 it was n't enough to give the cdu anything close to a clear majority and they were forced to form a grand coalition with the spd .
however , in 1994 the cdu was granted 12 extra overhang seats , allowing helmut kohl to maintain his position as chancellor. mrm / dpa / reuters / afp editor : tony dunham send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not all of them .
a quirk in the german electoral process awards larger parties a disproportionate number of parliamentary seats .
that increases the size of parliament and could give the cdu a decisive advantage in the coming vote . germany 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have repeated their warning that a new coalition led by chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- would be " illegitimate " if it were dependent upon winning additional seats that are awarded through an anomaly of the country 's election laws .
germans elect their representatives in a complicated process .
it involves dividing up the 598 seats in the bundestag , or parliament , into two groups , which are filled using two votes .
the first vote is for an actual candidate : each electoral district has candidates from one or several parties that campaign for a seat .
these seats are handed out in a simple , first-past-the-post majority , a system that often places smaller parties at a disadvantage .
two-vote system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier derided a coalition won on overhang seats the other 299 seats are allocated based on the second vote , which is for a party .
the votes of the 62 million germans eligible to take part in the election are added up and then divided by the number of parties .
those seats are then handed out to the people each party has put on a list , which is divided up among all 16 german states .
an example : in 2005 the conservative cdu and its bavarian sister party the csu took 35.2 percent of the vote for parties .
but 150 of their candidates were elected directly .
under german electoral law , if a party wins more direct seats than they would be entitled to under the votes cast for the party lists , then they are allowed to keep those extra seats and the total number in the bundestag simply goes up .
this is known as the ueberhangmandate , or " overhang seats . "
thus , the conservatives were awarded 246 parliamentary seats - some five percent more than the proportion of the party votes cast for them . if we take a local example , we see that the cdu won 31 out of 35 districts in the state of baden-wuerttemberg , which means they were entitled to 31 seats .
however , when its share of the second vote was tallied , it was actually only supposed to get 28 of the state 's 74 seats , meaning it got three extra seats .
at the moment , there are 611 seats in the bundestag , which include the 13 overhang seats that were created by the 2005 election .
the amount of overhang seats is determined anew by each election .
last week , merkel sparked debate by saying she was prepared to form a government with a coalition whose majority was based purely on these additional seats .

prosecutors are exploring possible legal action . in the two-page letter , which is phrased as an official announcement , the berlin branch of the national democratic party , or npd , called on various politicians to leave germany .
it presents a five-stage plan setting out " the details of -lsb- their -rsb- return home " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soccer star mesut özil was targeted by the npd in an obvious re-hashing of nazi germany 's anti-jewish laws of the 1930s , the plan details how people of immigrant background would be phased out of german life .
according to news magazine focus , the steps include withdrawing the right to social welfare and the right to own real estate on german soil .
in the meantime , the letter suggests , immigrants should " already start " looking for work and shelter in their " native " countries .
the letter is signed by the " commissioner for the repatriation of foreigners . "
but it also makes clear that it is written by joerg haehnel , chairman of the berlin npd .
state prosecutors are now exploring the possibility of prosecuting haehnel for incitement .
weary reaction green party politician özcan mutlu , who regularly receives far-right hate-mail both by e-mail and post , was unimpressed by the offensive letter : " they still do n't understand that this country is our country too .
the only immigrants who might be shocked by this letter are those that do n't recognize it for what it is : a cheap campaign trick . "
spokesman for the berlin senate , richard meng , called the letter obscene and digusting .
" i can only advise them to throw it in the bin , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' poland invasion ' posters were removed after protests haehnel was last in trouble with state prosecutors in 2007 and 2008 , when he was fined for anti-immigration comments and for declaring his approval of the murder of communist leaders rosa luxemburg and karl liebknecht in 1919 .
aggressive campaign the letter is new evidence of the npd 's aggressive election campaign strategy , apparently intended to provoke german authorities .
last week , npd press spokesman klaus beier called mesut özil , a german national football player of turkish origin , a " fake german , " causing outrage in the german football association and the threat of prosecution .

prosecutors are exploring possible legal action . in the two-page letter , which is phrased as an official announcement , the berlin branch of the national democratic party , or npd , called on various politicians to leave germany .
it presents a five-stage plan setting out " the details of -lsb- their -rsb- return home " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soccer star mesut özil was targeted by the npd in an obvious re-hashing of nazi germany 's anti-jewish laws of the 1930s , the plan details how people of immigrant background would be phased out of german life .
according to news magazine focus , the steps include withdrawing the right to social welfare and the right to own real estate on german soil .
in the meantime , the letter suggests , immigrants should " already start " looking for work and shelter in their " native " countries .
the letter is signed by the " commissioner for the repatriation of foreigners . "
but it also makes clear that it is written by joerg haehnel , chairman of the berlin npd .
state prosecutors are now exploring the possibility of prosecuting haehnel for incitement .
weary reaction green party politician özcan mutlu , who regularly receives far-right hate-mail both by e-mail and post , was unimpressed by the offensive letter : " they still do n't understand that this country is our country too .
the only immigrants who might be shocked by this letter are those that do n't recognize it for what it is : a cheap campaign trick . "

ciulli rejected the demand .
" this is not an anti-semitic piece , but one that addresses the subject of anti-semitism , " he said , stressing the " autonomy of theatric art . "

" for the near term , the outlook for the german economy looks bright .
it has the potential to lead europe out of the recession , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 22.09.2009 adidas and puma bury hatchet after more than 60 years großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the soccer match was held on the adi-dassler-sportplatz in herzogenaurach employees of germany 's rival sportswear companies adidas and puma symbollically ended the firms ' 60-year-old family feud on monday with a friendly football match to mark the un-backed peace one day initiative . the game , in which employees of both firms played in both teams , included board chairmen herbert hainer of adidas and jochen zeitz of puma and was played in the small northern bavarian town of herzogenaurach near nuremberg , where both companies maintain their headquarters .
hainer played in attack , while zeitz was goalkeeper .
the game was meant to bring a symbolic end to one of germany 's most infamous family feuds , which began in 1948 when a row between brothers rudolf and adolf dassler split the family sportswear business , already a major supplier in the field , into two camps .
rudolf founded puma in 1948 , while adolf , or adi , dassler founded adidas in 1949 .
their rivalry divided the dasslers ' home town of 23,000 people , where competing factories were built on opposite sides of the aurach river .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adidas provides the soccer balls for the world cup skeletons in the sportswear closet there are plenty of rumors about the cause of the split , including the story that rudolf had an affair with adolf 's wife kaethe in 1940 .
monday 's football match was the first conciliatory gesture between the two companies , even though neither has belonged to the dassler family for years .
both companies have become international leaders in the sportswear field , with puma signing a sponsorship deal with record-breaking sprinter usain bolt .
for its part , adidas recently extended its partnership with the football organization uefa , providing equipment for all international football tournaments until 2017 .
according to the german financial newspaper handelsblatt , adidas is currently the second biggest sportswear manufacturer in the world behind nike , while puma is third .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : puma makes usain bolt 's running shoes the sporting event was held in support of the peace one day initiative , set up by film-maker jeremy gilley in 1999 .
the initiative , which was adopted in 2001 as part of the un 's international day of peace on september 21 , was meant to establish an annual day of global ceasefire and non-violence with a fixed calendar date. bk / afp / reuters / ap editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the camp was used as a base for risky attempts to reach britain . britain 's home secretary alan johnson said the action taken in calais would " disrupt illegal immigration and people-trafficking routes . "
french police cleared and then bulldozed the makeshift forest camp - known as the " jungle " - near the northern city of calais on tuesday morning .
" i welcome the swift and decisive steps that the french government has taken today to close the " jungle " in calais , " johnson said .
the prefect of the region told journalists after the two-hour operation that 278 migrants had been taken into custody , nearly half of them minors .
the adults were temporarily jailed , while the minors were placed in " specialized centers , " he said .
the immigrants , mostly afghans , had hoped to travel the 35 kilometers across the english channel into britain .
an end to criminal trafficking the operation by hundreds of police officers was the final step in a months-long undertaking by the french government to remove the camp .
britain and france had agreed earlier this year to step up efforts against illegal migrants by strengthening border security with state-of-the-art technology and closer cooperation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : besson warned of more raids to come on nearby squatter camps france 's immigration minister eric besson told rtl radio that the dismantling of the camp was justified , calling the site a " base camp for human traffickers . "
the police operation " targeted the tools of the criminal gangs who sell migrants passage to britain , exploit them and have them living in what had become an open air garbage dump , " he said .
besson said that each migrant would be offered an " individual solution " and given the choice to leave voluntarily , apply for asylum or be forcibly deported .
aid groups predict , though , that many of the immigrants will simply end up back on the streets .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : the long road to copenhagen experts express little optimism ahead of copenhagen summit brown , sarkozy propose multi-billion-dollar climate fund for poor nations hacker scandal sends ripples through climate-science community world leaders favor delaying a binding climate change deal climate -pipe- 22.09.2009 cutting carbon emissions wo n't stop climate change , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lomborg says the world faces more pressing problems than emissions as world leaders meet at the un to discuss climate change , bjorn lomborg tells dw he expects little to come from the talks .
he tells politicians there are better ways to spend billions than on fighting climate change . the author of " the skeptical environmentalist , " bjorn lomborg , has had public disagreements with climate activists including al gore and sir nicholas stern .
lomborg 's harshest criticism , however , is aimed at the international community for spending billions on what he says are ineffective measures intended to fight climate change . he talked to deutsche welle about ongoing climate negotiations and how economists at the copenhagen consensus center , a think tank he heads , suggest spending aid and development money . deutsche welle : what do you think will emerge from the climate talks taking place at the united nations on tuesday ? bjorn lomborg : first of all , i think it 's important to recognize that probably nothing will come out of this , simply because they are so far away from the different nations on what they want to achieve . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lomborg , a danish statistician , questions environmental orthodoxy it 's always good to talk about the problem , and i think it 's good to reaffirm to everybody that we need a deal in copenhagen by the end of this year .
the problem is the focus on cutting carbon emissions is actually one that both makes it very hard for everyone to agree because the chinese and the indians do n't want to cut and while the europeans and the americans claim they want to cut , they actually also know that it 's going to cost them a lot , and it 's going to have very little benefit even in the far-off future .
that 's why they are all playing for the gallery but nobody is actually willing to really commit . the chinese leader has said he will present china 's new plans for tackling global warming at the summit .
is n't that a positive signal ? it could be .
but let 's remember that the chinese have been doing a lot of posturing on climate change and coming out and suggesting that we might even see china 's emissions maxing out in 2050 or maybe even in 2040 .
but let 's not base our hopes for a climate deal on things that will happen in 20 or 40 years . if you had to give tips to the participants , what would you advise them to talk about ? we 've run what we call the copenhagen consensus for climate , where we ask top economists , including three nobel laureates " where do you do the most good for climate with the money you 're going to be spending ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could salt particulates help cool the earth in the short-term ?
what they told us was do n't focus on cutting carbon emissions .
it 's very expensive and does very little good for the climate even 100 years from now .
in the short and medium-term , we should recognize that nothing we do will change the temperature development except looking into geo-engineering , essentially making the planet cooler - for instance by spraying up salt particulates in the atmosphere , which will amplify natural processes , make more white clouds and hence make the world a little more reflective - especially over the south pacific .
that would be very cheap and could potentially avoid global warming for the next 100 years . this is still a band-aid , so what you also need to do is more toward a situation where we can actually get people to not just talk about cutting carbon emissions but actually doing so , and we will only do that if cutting carbon emissions and green energy technologies become much , much cheaper .
that 's why their second solution was to focus on making much cheaper green energy technologies - cheaper solar panels , cheaper windmills - that will actually work . those two in conjunction is what i would like to see world leaders focus on a lot more , if we actually care about fixing climate change not just making beautiful speeches . at the moment we also have to concentrate on adaptation to climate change .
its effects are already becoming very visible .
where would your priorities lie in that area ? i 'm referring to top economists , rather than my own private opinions .
what they found is we are very often being told that there is a huge amount of impacts from climate change right now , and it 's certainly true that there are a lot of good pictures out there where you can show here 's a catastrophe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lomborg says poverty impacts people 's lives more than climate change but what we fail to recognize is that the vast majority of the impact that we are seeing right now - climate impacts and other impacts - are impacts that have been there for hundreds of years .
most of this world 's population is poor and they 're ill-prepared to deal with any contingency that the world throws at them .
what we need to focus on is not just adaption specifically for climate change , which is a small part of the problems most people live with right now , but simply making better lives for people that is focusing on getting them more food , getting them better healthcare and making sure their kids get educated . the world 's doctors have said failure to tackle climate change in copenhagen could be catastrophic for health .
is it possible to separate climate change from issues like health , food security or a safe water supply ? we do n't need to separate them in the sense that we probably all agree we should tackle some of the really big problems that are out there right now .
i 'm simply concerned that many people latch on to talking about global warming and that the most important this is spending money on adaptation to global warming . but the main problem in bangladesh or myanmar is not future sea-level rises , it 's the fact that the countries are so poor right now that they are already getting inundated .
it 's not about climate-proofing it in 100 years , it 's about dealing with the vulnerability to climate right now , which has nothing to do with climate change but simply something to do with them being very poor . it 's more about an emphasis on focusing where you can actually deal with real problems right now rather than a possible problem in 100 years . interview : irene quaile -lrb- sms -rrb- editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

prosecutors are exploring possible legal action . in the two-page letter , which is phrased as an official announcement , the berlin branch of the national democratic party , or npd , called on various politicians to leave germany .

according to news magazine focus , the steps include withdrawing the right to social welfare and the right to own real estate on german soil .
in the meantime , the letter suggests , immigrants should " already start " looking for work and shelter in their " native " countries .
the letter is signed by the " commissioner for the repatriation of foreigners . "
but it also makes clear that it is written by joerg haehnel , chairman of the berlin npd .
state prosecutors are now exploring the possibility of prosecuting haehnel for incitement .
weary reaction green party politician özcan mutlu , who regularly receives far-right hate-mail both by e-mail and post , was unimpressed by the offensive letter : " they still do n't understand that this country is our country too .
the only immigrants who might be shocked by this letter are those that do n't recognize it for what it is : a cheap campaign trick . "

he tells politicians there are better ways to spend billions than on fighting climate change . the author of " the skeptical environmentalist , " bjorn lomborg , has had public disagreements with climate activists including al gore and sir nicholas stern .
lomborg 's harshest criticism , however , is aimed at the international community for spending billions on what he says are ineffective measures intended to fight climate change . he talked to deutsche welle about ongoing climate negotiations and how economists at the copenhagen consensus center , a think tank he heads , suggest spending aid and development money . deutsche welle : what do you think will emerge from the climate talks taking place at the united nations on tuesday ? bjorn lomborg : first of all , i think it 's important to recognize that probably nothing will come out of this , simply because they are so far away from the different nations on what they want to achieve . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lomborg , a danish statistician , questions environmental orthodoxy it 's always good to talk about the problem , and i think it 's good to reaffirm to everybody that we need a deal in copenhagen by the end of this year .
the problem is the focus on cutting carbon emissions is actually one that both makes it very hard for everyone to agree because the chinese and the indians do n't want to cut and while the europeans and the americans claim they want to cut , they actually also know that it 's going to cost them a lot , and it 's going to have very little benefit even in the far-off future .
that 's why they are all playing for the gallery but nobody is actually willing to really commit . the chinese leader has said he will present china 's new plans for tackling global warming at the summit .
is n't that a positive signal ? it could be .
but let 's remember that the chinese have been doing a lot of posturing on climate change and coming out and suggesting that we might even see china 's emissions maxing out in 2050 or maybe even in 2040 .
but let 's not base our hopes for a climate deal on things that will happen in 20 or 40 years . if you had to give tips to the participants , what would you advise them to talk about ? we 've run what we call the copenhagen consensus for climate , where we ask top economists , including three nobel laureates " where do you do the most good for climate with the money you 're going to be spending ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could salt particulates help cool the earth in the short-term ?
what they told us was do n't focus on cutting carbon emissions .
it 's very expensive and does very little good for the climate even 100 years from now .
in the short and medium-term , we should recognize that nothing we do will change the temperature development except looking into geo-engineering , essentially making the planet cooler - for instance by spraying up salt particulates in the atmosphere , which will amplify natural processes , make more white clouds and hence make the world a little more reflective - especially over the south pacific .
that would be very cheap and could potentially avoid global warming for the next 100 years . this is still a band-aid , so what you also need to do is more toward a situation where we can actually get people to not just talk about cutting carbon emissions but actually doing so , and we will only do that if cutting carbon emissions and green energy technologies become much , much cheaper .
that 's why their second solution was to focus on making much cheaper green energy technologies - cheaper solar panels , cheaper windmills - that will actually work . those two in conjunction is what i would like to see world leaders focus on a lot more , if we actually care about fixing climate change not just making beautiful speeches . at the moment we also have to concentrate on adaptation to climate change .
its effects are already becoming very visible .
where would your priorities lie in that area ? i 'm referring to top economists , rather than my own private opinions .
what they found is we are very often being told that there is a huge amount of impacts from climate change right now , and it 's certainly true that there are a lot of good pictures out there where you can show here 's a catastrophe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lomborg says poverty impacts people 's lives more than climate change but what we fail to recognize is that the vast majority of the impact that we are seeing right now - climate impacts and other impacts - are impacts that have been there for hundreds of years .
most of this world 's population is poor and they 're ill-prepared to deal with any contingency that the world throws at them .
what we need to focus on is not just adaption specifically for climate change , which is a small part of the problems most people live with right now , but simply making better lives for people that is focusing on getting them more food , getting them better healthcare and making sure their kids get educated . the world 's doctors have said failure to tackle climate change in copenhagen could be catastrophic for health .
is it possible to separate climate change from issues like health , food security or a safe water supply ? we do n't need to separate them in the sense that we probably all agree we should tackle some of the really big problems that are out there right now .
i 'm simply concerned that many people latch on to talking about global warming and that the most important this is spending money on adaptation to global warming . but the main problem in bangladesh or myanmar is not future sea-level rises , it 's the fact that the countries are so poor right now that they are already getting inundated .
it 's not about climate-proofing it in 100 years , it 's about dealing with the vulnerability to climate right now , which has nothing to do with climate change but simply something to do with them being very poor . it 's more about an emphasis on focusing where you can actually deal with real problems right now rather than a possible problem in 100 years . interview : irene quaile -lrb- sms -rrb- editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : the long road to copenhagen experts express little optimism ahead of copenhagen summit brown , sarkozy propose multi-billion-dollar climate fund for poor nations hacker scandal sends ripples through climate-science community world leaders favor delaying a binding climate change deal climate -pipe- 22.09.2009 cutting carbon emissions wo n't stop climate change , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lomborg says the world faces more pressing problems than emissions as world leaders meet at the un to discuss climate change , bjorn lomborg tells dw he expects little to come from the talks .
he tells politicians there are better ways to spend billions than on fighting climate change . the author of " the skeptical environmentalist , " bjorn lomborg , has had public disagreements with climate activists including al gore and sir nicholas stern .
lomborg 's harshest criticism , however , is aimed at the international community for spending billions on what he says are ineffective measures intended to fight climate change . he talked to deutsche welle about ongoing climate negotiations and how economists at the copenhagen consensus center , a think tank he heads , suggest spending aid and development money . deutsche welle : what do you think will emerge from the climate talks taking place at the united nations on tuesday ? bjorn lomborg : first of all , i think it 's important to recognize that probably nothing will come out of this , simply because they are so far away from the different nations on what they want to achieve . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lomborg , a danish statistician , questions environmental orthodoxy it 's always good to talk about the problem , and i think it 's good to reaffirm to everybody that we need a deal in copenhagen by the end of this year .
the problem is the focus on cutting carbon emissions is actually one that both makes it very hard for everyone to agree because the chinese and the indians do n't want to cut and while the europeans and the americans claim they want to cut , they actually also know that it 's going to cost them a lot , and it 's going to have very little benefit even in the far-off future .
that 's why they are all playing for the gallery but nobody is actually willing to really commit . the chinese leader has said he will present china 's new plans for tackling global warming at the summit .
is n't that a positive signal ? it could be .
but let 's remember that the chinese have been doing a lot of posturing on climate change and coming out and suggesting that we might even see china 's emissions maxing out in 2050 or maybe even in 2040 .
but let 's not base our hopes for a climate deal on things that will happen in 20 or 40 years . if you had to give tips to the participants , what would you advise them to talk about ? we 've run what we call the copenhagen consensus for climate , where we ask top economists , including three nobel laureates " where do you do the most good for climate with the money you 're going to be spending ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could salt particulates help cool the earth in the short-term ?
what they told us was do n't focus on cutting carbon emissions .
it 's very expensive and does very little good for the climate even 100 years from now .
in the short and medium-term , we should recognize that nothing we do will change the temperature development except looking into geo-engineering , essentially making the planet cooler - for instance by spraying up salt particulates in the atmosphere , which will amplify natural processes , make more white clouds and hence make the world a little more reflective - especially over the south pacific .
that would be very cheap and could potentially avoid global warming for the next 100 years . this is still a band-aid , so what you also need to do is more toward a situation where we can actually get people to not just talk about cutting carbon emissions but actually doing so , and we will only do that if cutting carbon emissions and green energy technologies become much , much cheaper .
that 's why their second solution was to focus on making much cheaper green energy technologies - cheaper solar panels , cheaper windmills - that will actually work . those two in conjunction is what i would like to see world leaders focus on a lot more , if we actually care about fixing climate change not just making beautiful speeches . at the moment we also have to concentrate on adaptation to climate change .
its effects are already becoming very visible .
where would your priorities lie in that area ? i 'm referring to top economists , rather than my own private opinions .
what they found is we are very often being told that there is a huge amount of impacts from climate change right now , and it 's certainly true that there are a lot of good pictures out there where you can show here 's a catastrophe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lomborg says poverty impacts people 's lives more than climate change but what we fail to recognize is that the vast majority of the impact that we are seeing right now - climate impacts and other impacts - are impacts that have been there for hundreds of years .
most of this world 's population is poor and they 're ill-prepared to deal with any contingency that the world throws at them .
what we need to focus on is not just adaption specifically for climate change , which is a small part of the problems most people live with right now , but simply making better lives for people that is focusing on getting them more food , getting them better healthcare and making sure their kids get educated . the world 's doctors have said failure to tackle climate change in copenhagen could be catastrophic for health .
is it possible to separate climate change from issues like health , food security or a safe water supply ? we do n't need to separate them in the sense that we probably all agree we should tackle some of the really big problems that are out there right now .
i 'm simply concerned that many people latch on to talking about global warming and that the most important this is spending money on adaptation to global warming . but the main problem in bangladesh or myanmar is not future sea-level rises , it 's the fact that the countries are so poor right now that they are already getting inundated .
it 's not about climate-proofing it in 100 years , it 's about dealing with the vulnerability to climate right now , which has nothing to do with climate change but simply something to do with them being very poor . it 's more about an emphasis on focusing where you can actually deal with real problems right now rather than a possible problem in 100 years . interview : irene quaile -lrb- sms -rrb- editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : the long road to copenhagen experts express little optimism ahead of copenhagen summit brown , sarkozy propose multi-billion-dollar climate fund for poor nations hacker scandal sends ripples through climate-science community world leaders favor delaying a binding climate change deal climate -pipe- 22.09.2009 cutting carbon emissions wo n't stop climate change , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lomborg says the world faces more pressing problems than emissions as world leaders meet at the un to discuss climate change , bjorn lomborg tells dw he expects little to come from the talks .
he tells politicians there are better ways to spend billions than on fighting climate change . the author of " the skeptical environmentalist , " bjorn lomborg , has had public disagreements with climate activists including al gore and sir nicholas stern .
lomborg 's harshest criticism , however , is aimed at the international community for spending billions on what he says are ineffective measures intended to fight climate change . he talked to deutsche welle about ongoing climate negotiations and how economists at the copenhagen consensus center , a think tank he heads , suggest spending aid and development money . deutsche welle : what do you think will emerge from the climate talks taking place at the united nations on tuesday ? bjorn lomborg : first of all , i think it 's important to recognize that probably nothing will come out of this , simply because they are so far away from the different nations on what they want to achieve . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lomborg , a danish statistician , questions environmental orthodoxy it 's always good to talk about the problem , and i think it 's good to reaffirm to everybody that we need a deal in copenhagen by the end of this year .
the problem is the focus on cutting carbon emissions is actually one that both makes it very hard for everyone to agree because the chinese and the indians do n't want to cut and while the europeans and the americans claim they want to cut , they actually also know that it 's going to cost them a lot , and it 's going to have very little benefit even in the far-off future .
that 's why they are all playing for the gallery but nobody is actually willing to really commit . the chinese leader has said he will present china 's new plans for tackling global warming at the summit .
is n't that a positive signal ? it could be .
but let 's remember that the chinese have been doing a lot of posturing on climate change and coming out and suggesting that we might even see china 's emissions maxing out in 2050 or maybe even in 2040 .
but let 's not base our hopes for a climate deal on things that will happen in 20 or 40 years . if you had to give tips to the participants , what would you advise them to talk about ? we 've run what we call the copenhagen consensus for climate , where we ask top economists , including three nobel laureates " where do you do the most good for climate with the money you 're going to be spending ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could salt particulates help cool the earth in the short-term ?
what they told us was do n't focus on cutting carbon emissions .
it 's very expensive and does very little good for the climate even 100 years from now .
in the short and medium-term , we should recognize that nothing we do will change the temperature development except looking into geo-engineering , essentially making the planet cooler - for instance by spraying up salt particulates in the atmosphere , which will amplify natural processes , make more white clouds and hence make the world a little more reflective - especially over the south pacific .
that would be very cheap and could potentially avoid global warming for the next 100 years . this is still a band-aid , so what you also need to do is more toward a situation where we can actually get people to not just talk about cutting carbon emissions but actually doing so , and we will only do that if cutting carbon emissions and green energy technologies become much , much cheaper .
that 's why their second solution was to focus on making much cheaper green energy technologies - cheaper solar panels , cheaper windmills - that will actually work . those two in conjunction is what i would like to see world leaders focus on a lot more , if we actually care about fixing climate change not just making beautiful speeches . at the moment we also have to concentrate on adaptation to climate change .
its effects are already becoming very visible .
where would your priorities lie in that area ? i 'm referring to top economists , rather than my own private opinions .
what they found is we are very often being told that there is a huge amount of impacts from climate change right now , and it 's certainly true that there are a lot of good pictures out there where you can show here 's a catastrophe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lomborg says poverty impacts people 's lives more than climate change but what we fail to recognize is that the vast majority of the impact that we are seeing right now - climate impacts and other impacts - are impacts that have been there for hundreds of years .
most of this world 's population is poor and they 're ill-prepared to deal with any contingency that the world throws at them .
what we need to focus on is not just adaption specifically for climate change , which is a small part of the problems most people live with right now , but simply making better lives for people that is focusing on getting them more food , getting them better healthcare and making sure their kids get educated . the world 's doctors have said failure to tackle climate change in copenhagen could be catastrophic for health .
is it possible to separate climate change from issues like health , food security or a safe water supply ? we do n't need to separate them in the sense that we probably all agree we should tackle some of the really big problems that are out there right now .
i 'm simply concerned that many people latch on to talking about global warming and that the most important this is spending money on adaptation to global warming . but the main problem in bangladesh or myanmar is not future sea-level rises , it 's the fact that the countries are so poor right now that they are already getting inundated .
it 's not about climate-proofing it in 100 years , it 's about dealing with the vulnerability to climate right now , which has nothing to do with climate change but simply something to do with them being very poor . it 's more about an emphasis on focusing where you can actually deal with real problems right now rather than a possible problem in 100 years . interview : irene quaile -lrb- sms -rrb- editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 22.09.2009 britain welcomes french raid on calais migrant camp großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the migrants lived under extremely poor conditions french riot police raze a camp housing mainly afghan immigrants as part of an agreement with britain to step up efforts against illegal migrants .
the camp was used as a base for risky attempts to reach britain . britain 's home secretary alan johnson said the action taken in calais would " disrupt illegal immigration and people-trafficking routes . "
french police cleared and then bulldozed the makeshift forest camp - known as the " jungle " - near the northern city of calais on tuesday morning .
" i welcome the swift and decisive steps that the french government has taken today to close the " jungle " in calais , " johnson said .
the prefect of the region told journalists after the two-hour operation that 278 migrants had been taken into custody , nearly half of them minors .
the adults were temporarily jailed , while the minors were placed in " specialized centers , " he said .
the immigrants , mostly afghans , had hoped to travel the 35 kilometers across the english channel into britain .
an end to criminal trafficking the operation by hundreds of police officers was the final step in a months-long undertaking by the french government to remove the camp .
britain and france had agreed earlier this year to step up efforts against illegal migrants by strengthening border security with state-of-the-art technology and closer cooperation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : besson warned of more raids to come on nearby squatter camps france 's immigration minister eric besson told rtl radio that the dismantling of the camp was justified , calling the site a " base camp for human traffickers . "
the police operation " targeted the tools of the criminal gangs who sell migrants passage to britain , exploit them and have them living in what had become an open air garbage dump , " he said .
besson said that each migrant would be offered an " individual solution " and given the choice to leave voluntarily , apply for asylum or be forcibly deported .
aid groups predict , though , that many of the immigrants will simply end up back on the streets .
" they are going to be scattered across the countryside , at the mercy of traffickers , " said jean-claude lenoir of the salam migrant support group .
" at least here , the young people had built a kind of community .
it 's tragic . "
problem of illegal immigration continues the un refugee agency unhcr said it recognized the need to combat smuggling and trafficking of persons and the right of the french government to maintain public order .
" closing the so-called jungle camp does , however , not address the phenomenon of mixed and irregular migration , nor does it solve the problems of the people concerned , amongst whom there may be many with protection needs , " unhcr spokesman andrej mahecic said at a press briefing in geneva on tuesday .
bildunterschrift : the migrants had gathered before their evacuation to demonstrate their plight unhcr called on the french authorities to ensure that those who wish to apply for refugee protection were given access to " a full and fair asylum procedure , " mahecic said .
" the situation in calais underscores , once again , the need for governments in europe to intensify efforts to arrive at a common european asylum system , not only on paper , but also in practice , " he said .
besson said the calais crisis was partly caused by the lack of a coherent european union migration policy .
he said states should agree to share the asylum burden more fairly , while boosting the powers of the eu border police , frontex. sac / ap / afp / dpa editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she eliminated her main rival , egyptian culture minister farouk hosny , after five rounds of voting by the paris-based agency 's executive council .
bokova , a former communist turned europhile , has represented bulgaria on unesco 's board since 2007 and is also her country 's ambassador to france and monaco .
the process of finding a successor for incumbent director general koichira matsuura has been plagued by controversy from the start , primarily due to hosny 's nomination .
anti-semitic remarks the 71-year-old hosny , who had hoped to become the first arab to head the un agency , has been accused of anti-semitism because he has publicly derided israeli culture .
last year , he said he would personally burn any israeli book found in the library of alexandria .
he has since apologized for his statements , but has not been able to satisfy his detractors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hosny outraged many jews with his 2008 comments vowing to burn israeli books the latest public personality to come out against hosny 's candidature was former french minister and auschwitz survivor simone weil , who was quoted in tuesday 's edition of the daily ‘ liberation ' as saying that hosny 's statements " raise many questions for me . "
the controversial egyptian minister and the bulgarian diplomat were the only candidates remaining in the race after the first four rounds of voting .
in monday 's fourth round , bokova and hosni both received 29 votes from the 58-member executive board , setting up a tense finish to what turned out to be an historic election .
first woman chief 57-year-old bokova will become the first woman to head the agency after unesco 's general conference , which consists of representatives of member states , approves her appointment when it meets in october .
in the past , whoever emerged as winner of the council 's election has been automatically accepted by the general conference. rb / afp / ap / reuters editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the camp was used as a base for risky attempts to reach britain . britain 's home secretary alan johnson said the action taken in calais would " disrupt illegal immigration and people-trafficking routes . "
french police cleared and then bulldozed the makeshift forest camp - known as the " jungle " - near the northern city of calais on tuesday morning .
" i welcome the swift and decisive steps that the french government has taken today to close the " jungle " in calais , " johnson said .
the prefect of the region told journalists after the two-hour operation that 278 migrants had been taken into custody , nearly half of them minors .
the adults were temporarily jailed , while the minors were placed in " specialized centers , " he said .
the immigrants , mostly afghans , had hoped to travel the 35 kilometers across the english channel into britain .
an end to criminal trafficking the operation by hundreds of police officers was the final step in a months-long undertaking by the french government to remove the camp .
britain and france had agreed earlier this year to step up efforts against illegal migrants by strengthening border security with state-of-the-art technology and closer cooperation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : besson warned of more raids to come on nearby squatter camps france 's immigration minister eric besson told rtl radio that the dismantling of the camp was justified , calling the site a " base camp for human traffickers . "
the police operation " targeted the tools of the criminal gangs who sell migrants passage to britain , exploit them and have them living in what had become an open air garbage dump , " he said .
besson said that each migrant would be offered an " individual solution " and given the choice to leave voluntarily , apply for asylum or be forcibly deported .
aid groups predict , though , that many of the immigrants will simply end up back on the streets .
" they are going to be scattered across the countryside , at the mercy of traffickers , " said jean-claude lenoir of the salam migrant support group .
" at least here , the young people had built a kind of community .
it 's tragic . "
problem of illegal immigration continues the un refugee agency unhcr said it recognized the need to combat smuggling and trafficking of persons and the right of the french government to maintain public order .
" closing the so-called jungle camp does , however , not address the phenomenon of mixed and irregular migration , nor does it solve the problems of the people concerned , amongst whom there may be many with protection needs , " unhcr spokesman andrej mahecic said at a press briefing in geneva on tuesday .
bildunterschrift : the migrants had gathered before their evacuation to demonstrate their plight unhcr called on the french authorities to ensure that those who wish to apply for refugee protection were given access to " a full and fair asylum procedure , " mahecic said .
" the situation in calais underscores , once again , the need for governments in europe to intensify efforts to arrive at a common european asylum system , not only on paper , but also in practice , " he said .
besson said the calais crisis was partly caused by the lack of a coherent european union migration policy .
he said states should agree to share the asylum burden more fairly , while boosting the powers of the eu border police , frontex. sac / ap / afp / dpa editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

greece took in almost 6.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.25 billion -rrb- more from the eu 's budget than it paid into it in 2008 , according to the commission .
the bulk of that money came in payments to greek farmers and in eu funding for infrastructure projects such as highways and ports .
greece was far ahead of eu newcomer poland in the eu 's net handouts list .
poland 's net income from the eu 's budget actually fell by some three-quarters of a billion euros to 4.4 billion euros last year .
the drop owed largely to a reduction in eu payments to polish farmers .
observers say this is likely to provoke heated comments from warsaw , which has frequently accused the eu of treating the countries that joined in 2004 and 2007 less generously than older member states .
german payments hit historic highs at the other end of the scale , germany , the eu 's biggest member , paid almost 8.8 billion euros more into the budget than it received .
this marks the biggest contribution by the country in the last 10 years .
germany 's payment amounts to more than double that of the next biggest contributors , italy and france , which paid around a net 4 billion euros to the fund each .
the three countries are , however , far ahead of the eu 's other heavyweight , britain , whose net contribution fell from over 4 billion euros in 2007 to under 1 billion euros in 2008 .
in terms of absolute receipts , france maintained its position as the largest recipient of eu funds , ahead of spain , germany and italy .
britain , the eu 's third-largest economy , was only the seventh-largest recipient of funding .
the news comes as the the european commission is drawing up plans to reform the bloc 's budgetary process in a move that analysts say will likely spark a rancorous debate between countries which receive the most money from the bloc and those who pay the most into it. rb / dpa / reuters editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hainer played in attack , while zeitz was goalkeeper .
the game was meant to bring a symbolic end to one of germany 's most infamous family feuds , which began in 1948 when a row between brothers rudolf and adolf dassler split the family sportswear business , already a major supplier in the field , into two camps .
rudolf founded puma in 1948 , while adolf , or adi , dassler founded adidas in 1949 .
their rivalry divided the dasslers ' home town of 23,000 people , where competing factories were built on opposite sides of the aurach river .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adidas provides the soccer balls for the world cup skeletons in the sportswear closet there are plenty of rumors about the cause of the split , including the story that rudolf had an affair with adolf 's wife kaethe in 1940 .
monday 's football match was the first conciliatory gesture between the two companies , even though neither has belonged to the dassler family for years .
both companies have become international leaders in the sportswear field , with puma signing a sponsorship deal with record-breaking sprinter usain bolt .
for its part , adidas recently extended its partnership with the football organization uefa , providing equipment for all international football tournaments until 2017 .
according to the german financial newspaper handelsblatt , adidas is currently the second biggest sportswear manufacturer in the world behind nike , while puma is third .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : puma makes usain bolt 's running shoes the sporting event was held in support of the peace one day initiative , set up by film-maker jeremy gilley in 1999 .
the initiative , which was adopted in 2001 as part of the un 's international day of peace on september 21 , was meant to establish an annual day of global ceasefire and non-violence with a fixed calendar date. bk / afp / reuters / ap editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : the long road to copenhagen experts express little optimism ahead of copenhagen summit brown , sarkozy propose multi-billion-dollar climate fund for poor nations hacker scandal sends ripples through climate-science community world leaders favor delaying a binding climate change deal climate -pipe- 22.09.2009 cutting carbon emissions wo n't stop climate change , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lomborg says the world faces more pressing problems than emissions as world leaders meet at the un to discuss climate change , bjorn lomborg tells dw he expects little to come from the talks .
he tells politicians there are better ways to spend billions than on fighting climate change . the author of " the skeptical environmentalist , " bjorn lomborg , has had public disagreements with climate activists including al gore and sir nicholas stern .
lomborg 's harshest criticism , however , is aimed at the international community for spending billions on what he says are ineffective measures intended to fight climate change . he talked to deutsche welle about ongoing climate negotiations and how economists at the copenhagen consensus center , a think tank he heads , suggest spending aid and development money . deutsche welle : what do you think will emerge from the climate talks taking place at the united nations on tuesday ? bjorn lomborg : first of all , i think it 's important to recognize that probably nothing will come out of this , simply because they are so far away from the different nations on what they want to achieve . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lomborg , a danish statistician , questions environmental orthodoxy it 's always good to talk about the problem , and i think it 's good to reaffirm to everybody that we need a deal in copenhagen by the end of this year .
the problem is the focus on cutting carbon emissions is actually one that both makes it very hard for everyone to agree because the chinese and the indians do n't want to cut and while the europeans and the americans claim they want to cut , they actually also know that it 's going to cost them a lot , and it 's going to have very little benefit even in the far-off future .
that 's why they are all playing for the gallery but nobody is actually willing to really commit . the chinese leader has said he will present china 's new plans for tackling global warming at the summit .
is n't that a positive signal ? it could be .
but let 's remember that the chinese have been doing a lot of posturing on climate change and coming out and suggesting that we might even see china 's emissions maxing out in 2050 or maybe even in 2040 .
but let 's not base our hopes for a climate deal on things that will happen in 20 or 40 years . if you had to give tips to the participants , what would you advise them to talk about ? we 've run what we call the copenhagen consensus for climate , where we ask top economists , including three nobel laureates " where do you do the most good for climate with the money you 're going to be spending ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could salt particulates help cool the earth in the short-term ?
what they told us was do n't focus on cutting carbon emissions .
it 's very expensive and does very little good for the climate even 100 years from now .
in the short and medium-term , we should recognize that nothing we do will change the temperature development except looking into geo-engineering , essentially making the planet cooler - for instance by spraying up salt particulates in the atmosphere , which will amplify natural processes , make more white clouds and hence make the world a little more reflective - especially over the south pacific .
that would be very cheap and could potentially avoid global warming for the next 100 years . this is still a band-aid , so what you also need to do is more toward a situation where we can actually get people to not just talk about cutting carbon emissions but actually doing so , and we will only do that if cutting carbon emissions and green energy technologies become much , much cheaper .
that 's why their second solution was to focus on making much cheaper green energy technologies - cheaper solar panels , cheaper windmills - that will actually work . those two in conjunction is what i would like to see world leaders focus on a lot more , if we actually care about fixing climate change not just making beautiful speeches . at the moment we also have to concentrate on adaptation to climate change .
its effects are already becoming very visible .
where would your priorities lie in that area ? i 'm referring to top economists , rather than my own private opinions .
what they found is we are very often being told that there is a huge amount of impacts from climate change right now , and it 's certainly true that there are a lot of good pictures out there where you can show here 's a catastrophe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lomborg says poverty impacts people 's lives more than climate change but what we fail to recognize is that the vast majority of the impact that we are seeing right now - climate impacts and other impacts - are impacts that have been there for hundreds of years .
most of this world 's population is poor and they 're ill-prepared to deal with any contingency that the world throws at them .
what we need to focus on is not just adaption specifically for climate change , which is a small part of the problems most people live with right now , but simply making better lives for people that is focusing on getting them more food , getting them better healthcare and making sure their kids get educated . the world 's doctors have said failure to tackle climate change in copenhagen could be catastrophic for health .
is it possible to separate climate change from issues like health , food security or a safe water supply ? we do n't need to separate them in the sense that we probably all agree we should tackle some of the really big problems that are out there right now .
i 'm simply concerned that many people latch on to talking about global warming and that the most important this is spending money on adaptation to global warming . but the main problem in bangladesh or myanmar is not future sea-level rises , it 's the fact that the countries are so poor right now that they are already getting inundated .
it 's not about climate-proofing it in 100 years , it 's about dealing with the vulnerability to climate right now , which has nothing to do with climate change but simply something to do with them being very poor . it 's more about an emphasis on focusing where you can actually deal with real problems right now rather than a possible problem in 100 years . interview : irene quaile -lrb- sms -rrb- editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de myriad climate talks necessary to reach any deal , experts say climate is high on the agenda in the usa at yet another round of climate conferences , one of many held around the world .

the camp was used as a base for risky attempts to reach britain . britain 's home secretary alan johnson said the action taken in calais would " disrupt illegal immigration and people-trafficking routes . "
french police cleared and then bulldozed the makeshift forest camp - known as the " jungle " - near the northern city of calais on tuesday morning .
" i welcome the swift and decisive steps that the french government has taken today to close the " jungle " in calais , " johnson said .
the prefect of the region told journalists after the two-hour operation that 278 migrants had been taken into custody , nearly half of them minors .
the adults were temporarily jailed , while the minors were placed in " specialized centers , " he said .
the immigrants , mostly afghans , had hoped to travel the 35 kilometers across the english channel into britain .
an end to criminal trafficking the operation by hundreds of police officers was the final step in a months-long undertaking by the french government to remove the camp .

besson said that each migrant would be offered an " individual solution " and given the choice to leave voluntarily , apply for asylum or be forcibly deported .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : the long road to copenhagen experts express little optimism ahead of copenhagen summit brown , sarkozy propose multi-billion-dollar climate fund for poor nations hacker scandal sends ripples through climate-science community world leaders favor delaying a binding climate change deal climate -pipe- 22.09.2009 cutting carbon emissions wo n't stop climate change , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lomborg says the world faces more pressing problems than emissions as world leaders meet at the un to discuss climate change , bjorn lomborg tells dw he expects little to come from the talks .
he tells politicians there are better ways to spend billions than on fighting climate change . the author of " the skeptical environmentalist , " bjorn lomborg , has had public disagreements with climate activists including al gore and sir nicholas stern .
lomborg 's harshest criticism , however , is aimed at the international community for spending billions on what he says are ineffective measures intended to fight climate change . he talked to deutsche welle about ongoing climate negotiations and how economists at the copenhagen consensus center , a think tank he heads , suggest spending aid and development money . deutsche welle : what do you think will emerge from the climate talks taking place at the united nations on tuesday ? bjorn lomborg : first of all , i think it 's important to recognize that probably nothing will come out of this , simply because they are so far away from the different nations on what they want to achieve . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lomborg , a danish statistician , questions environmental orthodoxy it 's always good to talk about the problem , and i think it 's good to reaffirm to everybody that we need a deal in copenhagen by the end of this year .
the problem is the focus on cutting carbon emissions is actually one that both makes it very hard for everyone to agree because the chinese and the indians do n't want to cut and while the europeans and the americans claim they want to cut , they actually also know that it 's going to cost them a lot , and it 's going to have very little benefit even in the far-off future .
that 's why they are all playing for the gallery but nobody is actually willing to really commit . the chinese leader has said he will present china 's new plans for tackling global warming at the summit .
is n't that a positive signal ? it could be .
but let 's remember that the chinese have been doing a lot of posturing on climate change and coming out and suggesting that we might even see china 's emissions maxing out in 2050 or maybe even in 2040 .
but let 's not base our hopes for a climate deal on things that will happen in 20 or 40 years . if you had to give tips to the participants , what would you advise them to talk about ? we 've run what we call the copenhagen consensus for climate , where we ask top economists , including three nobel laureates " where do you do the most good for climate with the money you 're going to be spending ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could salt particulates help cool the earth in the short-term ?
what they told us was do n't focus on cutting carbon emissions .
it 's very expensive and does very little good for the climate even 100 years from now .
in the short and medium-term , we should recognize that nothing we do will change the temperature development except looking into geo-engineering , essentially making the planet cooler - for instance by spraying up salt particulates in the atmosphere , which will amplify natural processes , make more white clouds and hence make the world a little more reflective - especially over the south pacific .
that would be very cheap and could potentially avoid global warming for the next 100 years . this is still a band-aid , so what you also need to do is more toward a situation where we can actually get people to not just talk about cutting carbon emissions but actually doing so , and we will only do that if cutting carbon emissions and green energy technologies become much , much cheaper .
that 's why their second solution was to focus on making much cheaper green energy technologies - cheaper solar panels , cheaper windmills - that will actually work . those two in conjunction is what i would like to see world leaders focus on a lot more , if we actually care about fixing climate change not just making beautiful speeches . at the moment we also have to concentrate on adaptation to climate change .
its effects are already becoming very visible .
where would your priorities lie in that area ? i 'm referring to top economists , rather than my own private opinions .
what they found is we are very often being told that there is a huge amount of impacts from climate change right now , and it 's certainly true that there are a lot of good pictures out there where you can show here 's a catastrophe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lomborg says poverty impacts people 's lives more than climate change but what we fail to recognize is that the vast majority of the impact that we are seeing right now - climate impacts and other impacts - are impacts that have been there for hundreds of years .
most of this world 's population is poor and they 're ill-prepared to deal with any contingency that the world throws at them .
what we need to focus on is not just adaption specifically for climate change , which is a small part of the problems most people live with right now , but simply making better lives for people that is focusing on getting them more food , getting them better healthcare and making sure their kids get educated . the world 's doctors have said failure to tackle climate change in copenhagen could be catastrophic for health .
is it possible to separate climate change from issues like health , food security or a safe water supply ? we do n't need to separate them in the sense that we probably all agree we should tackle some of the really big problems that are out there right now .
i 'm simply concerned that many people latch on to talking about global warming and that the most important this is spending money on adaptation to global warming . but the main problem in bangladesh or myanmar is not future sea-level rises , it 's the fact that the countries are so poor right now that they are already getting inundated .
it 's not about climate-proofing it in 100 years , it 's about dealing with the vulnerability to climate right now , which has nothing to do with climate change but simply something to do with them being very poor . it 's more about an emphasis on focusing where you can actually deal with real problems right now rather than a possible problem in 100 years . interview : irene quaile -lrb- sms -rrb- editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 22.09.2009 greece tops 2008 eu handouts list as german payments hit new high großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's net payout of 8.8 billion euros is the highest in a decade a european commission report shows that greece and poland were the biggest beneficiaries of the eu 's budget in 2008 , while germany paid the most into the bloc ’ s coffers . officials from the european commission , the executive arm of the european union , said in brussels on tuesday that greece received more money from its eu membership than any other country in 2008 .
greece took in almost 6.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.25 billion -rrb- more from the eu 's budget than it paid into it in 2008 , according to the commission .
the bulk of that money came in payments to greek farmers and in eu funding for infrastructure projects such as highways and ports .
greece was far ahead of eu newcomer poland in the eu 's net handouts list .
poland 's net income from the eu 's budget actually fell by some three-quarters of a billion euros to 4.4 billion euros last year .
the drop owed largely to a reduction in eu payments to polish farmers .
observers say this is likely to provoke heated comments from warsaw , which has frequently accused the eu of treating the countries that joined in 2004 and 2007 less generously than older member states .
german payments hit historic highs at the other end of the scale , germany , the eu 's biggest member , paid almost 8.8 billion euros more into the budget than it received .
this marks the biggest contribution by the country in the last 10 years .
germany 's payment amounts to more than double that of the next biggest contributors , italy and france , which paid around a net 4 billion euros to the fund each .
the three countries are , however , far ahead of the eu 's other heavyweight , britain , whose net contribution fell from over 4 billion euros in 2007 to under 1 billion euros in 2008 .
in terms of absolute receipts , france maintained its position as the largest recipient of eu funds , ahead of spain , germany and italy .
britain , the eu 's third-largest economy , was only the seventh-largest recipient of funding .
the news comes as the the european commission is drawing up plans to reform the bloc 's budgetary process in a move that analysts say will likely spark a rancorous debate between countries which receive the most money from the bloc and those who pay the most into it. rb / dpa / reuters editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

greece took in almost 6.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.25 billion -rrb- more from the eu 's budget than it paid into it in 2008 , according to the commission .
the bulk of that money came in payments to greek farmers and in eu funding for infrastructure projects such as highways and ports .
greece was far ahead of eu newcomer poland in the eu 's net handouts list .
poland 's net income from the eu 's budget actually fell by some three-quarters of a billion euros to 4.4 billion euros last year .
the drop owed largely to a reduction in eu payments to polish farmers .
observers say this is likely to provoke heated comments from warsaw , which has frequently accused the eu of treating the countries that joined in 2004 and 2007 less generously than older member states .
german payments hit historic highs at the other end of the scale , germany , the eu 's biggest member , paid almost 8.8 billion euros more into the budget than it received .
this marks the biggest contribution by the country in the last 10 years .
germany 's payment amounts to more than double that of the next biggest contributors , italy and france , which paid around a net 4 billion euros to the fund each .
the three countries are , however , far ahead of the eu 's other heavyweight , britain , whose net contribution fell from over 4 billion euros in 2007 to under 1 billion euros in 2008 .
in terms of absolute receipts , france maintained its position as the largest recipient of eu funds , ahead of spain , germany and italy .
britain , the eu 's third-largest economy , was only the seventh-largest recipient of funding .
the news comes as the the european commission is drawing up plans to reform the bloc 's budgetary process in a move that analysts say will likely spark a rancorous debate between countries which receive the most money from the bloc and those who pay the most into it. rb / dpa / reuters editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as the fabled northeast passage comes a step closer to reality , some say it may end up a road seldom traveled . the two vessels successfully navigated the narrow strip of water off russia 's northern coast last week . the vessels had delivered their cargo of heavy industrial equipment , loaded in south korea , to novy port in western siberia , and were now continuing their voyage to nigeria , where they were due to deliver a shipment of steel pipes picked up in the russian port of arkhangelsk , according to the beluga shipping company , which owns the vessels . the voyage only became possible because of climate change . melting arctic sea ice has opened the way for ships to navigate the arctic waters and avoid the icebergs , floes and pack ice that have confounded previous attempts to use the route for trade . the arctic 's sea ice thawed to its third-lowest level on record this summer .
on sept .
12 , it covered around 5.1 million square kilometers -lrb- 2 million square miles -rrb- - around a million square kilometers more than in 2007 , which had the lowest coverage since records began some 30 years ago . the beluga fraternity and beluga foresight are the first western commercial ships to transit the northeast passage successfully , according to the bremen-based shipping company . until now , only parts of the route have been navigable at any given time , and they were only used by russian shipping companies .
the fraternity and foresight were accompanied by russian icebreakers , but never needed to call upon them for assistance . despite the fact that the trip took a long time to clear with russian authorities , who demanded large fees in return for their approval , the beluga shipping company said it was satisfied with the trip . " we have saved not only voyage time - around 10 days , worth around $ 200,000 - but also , we 've been able to save fossil fuels in the amount of around 200 tons per ship , and at a cost of around $ 90,000 , " said company spokesperson verena beckhusen . bildunterschrift : the northeast passage could shave some 5,400 km off some traditional routes time is money but savings in time and cash are n't likely to unleash an armada of merchant shipping on the arctic . the route is only practical for european trade with northeast asia , a fraction of the region 's total volume .
furthermore , only certain kinds of cargo will be worth sending via the northeast passage , said max johns , spokesperson for the german ship owners association . " container ships will always take the southern route because there are many more ports , " he said .
" container ships work a little bit like buses in a city .
they have to go from port to port and collect and deliver containers in every possible port otherwise it is not worthwhile running them . " the northeast passage makes most sense for specialist deliveries of heavy-lift cargo , or bulk quantities of commodities like coal , iron ore and oil , johns added . added complications , new attractions the passage is also only open for a six- to eight-week window each summer .
then there is the challenge of dealing with an expensive , and byzantine , russian bureaucracy : the beluga shipping company only won final approval for its voyage in august following an application process that took nearly a year . one underplayed aspect of beluga 's successful voyage is that it makes resource extraction in the region more attractive . " the extraction is the real attraction now when the ice melts , and especially russia has a very keen eye on that , " johns said .
" for us , as service providers , it may be interesting to transport that cargo to where it is being needed . " environmental hazard bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has been keen to stake its claim to parts of the arctic vast quantities of energy resources are believed to be located in the arctic .
with some countries already gearing up to exploit them , this is precisely the kind of cargo that concerns environmentalists most . " if there were an oil spill , either from shipping or from the extraction work which will also increase when the ice is going ... then combating it would be very difficult , " said ulrich claussen , who leads the german federal environment 's agency 's efforts to protect marine life . the cold and stormy weather conditions would complicate clean-up efforts from a technical point of view and would also hinder the region 's natural capacity to absorb damage , claussen added . " normally bacteria can degrade the oil , but the colder it is the less active bacteria normally are , " he said .
" there might be a very slow reaction from the environment .
in alaska , where the spill from the exxon valdez was , we can still see some signs of non-recovery now . " the beluga shipping company , however , is already planning another voyage through the northeastern passage for next year .
next year 's trip , again on behalf of general electric , will be an even bigger exercise , requiring ships around double the size of the fraternity and foresight . nathan witkop editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not all of them .
a quirk in the german electoral process awards larger parties a disproportionate number of parliamentary seats .
that increases the size of parliament and could give the cdu a decisive advantage in the coming vote . germany 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have repeated their warning that a new coalition led by chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- would be " illegitimate " if it were dependent upon winning additional seats that are awarded through an anomaly of the country 's election laws .
germans elect their representatives in a complicated process .
it involves dividing up the 598 seats in the bundestag , or parliament , into two groups , which are filled using two votes .
the first vote is for an actual candidate : each electoral district has candidates from one or several parties that campaign for a seat .
these seats are handed out in a simple , first-past-the-post majority , a system that often places smaller parties at a disadvantage .
two-vote system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier derided a coalition won on overhang seats the other 299 seats are allocated based on the second vote , which is for a party .
the votes of the 62 million germans eligible to take part in the election are added up and then divided by the number of parties .
those seats are then handed out to the people each party has put on a list , which is divided up among all 16 german states .
an example : in 2005 the conservative cdu and its bavarian sister party the csu took 35.2 percent of the vote for parties .
but 150 of their candidates were elected directly .
under german electoral law , if a party wins more direct seats than they would be entitled to under the votes cast for the party lists , then they are allowed to keep those extra seats and the total number in the bundestag simply goes up .
this is known as the ueberhangmandate , or " overhang seats . "
thus , the conservatives were awarded 246 parliamentary seats - some five percent more than the proportion of the party votes cast for them . if we take a local example , we see that the cdu won 31 out of 35 districts in the state of baden-wuerttemberg , which means they were entitled to 31 seats .
however , when its share of the second vote was tallied , it was actually only supposed to get 28 of the state 's 74 seats , meaning it got three extra seats .
at the moment , there are 611 seats in the bundestag , which include the 13 overhang seats that were created by the 2005 election .
the amount of overhang seats is determined anew by each election .
last week , merkel sparked debate by saying she was prepared to form a government with a coalition whose majority was based purely on these additional seats .
' not a second-class mandate ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to merkel , any win is a good win " a mandate based on overhang seats is no second class mandate , " the chancellor said during a press conference .
the spd 's parliamentary leader thomas oppermann responded that , if this were to happen , " for the first time in germany there would be a government which the voters did n't choose and did n't want . "
normally , this is n't a big deal .
back in 2005 it was n't enough to give the cdu anything close to a clear majority and they were forced to form a grand coalition with the spd .
however , in 1994 the cdu was granted 12 extra overhang seats , allowing helmut kohl to maintain his position as chancellor. mrm / dpa / reuters / afp editor : tony dunham send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not all of them .
a quirk in the german electoral process awards larger parties a disproportionate number of parliamentary seats .
that increases the size of parliament and could give the cdu a decisive advantage in the coming vote . germany 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have repeated their warning that a new coalition led by chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- would be " illegitimate " if it were dependent upon winning additional seats that are awarded through an anomaly of the country 's election laws .
germans elect their representatives in a complicated process .
it involves dividing up the 598 seats in the bundestag , or parliament , into two groups , which are filled using two votes .
the first vote is for an actual candidate : each electoral district has candidates from one or several parties that campaign for a seat .
these seats are handed out in a simple , first-past-the-post majority , a system that often places smaller parties at a disadvantage .
two-vote system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier derided a coalition won on overhang seats the other 299 seats are allocated based on the second vote , which is for a party .
the votes of the 62 million germans eligible to take part in the election are added up and then divided by the number of parties .
those seats are then handed out to the people each party has put on a list , which is divided up among all 16 german states .
an example : in 2005 the conservative cdu and its bavarian sister party the csu took 35.2 percent of the vote for parties .
but 150 of their candidates were elected directly .
under german electoral law , if a party wins more direct seats than they would be entitled to under the votes cast for the party lists , then they are allowed to keep those extra seats and the total number in the bundestag simply goes up .
this is known as the ueberhangmandate , or " overhang seats . "
thus , the conservatives were awarded 246 parliamentary seats - some five percent more than the proportion of the party votes cast for them . if we take a local example , we see that the cdu won 31 out of 35 districts in the state of baden-wuerttemberg , which means they were entitled to 31 seats .
however , when its share of the second vote was tallied , it was actually only supposed to get 28 of the state 's 74 seats , meaning it got three extra seats .
at the moment , there are 611 seats in the bundestag , which include the 13 overhang seats that were created by the 2005 election .
the amount of overhang seats is determined anew by each election .
last week , merkel sparked debate by saying she was prepared to form a government with a coalition whose majority was based purely on these additional seats .
' not a second-class mandate ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to merkel , any win is a good win " a mandate based on overhang seats is no second class mandate , " the chancellor said during a press conference .
the spd 's parliamentary leader thomas oppermann responded that , if this were to happen , " for the first time in germany there would be a government which the voters did n't choose and did n't want . "
normally , this is n't a big deal .

the camp was used as a base for risky attempts to reach britain . britain 's home secretary alan johnson said the action taken in calais would " disrupt illegal immigration and people-trafficking routes . "
french police cleared and then bulldozed the makeshift forest camp - known as the " jungle " - near the northern city of calais on tuesday morning .
" i welcome the swift and decisive steps that the french government has taken today to close the " jungle " in calais , " johnson said .
the prefect of the region told journalists after the two-hour operation that 278 migrants had been taken into custody , nearly half of them minors .
the adults were temporarily jailed , while the minors were placed in " specialized centers , " he said .
the immigrants , mostly afghans , had hoped to travel the 35 kilometers across the english channel into britain .
an end to criminal trafficking the operation by hundreds of police officers was the final step in a months-long undertaking by the french government to remove the camp .
britain and france had agreed earlier this year to step up efforts against illegal migrants by strengthening border security with state-of-the-art technology and closer cooperation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : besson warned of more raids to come on nearby squatter camps france 's immigration minister eric besson told rtl radio that the dismantling of the camp was justified , calling the site a " base camp for human traffickers . "
the police operation " targeted the tools of the criminal gangs who sell migrants passage to britain , exploit them and have them living in what had become an open air garbage dump , " he said .
besson said that each migrant would be offered an " individual solution " and given the choice to leave voluntarily , apply for asylum or be forcibly deported .
aid groups predict , though , that many of the immigrants will simply end up back on the streets .
" they are going to be scattered across the countryside , at the mercy of traffickers , " said jean-claude lenoir of the salam migrant support group .
" at least here , the young people had built a kind of community .
it 's tragic . "
problem of illegal immigration continues the un refugee agency unhcr said it recognized the need to combat smuggling and trafficking of persons and the right of the french government to maintain public order .
" closing the so-called jungle camp does , however , not address the phenomenon of mixed and irregular migration , nor does it solve the problems of the people concerned , amongst whom there may be many with protection needs , " unhcr spokesman andrej mahecic said at a press briefing in geneva on tuesday .
bildunterschrift : the migrants had gathered before their evacuation to demonstrate their plight unhcr called on the french authorities to ensure that those who wish to apply for refugee protection were given access to " a full and fair asylum procedure , " mahecic said .
" the situation in calais underscores , once again , the need for governments in europe to intensify efforts to arrive at a common european asylum system , not only on paper , but also in practice , " he said .
besson said the calais crisis was partly caused by the lack of a coherent european union migration policy .
he said states should agree to share the asylum burden more fairly , while boosting the powers of the eu border police , frontex. sac / ap / afp / dpa editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the country 's two largest parties - the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- - are currently locked in a grand coalition .
and both have said they do n't want to continue this uneasy union .
failing a large enough majority to rule alone , they 'd each rather pick a smaller party to govern with . for chancellor merkel 's cdu the partner-of-choice is the pro-business fdp , while frank-walter steinmeier 's spd would pick the greens for their electoral pas-de-deux .
but what about the far-left left party , poised to become a vocal opposition to whoever will make it to the chancellery ? dw-world.de angela merkel : from shy physicist to re-elected stateswoman just ahead of german elections , the polls are heavily favoring the reelection of chancellor angela merkel .
voters see her as a steady hand at the helm in a time of crisis and a formidable presence on the world stage .
-lrb- 19.08.2009 -rrb- frank-walter steinmeier : uphill battle for the chancellery the rival to chancellor angela merkel in september 's election is a man who works closely with her , current foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier .
but he faces a strong opponent and multiple challenges .
-lrb- 19.08.2009 -rrb- guido westerwelle : resurrecting germany 's liberals free democrat leader guido westerwelle has led his party from near political oblivion to a possible place back in government .
now the rhineland native must maintain his poise before the last hurdle .
-lrb- 27.08.2009 -rrb- oskar lafontaine : populist rebel of the left a high-profile defector from the social democrats , left party leader oskar lafontaine has always been a divisive character .
he is aiming for the state premiership of his native saarland in elections on aug .
30 .
-lrb- 31.08.2009 -rrb- the christian democrats : promising strength germany 's conservatives aim to cut taxes , reform financial markets and improve childcare in a bid to secure a second term at the head of a new-look governing coalition .
-lrb- 24.08.2009 -rrb- the social democrats : seeking to regain lost support in a last-ditch effort , germany 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- hope to win back voters by promising millions of new jobs .
but that has n't necessarily boosted the spd ’ s credibility .
-lrb- 24.08.2009 -rrb- the free democrats : kingmakers in waiting ?
thrust into the position of germany 's opposition party by default , the liberal , pro-business free democrats have been slowly gaining ground on their much larger political rivals and could soon be in power once again .
-lrb- 25.08.2009 -rrb- the green party : getting used to opposition having spent seven years in government with the social democratic party , the greens had to use the last legislature creating a meaningful opposition to its former partner .
now this opposition faces its first major test .
-lrb- 24.08.2009 -rrb- the left party : a dark red horse the left party remains a political pariah , both for its belligerent attitude and its roots in the east german dictatorship .
but if recent state level success continues , the left party will become difficult to ignore .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 22.09.2009 china plans to reduce carbon emissions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daya bay nuclear electricity plant in shenzhen in china 's southern guangdong province at a un climate conference in new york , chinese president hu jintao vowed to reduce the chinese economy 's carbon intensity by a " notable margin " by 2020 on tuesday .
china has become the world 's largest emitter of carbon dioxide and the country 's climate policy is being closely watched in the run-up to the copenhagen climate summit taking place at the end of the year .
hu jintao pledged to " vigorously " develop renewable energies , which will account for 15 percent of china 's energy mix by 2020 , as well as to boost nuclear energy . china currently has 11 nuclear reactors , which generate nine gigawatts of energy , enough to provide 1 percent of the country ’ s energy .
24 are in the making right now and 18 more are planned in the future .
by 2020 , 70 gigawatts of nuclear energy will be generated - enough to power 70 cities the size of san francisco .
zhou dadi from the energy research institute of the national development and reform commission in beijing says : “ nuclear energy can help restrict pollution , protect the environment and optimise our energy supply .
our studies show that china sees nuclear energy as an important means of reducing pollution , acquiring more energy and reducing our dependence on coal .
nuclear energy is going to develop very fast in the future . ”
china still gets most of its energy - over 70 percent - from coal .
but coal-powered stations can not meet the demand .
the electricity grid often collapses .
there are power cuts in summer particularly because of the intense use of air conditioning .
on top of that , the power stations are old and pollute the atmosphere heavily .
little public debate about risks as china is turning to nuclear energy as a long-term alternative , there is more and more talk of the risks involved .
but nuclear expert zhou dadi thinks there is no need to worry : “ we are learning from the experiences in the united states , japan and europe .
in europe , the nuclear power stations are built near the cities .
it ’ s very important to choose the right technology and to ensure conditions are safe .
when we make decisions we will choose places which are not heavily populated .
i am sure that china will choose the most advanced technology . ”
although beijing is insistent that high safety standards should be met , this is not always the case in the provinces where corruption is high .
there is also very little public debate about nuclear power - about its advantages and about the risks involved .
critics of nuclear energy are often faced with reprisals .
nuclear waste causing concern wang , a student of english in beijing , says she is “ very much afraid of living close to a nuclear power plant .
there are many natural disasters such as earthquakes and landslides .
i don ’ t know how to prevent being exposed to radiation .
i don ’ t think we have enough knowledge about the dangers or bad effects of nuclear power . ”
nuclear waste is also causing concern but zhou dadi once again dismisses fears : “ we are thinking about how to recycle nuclear liquids .
we ’ re looking at the same methods as the international community - for example storing the waste deep underground .
china will act responsibly . "
a plan to store nuclear waste in the gobi desert has now been rejected .
there is still no alternative .

zhou dadi from the energy research institute of the national development and reform commission in beijing says : “ nuclear energy can help restrict pollution , protect the environment and optimise our energy supply .
our studies show that china sees nuclear energy as an important means of reducing pollution , acquiring more energy and reducing our dependence on coal .
nuclear energy is going to develop very fast in the future . ”
china still gets most of its energy - over 70 percent - from coal .
but coal-powered stations can not meet the demand .
the electricity grid often collapses .
there are power cuts in summer particularly because of the intense use of air conditioning .
on top of that , the power stations are old and pollute the atmosphere heavily .
little public debate about risks as china is turning to nuclear energy as a long-term alternative , there is more and more talk of the risks involved .
but nuclear expert zhou dadi thinks there is no need to worry : “ we are learning from the experiences in the united states , japan and europe .
in europe , the nuclear power stations are built near the cities .
it ’ s very important to choose the right technology and to ensure conditions are safe .
when we make decisions we will choose places which are not heavily populated .
i am sure that china will choose the most advanced technology . ”
although beijing is insistent that high safety standards should be met , this is not always the case in the provinces where corruption is high .
there is also very little public debate about nuclear power - about its advantages and about the risks involved .
critics of nuclear energy are often faced with reprisals .
nuclear waste causing concern wang , a student of english in beijing , says she is “ very much afraid of living close to a nuclear power plant .
there are many natural disasters such as earthquakes and landslides .
i don ’ t know how to prevent being exposed to radiation .
i don ’ t think we have enough knowledge about the dangers or bad effects of nuclear power . ”
nuclear waste is also causing concern but zhou dadi once again dismisses fears : “ we are thinking about how to recycle nuclear liquids .
we ’ re looking at the same methods as the international community - for example storing the waste deep underground .
china will act responsibly . "
a plan to store nuclear waste in the gobi desert has now been rejected .
there is still no alternative .

the camp was used as a base for risky attempts to reach britain . britain 's home secretary alan johnson said the action taken in calais would " disrupt illegal immigration and people-trafficking routes . "
french police cleared and then bulldozed the makeshift forest camp - known as the " jungle " - near the northern city of calais on tuesday morning .
" i welcome the swift and decisive steps that the french government has taken today to close the " jungle " in calais , " johnson said .
the prefect of the region told journalists after the two-hour operation that 278 migrants had been taken into custody , nearly half of them minors .
the adults were temporarily jailed , while the minors were placed in " specialized centers , " he said .
the immigrants , mostly afghans , had hoped to travel the 35 kilometers across the english channel into britain .
an end to criminal trafficking the operation by hundreds of police officers was the final step in a months-long undertaking by the french government to remove the camp .
britain and france had agreed earlier this year to step up efforts against illegal migrants by strengthening border security with state-of-the-art technology and closer cooperation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : besson warned of more raids to come on nearby squatter camps france 's immigration minister eric besson told rtl radio that the dismantling of the camp was justified , calling the site a " base camp for human traffickers . "
the police operation " targeted the tools of the criminal gangs who sell migrants passage to britain , exploit them and have them living in what had become an open air garbage dump , " he said .
besson said that each migrant would be offered an " individual solution " and given the choice to leave voluntarily , apply for asylum or be forcibly deported .
aid groups predict , though , that many of the immigrants will simply end up back on the streets .
" they are going to be scattered across the countryside , at the mercy of traffickers , " said jean-claude lenoir of the salam migrant support group .
" at least here , the young people had built a kind of community .
it 's tragic . "
problem of illegal immigration continues the un refugee agency unhcr said it recognized the need to combat smuggling and trafficking of persons and the right of the french government to maintain public order .
" closing the so-called jungle camp does , however , not address the phenomenon of mixed and irregular migration , nor does it solve the problems of the people concerned , amongst whom there may be many with protection needs , " unhcr spokesman andrej mahecic said at a press briefing in geneva on tuesday .
bildunterschrift : the migrants had gathered before their evacuation to demonstrate their plight unhcr called on the french authorities to ensure that those who wish to apply for refugee protection were given access to " a full and fair asylum procedure , " mahecic said .
" the situation in calais underscores , once again , the need for governments in europe to intensify efforts to arrive at a common european asylum system , not only on paper , but also in practice , " he said .

the camp was used as a base for risky attempts to reach britain . britain 's home secretary alan johnson said the action taken in calais would " disrupt illegal immigration and people-trafficking routes . "
french police cleared and then bulldozed the makeshift forest camp - known as the " jungle " - near the northern city of calais on tuesday morning .
" i welcome the swift and decisive steps that the french government has taken today to close the " jungle " in calais , " johnson said .
the prefect of the region told journalists after the two-hour operation that 278 migrants had been taken into custody , nearly half of them minors .
the adults were temporarily jailed , while the minors were placed in " specialized centers , " he said .
the immigrants , mostly afghans , had hoped to travel the 35 kilometers across the english channel into britain .
an end to criminal trafficking the operation by hundreds of police officers was the final step in a months-long undertaking by the french government to remove the camp .

the police operation " targeted the tools of the criminal gangs who sell migrants passage to britain , exploit them and have them living in what had become an open air garbage dump , " he said .
besson said that each migrant would be offered an " individual solution " and given the choice to leave voluntarily , apply for asylum or be forcibly deported .

he tells politicians there are better ways to spend billions than on fighting climate change . the author of " the skeptical environmentalist , " bjorn lomborg , has had public disagreements with climate activists including al gore and sir nicholas stern .
lomborg 's harshest criticism , however , is aimed at the international community for spending billions on what he says are ineffective measures intended to fight climate change . he talked to deutsche welle about ongoing climate negotiations and how economists at the copenhagen consensus center , a think tank he heads , suggest spending aid and development money . deutsche welle : what do you think will emerge from the climate talks taking place at the united nations on tuesday ? bjorn lomborg : first of all , i think it 's important to recognize that probably nothing will come out of this , simply because they are so far away from the different nations on what they want to achieve . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lomborg , a danish statistician , questions environmental orthodoxy it 's always good to talk about the problem , and i think it 's good to reaffirm to everybody that we need a deal in copenhagen by the end of this year .
the problem is the focus on cutting carbon emissions is actually one that both makes it very hard for everyone to agree because the chinese and the indians do n't want to cut and while the europeans and the americans claim they want to cut , they actually also know that it 's going to cost them a lot , and it 's going to have very little benefit even in the far-off future .
that 's why they are all playing for the gallery but nobody is actually willing to really commit . the chinese leader has said he will present china 's new plans for tackling global warming at the summit .
is n't that a positive signal ? it could be .
but let 's remember that the chinese have been doing a lot of posturing on climate change and coming out and suggesting that we might even see china 's emissions maxing out in 2050 or maybe even in 2040 .
but let 's not base our hopes for a climate deal on things that will happen in 20 or 40 years . if you had to give tips to the participants , what would you advise them to talk about ? we 've run what we call the copenhagen consensus for climate , where we ask top economists , including three nobel laureates " where do you do the most good for climate with the money you 're going to be spending ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could salt particulates help cool the earth in the short-term ?
what they told us was do n't focus on cutting carbon emissions .
it 's very expensive and does very little good for the climate even 100 years from now .
in the short and medium-term , we should recognize that nothing we do will change the temperature development except looking into geo-engineering , essentially making the planet cooler - for instance by spraying up salt particulates in the atmosphere , which will amplify natural processes , make more white clouds and hence make the world a little more reflective - especially over the south pacific .
that would be very cheap and could potentially avoid global warming for the next 100 years . this is still a band-aid , so what you also need to do is more toward a situation where we can actually get people to not just talk about cutting carbon emissions but actually doing so , and we will only do that if cutting carbon emissions and green energy technologies become much , much cheaper .
that 's why their second solution was to focus on making much cheaper green energy technologies - cheaper solar panels , cheaper windmills - that will actually work . those two in conjunction is what i would like to see world leaders focus on a lot more , if we actually care about fixing climate change not just making beautiful speeches . at the moment we also have to concentrate on adaptation to climate change .
its effects are already becoming very visible .
where would your priorities lie in that area ? i 'm referring to top economists , rather than my own private opinions .
what they found is we are very often being told that there is a huge amount of impacts from climate change right now , and it 's certainly true that there are a lot of good pictures out there where you can show here 's a catastrophe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lomborg says poverty impacts people 's lives more than climate change but what we fail to recognize is that the vast majority of the impact that we are seeing right now - climate impacts and other impacts - are impacts that have been there for hundreds of years .
most of this world 's population is poor and they 're ill-prepared to deal with any contingency that the world throws at them .
what we need to focus on is not just adaption specifically for climate change , which is a small part of the problems most people live with right now , but simply making better lives for people that is focusing on getting them more food , getting them better healthcare and making sure their kids get educated . the world 's doctors have said failure to tackle climate change in copenhagen could be catastrophic for health .
is it possible to separate climate change from issues like health , food security or a safe water supply ? we do n't need to separate them in the sense that we probably all agree we should tackle some of the really big problems that are out there right now .
i 'm simply concerned that many people latch on to talking about global warming and that the most important this is spending money on adaptation to global warming . but the main problem in bangladesh or myanmar is not future sea-level rises , it 's the fact that the countries are so poor right now that they are already getting inundated .
it 's not about climate-proofing it in 100 years , it 's about dealing with the vulnerability to climate right now , which has nothing to do with climate change but simply something to do with them being very poor . it 's more about an emphasis on focusing where you can actually deal with real problems right now rather than a possible problem in 100 years . interview : irene quaile -lrb- sms -rrb- editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : the long road to copenhagen experts express little optimism ahead of copenhagen summit brown , sarkozy propose multi-billion-dollar climate fund for poor nations hacker scandal sends ripples through climate-science community world leaders favor delaying a binding climate change deal climate -pipe- 22.09.2009 cutting carbon emissions wo n't stop climate change , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lomborg says the world faces more pressing problems than emissions as world leaders meet at the un to discuss climate change , bjorn lomborg tells dw he expects little to come from the talks .
he tells politicians there are better ways to spend billions than on fighting climate change . the author of " the skeptical environmentalist , " bjorn lomborg , has had public disagreements with climate activists including al gore and sir nicholas stern .
lomborg 's harshest criticism , however , is aimed at the international community for spending billions on what he says are ineffective measures intended to fight climate change . he talked to deutsche welle about ongoing climate negotiations and how economists at the copenhagen consensus center , a think tank he heads , suggest spending aid and development money . deutsche welle : what do you think will emerge from the climate talks taking place at the united nations on tuesday ? bjorn lomborg : first of all , i think it 's important to recognize that probably nothing will come out of this , simply because they are so far away from the different nations on what they want to achieve . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lomborg , a danish statistician , questions environmental orthodoxy it 's always good to talk about the problem , and i think it 's good to reaffirm to everybody that we need a deal in copenhagen by the end of this year .
the problem is the focus on cutting carbon emissions is actually one that both makes it very hard for everyone to agree because the chinese and the indians do n't want to cut and while the europeans and the americans claim they want to cut , they actually also know that it 's going to cost them a lot , and it 's going to have very little benefit even in the far-off future .
that 's why they are all playing for the gallery but nobody is actually willing to really commit . the chinese leader has said he will present china 's new plans for tackling global warming at the summit .
is n't that a positive signal ? it could be .
but let 's remember that the chinese have been doing a lot of posturing on climate change and coming out and suggesting that we might even see china 's emissions maxing out in 2050 or maybe even in 2040 .
but let 's not base our hopes for a climate deal on things that will happen in 20 or 40 years . if you had to give tips to the participants , what would you advise them to talk about ? we 've run what we call the copenhagen consensus for climate , where we ask top economists , including three nobel laureates " where do you do the most good for climate with the money you 're going to be spending ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could salt particulates help cool the earth in the short-term ?
what they told us was do n't focus on cutting carbon emissions .
it 's very expensive and does very little good for the climate even 100 years from now .
in the short and medium-term , we should recognize that nothing we do will change the temperature development except looking into geo-engineering , essentially making the planet cooler - for instance by spraying up salt particulates in the atmosphere , which will amplify natural processes , make more white clouds and hence make the world a little more reflective - especially over the south pacific .
that would be very cheap and could potentially avoid global warming for the next 100 years . this is still a band-aid , so what you also need to do is more toward a situation where we can actually get people to not just talk about cutting carbon emissions but actually doing so , and we will only do that if cutting carbon emissions and green energy technologies become much , much cheaper .
that 's why their second solution was to focus on making much cheaper green energy technologies - cheaper solar panels , cheaper windmills - that will actually work . those two in conjunction is what i would like to see world leaders focus on a lot more , if we actually care about fixing climate change not just making beautiful speeches . at the moment we also have to concentrate on adaptation to climate change .
its effects are already becoming very visible .
where would your priorities lie in that area ? i 'm referring to top economists , rather than my own private opinions .
what they found is we are very often being told that there is a huge amount of impacts from climate change right now , and it 's certainly true that there are a lot of good pictures out there where you can show here 's a catastrophe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lomborg says poverty impacts people 's lives more than climate change but what we fail to recognize is that the vast majority of the impact that we are seeing right now - climate impacts and other impacts - are impacts that have been there for hundreds of years .
most of this world 's population is poor and they 're ill-prepared to deal with any contingency that the world throws at them .
what we need to focus on is not just adaption specifically for climate change , which is a small part of the problems most people live with right now , but simply making better lives for people that is focusing on getting them more food , getting them better healthcare and making sure their kids get educated . the world 's doctors have said failure to tackle climate change in copenhagen could be catastrophic for health .
is it possible to separate climate change from issues like health , food security or a safe water supply ? we do n't need to separate them in the sense that we probably all agree we should tackle some of the really big problems that are out there right now .
i 'm simply concerned that many people latch on to talking about global warming and that the most important this is spending money on adaptation to global warming . but the main problem in bangladesh or myanmar is not future sea-level rises , it 's the fact that the countries are so poor right now that they are already getting inundated .
it 's not about climate-proofing it in 100 years , it 's about dealing with the vulnerability to climate right now , which has nothing to do with climate change but simply something to do with them being very poor . it 's more about an emphasis on focusing where you can actually deal with real problems right now rather than a possible problem in 100 years . interview : irene quaile -lrb- sms -rrb- editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hainer played in attack , while zeitz was goalkeeper .
the game was meant to bring a symbolic end to one of germany 's most infamous family feuds , which began in 1948 when a row between brothers rudolf and adolf dassler split the family sportswear business , already a major supplier in the field , into two camps .
rudolf founded puma in 1948 , while adolf , or adi , dassler founded adidas in 1949 .
their rivalry divided the dasslers ' home town of 23,000 people , where competing factories were built on opposite sides of the aurach river .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adidas provides the soccer balls for the world cup skeletons in the sportswear closet there are plenty of rumors about the cause of the split , including the story that rudolf had an affair with adolf 's wife kaethe in 1940 .
monday 's football match was the first conciliatory gesture between the two companies , even though neither has belonged to the dassler family for years .
both companies have become international leaders in the sportswear field , with puma signing a sponsorship deal with record-breaking sprinter usain bolt .
for its part , adidas recently extended its partnership with the football organization uefa , providing equipment for all international football tournaments until 2017 .
according to the german financial newspaper handelsblatt , adidas is currently the second biggest sportswear manufacturer in the world behind nike , while puma is third .

hainer played in attack , while zeitz was goalkeeper .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : the long road to copenhagen experts express little optimism ahead of copenhagen summit brown , sarkozy propose multi-billion-dollar climate fund for poor nations hacker scandal sends ripples through climate-science community world leaders favor delaying a binding climate change deal climate -pipe- 22.09.2009 cutting carbon emissions wo n't stop climate change , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lomborg says the world faces more pressing problems than emissions as world leaders meet at the un to discuss climate change , bjorn lomborg tells dw he expects little to come from the talks .
he tells politicians there are better ways to spend billions than on fighting climate change . the author of " the skeptical environmentalist , " bjorn lomborg , has had public disagreements with climate activists including al gore and sir nicholas stern .
lomborg 's harshest criticism , however , is aimed at the international community for spending billions on what he says are ineffective measures intended to fight climate change . he talked to deutsche welle about ongoing climate negotiations and how economists at the copenhagen consensus center , a think tank he heads , suggest spending aid and development money . deutsche welle : what do you think will emerge from the climate talks taking place at the united nations on tuesday ? bjorn lomborg : first of all , i think it 's important to recognize that probably nothing will come out of this , simply because they are so far away from the different nations on what they want to achieve . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lomborg , a danish statistician , questions environmental orthodoxy it 's always good to talk about the problem , and i think it 's good to reaffirm to everybody that we need a deal in copenhagen by the end of this year .
the problem is the focus on cutting carbon emissions is actually one that both makes it very hard for everyone to agree because the chinese and the indians do n't want to cut and while the europeans and the americans claim they want to cut , they actually also know that it 's going to cost them a lot , and it 's going to have very little benefit even in the far-off future .
that 's why they are all playing for the gallery but nobody is actually willing to really commit . the chinese leader has said he will present china 's new plans for tackling global warming at the summit .
is n't that a positive signal ? it could be .
but let 's remember that the chinese have been doing a lot of posturing on climate change and coming out and suggesting that we might even see china 's emissions maxing out in 2050 or maybe even in 2040 .
but let 's not base our hopes for a climate deal on things that will happen in 20 or 40 years . if you had to give tips to the participants , what would you advise them to talk about ? we 've run what we call the copenhagen consensus for climate , where we ask top economists , including three nobel laureates " where do you do the most good for climate with the money you 're going to be spending ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could salt particulates help cool the earth in the short-term ?
what they told us was do n't focus on cutting carbon emissions .
it 's very expensive and does very little good for the climate even 100 years from now .
in the short and medium-term , we should recognize that nothing we do will change the temperature development except looking into geo-engineering , essentially making the planet cooler - for instance by spraying up salt particulates in the atmosphere , which will amplify natural processes , make more white clouds and hence make the world a little more reflective - especially over the south pacific .
that would be very cheap and could potentially avoid global warming for the next 100 years . this is still a band-aid , so what you also need to do is more toward a situation where we can actually get people to not just talk about cutting carbon emissions but actually doing so , and we will only do that if cutting carbon emissions and green energy technologies become much , much cheaper .
that 's why their second solution was to focus on making much cheaper green energy technologies - cheaper solar panels , cheaper windmills - that will actually work . those two in conjunction is what i would like to see world leaders focus on a lot more , if we actually care about fixing climate change not just making beautiful speeches . at the moment we also have to concentrate on adaptation to climate change .
its effects are already becoming very visible .
where would your priorities lie in that area ? i 'm referring to top economists , rather than my own private opinions .
what they found is we are very often being told that there is a huge amount of impacts from climate change right now , and it 's certainly true that there are a lot of good pictures out there where you can show here 's a catastrophe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lomborg says poverty impacts people 's lives more than climate change but what we fail to recognize is that the vast majority of the impact that we are seeing right now - climate impacts and other impacts - are impacts that have been there for hundreds of years .
most of this world 's population is poor and they 're ill-prepared to deal with any contingency that the world throws at them .
what we need to focus on is not just adaption specifically for climate change , which is a small part of the problems most people live with right now , but simply making better lives for people that is focusing on getting them more food , getting them better healthcare and making sure their kids get educated . the world 's doctors have said failure to tackle climate change in copenhagen could be catastrophic for health .
is it possible to separate climate change from issues like health , food security or a safe water supply ? we do n't need to separate them in the sense that we probably all agree we should tackle some of the really big problems that are out there right now .
i 'm simply concerned that many people latch on to talking about global warming and that the most important this is spending money on adaptation to global warming . but the main problem in bangladesh or myanmar is not future sea-level rises , it 's the fact that the countries are so poor right now that they are already getting inundated .
it 's not about climate-proofing it in 100 years , it 's about dealing with the vulnerability to climate right now , which has nothing to do with climate change but simply something to do with them being very poor . it 's more about an emphasis on focusing where you can actually deal with real problems right now rather than a possible problem in 100 years . interview : irene quaile -lrb- sms -rrb- editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that 's why their second solution was to focus on making much cheaper green energy technologies - cheaper solar panels , cheaper windmills - that will actually work . those two in conjunction is what i would like to see world leaders focus on a lot more , if we actually care about fixing climate change not just making beautiful speeches . at the moment we also have to concentrate on adaptation to climate change .

he tells politicians there are better ways to spend billions than on fighting climate change . the author of " the skeptical environmentalist , " bjorn lomborg , has had public disagreements with climate activists including al gore and sir nicholas stern .
lomborg 's harshest criticism , however , is aimed at the international community for spending billions on what he says are ineffective measures intended to fight climate change . he talked to deutsche welle about ongoing climate negotiations and how economists at the copenhagen consensus center , a think tank he heads , suggest spending aid and development money . deutsche welle : what do you think will emerge from the climate talks taking place at the united nations on tuesday ? bjorn lomborg : first of all , i think it 's important to recognize that probably nothing will come out of this , simply because they are so far away from the different nations on what they want to achieve . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lomborg , a danish statistician , questions environmental orthodoxy it 's always good to talk about the problem , and i think it 's good to reaffirm to everybody that we need a deal in copenhagen by the end of this year .
the problem is the focus on cutting carbon emissions is actually one that both makes it very hard for everyone to agree because the chinese and the indians do n't want to cut and while the europeans and the americans claim they want to cut , they actually also know that it 's going to cost them a lot , and it 's going to have very little benefit even in the far-off future .
that 's why they are all playing for the gallery but nobody is actually willing to really commit . the chinese leader has said he will present china 's new plans for tackling global warming at the summit .
is n't that a positive signal ? it could be .
but let 's remember that the chinese have been doing a lot of posturing on climate change and coming out and suggesting that we might even see china 's emissions maxing out in 2050 or maybe even in 2040 .
but let 's not base our hopes for a climate deal on things that will happen in 20 or 40 years . if you had to give tips to the participants , what would you advise them to talk about ? we 've run what we call the copenhagen consensus for climate , where we ask top economists , including three nobel laureates " where do you do the most good for climate with the money you 're going to be spending ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could salt particulates help cool the earth in the short-term ?

while losses were observed across the board , exports to the united states and russia fell most sharply . the german federal statistical office published the report showing that exports to european union countries were 24 percent lower than during the same period last year , while exports to countries outside of the eu were nearly 22 percent lower on average .
the wiesbaden-based office said exports to some countries within the eu was better than to others .
export volumes to ireland , spain , hungary and the uk were " above average " , according to official figures released on tuesday .
outside of the eu , " very sharp falls were observed for deliveries to russia and to turkey , ” the report said .
exports to the us and japan were down 27 and 23 percent respectively , the report added .
the latest data point to the prolongation of a gloomy outlook for the world ’ s largest exporter .
exports rebounded in july the second quarter export figures come close on the heels of relatively encouraging data published earlier this month by the federal statistics office .
germany ’ s trade surplus jumped 12 percent in july and exports rose by more than two percent over the previous month to over 70 billion euros .
analysts said that the july trade surplus was driven largely by a solid surge in exports to asia , in particular .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite huge losses , germany remains europe 's most promising economy no quick recovery in sight on monday , the head of germany ’ s central bank warned that the economy , battered by the financial market chaos , would not recover to its pre-crisis levels for another four years . “ the economic recovery will take a while .
the german economy will not reach the level of prosperity it enjoyed in 2008 until , probably , 2013 , " bundesbank president axel weber told the frankfurter rundschau newspaper .
the road ahead would remain “ bumpy " , he added . nevertheless , he said that germany had exited the " free fall " phase . economy on the mend notwithstanding the drastic fall in exports , the german economy emerged from recession during the second quarter of this year , much earlier than previously forecast .
ing bank economist carsten brzeski said germany 's economic performance in recent months was a positive sign for the future .
" for the near term , the outlook for the german economy looks bright .
it has the potential to lead europe out of the recession , " he said .
however , the rollout of extensive stimulus packages designed to help the country out of the crisis , has left gaping holes in the national budget .
since the beginning of the year , germany has built up a deficit of over 17 billion euros , compared to a budget surplus of seven billion euros during the same period last year .
this amounts to around 1.5 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- – well within the three percent limit for the 16 countries that use europe 's common currency , the euro. glb / rb / dpa / reuters / afp editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not all of them .
a quirk in the german electoral process awards larger parties a disproportionate number of parliamentary seats .
that increases the size of parliament and could give the cdu a decisive advantage in the coming vote . germany 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have repeated their warning that a new coalition led by chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- would be " illegitimate " if it were dependent upon winning additional seats that are awarded through an anomaly of the country 's election laws .
germans elect their representatives in a complicated process .
it involves dividing up the 598 seats in the bundestag , or parliament , into two groups , which are filled using two votes .
the first vote is for an actual candidate : each electoral district has candidates from one or several parties that campaign for a seat .
these seats are handed out in a simple , first-past-the-post majority , a system that often places smaller parties at a disadvantage .
two-vote system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier derided a coalition won on overhang seats the other 299 seats are allocated based on the second vote , which is for a party .
the votes of the 62 million germans eligible to take part in the election are added up and then divided by the number of parties .
those seats are then handed out to the people each party has put on a list , which is divided up among all 16 german states .
an example : in 2005 the conservative cdu and its bavarian sister party the csu took 35.2 percent of the vote for parties .
but 150 of their candidates were elected directly .
under german electoral law , if a party wins more direct seats than they would be entitled to under the votes cast for the party lists , then they are allowed to keep those extra seats and the total number in the bundestag simply goes up .
this is known as the ueberhangmandate , or " overhang seats . "
thus , the conservatives were awarded 246 parliamentary seats - some five percent more than the proportion of the party votes cast for them . if we take a local example , we see that the cdu won 31 out of 35 districts in the state of baden-wuerttemberg , which means they were entitled to 31 seats .
however , when its share of the second vote was tallied , it was actually only supposed to get 28 of the state 's 74 seats , meaning it got three extra seats .
at the moment , there are 611 seats in the bundestag , which include the 13 overhang seats that were created by the 2005 election .
the amount of overhang seats is determined anew by each election .
last week , merkel sparked debate by saying she was prepared to form a government with a coalition whose majority was based purely on these additional seats .
' not a second-class mandate ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to merkel , any win is a good win " a mandate based on overhang seats is no second class mandate , " the chancellor said during a press conference .
the spd 's parliamentary leader thomas oppermann responded that , if this were to happen , " for the first time in germany there would be a government which the voters did n't choose and did n't want . "
normally , this is n't a big deal .
back in 2005 it was n't enough to give the cdu anything close to a clear majority and they were forced to form a grand coalition with the spd .
however , in 1994 the cdu was granted 12 extra overhang seats , allowing helmut kohl to maintain his position as chancellor. mrm / dpa / reuters / afp editor : tony dunham send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not all of them .
a quirk in the german electoral process awards larger parties a disproportionate number of parliamentary seats .
that increases the size of parliament and could give the cdu a decisive advantage in the coming vote . germany 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have repeated their warning that a new coalition led by chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- would be " illegitimate " if it were dependent upon winning additional seats that are awarded through an anomaly of the country 's election laws .
germans elect their representatives in a complicated process .
it involves dividing up the 598 seats in the bundestag , or parliament , into two groups , which are filled using two votes .
the first vote is for an actual candidate : each electoral district has candidates from one or several parties that campaign for a seat .
these seats are handed out in a simple , first-past-the-post majority , a system that often places smaller parties at a disadvantage .
two-vote system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier derided a coalition won on overhang seats the other 299 seats are allocated based on the second vote , which is for a party .
the votes of the 62 million germans eligible to take part in the election are added up and then divided by the number of parties .
those seats are then handed out to the people each party has put on a list , which is divided up among all 16 german states .
an example : in 2005 the conservative cdu and its bavarian sister party the csu took 35.2 percent of the vote for parties .
but 150 of their candidates were elected directly .
under german electoral law , if a party wins more direct seats than they would be entitled to under the votes cast for the party lists , then they are allowed to keep those extra seats and the total number in the bundestag simply goes up .
this is known as the ueberhangmandate , or " overhang seats . "
thus , the conservatives were awarded 246 parliamentary seats - some five percent more than the proportion of the party votes cast for them . if we take a local example , we see that the cdu won 31 out of 35 districts in the state of baden-wuerttemberg , which means they were entitled to 31 seats .
however , when its share of the second vote was tallied , it was actually only supposed to get 28 of the state 's 74 seats , meaning it got three extra seats .
at the moment , there are 611 seats in the bundestag , which include the 13 overhang seats that were created by the 2005 election .
the amount of overhang seats is determined anew by each election .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 22.09.2009 german freighters blaze trail through arctic großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mv beluga foresight did n't need to call on its ice-breaking escort two german freighters have successfully travelled from asia to europe via the arctic waters above russia .
as the fabled northeast passage comes a step closer to reality , some say it may end up a road seldom traveled . the two vessels successfully navigated the narrow strip of water off russia 's northern coast last week . the vessels had delivered their cargo of heavy industrial equipment , loaded in south korea , to novy port in western siberia , and were now continuing their voyage to nigeria , where they were due to deliver a shipment of steel pipes picked up in the russian port of arkhangelsk , according to the beluga shipping company , which owns the vessels . the voyage only became possible because of climate change . melting arctic sea ice has opened the way for ships to navigate the arctic waters and avoid the icebergs , floes and pack ice that have confounded previous attempts to use the route for trade . the arctic 's sea ice thawed to its third-lowest level on record this summer .
on sept .
12 , it covered around 5.1 million square kilometers -lrb- 2 million square miles -rrb- - around a million square kilometers more than in 2007 , which had the lowest coverage since records began some 30 years ago . the beluga fraternity and beluga foresight are the first western commercial ships to transit the northeast passage successfully , according to the bremen-based shipping company . until now , only parts of the route have been navigable at any given time , and they were only used by russian shipping companies .
the fraternity and foresight were accompanied by russian icebreakers , but never needed to call upon them for assistance . despite the fact that the trip took a long time to clear with russian authorities , who demanded large fees in return for their approval , the beluga shipping company said it was satisfied with the trip . " we have saved not only voyage time - around 10 days , worth around $ 200,000 - but also , we 've been able to save fossil fuels in the amount of around 200 tons per ship , and at a cost of around $ 90,000 , " said company spokesperson verena beckhusen . bildunterschrift : the northeast passage could shave some 5,400 km off some traditional routes time is money but savings in time and cash are n't likely to unleash an armada of merchant shipping on the arctic . the route is only practical for european trade with northeast asia , a fraction of the region 's total volume .
furthermore , only certain kinds of cargo will be worth sending via the northeast passage , said max johns , spokesperson for the german ship owners association . " container ships will always take the southern route because there are many more ports , " he said .
" container ships work a little bit like buses in a city .
they have to go from port to port and collect and deliver containers in every possible port otherwise it is not worthwhile running them . " the northeast passage makes most sense for specialist deliveries of heavy-lift cargo , or bulk quantities of commodities like coal , iron ore and oil , johns added . added complications , new attractions the passage is also only open for a six- to eight-week window each summer .
then there is the challenge of dealing with an expensive , and byzantine , russian bureaucracy : the beluga shipping company only won final approval for its voyage in august following an application process that took nearly a year . one underplayed aspect of beluga 's successful voyage is that it makes resource extraction in the region more attractive . " the extraction is the real attraction now when the ice melts , and especially russia has a very keen eye on that , " johns said .
" for us , as service providers , it may be interesting to transport that cargo to where it is being needed . " environmental hazard bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has been keen to stake its claim to parts of the arctic vast quantities of energy resources are believed to be located in the arctic .
with some countries already gearing up to exploit them , this is precisely the kind of cargo that concerns environmentalists most . " if there were an oil spill , either from shipping or from the extraction work which will also increase when the ice is going ... then combating it would be very difficult , " said ulrich claussen , who leads the german federal environment 's agency 's efforts to protect marine life . the cold and stormy weather conditions would complicate clean-up efforts from a technical point of view and would also hinder the region 's natural capacity to absorb damage , claussen added . " normally bacteria can degrade the oil , but the colder it is the less active bacteria normally are , " he said .
" there might be a very slow reaction from the environment .
in alaska , where the spill from the exxon valdez was , we can still see some signs of non-recovery now . " the beluga shipping company , however , is already planning another voyage through the northeastern passage for next year .
next year 's trip , again on behalf of general electric , will be an even bigger exercise , requiring ships around double the size of the fraternity and foresight . nathan witkop editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as the fabled northeast passage comes a step closer to reality , some say it may end up a road seldom traveled . the two vessels successfully navigated the narrow strip of water off russia 's northern coast last week . the vessels had delivered their cargo of heavy industrial equipment , loaded in south korea , to novy port in western siberia , and were now continuing their voyage to nigeria , where they were due to deliver a shipment of steel pipes picked up in the russian port of arkhangelsk , according to the beluga shipping company , which owns the vessels . the voyage only became possible because of climate change . melting arctic sea ice has opened the way for ships to navigate the arctic waters and avoid the icebergs , floes and pack ice that have confounded previous attempts to use the route for trade . the arctic 's sea ice thawed to its third-lowest level on record this summer .

the fraternity and foresight were accompanied by russian icebreakers , but never needed to call upon them for assistance . despite the fact that the trip took a long time to clear with russian authorities , who demanded large fees in return for their approval , the beluga shipping company said it was satisfied with the trip . " we have saved not only voyage time - around 10 days , worth around $ 200,000 - but also , we 've been able to save fossil fuels in the amount of around 200 tons per ship , and at a cost of around $ 90,000 , " said company spokesperson verena beckhusen . bildunterschrift : the northeast passage could shave some 5,400 km off some traditional routes time is money but savings in time and cash are n't likely to unleash an armada of merchant shipping on the arctic . the route is only practical for european trade with northeast asia , a fraction of the region 's total volume .
furthermore , only certain kinds of cargo will be worth sending via the northeast passage , said max johns , spokesperson for the german ship owners association . " container ships will always take the southern route because there are many more ports , " he said .
" container ships work a little bit like buses in a city .
they have to go from port to port and collect and deliver containers in every possible port otherwise it is not worthwhile running them . " the northeast passage makes most sense for specialist deliveries of heavy-lift cargo , or bulk quantities of commodities like coal , iron ore and oil , johns added . added complications , new attractions the passage is also only open for a six- to eight-week window each summer .
then there is the challenge of dealing with an expensive , and byzantine , russian bureaucracy : the beluga shipping company only won final approval for its voyage in august following an application process that took nearly a year . one underplayed aspect of beluga 's successful voyage is that it makes resource extraction in the region more attractive . " the extraction is the real attraction now when the ice melts , and especially russia has a very keen eye on that , " johns said .
" for us , as service providers , it may be interesting to transport that cargo to where it is being needed . " environmental hazard bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has been keen to stake its claim to parts of the arctic vast quantities of energy resources are believed to be located in the arctic .
with some countries already gearing up to exploit them , this is precisely the kind of cargo that concerns environmentalists most . " if there were an oil spill , either from shipping or from the extraction work which will also increase when the ice is going ... then combating it would be very difficult , " said ulrich claussen , who leads the german federal environment 's agency 's efforts to protect marine life . the cold and stormy weather conditions would complicate clean-up efforts from a technical point of view and would also hinder the region 's natural capacity to absorb damage , claussen added . " normally bacteria can degrade the oil , but the colder it is the less active bacteria normally are , " he said .
" there might be a very slow reaction from the environment .
in alaska , where the spill from the exxon valdez was , we can still see some signs of non-recovery now . " the beluga shipping company , however , is already planning another voyage through the northeastern passage for next year .

greece took in almost 6.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.25 billion -rrb- more from the eu 's budget than it paid into it in 2008 , according to the commission .
the bulk of that money came in payments to greek farmers and in eu funding for infrastructure projects such as highways and ports .
greece was far ahead of eu newcomer poland in the eu 's net handouts list .
poland 's net income from the eu 's budget actually fell by some three-quarters of a billion euros to 4.4 billion euros last year .
the drop owed largely to a reduction in eu payments to polish farmers .
observers say this is likely to provoke heated comments from warsaw , which has frequently accused the eu of treating the countries that joined in 2004 and 2007 less generously than older member states .
german payments hit historic highs at the other end of the scale , germany , the eu 's biggest member , paid almost 8.8 billion euros more into the budget than it received .
this marks the biggest contribution by the country in the last 10 years .
germany 's payment amounts to more than double that of the next biggest contributors , italy and france , which paid around a net 4 billion euros to the fund each .
the three countries are , however , far ahead of the eu 's other heavyweight , britain , whose net contribution fell from over 4 billion euros in 2007 to under 1 billion euros in 2008 .
in terms of absolute receipts , france maintained its position as the largest recipient of eu funds , ahead of spain , germany and italy .
britain , the eu 's third-largest economy , was only the seventh-largest recipient of funding .
the news comes as the the european commission is drawing up plans to reform the bloc 's budgetary process in a move that analysts say will likely spark a rancorous debate between countries which receive the most money from the bloc and those who pay the most into it. rb / dpa / reuters editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

greece took in almost 6.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.25 billion -rrb- more from the eu 's budget than it paid into it in 2008 , according to the commission .

greece was far ahead of eu newcomer poland in the eu 's net handouts list .
poland 's net income from the eu 's budget actually fell by some three-quarters of a billion euros to 4.4 billion euros last year .

germany 's payment amounts to more than double that of the next biggest contributors , italy and france , which paid around a net 4 billion euros to the fund each .

greece took in almost 6.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.25 billion -rrb- more from the eu 's budget than it paid into it in 2008 , according to the commission .
the bulk of that money came in payments to greek farmers and in eu funding for infrastructure projects such as highways and ports .
greece was far ahead of eu newcomer poland in the eu 's net handouts list .
poland 's net income from the eu 's budget actually fell by some three-quarters of a billion euros to 4.4 billion euros last year .
the drop owed largely to a reduction in eu payments to polish farmers .
observers say this is likely to provoke heated comments from warsaw , which has frequently accused the eu of treating the countries that joined in 2004 and 2007 less generously than older member states .
german payments hit historic highs at the other end of the scale , germany , the eu 's biggest member , paid almost 8.8 billion euros more into the budget than it received .
this marks the biggest contribution by the country in the last 10 years .
germany 's payment amounts to more than double that of the next biggest contributors , italy and france , which paid around a net 4 billion euros to the fund each .
the three countries are , however , far ahead of the eu 's other heavyweight , britain , whose net contribution fell from over 4 billion euros in 2007 to under 1 billion euros in 2008 .
in terms of absolute receipts , france maintained its position as the largest recipient of eu funds , ahead of spain , germany and italy .
britain , the eu 's third-largest economy , was only the seventh-largest recipient of funding .
the news comes as the the european commission is drawing up plans to reform the bloc 's budgetary process in a move that analysts say will likely spark a rancorous debate between countries which receive the most money from the bloc and those who pay the most into it. rb / dpa / reuters editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hainer played in attack , while zeitz was goalkeeper .
the game was meant to bring a symbolic end to one of germany 's most infamous family feuds , which began in 1948 when a row between brothers rudolf and adolf dassler split the family sportswear business , already a major supplier in the field , into two camps .
rudolf founded puma in 1948 , while adolf , or adi , dassler founded adidas in 1949 .
their rivalry divided the dasslers ' home town of 23,000 people , where competing factories were built on opposite sides of the aurach river .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adidas provides the soccer balls for the world cup skeletons in the sportswear closet there are plenty of rumors about the cause of the split , including the story that rudolf had an affair with adolf 's wife kaethe in 1940 .
monday 's football match was the first conciliatory gesture between the two companies , even though neither has belonged to the dassler family for years .
both companies have become international leaders in the sportswear field , with puma signing a sponsorship deal with record-breaking sprinter usain bolt .
for its part , adidas recently extended its partnership with the football organization uefa , providing equipment for all international football tournaments until 2017 .
according to the german financial newspaper handelsblatt , adidas is currently the second biggest sportswear manufacturer in the world behind nike , while puma is third .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : puma makes usain bolt 's running shoes the sporting event was held in support of the peace one day initiative , set up by film-maker jeremy gilley in 1999 .
the initiative , which was adopted in 2001 as part of the un 's international day of peace on september 21 , was meant to establish an annual day of global ceasefire and non-violence with a fixed calendar date. bk / afp / reuters / ap editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as the fabled northeast passage comes a step closer to reality , some say it may end up a road seldom traveled . the two vessels successfully navigated the narrow strip of water off russia 's northern coast last week . the vessels had delivered their cargo of heavy industrial equipment , loaded in south korea , to novy port in western siberia , and were now continuing their voyage to nigeria , where they were due to deliver a shipment of steel pipes picked up in the russian port of arkhangelsk , according to the beluga shipping company , which owns the vessels . the voyage only became possible because of climate change . melting arctic sea ice has opened the way for ships to navigate the arctic waters and avoid the icebergs , floes and pack ice that have confounded previous attempts to use the route for trade . the arctic 's sea ice thawed to its third-lowest level on record this summer .
on sept .
12 , it covered around 5.1 million square kilometers -lrb- 2 million square miles -rrb- - around a million square kilometers more than in 2007 , which had the lowest coverage since records began some 30 years ago . the beluga fraternity and beluga foresight are the first western commercial ships to transit the northeast passage successfully , according to the bremen-based shipping company . until now , only parts of the route have been navigable at any given time , and they were only used by russian shipping companies .
the fraternity and foresight were accompanied by russian icebreakers , but never needed to call upon them for assistance . despite the fact that the trip took a long time to clear with russian authorities , who demanded large fees in return for their approval , the beluga shipping company said it was satisfied with the trip . " we have saved not only voyage time - around 10 days , worth around $ 200,000 - but also , we 've been able to save fossil fuels in the amount of around 200 tons per ship , and at a cost of around $ 90,000 , " said company spokesperson verena beckhusen . bildunterschrift : the northeast passage could shave some 5,400 km off some traditional routes time is money but savings in time and cash are n't likely to unleash an armada of merchant shipping on the arctic . the route is only practical for european trade with northeast asia , a fraction of the region 's total volume .
furthermore , only certain kinds of cargo will be worth sending via the northeast passage , said max johns , spokesperson for the german ship owners association . " container ships will always take the southern route because there are many more ports , " he said .
" container ships work a little bit like buses in a city .
they have to go from port to port and collect and deliver containers in every possible port otherwise it is not worthwhile running them . " the northeast passage makes most sense for specialist deliveries of heavy-lift cargo , or bulk quantities of commodities like coal , iron ore and oil , johns added . added complications , new attractions the passage is also only open for a six- to eight-week window each summer .
then there is the challenge of dealing with an expensive , and byzantine , russian bureaucracy : the beluga shipping company only won final approval for its voyage in august following an application process that took nearly a year . one underplayed aspect of beluga 's successful voyage is that it makes resource extraction in the region more attractive . " the extraction is the real attraction now when the ice melts , and especially russia has a very keen eye on that , " johns said .
" for us , as service providers , it may be interesting to transport that cargo to where it is being needed . " environmental hazard bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has been keen to stake its claim to parts of the arctic vast quantities of energy resources are believed to be located in the arctic .
with some countries already gearing up to exploit them , this is precisely the kind of cargo that concerns environmentalists most . " if there were an oil spill , either from shipping or from the extraction work which will also increase when the ice is going ... then combating it would be very difficult , " said ulrich claussen , who leads the german federal environment 's agency 's efforts to protect marine life . the cold and stormy weather conditions would complicate clean-up efforts from a technical point of view and would also hinder the region 's natural capacity to absorb damage , claussen added . " normally bacteria can degrade the oil , but the colder it is the less active bacteria normally are , " he said .
" there might be a very slow reaction from the environment .
in alaska , where the spill from the exxon valdez was , we can still see some signs of non-recovery now . " the beluga shipping company , however , is already planning another voyage through the northeastern passage for next year .
next year 's trip , again on behalf of general electric , will be an even bigger exercise , requiring ships around double the size of the fraternity and foresight . nathan witkop editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the fraternity and foresight were accompanied by russian icebreakers , but never needed to call upon them for assistance . despite the fact that the trip took a long time to clear with russian authorities , who demanded large fees in return for their approval , the beluga shipping company said it was satisfied with the trip . " we have saved not only voyage time - around 10 days , worth around $ 200,000 - but also , we 've been able to save fossil fuels in the amount of around 200 tons per ship , and at a cost of around $ 90,000 , " said company spokesperson verena beckhusen . bildunterschrift : the northeast passage could shave some 5,400 km off some traditional routes time is money but savings in time and cash are n't likely to unleash an armada of merchant shipping on the arctic . the route is only practical for european trade with northeast asia , a fraction of the region 's total volume .

the camp was used as a base for risky attempts to reach britain . britain 's home secretary alan johnson said the action taken in calais would " disrupt illegal immigration and people-trafficking routes . "
french police cleared and then bulldozed the makeshift forest camp - known as the " jungle " - near the northern city of calais on tuesday morning .
" i welcome the swift and decisive steps that the french government has taken today to close the " jungle " in calais , " johnson said .
the prefect of the region told journalists after the two-hour operation that 278 migrants had been taken into custody , nearly half of them minors .
the adults were temporarily jailed , while the minors were placed in " specialized centers , " he said .
the immigrants , mostly afghans , had hoped to travel the 35 kilometers across the english channel into britain .
an end to criminal trafficking the operation by hundreds of police officers was the final step in a months-long undertaking by the french government to remove the camp .
britain and france had agreed earlier this year to step up efforts against illegal migrants by strengthening border security with state-of-the-art technology and closer cooperation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : besson warned of more raids to come on nearby squatter camps france 's immigration minister eric besson told rtl radio that the dismantling of the camp was justified , calling the site a " base camp for human traffickers . "
the police operation " targeted the tools of the criminal gangs who sell migrants passage to britain , exploit them and have them living in what had become an open air garbage dump , " he said .
besson said that each migrant would be offered an " individual solution " and given the choice to leave voluntarily , apply for asylum or be forcibly deported .
aid groups predict , though , that many of the immigrants will simply end up back on the streets .
" they are going to be scattered across the countryside , at the mercy of traffickers , " said jean-claude lenoir of the salam migrant support group .
" at least here , the young people had built a kind of community .
it 's tragic . "
problem of illegal immigration continues the un refugee agency unhcr said it recognized the need to combat smuggling and trafficking of persons and the right of the french government to maintain public order .
" closing the so-called jungle camp does , however , not address the phenomenon of mixed and irregular migration , nor does it solve the problems of the people concerned , amongst whom there may be many with protection needs , " unhcr spokesman andrej mahecic said at a press briefing in geneva on tuesday .
bildunterschrift : the migrants had gathered before their evacuation to demonstrate their plight unhcr called on the french authorities to ensure that those who wish to apply for refugee protection were given access to " a full and fair asylum procedure , " mahecic said .
" the situation in calais underscores , once again , the need for governments in europe to intensify efforts to arrive at a common european asylum system , not only on paper , but also in practice , " he said .
besson said the calais crisis was partly caused by the lack of a coherent european union migration policy .
he said states should agree to share the asylum burden more fairly , while boosting the powers of the eu border police , frontex. sac / ap / afp / dpa editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hainer played in attack , while zeitz was goalkeeper .
the game was meant to bring a symbolic end to one of germany 's most infamous family feuds , which began in 1948 when a row between brothers rudolf and adolf dassler split the family sportswear business , already a major supplier in the field , into two camps .
rudolf founded puma in 1948 , while adolf , or adi , dassler founded adidas in 1949 .
their rivalry divided the dasslers ' home town of 23,000 people , where competing factories were built on opposite sides of the aurach river .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adidas provides the soccer balls for the world cup skeletons in the sportswear closet there are plenty of rumors about the cause of the split , including the story that rudolf had an affair with adolf 's wife kaethe in 1940 .
monday 's football match was the first conciliatory gesture between the two companies , even though neither has belonged to the dassler family for years .
both companies have become international leaders in the sportswear field , with puma signing a sponsorship deal with record-breaking sprinter usain bolt .
for its part , adidas recently extended its partnership with the football organization uefa , providing equipment for all international football tournaments until 2017 .
according to the german financial newspaper handelsblatt , adidas is currently the second biggest sportswear manufacturer in the world behind nike , while puma is third .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : puma makes usain bolt 's running shoes the sporting event was held in support of the peace one day initiative , set up by film-maker jeremy gilley in 1999 .
the initiative , which was adopted in 2001 as part of the un 's international day of peace on september 21 , was meant to establish an annual day of global ceasefire and non-violence with a fixed calendar date. bk / afp / reuters / ap editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ciulli rejected the demand .
" this is not an anti-semitic piece , but one that addresses the subject of anti-semitism , " he said , stressing the " autonomy of theatric art . "
he stressed that the play would premiere , as planned , on october 1 at his theater in the western germany city of muelheim .
it is slated to be one of three works by fassbinder to be shown in a three-hour evening performance set .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the play presents cliches , some jewish leaders say play staged in new york , tel aviv the play has never been performed in germany , but has been staged in new york , tel aviv and european cities .
jewish groups said the play revived stereotypes of jews , with one main character being a " rich jew " who amasses great wealth through property speculation .
in the piece , the man regularly visits a prostitute , whose father was a nazi during the third reich and co-responsible for the decimation of jews .
the prostitute becomes an object for the jew 's revenge ; her murder is ultimately covered up by the police .
murder , brutal homosexuality and sexual and psychic perversions are all part of the play , which was written in 1975 .
the " usual cliches " the central council of jews said the play presented characters " as stereotypes burdened with the usual cliches , " and said the piece should not be staged " out of respect for the small number of holocaust survivors and the millions who died . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fassbinder was known for his shocking works the play was originally scheduled to be performed in frankfurt in1985 , but was cancelled when protestors and members of the central council of jews - wearing concentration camp prisoner garb - stormed the stage , rejecting the presentation of a jew as murderer .
another attempt to stage the play in berlin 13 years later was likewise abandoned .

he tells politicians there are better ways to spend billions than on fighting climate change . the author of " the skeptical environmentalist , " bjorn lomborg , has had public disagreements with climate activists including al gore and sir nicholas stern .
lomborg 's harshest criticism , however , is aimed at the international community for spending billions on what he says are ineffective measures intended to fight climate change . he talked to deutsche welle about ongoing climate negotiations and how economists at the copenhagen consensus center , a think tank he heads , suggest spending aid and development money . deutsche welle : what do you think will emerge from the climate talks taking place at the united nations on tuesday ? bjorn lomborg : first of all , i think it 's important to recognize that probably nothing will come out of this , simply because they are so far away from the different nations on what they want to achieve . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lomborg , a danish statistician , questions environmental orthodoxy it 's always good to talk about the problem , and i think it 's good to reaffirm to everybody that we need a deal in copenhagen by the end of this year .
the problem is the focus on cutting carbon emissions is actually one that both makes it very hard for everyone to agree because the chinese and the indians do n't want to cut and while the europeans and the americans claim they want to cut , they actually also know that it 's going to cost them a lot , and it 's going to have very little benefit even in the far-off future .
that 's why they are all playing for the gallery but nobody is actually willing to really commit . the chinese leader has said he will present china 's new plans for tackling global warming at the summit .
is n't that a positive signal ? it could be .
but let 's remember that the chinese have been doing a lot of posturing on climate change and coming out and suggesting that we might even see china 's emissions maxing out in 2050 or maybe even in 2040 .
but let 's not base our hopes for a climate deal on things that will happen in 20 or 40 years . if you had to give tips to the participants , what would you advise them to talk about ? we 've run what we call the copenhagen consensus for climate , where we ask top economists , including three nobel laureates " where do you do the most good for climate with the money you 're going to be spending ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could salt particulates help cool the earth in the short-term ?
what they told us was do n't focus on cutting carbon emissions .
it 's very expensive and does very little good for the climate even 100 years from now .
in the short and medium-term , we should recognize that nothing we do will change the temperature development except looking into geo-engineering , essentially making the planet cooler - for instance by spraying up salt particulates in the atmosphere , which will amplify natural processes , make more white clouds and hence make the world a little more reflective - especially over the south pacific .
that would be very cheap and could potentially avoid global warming for the next 100 years . this is still a band-aid , so what you also need to do is more toward a situation where we can actually get people to not just talk about cutting carbon emissions but actually doing so , and we will only do that if cutting carbon emissions and green energy technologies become much , much cheaper .
that 's why their second solution was to focus on making much cheaper green energy technologies - cheaper solar panels , cheaper windmills - that will actually work . those two in conjunction is what i would like to see world leaders focus on a lot more , if we actually care about fixing climate change not just making beautiful speeches . at the moment we also have to concentrate on adaptation to climate change .
its effects are already becoming very visible .
where would your priorities lie in that area ? i 'm referring to top economists , rather than my own private opinions .
what they found is we are very often being told that there is a huge amount of impacts from climate change right now , and it 's certainly true that there are a lot of good pictures out there where you can show here 's a catastrophe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lomborg says poverty impacts people 's lives more than climate change but what we fail to recognize is that the vast majority of the impact that we are seeing right now - climate impacts and other impacts - are impacts that have been there for hundreds of years .
most of this world 's population is poor and they 're ill-prepared to deal with any contingency that the world throws at them .
what we need to focus on is not just adaption specifically for climate change , which is a small part of the problems most people live with right now , but simply making better lives for people that is focusing on getting them more food , getting them better healthcare and making sure their kids get educated . the world 's doctors have said failure to tackle climate change in copenhagen could be catastrophic for health .
is it possible to separate climate change from issues like health , food security or a safe water supply ? we do n't need to separate them in the sense that we probably all agree we should tackle some of the really big problems that are out there right now .
i 'm simply concerned that many people latch on to talking about global warming and that the most important this is spending money on adaptation to global warming . but the main problem in bangladesh or myanmar is not future sea-level rises , it 's the fact that the countries are so poor right now that they are already getting inundated .
it 's not about climate-proofing it in 100 years , it 's about dealing with the vulnerability to climate right now , which has nothing to do with climate change but simply something to do with them being very poor . it 's more about an emphasis on focusing where you can actually deal with real problems right now rather than a possible problem in 100 years . interview : irene quaile -lrb- sms -rrb- editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that 's why they are all playing for the gallery but nobody is actually willing to really commit . the chinese leader has said he will present china 's new plans for tackling global warming at the summit .
is n't that a positive signal ? it could be .
but let 's remember that the chinese have been doing a lot of posturing on climate change and coming out and suggesting that we might even see china 's emissions maxing out in 2050 or maybe even in 2040 .
but let 's not base our hopes for a climate deal on things that will happen in 20 or 40 years . if you had to give tips to the participants , what would you advise them to talk about ? we 've run what we call the copenhagen consensus for climate , where we ask top economists , including three nobel laureates " where do you do the most good for climate with the money you 're going to be spending ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could salt particulates help cool the earth in the short-term ?
what they told us was do n't focus on cutting carbon emissions .
it 's very expensive and does very little good for the climate even 100 years from now .
in the short and medium-term , we should recognize that nothing we do will change the temperature development except looking into geo-engineering , essentially making the planet cooler - for instance by spraying up salt particulates in the atmosphere , which will amplify natural processes , make more white clouds and hence make the world a little more reflective - especially over the south pacific .
that would be very cheap and could potentially avoid global warming for the next 100 years . this is still a band-aid , so what you also need to do is more toward a situation where we can actually get people to not just talk about cutting carbon emissions but actually doing so , and we will only do that if cutting carbon emissions and green energy technologies become much , much cheaper .
that 's why their second solution was to focus on making much cheaper green energy technologies - cheaper solar panels , cheaper windmills - that will actually work . those two in conjunction is what i would like to see world leaders focus on a lot more , if we actually care about fixing climate change not just making beautiful speeches . at the moment we also have to concentrate on adaptation to climate change .
its effects are already becoming very visible .
where would your priorities lie in that area ? i 'm referring to top economists , rather than my own private opinions .
what they found is we are very often being told that there is a huge amount of impacts from climate change right now , and it 's certainly true that there are a lot of good pictures out there where you can show here 's a catastrophe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lomborg says poverty impacts people 's lives more than climate change but what we fail to recognize is that the vast majority of the impact that we are seeing right now - climate impacts and other impacts - are impacts that have been there for hundreds of years .
most of this world 's population is poor and they 're ill-prepared to deal with any contingency that the world throws at them .
what we need to focus on is not just adaption specifically for climate change , which is a small part of the problems most people live with right now , but simply making better lives for people that is focusing on getting them more food , getting them better healthcare and making sure their kids get educated . the world 's doctors have said failure to tackle climate change in copenhagen could be catastrophic for health .
is it possible to separate climate change from issues like health , food security or a safe water supply ? we do n't need to separate them in the sense that we probably all agree we should tackle some of the really big problems that are out there right now .
i 'm simply concerned that many people latch on to talking about global warming and that the most important this is spending money on adaptation to global warming . but the main problem in bangladesh or myanmar is not future sea-level rises , it 's the fact that the countries are so poor right now that they are already getting inundated .
it 's not about climate-proofing it in 100 years , it 's about dealing with the vulnerability to climate right now , which has nothing to do with climate change but simply something to do with them being very poor . it 's more about an emphasis on focusing where you can actually deal with real problems right now rather than a possible problem in 100 years . interview : irene quaile -lrb- sms -rrb- editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the french immigration ministry has said it will close the camp by the end of the week .
but it has also promised to find an " individual solution " for each migrant .
" there wo n't be any forced returns to unsafe conditions , " said immigration minister eric besson .
" whether a voluntary return home , an asylum request , or explusion , we will deal with each migrant on an individual basis . "

of these , most have now ventured on to other places in europe - like britain , belgium , holland , and norway .
workers for the several aid groups in calais say those who remain in the ' jungle ' have no where else to go .
" those still here are mostly minors who can not be deported , or others who simply do n't have the money or connections to leave , " said vincent lenoir , of the salam migrant support group .
one of the migrants , bashir , a 24-year-old english teacher from northern afghanistan , paid $ 15,000 -lrb- 10,000 euros -rrb- to make the trip via pakistan and istanbul .
" we have no idea what the police will do , if they will take us or let us go free , but here we already made our place .
here we have our houses , our showers and our mosque , " he said .

city officials also support the police operation , saying the situation has become unbearable .
french authorities operated a center for migrants at sangatte , near calais , but closed it in 2002 because of crime and accusations from london that it was acting as a magnet for migrants headed for britain .
the french government says it is determined to stop illegal immigrants from entering the country , which it says is part of its stand against the practice of human trafficking .
paris says it has planned several spike operations – like this one in calais – to be carried out in the near future. glb / afp / reuters editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ciulli rejected the demand .
" this is not an anti-semitic piece , but one that addresses the subject of anti-semitism , " he said , stressing the " autonomy of theatric art . "
he stressed that the play would premiere , as planned , on october 1 at his theater in the western germany city of muelheim .
it is slated to be one of three works by fassbinder to be shown in a three-hour evening performance set .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the play presents cliches , some jewish leaders say play staged in new york , tel aviv the play has never been performed in germany , but has been staged in new york , tel aviv and european cities .
jewish groups said the play revived stereotypes of jews , with one main character being a " rich jew " who amasses great wealth through property speculation .
in the piece , the man regularly visits a prostitute , whose father was a nazi during the third reich and co-responsible for the decimation of jews .
the prostitute becomes an object for the jew 's revenge ; her murder is ultimately covered up by the police .
murder , brutal homosexuality and sexual and psychic perversions are all part of the play , which was written in 1975 .
the " usual cliches " the central council of jews said the play presented characters " as stereotypes burdened with the usual cliches , " and said the piece should not be staged " out of respect for the small number of holocaust survivors and the millions who died . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fassbinder was known for his shocking works the play was originally scheduled to be performed in frankfurt in1985 , but was cancelled when protestors and members of the central council of jews - wearing concentration camp prisoner garb - stormed the stage , rejecting the presentation of a jew as murderer .
another attempt to stage the play in berlin 13 years later was likewise abandoned .
this is not the first time works by the late fassbinder have unnerved audiences .
the writer and director is known for his socially critical works , and is most famous for his film " the marriage of maria braun . "
he died in 1982 at the age of 37 from heart failure related to drugs. als / dpa / epd editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not all of them .
a quirk in the german electoral process awards larger parties a disproportionate number of parliamentary seats .
that increases the size of parliament and could give the cdu a decisive advantage in the coming vote . germany 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have repeated their warning that a new coalition led by chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- would be " illegitimate " if it were dependent upon winning additional seats that are awarded through an anomaly of the country 's election laws .
germans elect their representatives in a complicated process .
it involves dividing up the 598 seats in the bundestag , or parliament , into two groups , which are filled using two votes .
the first vote is for an actual candidate : each electoral district has candidates from one or several parties that campaign for a seat .
these seats are handed out in a simple , first-past-the-post majority , a system that often places smaller parties at a disadvantage .
two-vote system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier derided a coalition won on overhang seats the other 299 seats are allocated based on the second vote , which is for a party .
the votes of the 62 million germans eligible to take part in the election are added up and then divided by the number of parties .
those seats are then handed out to the people each party has put on a list , which is divided up among all 16 german states .
an example : in 2005 the conservative cdu and its bavarian sister party the csu took 35.2 percent of the vote for parties .
but 150 of their candidates were elected directly .
under german electoral law , if a party wins more direct seats than they would be entitled to under the votes cast for the party lists , then they are allowed to keep those extra seats and the total number in the bundestag simply goes up .
this is known as the ueberhangmandate , or " overhang seats . "
thus , the conservatives were awarded 246 parliamentary seats - some five percent more than the proportion of the party votes cast for them . if we take a local example , we see that the cdu won 31 out of 35 districts in the state of baden-wuerttemberg , which means they were entitled to 31 seats .
however , when its share of the second vote was tallied , it was actually only supposed to get 28 of the state 's 74 seats , meaning it got three extra seats .
at the moment , there are 611 seats in the bundestag , which include the 13 overhang seats that were created by the 2005 election .
the amount of overhang seats is determined anew by each election .
last week , merkel sparked debate by saying she was prepared to form a government with a coalition whose majority was based purely on these additional seats .
' not a second-class mandate ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to merkel , any win is a good win " a mandate based on overhang seats is no second class mandate , " the chancellor said during a press conference .
the spd 's parliamentary leader thomas oppermann responded that , if this were to happen , " for the first time in germany there would be a government which the voters did n't choose and did n't want . "
normally , this is n't a big deal .
back in 2005 it was n't enough to give the cdu anything close to a clear majority and they were forced to form a grand coalition with the spd .
however , in 1994 the cdu was granted 12 extra overhang seats , allowing helmut kohl to maintain his position as chancellor. mrm / dpa / reuters / afp editor : tony dunham send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the camp was used as a base for risky attempts to reach britain . britain 's home secretary alan johnson said the action taken in calais would " disrupt illegal immigration and people-trafficking routes . "
french police cleared and then bulldozed the makeshift forest camp - known as the " jungle " - near the northern city of calais on tuesday morning .
" i welcome the swift and decisive steps that the french government has taken today to close the " jungle " in calais , " johnson said .
the prefect of the region told journalists after the two-hour operation that 278 migrants had been taken into custody , nearly half of them minors .
the adults were temporarily jailed , while the minors were placed in " specialized centers , " he said .
the immigrants , mostly afghans , had hoped to travel the 35 kilometers across the english channel into britain .
an end to criminal trafficking the operation by hundreds of police officers was the final step in a months-long undertaking by the french government to remove the camp .
britain and france had agreed earlier this year to step up efforts against illegal migrants by strengthening border security with state-of-the-art technology and closer cooperation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : besson warned of more raids to come on nearby squatter camps france 's immigration minister eric besson told rtl radio that the dismantling of the camp was justified , calling the site a " base camp for human traffickers . "
the police operation " targeted the tools of the criminal gangs who sell migrants passage to britain , exploit them and have them living in what had become an open air garbage dump , " he said .
besson said that each migrant would be offered an " individual solution " and given the choice to leave voluntarily , apply for asylum or be forcibly deported .
aid groups predict , though , that many of the immigrants will simply end up back on the streets .
" they are going to be scattered across the countryside , at the mercy of traffickers , " said jean-claude lenoir of the salam migrant support group .
" at least here , the young people had built a kind of community .
it 's tragic . "
problem of illegal immigration continues the un refugee agency unhcr said it recognized the need to combat smuggling and trafficking of persons and the right of the french government to maintain public order .
" closing the so-called jungle camp does , however , not address the phenomenon of mixed and irregular migration , nor does it solve the problems of the people concerned , amongst whom there may be many with protection needs , " unhcr spokesman andrej mahecic said at a press briefing in geneva on tuesday .
bildunterschrift : the migrants had gathered before their evacuation to demonstrate their plight unhcr called on the french authorities to ensure that those who wish to apply for refugee protection were given access to " a full and fair asylum procedure , " mahecic said .
" the situation in calais underscores , once again , the need for governments in europe to intensify efforts to arrive at a common european asylum system , not only on paper , but also in practice , " he said .
besson said the calais crisis was partly caused by the lack of a coherent european union migration policy .
he said states should agree to share the asylum burden more fairly , while boosting the powers of the eu border police , frontex. sac / ap / afp / dpa editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not all of them .
a quirk in the german electoral process awards larger parties a disproportionate number of parliamentary seats .
that increases the size of parliament and could give the cdu a decisive advantage in the coming vote . germany 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have repeated their warning that a new coalition led by chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- would be " illegitimate " if it were dependent upon winning additional seats that are awarded through an anomaly of the country 's election laws .
germans elect their representatives in a complicated process .
it involves dividing up the 598 seats in the bundestag , or parliament , into two groups , which are filled using two votes .
the first vote is for an actual candidate : each electoral district has candidates from one or several parties that campaign for a seat .
these seats are handed out in a simple , first-past-the-post majority , a system that often places smaller parties at a disadvantage .
two-vote system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier derided a coalition won on overhang seats the other 299 seats are allocated based on the second vote , which is for a party .
the votes of the 62 million germans eligible to take part in the election are added up and then divided by the number of parties .
those seats are then handed out to the people each party has put on a list , which is divided up among all 16 german states .
an example : in 2005 the conservative cdu and its bavarian sister party the csu took 35.2 percent of the vote for parties .
but 150 of their candidates were elected directly .
under german electoral law , if a party wins more direct seats than they would be entitled to under the votes cast for the party lists , then they are allowed to keep those extra seats and the total number in the bundestag simply goes up .
this is known as the ueberhangmandate , or " overhang seats . "
thus , the conservatives were awarded 246 parliamentary seats - some five percent more than the proportion of the party votes cast for them . if we take a local example , we see that the cdu won 31 out of 35 districts in the state of baden-wuerttemberg , which means they were entitled to 31 seats .
however , when its share of the second vote was tallied , it was actually only supposed to get 28 of the state 's 74 seats , meaning it got three extra seats .
at the moment , there are 611 seats in the bundestag , which include the 13 overhang seats that were created by the 2005 election .
the amount of overhang seats is determined anew by each election .
last week , merkel sparked debate by saying she was prepared to form a government with a coalition whose majority was based purely on these additional seats .
' not a second-class mandate ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to merkel , any win is a good win " a mandate based on overhang seats is no second class mandate , " the chancellor said during a press conference .

as the fabled northeast passage comes a step closer to reality , some say it may end up a road seldom traveled . the two vessels successfully navigated the narrow strip of water off russia 's northern coast last week . the vessels had delivered their cargo of heavy industrial equipment , loaded in south korea , to novy port in western siberia , and were now continuing their voyage to nigeria , where they were due to deliver a shipment of steel pipes picked up in the russian port of arkhangelsk , according to the beluga shipping company , which owns the vessels . the voyage only became possible because of climate change . melting arctic sea ice has opened the way for ships to navigate the arctic waters and avoid the icebergs , floes and pack ice that have confounded previous attempts to use the route for trade . the arctic 's sea ice thawed to its third-lowest level on record this summer .

the fraternity and foresight were accompanied by russian icebreakers , but never needed to call upon them for assistance . despite the fact that the trip took a long time to clear with russian authorities , who demanded large fees in return for their approval , the beluga shipping company said it was satisfied with the trip . " we have saved not only voyage time - around 10 days , worth around $ 200,000 - but also , we 've been able to save fossil fuels in the amount of around 200 tons per ship , and at a cost of around $ 90,000 , " said company spokesperson verena beckhusen . bildunterschrift : the northeast passage could shave some 5,400 km off some traditional routes time is money but savings in time and cash are n't likely to unleash an armada of merchant shipping on the arctic . the route is only practical for european trade with northeast asia , a fraction of the region 's total volume .
furthermore , only certain kinds of cargo will be worth sending via the northeast passage , said max johns , spokesperson for the german ship owners association . " container ships will always take the southern route because there are many more ports , " he said .
" container ships work a little bit like buses in a city .
they have to go from port to port and collect and deliver containers in every possible port otherwise it is not worthwhile running them . " the northeast passage makes most sense for specialist deliveries of heavy-lift cargo , or bulk quantities of commodities like coal , iron ore and oil , johns added . added complications , new attractions the passage is also only open for a six- to eight-week window each summer .
then there is the challenge of dealing with an expensive , and byzantine , russian bureaucracy : the beluga shipping company only won final approval for its voyage in august following an application process that took nearly a year . one underplayed aspect of beluga 's successful voyage is that it makes resource extraction in the region more attractive . " the extraction is the real attraction now when the ice melts , and especially russia has a very keen eye on that , " johns said .
" for us , as service providers , it may be interesting to transport that cargo to where it is being needed . " environmental hazard bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has been keen to stake its claim to parts of the arctic vast quantities of energy resources are believed to be located in the arctic .

" if there were an oil spill , either from shipping or from the extraction work which will also increase when the ice is going ... then combating it would be very difficult , " said ulrich claussen , who leads the german federal environment 's agency 's efforts to protect marine life . the cold and stormy weather conditions would complicate clean-up efforts from a technical point of view and would also hinder the region 's natural capacity to absorb damage , claussen added . " normally bacteria can degrade the oil , but the colder it is the less active bacteria normally are , " he said .
" there might be a very slow reaction from the environment .

as the fabled northeast passage comes a step closer to reality , some say it may end up a road seldom traveled . the two vessels successfully navigated the narrow strip of water off russia 's northern coast last week . the vessels had delivered their cargo of heavy industrial equipment , loaded in south korea , to novy port in western siberia , and were now continuing their voyage to nigeria , where they were due to deliver a shipment of steel pipes picked up in the russian port of arkhangelsk , according to the beluga shipping company , which owns the vessels . the voyage only became possible because of climate change . melting arctic sea ice has opened the way for ships to navigate the arctic waters and avoid the icebergs , floes and pack ice that have confounded previous attempts to use the route for trade . the arctic 's sea ice thawed to its third-lowest level on record this summer .
on sept .
12 , it covered around 5.1 million square kilometers -lrb- 2 million square miles -rrb- - around a million square kilometers more than in 2007 , which had the lowest coverage since records began some 30 years ago . the beluga fraternity and beluga foresight are the first western commercial ships to transit the northeast passage successfully , according to the bremen-based shipping company . until now , only parts of the route have been navigable at any given time , and they were only used by russian shipping companies .
the fraternity and foresight were accompanied by russian icebreakers , but never needed to call upon them for assistance . despite the fact that the trip took a long time to clear with russian authorities , who demanded large fees in return for their approval , the beluga shipping company said it was satisfied with the trip . " we have saved not only voyage time - around 10 days , worth around $ 200,000 - but also , we 've been able to save fossil fuels in the amount of around 200 tons per ship , and at a cost of around $ 90,000 , " said company spokesperson verena beckhusen . bildunterschrift : the northeast passage could shave some 5,400 km off some traditional routes time is money but savings in time and cash are n't likely to unleash an armada of merchant shipping on the arctic . the route is only practical for european trade with northeast asia , a fraction of the region 's total volume .
furthermore , only certain kinds of cargo will be worth sending via the northeast passage , said max johns , spokesperson for the german ship owners association . " container ships will always take the southern route because there are many more ports , " he said .
" container ships work a little bit like buses in a city .
they have to go from port to port and collect and deliver containers in every possible port otherwise it is not worthwhile running them . " the northeast passage makes most sense for specialist deliveries of heavy-lift cargo , or bulk quantities of commodities like coal , iron ore and oil , johns added . added complications , new attractions the passage is also only open for a six- to eight-week window each summer .
then there is the challenge of dealing with an expensive , and byzantine , russian bureaucracy : the beluga shipping company only won final approval for its voyage in august following an application process that took nearly a year . one underplayed aspect of beluga 's successful voyage is that it makes resource extraction in the region more attractive . " the extraction is the real attraction now when the ice melts , and especially russia has a very keen eye on that , " johns said .
" for us , as service providers , it may be interesting to transport that cargo to where it is being needed . " environmental hazard bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has been keen to stake its claim to parts of the arctic vast quantities of energy resources are believed to be located in the arctic .
with some countries already gearing up to exploit them , this is precisely the kind of cargo that concerns environmentalists most . " if there were an oil spill , either from shipping or from the extraction work which will also increase when the ice is going ... then combating it would be very difficult , " said ulrich claussen , who leads the german federal environment 's agency 's efforts to protect marine life . the cold and stormy weather conditions would complicate clean-up efforts from a technical point of view and would also hinder the region 's natural capacity to absorb damage , claussen added . " normally bacteria can degrade the oil , but the colder it is the less active bacteria normally are , " he said .
" there might be a very slow reaction from the environment .
in alaska , where the spill from the exxon valdez was , we can still see some signs of non-recovery now . " the beluga shipping company , however , is already planning another voyage through the northeastern passage for next year .

the camp was used as a base for risky attempts to reach britain . britain 's home secretary alan johnson said the action taken in calais would " disrupt illegal immigration and people-trafficking routes . "
french police cleared and then bulldozed the makeshift forest camp - known as the " jungle " - near the northern city of calais on tuesday morning .
" i welcome the swift and decisive steps that the french government has taken today to close the " jungle " in calais , " johnson said .
the prefect of the region told journalists after the two-hour operation that 278 migrants had been taken into custody , nearly half of them minors .
the adults were temporarily jailed , while the minors were placed in " specialized centers , " he said .
the immigrants , mostly afghans , had hoped to travel the 35 kilometers across the english channel into britain .
an end to criminal trafficking the operation by hundreds of police officers was the final step in a months-long undertaking by the french government to remove the camp .
britain and france had agreed earlier this year to step up efforts against illegal migrants by strengthening border security with state-of-the-art technology and closer cooperation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : besson warned of more raids to come on nearby squatter camps france 's immigration minister eric besson told rtl radio that the dismantling of the camp was justified , calling the site a " base camp for human traffickers . "
the police operation " targeted the tools of the criminal gangs who sell migrants passage to britain , exploit them and have them living in what had become an open air garbage dump , " he said .
besson said that each migrant would be offered an " individual solution " and given the choice to leave voluntarily , apply for asylum or be forcibly deported .
aid groups predict , though , that many of the immigrants will simply end up back on the streets .
" they are going to be scattered across the countryside , at the mercy of traffickers , " said jean-claude lenoir of the salam migrant support group .
" at least here , the young people had built a kind of community .
it 's tragic . "
problem of illegal immigration continues the un refugee agency unhcr said it recognized the need to combat smuggling and trafficking of persons and the right of the french government to maintain public order .
" closing the so-called jungle camp does , however , not address the phenomenon of mixed and irregular migration , nor does it solve the problems of the people concerned , amongst whom there may be many with protection needs , " unhcr spokesman andrej mahecic said at a press briefing in geneva on tuesday .
bildunterschrift : the migrants had gathered before their evacuation to demonstrate their plight unhcr called on the french authorities to ensure that those who wish to apply for refugee protection were given access to " a full and fair asylum procedure , " mahecic said .
" the situation in calais underscores , once again , the need for governments in europe to intensify efforts to arrive at a common european asylum system , not only on paper , but also in practice , " he said .
besson said the calais crisis was partly caused by the lack of a coherent european union migration policy .

while some say the discussions are necessary , others say the time for action , not talk , has come . representatives from around the world are gathering in the united states for a week 's worth of climate talks .
on tuesday , un secretary-general ban ki-moon is staging his own climate summit , ahead of two-days of g-20 talks in pittsburgh , pennsylvania , beginning thursday . the most recent in a long series of formal meetings and informal pow-wows , the meetings provide international leaders with further opportunities to share their views on how to counter climate change in the run-up to the key un climate conference in copenhagen in december . " there are more and more climate conferences that are getting more and more complex and including more and more issues , " said miranda schreurs , a professor at berlin 's free university and a member of the german environmental advisory board .
" it can sometimes be overwhelming both for the public and the negotiators , who are working long days and traveling from one conference to another . " the sheer number of places to meet can even be overwhelming .
what 's come to be called " climate week " kicked off in washington last thursday , continues at the un in new york and concludes when g-20 leaders meet in pittsburgh for two days of talks beginning thursday .
the un 's climate secretariat , the unfccc , will hold further talks in bangkok and barcelona ahead of the copenhagen event . ample opportunity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists say politians are dragging their heels the abundance of places to present a position has not yet led to a clear improvement in countries ' ability to reach an agreement , according to some environmental groups . " this is a unique opportunity to show political will and face up to global warming , " said kim carstensen , head of the wwf 's global climate initiative .
" without new , powerful political impetus at the meetings in september , the climate negotiations could be doomed . " the united nations ' goal is to have environment ministers gather in copenhagen in december and agree to a new round of greenhouse gas emissions cuts that would be introduced when the kyoto protocol expires in 2012 .
however , the prospect of an agreement to cut emissions by up to 40 percent by 2020 , as scientists have called for , appears very distant . " the ongoing negotiations have been stuck in a dead end for months because industrialized nations refuse to make a fair contribution to protecting the global climate , " jan kowalzig , a climate expert at oxfam germany , said in a statement . conferences large and small bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ultimately , heads of government need to come to the table un secretary-general ban ki-moon has also warned that climate change will have severe effects on the entire planet if world leaders ca n't reach a compromise . " our foot is stuck on the accelerator and we are heading towards an abyss , " he said at another conference earlier this month the geneva .
" climate change could spell widespread disaster . " while such warnings are part of political negotiating tactics , the environment may not benefit from nations leaving the table and implementing their own plans , in the view of berlin professor schreurs . " despite the kyoto protocol and despite the efforts of individual countries , carbon dioxide emissions have increased 30 percent since 1990 , " she said .
" we need leading countries to pressure others into acting . " while important for establishing global norms , exchanging information and giving voice to everyone affected by global warming , massive conferences with dozens of participating nations are not always the best places to reach a deal , schreurs added . some argue that smaller roundtables , such as " big 17 " talks held last week in washington among the 17 largest economies , which are also the largest greenhouse gas emitters , often involve less bureaucracy and can lead to faster solutions .
whatever the official set-up , informal conversations could be more apt to bring about progress . as german environment expert schreurs pointed out , " compromise can sometimes be reached over a beer after a day of negotiations or when people bump into each other at airports on their various trips .

china has become the world 's largest emitter of carbon dioxide and the country 's climate policy is being closely watched in the run-up to the copenhagen climate summit taking place at the end of the year .
hu jintao pledged to " vigorously " develop renewable energies , which will account for 15 percent of china 's energy mix by 2020 , as well as to boost nuclear energy . china currently has 11 nuclear reactors , which generate nine gigawatts of energy , enough to provide 1 percent of the country ’ s energy .
24 are in the making right now and 18 more are planned in the future .
by 2020 , 70 gigawatts of nuclear energy will be generated - enough to power 70 cities the size of san francisco .
zhou dadi from the energy research institute of the national development and reform commission in beijing says : “ nuclear energy can help restrict pollution , protect the environment and optimise our energy supply .
our studies show that china sees nuclear energy as an important means of reducing pollution , acquiring more energy and reducing our dependence on coal .
nuclear energy is going to develop very fast in the future . ”
china still gets most of its energy - over 70 percent - from coal .
but coal-powered stations can not meet the demand .
the electricity grid often collapses .
there are power cuts in summer particularly because of the intense use of air conditioning .
on top of that , the power stations are old and pollute the atmosphere heavily .
little public debate about risks as china is turning to nuclear energy as a long-term alternative , there is more and more talk of the risks involved .
but nuclear expert zhou dadi thinks there is no need to worry : “ we are learning from the experiences in the united states , japan and europe .
in europe , the nuclear power stations are built near the cities .
it ’ s very important to choose the right technology and to ensure conditions are safe .
when we make decisions we will choose places which are not heavily populated .
i am sure that china will choose the most advanced technology . ”
although beijing is insistent that high safety standards should be met , this is not always the case in the provinces where corruption is high .
there is also very little public debate about nuclear power - about its advantages and about the risks involved .
critics of nuclear energy are often faced with reprisals .
nuclear waste causing concern wang , a student of english in beijing , says she is “ very much afraid of living close to a nuclear power plant .
there are many natural disasters such as earthquakes and landslides .
i don ’ t know how to prevent being exposed to radiation .
i don ’ t think we have enough knowledge about the dangers or bad effects of nuclear power . ”
nuclear waste is also causing concern but zhou dadi once again dismisses fears : “ we are thinking about how to recycle nuclear liquids .
we ’ re looking at the same methods as the international community - for example storing the waste deep underground .
china will act responsibly . "
a plan to store nuclear waste in the gobi desert has now been rejected .
there is still no alternative .

china has become the world 's largest emitter of carbon dioxide and the country 's climate policy is being closely watched in the run-up to the copenhagen climate summit taking place at the end of the year .
hu jintao pledged to " vigorously " develop renewable energies , which will account for 15 percent of china 's energy mix by 2020 , as well as to boost nuclear energy . china currently has 11 nuclear reactors , which generate nine gigawatts of energy , enough to provide 1 percent of the country ’ s energy .
24 are in the making right now and 18 more are planned in the future .
by 2020 , 70 gigawatts of nuclear energy will be generated - enough to power 70 cities the size of san francisco .
zhou dadi from the energy research institute of the national development and reform commission in beijing says : “ nuclear energy can help restrict pollution , protect the environment and optimise our energy supply .
our studies show that china sees nuclear energy as an important means of reducing pollution , acquiring more energy and reducing our dependence on coal .
nuclear energy is going to develop very fast in the future . ”
china still gets most of its energy - over 70 percent - from coal .
but coal-powered stations can not meet the demand .
the electricity grid often collapses .
there are power cuts in summer particularly because of the intense use of air conditioning .
on top of that , the power stations are old and pollute the atmosphere heavily .
little public debate about risks as china is turning to nuclear energy as a long-term alternative , there is more and more talk of the risks involved .
but nuclear expert zhou dadi thinks there is no need to worry : “ we are learning from the experiences in the united states , japan and europe .
in europe , the nuclear power stations are built near the cities .
it ’ s very important to choose the right technology and to ensure conditions are safe .
when we make decisions we will choose places which are not heavily populated .
i am sure that china will choose the most advanced technology . ”
although beijing is insistent that high safety standards should be met , this is not always the case in the provinces where corruption is high .
there is also very little public debate about nuclear power - about its advantages and about the risks involved .
critics of nuclear energy are often faced with reprisals .
nuclear waste causing concern wang , a student of english in beijing , says she is “ very much afraid of living close to a nuclear power plant .
there are many natural disasters such as earthquakes and landslides .
i don ’ t know how to prevent being exposed to radiation .
i don ’ t think we have enough knowledge about the dangers or bad effects of nuclear power . ”
nuclear waste is also causing concern but zhou dadi once again dismisses fears : “ we are thinking about how to recycle nuclear liquids .
we ’ re looking at the same methods as the international community - for example storing the waste deep underground .
china will act responsibly . "
a plan to store nuclear waste in the gobi desert has now been rejected .
there is still no alternative .

greece took in almost 6.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.25 billion -rrb- more from the eu 's budget than it paid into it in 2008 , according to the commission .
the bulk of that money came in payments to greek farmers and in eu funding for infrastructure projects such as highways and ports .
greece was far ahead of eu newcomer poland in the eu 's net handouts list .
poland 's net income from the eu 's budget actually fell by some three-quarters of a billion euros to 4.4 billion euros last year .
the drop owed largely to a reduction in eu payments to polish farmers .
observers say this is likely to provoke heated comments from warsaw , which has frequently accused the eu of treating the countries that joined in 2004 and 2007 less generously than older member states .
german payments hit historic highs at the other end of the scale , germany , the eu 's biggest member , paid almost 8.8 billion euros more into the budget than it received .
this marks the biggest contribution by the country in the last 10 years .
germany 's payment amounts to more than double that of the next biggest contributors , italy and france , which paid around a net 4 billion euros to the fund each .
the three countries are , however , far ahead of the eu 's other heavyweight , britain , whose net contribution fell from over 4 billion euros in 2007 to under 1 billion euros in 2008 .
in terms of absolute receipts , france maintained its position as the largest recipient of eu funds , ahead of spain , germany and italy .
britain , the eu 's third-largest economy , was only the seventh-largest recipient of funding .
the news comes as the the european commission is drawing up plans to reform the bloc 's budgetary process in a move that analysts say will likely spark a rancorous debate between countries which receive the most money from the bloc and those who pay the most into it. rb / dpa / reuters editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

greece took in almost 6.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.25 billion -rrb- more from the eu 's budget than it paid into it in 2008 , according to the commission .
the bulk of that money came in payments to greek farmers and in eu funding for infrastructure projects such as highways and ports .
greece was far ahead of eu newcomer poland in the eu 's net handouts list .
poland 's net income from the eu 's budget actually fell by some three-quarters of a billion euros to 4.4 billion euros last year .
the drop owed largely to a reduction in eu payments to polish farmers .
observers say this is likely to provoke heated comments from warsaw , which has frequently accused the eu of treating the countries that joined in 2004 and 2007 less generously than older member states .
german payments hit historic highs at the other end of the scale , germany , the eu 's biggest member , paid almost 8.8 billion euros more into the budget than it received .
this marks the biggest contribution by the country in the last 10 years .
germany 's payment amounts to more than double that of the next biggest contributors , italy and france , which paid around a net 4 billion euros to the fund each .
the three countries are , however , far ahead of the eu 's other heavyweight , britain , whose net contribution fell from over 4 billion euros in 2007 to under 1 billion euros in 2008 .
in terms of absolute receipts , france maintained its position as the largest recipient of eu funds , ahead of spain , germany and italy .
britain , the eu 's third-largest economy , was only the seventh-largest recipient of funding .
the news comes as the the european commission is drawing up plans to reform the bloc 's budgetary process in a move that analysts say will likely spark a rancorous debate between countries which receive the most money from the bloc and those who pay the most into it. rb / dpa / reuters editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the camp was used as a base for risky attempts to reach britain . britain 's home secretary alan johnson said the action taken in calais would " disrupt illegal immigration and people-trafficking routes . "
french police cleared and then bulldozed the makeshift forest camp - known as the " jungle " - near the northern city of calais on tuesday morning .
" i welcome the swift and decisive steps that the french government has taken today to close the " jungle " in calais , " johnson said .
the prefect of the region told journalists after the two-hour operation that 278 migrants had been taken into custody , nearly half of them minors .
the adults were temporarily jailed , while the minors were placed in " specialized centers , " he said .
the immigrants , mostly afghans , had hoped to travel the 35 kilometers across the english channel into britain .
an end to criminal trafficking the operation by hundreds of police officers was the final step in a months-long undertaking by the french government to remove the camp .
britain and france had agreed earlier this year to step up efforts against illegal migrants by strengthening border security with state-of-the-art technology and closer cooperation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : besson warned of more raids to come on nearby squatter camps france 's immigration minister eric besson told rtl radio that the dismantling of the camp was justified , calling the site a " base camp for human traffickers . "
the police operation " targeted the tools of the criminal gangs who sell migrants passage to britain , exploit them and have them living in what had become an open air garbage dump , " he said .
besson said that each migrant would be offered an " individual solution " and given the choice to leave voluntarily , apply for asylum or be forcibly deported .
aid groups predict , though , that many of the immigrants will simply end up back on the streets .
" they are going to be scattered across the countryside , at the mercy of traffickers , " said jean-claude lenoir of the salam migrant support group .
" at least here , the young people had built a kind of community .
it 's tragic . "
problem of illegal immigration continues the un refugee agency unhcr said it recognized the need to combat smuggling and trafficking of persons and the right of the french government to maintain public order .
" closing the so-called jungle camp does , however , not address the phenomenon of mixed and irregular migration , nor does it solve the problems of the people concerned , amongst whom there may be many with protection needs , " unhcr spokesman andrej mahecic said at a press briefing in geneva on tuesday .
bildunterschrift : the migrants had gathered before their evacuation to demonstrate their plight unhcr called on the french authorities to ensure that those who wish to apply for refugee protection were given access to " a full and fair asylum procedure , " mahecic said .
" the situation in calais underscores , once again , the need for governments in europe to intensify efforts to arrive at a common european asylum system , not only on paper , but also in practice , " he said .

the camp was used as a base for risky attempts to reach britain . britain 's home secretary alan johnson said the action taken in calais would " disrupt illegal immigration and people-trafficking routes . "
french police cleared and then bulldozed the makeshift forest camp - known as the " jungle " - near the northern city of calais on tuesday morning .
" i welcome the swift and decisive steps that the french government has taken today to close the " jungle " in calais , " johnson said .
the prefect of the region told journalists after the two-hour operation that 278 migrants had been taken into custody , nearly half of them minors .
the adults were temporarily jailed , while the minors were placed in " specialized centers , " he said .
the immigrants , mostly afghans , had hoped to travel the 35 kilometers across the english channel into britain .
an end to criminal trafficking the operation by hundreds of police officers was the final step in a months-long undertaking by the french government to remove the camp .
britain and france had agreed earlier this year to step up efforts against illegal migrants by strengthening border security with state-of-the-art technology and closer cooperation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : besson warned of more raids to come on nearby squatter camps france 's immigration minister eric besson told rtl radio that the dismantling of the camp was justified , calling the site a " base camp for human traffickers . "
the police operation " targeted the tools of the criminal gangs who sell migrants passage to britain , exploit them and have them living in what had become an open air garbage dump , " he said .
besson said that each migrant would be offered an " individual solution " and given the choice to leave voluntarily , apply for asylum or be forcibly deported .
aid groups predict , though , that many of the immigrants will simply end up back on the streets .
" they are going to be scattered across the countryside , at the mercy of traffickers , " said jean-claude lenoir of the salam migrant support group .
" at least here , the young people had built a kind of community .
it 's tragic . "
problem of illegal immigration continues the un refugee agency unhcr said it recognized the need to combat smuggling and trafficking of persons and the right of the french government to maintain public order .
" closing the so-called jungle camp does , however , not address the phenomenon of mixed and irregular migration , nor does it solve the problems of the people concerned , amongst whom there may be many with protection needs , " unhcr spokesman andrej mahecic said at a press briefing in geneva on tuesday .
bildunterschrift : the migrants had gathered before their evacuation to demonstrate their plight unhcr called on the french authorities to ensure that those who wish to apply for refugee protection were given access to " a full and fair asylum procedure , " mahecic said .
" the situation in calais underscores , once again , the need for governments in europe to intensify efforts to arrive at a common european asylum system , not only on paper , but also in practice , " he said .
besson said the calais crisis was partly caused by the lack of a coherent european union migration policy .

hainer played in attack , while zeitz was goalkeeper .
the game was meant to bring a symbolic end to one of germany 's most infamous family feuds , which began in 1948 when a row between brothers rudolf and adolf dassler split the family sportswear business , already a major supplier in the field , into two camps .
rudolf founded puma in 1948 , while adolf , or adi , dassler founded adidas in 1949 .
their rivalry divided the dasslers ' home town of 23,000 people , where competing factories were built on opposite sides of the aurach river .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adidas provides the soccer balls for the world cup skeletons in the sportswear closet there are plenty of rumors about the cause of the split , including the story that rudolf had an affair with adolf 's wife kaethe in 1940 .
monday 's football match was the first conciliatory gesture between the two companies , even though neither has belonged to the dassler family for years .
both companies have become international leaders in the sportswear field , with puma signing a sponsorship deal with record-breaking sprinter usain bolt .
for its part , adidas recently extended its partnership with the football organization uefa , providing equipment for all international football tournaments until 2017 .
according to the german financial newspaper handelsblatt , adidas is currently the second biggest sportswear manufacturer in the world behind nike , while puma is third .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : puma makes usain bolt 's running shoes the sporting event was held in support of the peace one day initiative , set up by film-maker jeremy gilley in 1999 .
the initiative , which was adopted in 2001 as part of the un 's international day of peace on september 21 , was meant to establish an annual day of global ceasefire and non-violence with a fixed calendar date. bk / afp / reuters / ap editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while losses were observed across the board , exports to the united states and russia fell most sharply . the german federal statistical office published the report showing that exports to european union countries were 24 percent lower than during the same period last year , while exports to countries outside of the eu were nearly 22 percent lower on average .
the wiesbaden-based office said exports to some countries within the eu was better than to others .
export volumes to ireland , spain , hungary and the uk were " above average " , according to official figures released on tuesday .
outside of the eu , " very sharp falls were observed for deliveries to russia and to turkey , ” the report said .
exports to the us and japan were down 27 and 23 percent respectively , the report added .
the latest data point to the prolongation of a gloomy outlook for the world ’ s largest exporter .
exports rebounded in july the second quarter export figures come close on the heels of relatively encouraging data published earlier this month by the federal statistics office .
germany ’ s trade surplus jumped 12 percent in july and exports rose by more than two percent over the previous month to over 70 billion euros .
analysts said that the july trade surplus was driven largely by a solid surge in exports to asia , in particular .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite huge losses , germany remains europe 's most promising economy no quick recovery in sight on monday , the head of germany ’ s central bank warned that the economy , battered by the financial market chaos , would not recover to its pre-crisis levels for another four years . “ the economic recovery will take a while .
the german economy will not reach the level of prosperity it enjoyed in 2008 until , probably , 2013 , " bundesbank president axel weber told the frankfurter rundschau newspaper .
the road ahead would remain “ bumpy " , he added . nevertheless , he said that germany had exited the " free fall " phase . economy on the mend notwithstanding the drastic fall in exports , the german economy emerged from recession during the second quarter of this year , much earlier than previously forecast .
ing bank economist carsten brzeski said germany 's economic performance in recent months was a positive sign for the future .
" for the near term , the outlook for the german economy looks bright .
it has the potential to lead europe out of the recession , " he said .

it is slated to be one of three works by fassbinder to be shown in a three-hour evening performance set .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the play presents cliches , some jewish leaders say play staged in new york , tel aviv the play has never been performed in germany , but has been staged in new york , tel aviv and european cities .
jewish groups said the play revived stereotypes of jews , with one main character being a " rich jew " who amasses great wealth through property speculation .
in the piece , the man regularly visits a prostitute , whose father was a nazi during the third reich and co-responsible for the decimation of jews .
the prostitute becomes an object for the jew 's revenge ; her murder is ultimately covered up by the police .
murder , brutal homosexuality and sexual and psychic perversions are all part of the play , which was written in 1975 .
the " usual cliches " the central council of jews said the play presented characters " as stereotypes burdened with the usual cliches , " and said the piece should not be staged " out of respect for the small number of holocaust survivors and the millions who died . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fassbinder was known for his shocking works the play was originally scheduled to be performed in frankfurt in1985 , but was cancelled when protestors and members of the central council of jews - wearing concentration camp prisoner garb - stormed the stage , rejecting the presentation of a jew as murderer .
another attempt to stage the play in berlin 13 years later was likewise abandoned .
this is not the first time works by the late fassbinder have unnerved audiences .
the writer and director is known for his socially critical works , and is most famous for his film " the marriage of maria braun . "
he died in 1982 at the age of 37 from heart failure related to drugs. als / dpa / epd editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the migrants , meanwhile , are pleading with french authorities for shelter and protection . the operation began at dawn in the tent city , located on a patch of sandy scrubland in the channel port of calais .
with camera crews flooding the scene at " the jungle , " riot police detained 278 migrants in the raid , a top state official confirmed .
the migrants were then loaded into buses .
the french immigration ministry has said it will close the camp by the end of the week .
but it has also promised to find an " individual solution " for each migrant .
" there wo n't be any forced returns to unsafe conditions , " said immigration minister eric besson .
" whether a voluntary return home , an asylum request , or explusion , we will deal with each migrant on an individual basis . "

not all of them .
a quirk in the german electoral process awards larger parties a disproportionate number of parliamentary seats .
that increases the size of parliament and could give the cdu a decisive advantage in the coming vote . germany 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have repeated their warning that a new coalition led by chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- would be " illegitimate " if it were dependent upon winning additional seats that are awarded through an anomaly of the country 's election laws .
germans elect their representatives in a complicated process .
it involves dividing up the 598 seats in the bundestag , or parliament , into two groups , which are filled using two votes .
the first vote is for an actual candidate : each electoral district has candidates from one or several parties that campaign for a seat .
these seats are handed out in a simple , first-past-the-post majority , a system that often places smaller parties at a disadvantage .
two-vote system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier derided a coalition won on overhang seats the other 299 seats are allocated based on the second vote , which is for a party .
the votes of the 62 million germans eligible to take part in the election are added up and then divided by the number of parties .
those seats are then handed out to the people each party has put on a list , which is divided up among all 16 german states .
an example : in 2005 the conservative cdu and its bavarian sister party the csu took 35.2 percent of the vote for parties .
but 150 of their candidates were elected directly .
under german electoral law , if a party wins more direct seats than they would be entitled to under the votes cast for the party lists , then they are allowed to keep those extra seats and the total number in the bundestag simply goes up .
this is known as the ueberhangmandate , or " overhang seats . "
thus , the conservatives were awarded 246 parliamentary seats - some five percent more than the proportion of the party votes cast for them . if we take a local example , we see that the cdu won 31 out of 35 districts in the state of baden-wuerttemberg , which means they were entitled to 31 seats .
however , when its share of the second vote was tallied , it was actually only supposed to get 28 of the state 's 74 seats , meaning it got three extra seats .
at the moment , there are 611 seats in the bundestag , which include the 13 overhang seats that were created by the 2005 election .
the amount of overhang seats is determined anew by each election .
last week , merkel sparked debate by saying she was prepared to form a government with a coalition whose majority was based purely on these additional seats .
' not a second-class mandate ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to merkel , any win is a good win " a mandate based on overhang seats is no second class mandate , " the chancellor said during a press conference .
the spd 's parliamentary leader thomas oppermann responded that , if this were to happen , " for the first time in germany there would be a government which the voters did n't choose and did n't want . "
normally , this is n't a big deal .
back in 2005 it was n't enough to give the cdu anything close to a clear majority and they were forced to form a grand coalition with the spd .
however , in 1994 the cdu was granted 12 extra overhang seats , allowing helmut kohl to maintain his position as chancellor. mrm / dpa / reuters / afp editor : tony dunham send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it involves dividing up the 598 seats in the bundestag , or parliament , into two groups , which are filled using two votes .
the first vote is for an actual candidate : each electoral district has candidates from one or several parties that campaign for a seat .
these seats are handed out in a simple , first-past-the-post majority , a system that often places smaller parties at a disadvantage .
two-vote system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier derided a coalition won on overhang seats the other 299 seats are allocated based on the second vote , which is for a party .
the votes of the 62 million germans eligible to take part in the election are added up and then divided by the number of parties .
those seats are then handed out to the people each party has put on a list , which is divided up among all 16 german states .
an example : in 2005 the conservative cdu and its bavarian sister party the csu took 35.2 percent of the vote for parties .
but 150 of their candidates were elected directly .
under german electoral law , if a party wins more direct seats than they would be entitled to under the votes cast for the party lists , then they are allowed to keep those extra seats and the total number in the bundestag simply goes up .
this is known as the ueberhangmandate , or " overhang seats . "
thus , the conservatives were awarded 246 parliamentary seats - some five percent more than the proportion of the party votes cast for them . if we take a local example , we see that the cdu won 31 out of 35 districts in the state of baden-wuerttemberg , which means they were entitled to 31 seats .
however , when its share of the second vote was tallied , it was actually only supposed to get 28 of the state 's 74 seats , meaning it got three extra seats .
at the moment , there are 611 seats in the bundestag , which include the 13 overhang seats that were created by the 2005 election .
the amount of overhang seats is determined anew by each election .
last week , merkel sparked debate by saying she was prepared to form a government with a coalition whose majority was based purely on these additional seats .
' not a second-class mandate ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to merkel , any win is a good win " a mandate based on overhang seats is no second class mandate , " the chancellor said during a press conference .
the spd 's parliamentary leader thomas oppermann responded that , if this were to happen , " for the first time in germany there would be a government which the voters did n't choose and did n't want . "
normally , this is n't a big deal .
back in 2005 it was n't enough to give the cdu anything close to a clear majority and they were forced to form a grand coalition with the spd .
however , in 1994 the cdu was granted 12 extra overhang seats , allowing helmut kohl to maintain his position as chancellor. mrm / dpa / reuters / afp editor : tony dunham send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as the fabled northeast passage comes a step closer to reality , some say it may end up a road seldom traveled . the two vessels successfully navigated the narrow strip of water off russia 's northern coast last week . the vessels had delivered their cargo of heavy industrial equipment , loaded in south korea , to novy port in western siberia , and were now continuing their voyage to nigeria , where they were due to deliver a shipment of steel pipes picked up in the russian port of arkhangelsk , according to the beluga shipping company , which owns the vessels . the voyage only became possible because of climate change . melting arctic sea ice has opened the way for ships to navigate the arctic waters and avoid the icebergs , floes and pack ice that have confounded previous attempts to use the route for trade . the arctic 's sea ice thawed to its third-lowest level on record this summer .

the fraternity and foresight were accompanied by russian icebreakers , but never needed to call upon them for assistance . despite the fact that the trip took a long time to clear with russian authorities , who demanded large fees in return for their approval , the beluga shipping company said it was satisfied with the trip . " we have saved not only voyage time - around 10 days , worth around $ 200,000 - but also , we 've been able to save fossil fuels in the amount of around 200 tons per ship , and at a cost of around $ 90,000 , " said company spokesperson verena beckhusen . bildunterschrift : the northeast passage could shave some 5,400 km off some traditional routes time is money but savings in time and cash are n't likely to unleash an armada of merchant shipping on the arctic . the route is only practical for european trade with northeast asia , a fraction of the region 's total volume .
furthermore , only certain kinds of cargo will be worth sending via the northeast passage , said max johns , spokesperson for the german ship owners association . " container ships will always take the southern route because there are many more ports , " he said .
" container ships work a little bit like buses in a city .
they have to go from port to port and collect and deliver containers in every possible port otherwise it is not worthwhile running them . " the northeast passage makes most sense for specialist deliveries of heavy-lift cargo , or bulk quantities of commodities like coal , iron ore and oil , johns added . added complications , new attractions the passage is also only open for a six- to eight-week window each summer .
then there is the challenge of dealing with an expensive , and byzantine , russian bureaucracy : the beluga shipping company only won final approval for its voyage in august following an application process that took nearly a year . one underplayed aspect of beluga 's successful voyage is that it makes resource extraction in the region more attractive . " the extraction is the real attraction now when the ice melts , and especially russia has a very keen eye on that , " johns said .
" for us , as service providers , it may be interesting to transport that cargo to where it is being needed . " environmental hazard bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has been keen to stake its claim to parts of the arctic vast quantities of energy resources are believed to be located in the arctic .
with some countries already gearing up to exploit them , this is precisely the kind of cargo that concerns environmentalists most . " if there were an oil spill , either from shipping or from the extraction work which will also increase when the ice is going ... then combating it would be very difficult , " said ulrich claussen , who leads the german federal environment 's agency 's efforts to protect marine life . the cold and stormy weather conditions would complicate clean-up efforts from a technical point of view and would also hinder the region 's natural capacity to absorb damage , claussen added . " normally bacteria can degrade the oil , but the colder it is the less active bacteria normally are , " he said .
" there might be a very slow reaction from the environment .
in alaska , where the spill from the exxon valdez was , we can still see some signs of non-recovery now . " the beluga shipping company , however , is already planning another voyage through the northeastern passage for next year .

he tells politicians there are better ways to spend billions than on fighting climate change . the author of " the skeptical environmentalist , " bjorn lomborg , has had public disagreements with climate activists including al gore and sir nicholas stern .
lomborg 's harshest criticism , however , is aimed at the international community for spending billions on what he says are ineffective measures intended to fight climate change . he talked to deutsche welle about ongoing climate negotiations and how economists at the copenhagen consensus center , a think tank he heads , suggest spending aid and development money . deutsche welle : what do you think will emerge from the climate talks taking place at the united nations on tuesday ? bjorn lomborg : first of all , i think it 's important to recognize that probably nothing will come out of this , simply because they are so far away from the different nations on what they want to achieve . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lomborg , a danish statistician , questions environmental orthodoxy it 's always good to talk about the problem , and i think it 's good to reaffirm to everybody that we need a deal in copenhagen by the end of this year .
the problem is the focus on cutting carbon emissions is actually one that both makes it very hard for everyone to agree because the chinese and the indians do n't want to cut and while the europeans and the americans claim they want to cut , they actually also know that it 's going to cost them a lot , and it 's going to have very little benefit even in the far-off future .
that 's why they are all playing for the gallery but nobody is actually willing to really commit . the chinese leader has said he will present china 's new plans for tackling global warming at the summit .
is n't that a positive signal ? it could be .
but let 's remember that the chinese have been doing a lot of posturing on climate change and coming out and suggesting that we might even see china 's emissions maxing out in 2050 or maybe even in 2040 .
but let 's not base our hopes for a climate deal on things that will happen in 20 or 40 years . if you had to give tips to the participants , what would you advise them to talk about ? we 've run what we call the copenhagen consensus for climate , where we ask top economists , including three nobel laureates " where do you do the most good for climate with the money you 're going to be spending ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could salt particulates help cool the earth in the short-term ?
what they told us was do n't focus on cutting carbon emissions .
it 's very expensive and does very little good for the climate even 100 years from now .
in the short and medium-term , we should recognize that nothing we do will change the temperature development except looking into geo-engineering , essentially making the planet cooler - for instance by spraying up salt particulates in the atmosphere , which will amplify natural processes , make more white clouds and hence make the world a little more reflective - especially over the south pacific .
that would be very cheap and could potentially avoid global warming for the next 100 years . this is still a band-aid , so what you also need to do is more toward a situation where we can actually get people to not just talk about cutting carbon emissions but actually doing so , and we will only do that if cutting carbon emissions and green energy technologies become much , much cheaper .
that 's why their second solution was to focus on making much cheaper green energy technologies - cheaper solar panels , cheaper windmills - that will actually work . those two in conjunction is what i would like to see world leaders focus on a lot more , if we actually care about fixing climate change not just making beautiful speeches . at the moment we also have to concentrate on adaptation to climate change .
its effects are already becoming very visible .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : the long road to copenhagen experts express little optimism ahead of copenhagen summit brown , sarkozy propose multi-billion-dollar climate fund for poor nations hacker scandal sends ripples through climate-science community world leaders favor delaying a binding climate change deal climate -pipe- 22.09.2009 cutting carbon emissions wo n't stop climate change , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lomborg says the world faces more pressing problems than emissions as world leaders meet at the un to discuss climate change , bjorn lomborg tells dw he expects little to come from the talks .
he tells politicians there are better ways to spend billions than on fighting climate change . the author of " the skeptical environmentalist , " bjorn lomborg , has had public disagreements with climate activists including al gore and sir nicholas stern .
lomborg 's harshest criticism , however , is aimed at the international community for spending billions on what he says are ineffective measures intended to fight climate change . he talked to deutsche welle about ongoing climate negotiations and how economists at the copenhagen consensus center , a think tank he heads , suggest spending aid and development money . deutsche welle : what do you think will emerge from the climate talks taking place at the united nations on tuesday ? bjorn lomborg : first of all , i think it 's important to recognize that probably nothing will come out of this , simply because they are so far away from the different nations on what they want to achieve . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lomborg , a danish statistician , questions environmental orthodoxy it 's always good to talk about the problem , and i think it 's good to reaffirm to everybody that we need a deal in copenhagen by the end of this year .
the problem is the focus on cutting carbon emissions is actually one that both makes it very hard for everyone to agree because the chinese and the indians do n't want to cut and while the europeans and the americans claim they want to cut , they actually also know that it 's going to cost them a lot , and it 's going to have very little benefit even in the far-off future .
that 's why they are all playing for the gallery but nobody is actually willing to really commit . the chinese leader has said he will present china 's new plans for tackling global warming at the summit .
is n't that a positive signal ? it could be .
but let 's remember that the chinese have been doing a lot of posturing on climate change and coming out and suggesting that we might even see china 's emissions maxing out in 2050 or maybe even in 2040 .
but let 's not base our hopes for a climate deal on things that will happen in 20 or 40 years . if you had to give tips to the participants , what would you advise them to talk about ? we 've run what we call the copenhagen consensus for climate , where we ask top economists , including three nobel laureates " where do you do the most good for climate with the money you 're going to be spending ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could salt particulates help cool the earth in the short-term ?
what they told us was do n't focus on cutting carbon emissions .
it 's very expensive and does very little good for the climate even 100 years from now .
in the short and medium-term , we should recognize that nothing we do will change the temperature development except looking into geo-engineering , essentially making the planet cooler - for instance by spraying up salt particulates in the atmosphere , which will amplify natural processes , make more white clouds and hence make the world a little more reflective - especially over the south pacific .
that would be very cheap and could potentially avoid global warming for the next 100 years . this is still a band-aid , so what you also need to do is more toward a situation where we can actually get people to not just talk about cutting carbon emissions but actually doing so , and we will only do that if cutting carbon emissions and green energy technologies become much , much cheaper .
that 's why their second solution was to focus on making much cheaper green energy technologies - cheaper solar panels , cheaper windmills - that will actually work . those two in conjunction is what i would like to see world leaders focus on a lot more , if we actually care about fixing climate change not just making beautiful speeches . at the moment we also have to concentrate on adaptation to climate change .
its effects are already becoming very visible .
where would your priorities lie in that area ? i 'm referring to top economists , rather than my own private opinions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : the long road to copenhagen experts express little optimism ahead of copenhagen summit brown , sarkozy propose multi-billion-dollar climate fund for poor nations hacker scandal sends ripples through climate-science community world leaders favor delaying a binding climate change deal climate -pipe- 22.09.2009 cutting carbon emissions wo n't stop climate change , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lomborg says the world faces more pressing problems than emissions as world leaders meet at the un to discuss climate change , bjorn lomborg tells dw he expects little to come from the talks .
he tells politicians there are better ways to spend billions than on fighting climate change . the author of " the skeptical environmentalist , " bjorn lomborg , has had public disagreements with climate activists including al gore and sir nicholas stern .
lomborg 's harshest criticism , however , is aimed at the international community for spending billions on what he says are ineffective measures intended to fight climate change . he talked to deutsche welle about ongoing climate negotiations and how economists at the copenhagen consensus center , a think tank he heads , suggest spending aid and development money . deutsche welle : what do you think will emerge from the climate talks taking place at the united nations on tuesday ? bjorn lomborg : first of all , i think it 's important to recognize that probably nothing will come out of this , simply because they are so far away from the different nations on what they want to achieve . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lomborg , a danish statistician , questions environmental orthodoxy it 's always good to talk about the problem , and i think it 's good to reaffirm to everybody that we need a deal in copenhagen by the end of this year .
the problem is the focus on cutting carbon emissions is actually one that both makes it very hard for everyone to agree because the chinese and the indians do n't want to cut and while the europeans and the americans claim they want to cut , they actually also know that it 's going to cost them a lot , and it 's going to have very little benefit even in the far-off future .
that 's why they are all playing for the gallery but nobody is actually willing to really commit . the chinese leader has said he will present china 's new plans for tackling global warming at the summit .
is n't that a positive signal ? it could be .
but let 's remember that the chinese have been doing a lot of posturing on climate change and coming out and suggesting that we might even see china 's emissions maxing out in 2050 or maybe even in 2040 .
but let 's not base our hopes for a climate deal on things that will happen in 20 or 40 years . if you had to give tips to the participants , what would you advise them to talk about ? we 've run what we call the copenhagen consensus for climate , where we ask top economists , including three nobel laureates " where do you do the most good for climate with the money you 're going to be spending ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could salt particulates help cool the earth in the short-term ?
what they told us was do n't focus on cutting carbon emissions .
it 's very expensive and does very little good for the climate even 100 years from now .
in the short and medium-term , we should recognize that nothing we do will change the temperature development except looking into geo-engineering , essentially making the planet cooler - for instance by spraying up salt particulates in the atmosphere , which will amplify natural processes , make more white clouds and hence make the world a little more reflective - especially over the south pacific .
that would be very cheap and could potentially avoid global warming for the next 100 years . this is still a band-aid , so what you also need to do is more toward a situation where we can actually get people to not just talk about cutting carbon emissions but actually doing so , and we will only do that if cutting carbon emissions and green energy technologies become much , much cheaper .
that 's why their second solution was to focus on making much cheaper green energy technologies - cheaper solar panels , cheaper windmills - that will actually work . those two in conjunction is what i would like to see world leaders focus on a lot more , if we actually care about fixing climate change not just making beautiful speeches . at the moment we also have to concentrate on adaptation to climate change .
its effects are already becoming very visible .
where would your priorities lie in that area ? i 'm referring to top economists , rather than my own private opinions .
what they found is we are very often being told that there is a huge amount of impacts from climate change right now , and it 's certainly true that there are a lot of good pictures out there where you can show here 's a catastrophe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lomborg says poverty impacts people 's lives more than climate change but what we fail to recognize is that the vast majority of the impact that we are seeing right now - climate impacts and other impacts - are impacts that have been there for hundreds of years .
most of this world 's population is poor and they 're ill-prepared to deal with any contingency that the world throws at them .
what we need to focus on is not just adaption specifically for climate change , which is a small part of the problems most people live with right now , but simply making better lives for people that is focusing on getting them more food , getting them better healthcare and making sure their kids get educated . the world 's doctors have said failure to tackle climate change in copenhagen could be catastrophic for health .
is it possible to separate climate change from issues like health , food security or a safe water supply ? we do n't need to separate them in the sense that we probably all agree we should tackle some of the really big problems that are out there right now .
i 'm simply concerned that many people latch on to talking about global warming and that the most important this is spending money on adaptation to global warming . but the main problem in bangladesh or myanmar is not future sea-level rises , it 's the fact that the countries are so poor right now that they are already getting inundated .
it 's not about climate-proofing it in 100 years , it 's about dealing with the vulnerability to climate right now , which has nothing to do with climate change but simply something to do with them being very poor . it 's more about an emphasis on focusing where you can actually deal with real problems right now rather than a possible problem in 100 years . interview : irene quaile -lrb- sms -rrb- editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 22.09.2009 china plans to reduce carbon emissions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daya bay nuclear electricity plant in shenzhen in china 's southern guangdong province at a un climate conference in new york , chinese president hu jintao vowed to reduce the chinese economy 's carbon intensity by a " notable margin " by 2020 on tuesday .
china has become the world 's largest emitter of carbon dioxide and the country 's climate policy is being closely watched in the run-up to the copenhagen climate summit taking place at the end of the year .
hu jintao pledged to " vigorously " develop renewable energies , which will account for 15 percent of china 's energy mix by 2020 , as well as to boost nuclear energy . china currently has 11 nuclear reactors , which generate nine gigawatts of energy , enough to provide 1 percent of the country ’ s energy .
24 are in the making right now and 18 more are planned in the future .
by 2020 , 70 gigawatts of nuclear energy will be generated - enough to power 70 cities the size of san francisco .
zhou dadi from the energy research institute of the national development and reform commission in beijing says : “ nuclear energy can help restrict pollution , protect the environment and optimise our energy supply .
our studies show that china sees nuclear energy as an important means of reducing pollution , acquiring more energy and reducing our dependence on coal .
nuclear energy is going to develop very fast in the future . ”
china still gets most of its energy - over 70 percent - from coal .
but coal-powered stations can not meet the demand .
the electricity grid often collapses .
there are power cuts in summer particularly because of the intense use of air conditioning .
on top of that , the power stations are old and pollute the atmosphere heavily .
little public debate about risks as china is turning to nuclear energy as a long-term alternative , there is more and more talk of the risks involved .
but nuclear expert zhou dadi thinks there is no need to worry : “ we are learning from the experiences in the united states , japan and europe .
in europe , the nuclear power stations are built near the cities .
it ’ s very important to choose the right technology and to ensure conditions are safe .
when we make decisions we will choose places which are not heavily populated .
i am sure that china will choose the most advanced technology . ”
although beijing is insistent that high safety standards should be met , this is not always the case in the provinces where corruption is high .
there is also very little public debate about nuclear power - about its advantages and about the risks involved .
critics of nuclear energy are often faced with reprisals .
nuclear waste causing concern wang , a student of english in beijing , says she is “ very much afraid of living close to a nuclear power plant .
there are many natural disasters such as earthquakes and landslides .
i don ’ t know how to prevent being exposed to radiation .
i don ’ t think we have enough knowledge about the dangers or bad effects of nuclear power . ”
nuclear waste is also causing concern but zhou dadi once again dismisses fears : “ we are thinking about how to recycle nuclear liquids .
we ’ re looking at the same methods as the international community - for example storing the waste deep underground .
china will act responsibly . "
a plan to store nuclear waste in the gobi desert has now been rejected .
there is still no alternative .

on tuesday , un secretary-general ban ki-moon is staging his own climate summit , ahead of two-days of g-20 talks in pittsburgh , pennsylvania , beginning thursday . the most recent in a long series of formal meetings and informal pow-wows , the meetings provide international leaders with further opportunities to share their views on how to counter climate change in the run-up to the key un climate conference in copenhagen in december .

" climate change could spell widespread disaster .

" we need leading countries to pressure others into acting .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 22.09.2009 china plans to reduce carbon emissions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daya bay nuclear electricity plant in shenzhen in china 's southern guangdong province at a un climate conference in new york , chinese president hu jintao vowed to reduce the chinese economy 's carbon intensity by a " notable margin " by 2020 on tuesday .
china has become the world 's largest emitter of carbon dioxide and the country 's climate policy is being closely watched in the run-up to the copenhagen climate summit taking place at the end of the year .
hu jintao pledged to " vigorously " develop renewable energies , which will account for 15 percent of china 's energy mix by 2020 , as well as to boost nuclear energy . china currently has 11 nuclear reactors , which generate nine gigawatts of energy , enough to provide 1 percent of the country ’ s energy .
24 are in the making right now and 18 more are planned in the future .
by 2020 , 70 gigawatts of nuclear energy will be generated - enough to power 70 cities the size of san francisco .
zhou dadi from the energy research institute of the national development and reform commission in beijing says : “ nuclear energy can help restrict pollution , protect the environment and optimise our energy supply .
our studies show that china sees nuclear energy as an important means of reducing pollution , acquiring more energy and reducing our dependence on coal .
nuclear energy is going to develop very fast in the future . ”
china still gets most of its energy - over 70 percent - from coal .
but coal-powered stations can not meet the demand .
the electricity grid often collapses .
there are power cuts in summer particularly because of the intense use of air conditioning .
on top of that , the power stations are old and pollute the atmosphere heavily .
little public debate about risks as china is turning to nuclear energy as a long-term alternative , there is more and more talk of the risks involved .
but nuclear expert zhou dadi thinks there is no need to worry : “ we are learning from the experiences in the united states , japan and europe .
in europe , the nuclear power stations are built near the cities .
it ’ s very important to choose the right technology and to ensure conditions are safe .
when we make decisions we will choose places which are not heavily populated .
i am sure that china will choose the most advanced technology . ”
although beijing is insistent that high safety standards should be met , this is not always the case in the provinces where corruption is high .
there is also very little public debate about nuclear power - about its advantages and about the risks involved .
critics of nuclear energy are often faced with reprisals .
nuclear waste causing concern wang , a student of english in beijing , says she is “ very much afraid of living close to a nuclear power plant .
there are many natural disasters such as earthquakes and landslides .
i don ’ t know how to prevent being exposed to radiation .
i don ’ t think we have enough knowledge about the dangers or bad effects of nuclear power . ”
nuclear waste is also causing concern but zhou dadi once again dismisses fears : “ we are thinking about how to recycle nuclear liquids .
we ’ re looking at the same methods as the international community - for example storing the waste deep underground .
china will act responsibly . "
a plan to store nuclear waste in the gobi desert has now been rejected .
there is still no alternative .

hu jintao pledged to " vigorously " develop renewable energies , which will account for 15 percent of china 's energy mix by 2020 , as well as to boost nuclear energy . china currently has 11 nuclear reactors , which generate nine gigawatts of energy , enough to provide 1 percent of the country ’ s energy .
24 are in the making right now and 18 more are planned in the future .
by 2020 , 70 gigawatts of nuclear energy will be generated - enough to power 70 cities the size of san francisco .
zhou dadi from the energy research institute of the national development and reform commission in beijing says : “ nuclear energy can help restrict pollution , protect the environment and optimise our energy supply .
our studies show that china sees nuclear energy as an important means of reducing pollution , acquiring more energy and reducing our dependence on coal .
nuclear energy is going to develop very fast in the future . ”
china still gets most of its energy - over 70 percent - from coal .
but coal-powered stations can not meet the demand .
the electricity grid often collapses .
there are power cuts in summer particularly because of the intense use of air conditioning .
on top of that , the power stations are old and pollute the atmosphere heavily .
little public debate about risks as china is turning to nuclear energy as a long-term alternative , there is more and more talk of the risks involved .
but nuclear expert zhou dadi thinks there is no need to worry : “ we are learning from the experiences in the united states , japan and europe .
in europe , the nuclear power stations are built near the cities .
it ’ s very important to choose the right technology and to ensure conditions are safe .
when we make decisions we will choose places which are not heavily populated .
i am sure that china will choose the most advanced technology . ”
although beijing is insistent that high safety standards should be met , this is not always the case in the provinces where corruption is high .
there is also very little public debate about nuclear power - about its advantages and about the risks involved .
critics of nuclear energy are often faced with reprisals .
nuclear waste causing concern wang , a student of english in beijing , says she is “ very much afraid of living close to a nuclear power plant .
there are many natural disasters such as earthquakes and landslides .
i don ’ t know how to prevent being exposed to radiation .
i don ’ t think we have enough knowledge about the dangers or bad effects of nuclear power . ”
nuclear waste is also causing concern but zhou dadi once again dismisses fears : “ we are thinking about how to recycle nuclear liquids .
we ’ re looking at the same methods as the international community - for example storing the waste deep underground .
china will act responsibly . "
a plan to store nuclear waste in the gobi desert has now been rejected .
there is still no alternative .

china has become the world 's largest emitter of carbon dioxide and the country 's climate policy is being closely watched in the run-up to the copenhagen climate summit taking place at the end of the year .
hu jintao pledged to " vigorously " develop renewable energies , which will account for 15 percent of china 's energy mix by 2020 , as well as to boost nuclear energy . china currently has 11 nuclear reactors , which generate nine gigawatts of energy , enough to provide 1 percent of the country ’ s energy .
24 are in the making right now and 18 more are planned in the future .
by 2020 , 70 gigawatts of nuclear energy will be generated - enough to power 70 cities the size of san francisco .
zhou dadi from the energy research institute of the national development and reform commission in beijing says : “ nuclear energy can help restrict pollution , protect the environment and optimise our energy supply .
our studies show that china sees nuclear energy as an important means of reducing pollution , acquiring more energy and reducing our dependence on coal .
nuclear energy is going to develop very fast in the future . ”
china still gets most of its energy - over 70 percent - from coal .
but coal-powered stations can not meet the demand .
the electricity grid often collapses .
there are power cuts in summer particularly because of the intense use of air conditioning .
on top of that , the power stations are old and pollute the atmosphere heavily .
little public debate about risks as china is turning to nuclear energy as a long-term alternative , there is more and more talk of the risks involved .
but nuclear expert zhou dadi thinks there is no need to worry : “ we are learning from the experiences in the united states , japan and europe .
in europe , the nuclear power stations are built near the cities .
it ’ s very important to choose the right technology and to ensure conditions are safe .
when we make decisions we will choose places which are not heavily populated .
i am sure that china will choose the most advanced technology . ”
although beijing is insistent that high safety standards should be met , this is not always the case in the provinces where corruption is high .
there is also very little public debate about nuclear power - about its advantages and about the risks involved .
critics of nuclear energy are often faced with reprisals .
nuclear waste causing concern wang , a student of english in beijing , says she is “ very much afraid of living close to a nuclear power plant .
there are many natural disasters such as earthquakes and landslides .
i don ’ t know how to prevent being exposed to radiation .
i don ’ t think we have enough knowledge about the dangers or bad effects of nuclear power . ”
nuclear waste is also causing concern but zhou dadi once again dismisses fears : “ we are thinking about how to recycle nuclear liquids .
we ’ re looking at the same methods as the international community - for example storing the waste deep underground .
china will act responsibly . "
a plan to store nuclear waste in the gobi desert has now been rejected .
there is still no alternative .

critics of nuclear energy are often faced with reprisals .
nuclear waste causing concern wang , a student of english in beijing , says she is “ very much afraid of living close to a nuclear power plant .
there are many natural disasters such as earthquakes and landslides .
i don ’ t know how to prevent being exposed to radiation .
i don ’ t think we have enough knowledge about the dangers or bad effects of nuclear power . ”
nuclear waste is also causing concern but zhou dadi once again dismisses fears : “ we are thinking about how to recycle nuclear liquids .
we ’ re looking at the same methods as the international community - for example storing the waste deep underground .
china will act responsibly . "
a plan to store nuclear waste in the gobi desert has now been rejected .
there is still no alternative .

greece took in almost 6.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.25 billion -rrb- more from the eu 's budget than it paid into it in 2008 , according to the commission .
the bulk of that money came in payments to greek farmers and in eu funding for infrastructure projects such as highways and ports .
greece was far ahead of eu newcomer poland in the eu 's net handouts list .
poland 's net income from the eu 's budget actually fell by some three-quarters of a billion euros to 4.4 billion euros last year .
the drop owed largely to a reduction in eu payments to polish farmers .
observers say this is likely to provoke heated comments from warsaw , which has frequently accused the eu of treating the countries that joined in 2004 and 2007 less generously than older member states .
german payments hit historic highs at the other end of the scale , germany , the eu 's biggest member , paid almost 8.8 billion euros more into the budget than it received .
this marks the biggest contribution by the country in the last 10 years .
germany 's payment amounts to more than double that of the next biggest contributors , italy and france , which paid around a net 4 billion euros to the fund each .
the three countries are , however , far ahead of the eu 's other heavyweight , britain , whose net contribution fell from over 4 billion euros in 2007 to under 1 billion euros in 2008 .
in terms of absolute receipts , france maintained its position as the largest recipient of eu funds , ahead of spain , germany and italy .
britain , the eu 's third-largest economy , was only the seventh-largest recipient of funding .

greece took in almost 6.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.25 billion -rrb- more from the eu 's budget than it paid into it in 2008 , according to the commission .
the bulk of that money came in payments to greek farmers and in eu funding for infrastructure projects such as highways and ports .
greece was far ahead of eu newcomer poland in the eu 's net handouts list .
poland 's net income from the eu 's budget actually fell by some three-quarters of a billion euros to 4.4 billion euros last year .
the drop owed largely to a reduction in eu payments to polish farmers .
observers say this is likely to provoke heated comments from warsaw , which has frequently accused the eu of treating the countries that joined in 2004 and 2007 less generously than older member states .
german payments hit historic highs at the other end of the scale , germany , the eu 's biggest member , paid almost 8.8 billion euros more into the budget than it received .
this marks the biggest contribution by the country in the last 10 years .
germany 's payment amounts to more than double that of the next biggest contributors , italy and france , which paid around a net 4 billion euros to the fund each .
the three countries are , however , far ahead of the eu 's other heavyweight , britain , whose net contribution fell from over 4 billion euros in 2007 to under 1 billion euros in 2008 .
in terms of absolute receipts , france maintained its position as the largest recipient of eu funds , ahead of spain , germany and italy .
britain , the eu 's third-largest economy , was only the seventh-largest recipient of funding .
the news comes as the the european commission is drawing up plans to reform the bloc 's budgetary process in a move that analysts say will likely spark a rancorous debate between countries which receive the most money from the bloc and those who pay the most into it. rb / dpa / reuters editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we need leading countries to pressure others into acting .

not all of them .
a quirk in the german electoral process awards larger parties a disproportionate number of parliamentary seats .
that increases the size of parliament and could give the cdu a decisive advantage in the coming vote . germany 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have repeated their warning that a new coalition led by chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- would be " illegitimate " if it were dependent upon winning additional seats that are awarded through an anomaly of the country 's election laws .
germans elect their representatives in a complicated process .
it involves dividing up the 598 seats in the bundestag , or parliament , into two groups , which are filled using two votes .
the first vote is for an actual candidate : each electoral district has candidates from one or several parties that campaign for a seat .
these seats are handed out in a simple , first-past-the-post majority , a system that often places smaller parties at a disadvantage .
two-vote system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier derided a coalition won on overhang seats the other 299 seats are allocated based on the second vote , which is for a party .
the votes of the 62 million germans eligible to take part in the election are added up and then divided by the number of parties .
those seats are then handed out to the people each party has put on a list , which is divided up among all 16 german states .
an example : in 2005 the conservative cdu and its bavarian sister party the csu took 35.2 percent of the vote for parties .
but 150 of their candidates were elected directly .
under german electoral law , if a party wins more direct seats than they would be entitled to under the votes cast for the party lists , then they are allowed to keep those extra seats and the total number in the bundestag simply goes up .
this is known as the ueberhangmandate , or " overhang seats . "
thus , the conservatives were awarded 246 parliamentary seats - some five percent more than the proportion of the party votes cast for them . if we take a local example , we see that the cdu won 31 out of 35 districts in the state of baden-wuerttemberg , which means they were entitled to 31 seats .
however , when its share of the second vote was tallied , it was actually only supposed to get 28 of the state 's 74 seats , meaning it got three extra seats .
at the moment , there are 611 seats in the bundestag , which include the 13 overhang seats that were created by the 2005 election .
the amount of overhang seats is determined anew by each election .
last week , merkel sparked debate by saying she was prepared to form a government with a coalition whose majority was based purely on these additional seats .
' not a second-class mandate ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to merkel , any win is a good win " a mandate based on overhang seats is no second class mandate , " the chancellor said during a press conference .
the spd 's parliamentary leader thomas oppermann responded that , if this were to happen , " for the first time in germany there would be a government which the voters did n't choose and did n't want . "
normally , this is n't a big deal .
back in 2005 it was n't enough to give the cdu anything close to a clear majority and they were forced to form a grand coalition with the spd .
however , in 1994 the cdu was granted 12 extra overhang seats , allowing helmut kohl to maintain his position as chancellor. mrm / dpa / reuters / afp editor : tony dunham send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

greece took in almost 6.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.25 billion -rrb- more from the eu 's budget than it paid into it in 2008 , according to the commission .
the bulk of that money came in payments to greek farmers and in eu funding for infrastructure projects such as highways and ports .
greece was far ahead of eu newcomer poland in the eu 's net handouts list .
poland 's net income from the eu 's budget actually fell by some three-quarters of a billion euros to 4.4 billion euros last year .
the drop owed largely to a reduction in eu payments to polish farmers .
observers say this is likely to provoke heated comments from warsaw , which has frequently accused the eu of treating the countries that joined in 2004 and 2007 less generously than older member states .
german payments hit historic highs at the other end of the scale , germany , the eu 's biggest member , paid almost 8.8 billion euros more into the budget than it received .
this marks the biggest contribution by the country in the last 10 years .
germany 's payment amounts to more than double that of the next biggest contributors , italy and france , which paid around a net 4 billion euros to the fund each .
the three countries are , however , far ahead of the eu 's other heavyweight , britain , whose net contribution fell from over 4 billion euros in 2007 to under 1 billion euros in 2008 .
in terms of absolute receipts , france maintained its position as the largest recipient of eu funds , ahead of spain , germany and italy .
britain , the eu 's third-largest economy , was only the seventh-largest recipient of funding .
the news comes as the the european commission is drawing up plans to reform the bloc 's budgetary process in a move that analysts say will likely spark a rancorous debate between countries which receive the most money from the bloc and those who pay the most into it. rb / dpa / reuters editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the camp was used as a base for risky attempts to reach britain . britain 's home secretary alan johnson said the action taken in calais would " disrupt illegal immigration and people-trafficking routes . "
french police cleared and then bulldozed the makeshift forest camp - known as the " jungle " - near the northern city of calais on tuesday morning .
" i welcome the swift and decisive steps that the french government has taken today to close the " jungle " in calais , " johnson said .
the prefect of the region told journalists after the two-hour operation that 278 migrants had been taken into custody , nearly half of them minors .
the adults were temporarily jailed , while the minors were placed in " specialized centers , " he said .
the immigrants , mostly afghans , had hoped to travel the 35 kilometers across the english channel into britain .
an end to criminal trafficking the operation by hundreds of police officers was the final step in a months-long undertaking by the french government to remove the camp .
britain and france had agreed earlier this year to step up efforts against illegal migrants by strengthening border security with state-of-the-art technology and closer cooperation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : besson warned of more raids to come on nearby squatter camps france 's immigration minister eric besson told rtl radio that the dismantling of the camp was justified , calling the site a " base camp for human traffickers . "
the police operation " targeted the tools of the criminal gangs who sell migrants passage to britain , exploit them and have them living in what had become an open air garbage dump , " he said .
besson said that each migrant would be offered an " individual solution " and given the choice to leave voluntarily , apply for asylum or be forcibly deported .
aid groups predict , though , that many of the immigrants will simply end up back on the streets .
" they are going to be scattered across the countryside , at the mercy of traffickers , " said jean-claude lenoir of the salam migrant support group .
" at least here , the young people had built a kind of community .
it 's tragic . "
problem of illegal immigration continues the un refugee agency unhcr said it recognized the need to combat smuggling and trafficking of persons and the right of the french government to maintain public order .
" closing the so-called jungle camp does , however , not address the phenomenon of mixed and irregular migration , nor does it solve the problems of the people concerned , amongst whom there may be many with protection needs , " unhcr spokesman andrej mahecic said at a press briefing in geneva on tuesday .
bildunterschrift : the migrants had gathered before their evacuation to demonstrate their plight unhcr called on the french authorities to ensure that those who wish to apply for refugee protection were given access to " a full and fair asylum procedure , " mahecic said .
" the situation in calais underscores , once again , the need for governments in europe to intensify efforts to arrive at a common european asylum system , not only on paper , but also in practice , " he said .
besson said the calais crisis was partly caused by the lack of a coherent european union migration policy .
he said states should agree to share the asylum burden more fairly , while boosting the powers of the eu border police , frontex. sac / ap / afp / dpa editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ciulli rejected the demand .
" this is not an anti-semitic piece , but one that addresses the subject of anti-semitism , " he said , stressing the " autonomy of theatric art . "
he stressed that the play would premiere , as planned , on october 1 at his theater in the western germany city of muelheim .
it is slated to be one of three works by fassbinder to be shown in a three-hour evening performance set .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the play presents cliches , some jewish leaders say play staged in new york , tel aviv the play has never been performed in germany , but has been staged in new york , tel aviv and european cities .
jewish groups said the play revived stereotypes of jews , with one main character being a " rich jew " who amasses great wealth through property speculation .
in the piece , the man regularly visits a prostitute , whose father was a nazi during the third reich and co-responsible for the decimation of jews .
the prostitute becomes an object for the jew 's revenge ; her murder is ultimately covered up by the police .
murder , brutal homosexuality and sexual and psychic perversions are all part of the play , which was written in 1975 .
the " usual cliches " the central council of jews said the play presented characters " as stereotypes burdened with the usual cliches , " and said the piece should not be staged " out of respect for the small number of holocaust survivors and the millions who died . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fassbinder was known for his shocking works the play was originally scheduled to be performed in frankfurt in1985 , but was cancelled when protestors and members of the central council of jews - wearing concentration camp prisoner garb - stormed the stage , rejecting the presentation of a jew as murderer .
another attempt to stage the play in berlin 13 years later was likewise abandoned .
this is not the first time works by the late fassbinder have unnerved audiences .
the writer and director is known for his socially critical works , and is most famous for his film " the marriage of maria braun . "
he died in 1982 at the age of 37 from heart failure related to drugs. als / dpa / epd editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he tells politicians there are better ways to spend billions than on fighting climate change . the author of " the skeptical environmentalist , " bjorn lomborg , has had public disagreements with climate activists including al gore and sir nicholas stern .
lomborg 's harshest criticism , however , is aimed at the international community for spending billions on what he says are ineffective measures intended to fight climate change . he talked to deutsche welle about ongoing climate negotiations and how economists at the copenhagen consensus center , a think tank he heads , suggest spending aid and development money . deutsche welle : what do you think will emerge from the climate talks taking place at the united nations on tuesday ? bjorn lomborg : first of all , i think it 's important to recognize that probably nothing will come out of this , simply because they are so far away from the different nations on what they want to achieve . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lomborg , a danish statistician , questions environmental orthodoxy it 's always good to talk about the problem , and i think it 's good to reaffirm to everybody that we need a deal in copenhagen by the end of this year .
the problem is the focus on cutting carbon emissions is actually one that both makes it very hard for everyone to agree because the chinese and the indians do n't want to cut and while the europeans and the americans claim they want to cut , they actually also know that it 's going to cost them a lot , and it 's going to have very little benefit even in the far-off future .
that 's why they are all playing for the gallery but nobody is actually willing to really commit . the chinese leader has said he will present china 's new plans for tackling global warming at the summit .
is n't that a positive signal ? it could be .
but let 's remember that the chinese have been doing a lot of posturing on climate change and coming out and suggesting that we might even see china 's emissions maxing out in 2050 or maybe even in 2040 .
but let 's not base our hopes for a climate deal on things that will happen in 20 or 40 years . if you had to give tips to the participants , what would you advise them to talk about ? we 've run what we call the copenhagen consensus for climate , where we ask top economists , including three nobel laureates " where do you do the most good for climate with the money you 're going to be spending ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could salt particulates help cool the earth in the short-term ?
what they told us was do n't focus on cutting carbon emissions .
it 's very expensive and does very little good for the climate even 100 years from now .
in the short and medium-term , we should recognize that nothing we do will change the temperature development except looking into geo-engineering , essentially making the planet cooler - for instance by spraying up salt particulates in the atmosphere , which will amplify natural processes , make more white clouds and hence make the world a little more reflective - especially over the south pacific .
that would be very cheap and could potentially avoid global warming for the next 100 years . this is still a band-aid , so what you also need to do is more toward a situation where we can actually get people to not just talk about cutting carbon emissions but actually doing so , and we will only do that if cutting carbon emissions and green energy technologies become much , much cheaper .
that 's why their second solution was to focus on making much cheaper green energy technologies - cheaper solar panels , cheaper windmills - that will actually work . those two in conjunction is what i would like to see world leaders focus on a lot more , if we actually care about fixing climate change not just making beautiful speeches . at the moment we also have to concentrate on adaptation to climate change .
its effects are already becoming very visible .
where would your priorities lie in that area ? i 'm referring to top economists , rather than my own private opinions .
what they found is we are very often being told that there is a huge amount of impacts from climate change right now , and it 's certainly true that there are a lot of good pictures out there where you can show here 's a catastrophe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lomborg says poverty impacts people 's lives more than climate change but what we fail to recognize is that the vast majority of the impact that we are seeing right now - climate impacts and other impacts - are impacts that have been there for hundreds of years .
most of this world 's population is poor and they 're ill-prepared to deal with any contingency that the world throws at them .
what we need to focus on is not just adaption specifically for climate change , which is a small part of the problems most people live with right now , but simply making better lives for people that is focusing on getting them more food , getting them better healthcare and making sure their kids get educated . the world 's doctors have said failure to tackle climate change in copenhagen could be catastrophic for health .
is it possible to separate climate change from issues like health , food security or a safe water supply ? we do n't need to separate them in the sense that we probably all agree we should tackle some of the really big problems that are out there right now .
i 'm simply concerned that many people latch on to talking about global warming and that the most important this is spending money on adaptation to global warming . but the main problem in bangladesh or myanmar is not future sea-level rises , it 's the fact that the countries are so poor right now that they are already getting inundated .
it 's not about climate-proofing it in 100 years , it 's about dealing with the vulnerability to climate right now , which has nothing to do with climate change but simply something to do with them being very poor . it 's more about an emphasis on focusing where you can actually deal with real problems right now rather than a possible problem in 100 years . interview : irene quaile -lrb- sms -rrb- editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the migrants , meanwhile , are pleading with french authorities for shelter and protection . the operation began at dawn in the tent city , located on a patch of sandy scrubland in the channel port of calais .
with camera crews flooding the scene at " the jungle , " riot police detained 278 migrants in the raid , a top state official confirmed .
the migrants were then loaded into buses .
the french immigration ministry has said it will close the camp by the end of the week .
but it has also promised to find an " individual solution " for each migrant .
" there wo n't be any forced returns to unsafe conditions , " said immigration minister eric besson .
" whether a voluntary return home , an asylum request , or explusion , we will deal with each migrant on an individual basis . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the migrants say they have no where else to go last remaining migrants thousands of migrants from afghanistan , iraq , and other troubled parts of the world have made the voyage to calais over the last ten years .
of these , most have now ventured on to other places in europe - like britain , belgium , holland , and norway .
workers for the several aid groups in calais say those who remain in the ' jungle ' have no where else to go .
" those still here are mostly minors who can not be deported , or others who simply do n't have the money or connections to leave , " said vincent lenoir , of the salam migrant support group .
one of the migrants , bashir , a 24-year-old english teacher from northern afghanistan , paid $ 15,000 -lrb- 10,000 euros -rrb- to make the trip via pakistan and istanbul .
" we have no idea what the police will do , if they will take us or let us go free , but here we already made our place .
here we have our houses , our showers and our mosque , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : calais residents have been repulsed by the squalor of the jungle locals outraged by camp but government officials say the " jungle " has become a no-go zone for locals , and squalid conditions have been blamed for a recent outbreak of scabies .
city officials also support the police operation , saying the situation has become unbearable .
french authorities operated a center for migrants at sangatte , near calais , but closed it in 2002 because of crime and accusations from london that it was acting as a magnet for migrants headed for britain .
the french government says it is determined to stop illegal immigrants from entering the country , which it says is part of its stand against the practice of human trafficking .

on 22 september , 1934 , an explosion - possibly caused by a spark off a tool - ripped through gresford colliery .
an air raid siren sounded in the town at 1100 bst , while wrexham fc will play on tuesday in commemorative shirts and will release 266 black balloons .
albert rowlands , 89 , is thought to be the last survivor of the gas blast .
mr rowlands ' father , john , was killed in the explosion , along with many who were " doubling up " that friday to get time off to watch wrexham play tranmere rovers the following day . "
i was always hoping to see my dad ... but he never came back " albert rowlands , survivor he said : " us boys in the lamp room had to be there as soon as the men started arriving for work .
" we were cycling to work with my dad and he told us to get on or we 'd be late so we went on ahead .
" he picked up his lamp at the other window so i never saw him again .
" two others of his friends were with us and they were lost as well .
they 're all still down there . "
recalling the rescue attempt that followed , mr rowlands said : " i was always hoping to see my dad .
" you could always tell him even when they all looked alike , covered in coal dust , because he always had a big grin and lovely white teeth .
" but he never came back and his tally was left there hanging on its hook . "
the likely cause was an explosion caused by a build-up of gas , chiefly methane .
it was ignited at about 0200 bst , possibly by a spark from a metal tool in the 2,263 ft -lrb- 690m -rrb- deep dennis shaft .
every man on the shift was killed apart from six miners who managed to escape .
by the next evening , three rescue workers had also been killed .
the blast left 166 widows , and 229 children without fathers .
in april 1937 , at wrexham petty sessions , 42 charges were laid against the colliery company , the manager and officials .
most were withdrawn or dismissed and the mine 's management were guilty of inadequate record-keeping .
on tuesday , an air raid siren at wrexham county borough museum sounded for two minutes at 1100 bst , to coincide with a memorial service at the gresford memorial .
councillor bob dutton , the council 's deputy leader , said : " the gresford disaster is something that communities in wrexham will never forget and we believe this is a fitting tribute to those men who so tragically lost their lives on that fateful morning .
" i hope many will choose this time to reflect on not only those who lost their lives but the resulting hardship and difficulties faced by those dependents left behind . "
wrexham fc players will wear memorial shirts , and a minute 's silence will be held before their match with luton town .
the club will release a black balloon for each of the men who died and manager dean saunders will lay a wreath on the centre circle at the racecourse .
a programme about the disaster , gresford - the terrible price is on bbc 2 wales on wednesday , 30 september , at 1900 bst .

advertisement 1965 tonight package - gresford a series of events is being staged in wrexham to commemorate the 75th anniversary of a mining disaster which killed 266 men .
on 22 september , 1934 , an explosion - possibly caused by a spark off a tool - ripped through gresford colliery .
an air raid siren sounded in the town at 1100 bst , while wrexham fc will play on tuesday in commemorative shirts and will release 266 black balloons .
albert rowlands , 89 , is thought to be the last survivor of the gas blast .
mr rowlands ' father , john , was killed in the explosion , along with many who were " doubling up " that friday to get time off to watch wrexham play tranmere rovers the following day .
i was always hoping to see my dad ... but he never came back albert rowlands , survivor he said : " us boys in the lamp room had to be there as soon as the men started arriving for work .
" we were cycling to work with my dad and he told us to get on or we 'd be late so we went on ahead .
" he picked up his lamp at the other window so i never saw him again .
" two others of his friends were with us and they were lost as well .
they 're all still down there . "
recalling the rescue attempt that followed , mr rowlands said : " i was always hoping to see my dad .
albert rowlands has not been down a mine since the disaster " you could always tell him even when they all looked alike , covered in coal dust , because he always had a big grin and lovely white teeth .
" but he never came back and his tally was left there hanging on its hook . "
the likely cause was an explosion caused by a build-up of gas , chiefly methane .
it was ignited at about 0200 bst , possibly by a spark from a metal tool in the 2,263 ft -lrb- 690m -rrb- deep dennis shaft .
every man on the shift was killed apart from six miners who managed to escape .
by the next evening , three rescue workers had also been killed .
the blast left 166 widows , and 229 children without fathers .
in april 1937 , at wrexham petty sessions , 42 charges were laid against the colliery company , the manager and officials .
crowds gathered to hear news of loved ones after the blast most were withdrawn or dismissed and the mine 's management were guilty of inadequate record-keeping .
on tuesday , an air raid siren at wrexham county borough museum sounded for two minutes at 1100 bst , to coincide with a memorial service at the gresford memorial .
councillor bob dutton , the council 's deputy leader , said : " the gresford disaster is something that communities in wrexham will never forget and we believe this is a fitting tribute to those men who so tragically lost their lives on that fateful morning .
" i hope many will choose this time to reflect on not only those who lost their lives but the resulting hardship and difficulties faced by those dependents left behind . "
wrexham fc players will wear memorial shirts , and a minute 's silence will be held before their match with luton town .
the club will release a black balloon for each of the men who died and manager dean saunders will lay a wreath on the centre circle at the racecourse .
a programme about the disaster , gresford - the terrible price is on bbc 2 wales on wednesday , 30 september , at 1900 bst .

it was ignited at about 0200 bst , possibly by a spark from a metal tool in the 2,263 ft -lrb- 690m -rrb- deep dennis shaft .
every man on the shift was killed apart from six miners who managed to escape .
by the next evening , three rescue workers had also been killed .
the blast left 166 widows , and 229 children without fathers .
in april 1937 , at wrexham petty sessions , 42 charges were laid against the colliery company , the manager and officials .
crowds gathered to hear news of loved ones after the blast most were withdrawn or dismissed and the mine 's management were guilty of inadequate record-keeping .
on tuesday , an air raid siren at wrexham county borough museum sounded for two minutes at 1100 bst , to coincide with a memorial service at the gresford memorial .
councillor bob dutton , the council 's deputy leader , said : " the gresford disaster is something that communities in wrexham will never forget and we believe this is a fitting tribute to those men who so tragically lost their lives on that fateful morning .
" i hope many will choose this time to reflect on not only those who lost their lives but the resulting hardship and difficulties faced by those dependents left behind . "
wrexham fc players will wear memorial shirts , and a minute 's silence will be held before their match with luton town .
the club will release a black balloon for each of the men who died and manager dean saunders will lay a wreath on the centre circle at the racecourse .
a programme about the disaster , gresford - the terrible price is on bbc 2 wales on wednesday , 30 september , at 1900 bst .

mike smyth , of the university of ulster criticised local policy-makers in the first trust bank economic outlook .
mr smyth said the ni executive should follow the example of their scottish counterparts .
he said they should " start the ball rolling " by initiating a review of the programme for government and budget .
" while in scotland , the executive produced a national recovery plan in august 2008 , which has since been revised as national and international economic conditions have altered , local policy-makers have been less proactive by comparison , " he said .
" the programme for government and budget remain largely unchanged since their publication in january 2008 with only some limited responses from individual departments . "
mr smyth said the latest evidence suggested the northern ireland economy has been less severely affected by the economic downturn than many other regions of the uk and the republic .
however , he said " the likelihood of future national spending cuts post-general election means the executive will finally have to make some difficult decisions about public services , as well as about ni 's investment strategy and wider public sector employment . "
he said there were some signs that consumer and business confidence were now less weak in northern ireland .
consumer confidence , particularly as shown by the housing market may be " on the turn " and the service sector has steadied with recovery likely to get under way in the second half of 2009 , mr smyth added .
among the key points of the economic outlook were : there is good chance of a return to positive economic growth in 2010 - albeit of a modest 0.5 % in terms of gdp .
consumer confidence remains feeble and the outlook for spending remains subdued .
however , consumer confidence as evidenced in the housing market may be on the turn as house prices appear to have bottomed out .
public expenditure cuts after a general election look increasingly inevitable .
sustained cross-border shopping continues to head off even more serious decline in consumer demand .
unemployment , which reached 51,000 or 5.9 % in july 2009 , is likely to rise to over 60,000 in 2010 .
however , it should be remembered that during the last recession in the early 1980s unemployment peaked at 125,000 .

" while in scotland , the executive produced a national recovery plan in august 2008 , which has since been revised as national and international economic conditions have altered , local policy-makers have been less proactive by comparison , " he said .
" the programme for government and budget remain largely unchanged since their publication in january 2008 with only some limited responses from individual departments . "
mr smyth said the latest evidence suggested the northern ireland economy has been less severely affected by the economic downturn than many other regions of the uk and the republic .
however , he said " the likelihood of future national spending cuts post-general election means the executive will finally have to make some difficult decisions about public services , as well as about ni 's investment strategy and wider public sector employment . "
he said there were some signs that consumer and business confidence were now less weak in northern ireland .
consumer confidence , particularly as shown by the housing market may be " on the turn " and the service sector has steadied with recovery likely to get under way in the second half of 2009 , mr smyth added .
among the key points of the economic outlook were : there is good chance of a return to positive economic growth in 2010 - albeit of a modest 0.5 % in terms of gdp .
consumer confidence remains feeble and the outlook for spending remains subdued .
however , consumer confidence as evidenced in the housing market may be on the turn as house prices appear to have bottomed out .
public expenditure cuts after a general election look increasingly inevitable .
sustained cross-border shopping continues to head off even more serious decline in consumer demand .
unemployment , which reached 51,000 or 5.9 % in july 2009 , is likely to rise to over 60,000 in 2010 .
however , it should be remembered that during the last recession in the early 1980s unemployment peaked at 125,000 .
