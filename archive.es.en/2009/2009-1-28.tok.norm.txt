deutsche welle 's michael knigge caught up with him at the conference . dw-world.de : what do you expect from this world economic forum ? michael dell : we have all come here with great interest to hear what the central bankers have to say , what other world leaders have to say about the financial situation and how the major economies of the world navigate out of the current crisis . do you feel that this year ’ s world economic forum is special in a way from all the other economic forums ? i think i had that question every time i came so yes , everyone is special . let ’ s talk about the global economic crisis .
how does it affect your business and how do you see it go forward ? dell is a company with an exceptionally strong balance sheet and so it gives us an opportunity to use that really as a weapon to consolidate the industry and grow by acquisitions .
so we are acquiring a few companies , but also make sure that we retain that strength that we have and that we continue to serve our customers really really well during this challenging time . coming from europe , how does europe fare right now compared to other regions of the world like the u.s. or asia ? i ’ d say europe has held up pretty well , comparatively speaking .
some of the new europe hasn ’ t held up quite as well as the old europe , if i can say that .
but i ’ d say it has held up pretty well . i have to ask you a question about president obama , who has been in office now for less than two weeks .
he took some pretty big steps right from the start .
how do you rate him so far in his first days with the new administration ? i think it provides a lot of encouragement and hope to americans and maybe around the world .
it ’ s a bit early to give a lot of ratings . what do you expect from his economic team which has been called a dream team ?
tim geithner has now also been confirmed . i know larry summers .
i think they are talented individuals , a good team . america ’ s image in the world has suffered so much in the last years and the expectations for obama are really high .
do you think america ’ s image can go up again with new administration ? well , it seems like it would be fairly easy to improve .
i think brand america has already improved based on the obama election .
now the administration and the country have to deliver . if you could have one wish for obama , one thing you would really like him to do , what would that be ? well , i see him next week and i ’ ll tell him . michael knigge interviewed michael dell -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" without a credible financial package , it 's clear that there will be no deal in copenhagen : no money , no deal , " eu environment commissioner stavros dimas told journalists in brussels . green groups : proposals do n't go far enough but environmentalist groups criticized the proposals as too vague and under-funded , with greenpeace accusing the commission of backing down on a call for rich countries to offer poorer ones at least 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 40 billion -rrb- a year in climate aid by 2020 . the lack of specific funding targets shows that the eu is " unable to put its euros where its mouth is , " greenpeace said in a statement , while fellow-green group wwf said that the question of specific sums of funding would be the " make or break issue " in copenhagen . in 2005 , the eu set up a system capping the amount of greenhouse gases the bloc 's heavy industries could emit and allowing firms which reduced their emissions to sell the surplus emissions permits - the world 's first greenhouse gas emissions trading system -lrb- ets -rrb- . the commission proposal calls on all 30 oecd members - countries such as the united states , japan and south korea - to set up a similar ets by 2013 , and to allow permits to be traded between them by 2015 . rich states should help finance poorer ones major developing economies , meanwhile , should draw up national plans to tackle global warming before the copenhagen talks , and have their own ets ready to link into the oecd one by 2020 , the report says . that is becoming an " increasingly realistic " goal , as australia is currently setting up an ets , with new zealand and the us expected to follow suit , dimas said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's new tack on climate change has sparked relief in the eu the report by the european commission came just a day after new us president barack obama named todd stern as the country 's first-ever climate change envoy , confirming his plans to reverse the skeptical approach to the issue displayed by former president george w. bush . clean energy research the commission also proposed a number of measures aimed at enticing the world 's major economies , both developed and developing , into a binding global deal on fighting climate change at talks in copenhagen . they include calling on developed economies to pledge to cut their emissions to an average of 30 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 , and agree to a formula for setting binding country-specific targets based on each one 's current emissions , energy efficiency and population . the eu has already vowed to cut emissions to 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 , and to go to 30 percent if other developed economies accept a comparable cut . the eu 's proposals also call on rich states to set up a legally binding system for paying developing countries to fight climate change , either by agreeing rules and targets for bilateral aid or by sharing some of the revenue from the sale of emissions permits . it calls on countries to double investment in clean-energy research by 2013 and quadruple it by 2020 , and to raise spending on climate-change issues by 175 billion euros -lrb- $ 230 billion -rrb- a year by 2020 . in return , developing powers should curb their emissions growth so that they release between 15 and 30 percent less greenhouse gas in 2020 than they would do if they pursued their current policies . blueprint faces tough hurdles the commission also called for the tightening of a system which allows rich countries to gain credit for sponsoring emissions-reduction projects in poorer ones , making it harder to claim such credits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rich nations will no sponsor emissions-reduction projects in countries such as india , if the eu gets its way such projects would be limited to the poorest countries , cutting out rising powers such as china , india and brazil . eu officials say that the wealthiest developing countries are already richer than the bloc 's poorest members , such as bulgaria and romania , making it only fair for them to pay for their emissions . but the eu report will have to pass two tough political tests if it is to have any chance of global acceptance . first , it will have to be approved by the eu 's 27 member states , who are currently reeling under the impact of the global financial crisis , and who have little appetite for expensive new initiatives . they then have to win approval from all major world powers in copenhagen - a negotiation which promises to be anything but simple . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the details are chilling . the german public television station first reported on the video , which is being attributed to islamic jihad union , a radical group active in afghanistan and pakistan .
in the video , which features details of dead children and injured people , six men threaten violence against germany .
" we have a few surprise packages prepared this year , " the men reportedly say .
" allies of the occupation powers must always reckon with our attacks . "
germany currently has 3,600 troops in afghanistan as part of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in that country .
the video also made reference to the latest conflict between israelis and palestinians and to german chancellor angela merkel .
" for 10 days the world has watched as muslims in the gaza strip have been massacred , " the men in the video reportedly say .
" where is the us ?
where is mrs. merkel and her cabinet ? "
germany federal criminal investigations office confirmed to dpa news agency that it was studying a terror video .

the announcement came after isaf said it had killed " a high-ranking rebel leader " late last week .
since the fall of the taliban in 2001 , the german army , the bundeswehr , has mostly been involved in peacekeeping and reconstruction activities in the relatively non-violent north of the country .

it was , to say the least , an impressive start to 2009 for the men in red . stuttgart came into the match feeling as though they had a legitimate chance for an upset since they were playing at home and had managed to split the points with bayern in the last league match before the winter break .
how wrong they were .
bayern pounced on their opponents right from the outset .
midfielder bastian schweinsteiger staked the visitors to the lead in the 14th minute with a well-placed shot past stuttgart keeper jens lehmann .
two minutes later it was 2-nil , with playmaker frank ribery creating havoc in stuttgart 's box and slotting home from close range .
bayern were awarded a penalty in minute 21 after a foul by luckless stuttgart defender arthur boka .
but ribery chipped the penalty straight into the arms of a waiting lehmann , who had anticipated the frenchman 's attempted trick .
no matter .
shortly before the break , bayern striker luca toni found the net from ten meters out to essentially put the game beyond reach .
any hopes fans might have had for a stuttgart fight-back in the second half were quickly dashed as bastian schweinsteiger scored a penalty in the 55th minute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hosts utterly failed to measure up to munich ze roberto struck four minutes later to end the scoring for bayern , while stuttgart 's mario gomez picked up a late consolation goal that hardly deserved the appellation .
indeed , if the match is any indication of the form and sense of purpose with which bayern intend to begin the second half of the league season , bundesliga rivals have every reason to be afraid .
very afraid .

27 , as the eu prepared to unveil its own environmental action plan . " europe has gained a strong partner , " said czech environment minister martin bursik , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
" barack obama is quickly implementing what he has promised .
he acts efficiently , " he added .
" to protect our climate and our collective security , we must call together a truly global coalition , " president obama said at a white house ceremony , in an apparent swipe at former president george w. bush 's reluctance to take control of international efforts to combat climate change .
" we will make it clear to the world that america is ready to lead . "
he also vowed his policies would be dictated by the " sound science " behind climate change , rather than " rigid ideology . "
obama has signaled a sharp departure from climate change politics-as-usual in the united states , but this is only the beginning .
the obama administration on monday took some initial steps towards reversing the policies of former president george w. bush , drawing widespread praise from us environmental groups who had felt sidelined for much of the last eight years under bush .
obama named todd stern as the country 's first-ever climate-change envoy to lead international negotiations .
he also signed executive orders allowing us states like california to enact tougher vehicle emissions rules - the first step towards reversing a bush administration block on such state action .
but obama 's actions mark only the first steps in a long and complicated process , both in the united states and abroad , which environmental groups say will require an ongoing commitment from the new administration in order to make a serious dent in us and global climate policy .
bold steps must be sustained , say environmentalists obama 's first moves have been " bolder " than even many environmentalists expected , reid detchon , head of the energy future coalition , said in an interview .
but " this is going to require a sustained effort , and more importantly political leadership " from the president himself , detchon said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stern will the point man on climate for the us stern will become the country 's chief negotiator in international climate talks that have already entered the final phase .
governments have resolved to agree on a comprehensive climate treaty that would impose tough new restrictions on greenhouse-gas emissions by the end of this year .
stern led the us delegation to the kyoto protocol talks in 1997 , which resulted in the world 's first climate treaty .
that experience will allow obama 's administration to get up and running immediately , shaving as much as four to six months off the transition process had obama chosen a less veteran negotiator , said detchon .
but while former president bill clinton signed the kyoto protocol , widespread opposition among lawmakers meant it was never ratified by the us senate .
the talks on a successor to kyoto also remain in the balance .
us opposition to the kyoto treaty rested on its failure to include emerging countries in its emissions targets .
developing countries have said that advanced economies , which industrialized earlier , bear greater responsibility for the earth 's warming to this point and should pay a heavier price .
many of the current sticking points on replacing kyoto , which expires in 2012 , revolve around the same issue .
obama ready to engage polluters in finding solution obama has not backed away from calling on developing countries , such as china and india , to share more of the burden in reducing emissions .
but he hopes to set an example for those countries by enacting sweeping new restrictions on polluting industries at home in the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama signed on to help fight climate change obama pledged during the presidential campaign to push for a cap- and-trade plan through congress that would effectively put a price on industries ' carbon emissions blamed for global warming .
supporters express hope that such legislation could be approved by december , when government delegates from around the world meet in copenhagen to thrash out a global climate deal .
but that could be a tough sell with the us facing a serious recession and us carmakers - who will bear the brunt of tougher fuel-efficiency standards - threatened with bankruptcy .
the eu looks set to pile more pressure on the us and other large polluters to sign up to an ambitious strategy to reduce greenhouse gases when ministers meet later this week .
the united states is the biggest polluter with 5.8 billion tons , followed by china with 5.1 billion tons of co2 per year .
with four billion tons of co2 a year , the eu generates 14 percent of the 27 billion tons that escape into the atmosphere each year .
last month european leaders approved a climate change action plan that the 27-nation bloc hopes will become a model for international negotiations in copenhagen in december .
eu ready to put its money where its mouth is bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commission president barroso will lead the eu 's fight the european commission will on wednesday unveil a strategy for gradually ramping up investments aimed at tackling climate change to a target of 175 billion euros -lrb- $ 231 billion -rrb- per year by 2020 .
the overall eu goal is to prevent a global temperature increase of more than two degrees centigrade over pre-industrial levels .
to do so it will encourage developed nations to commit to cut their emissions by 30 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 .
the target for developing nations should be set at 15-30 percent , according to the eu 's executive arm , with " significantly increased financial resources " required , including help from richer nations .
among the sources of finance , the commission recommends making polluters pay for each ton of carbon dioxide that they emit , according to draft proposals .
eu leaders committed last month to a climate-energy package that would decrease the bloc 's greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 , make 20 percent energy savings and bring renewable energy sources up to 20 percent of total energy use . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

27 , as the eu prepared to unveil its own environmental action plan . " europe has gained a strong partner , " said czech environment minister martin bursik , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
" barack obama is quickly implementing what he has promised .
he acts efficiently , " he added .
" to protect our climate and our collective security , we must call together a truly global coalition , " president obama said at a white house ceremony , in an apparent swipe at former president george w. bush 's reluctance to take control of international efforts to combat climate change .
" we will make it clear to the world that america is ready to lead . "
he also vowed his policies would be dictated by the " sound science " behind climate change , rather than " rigid ideology . "
obama has signaled a sharp departure from climate change politics-as-usual in the united states , but this is only the beginning .
the obama administration on monday took some initial steps towards reversing the policies of former president george w. bush , drawing widespread praise from us environmental groups who had felt sidelined for much of the last eight years under bush .
obama named todd stern as the country 's first-ever climate-change envoy to lead international negotiations .
he also signed executive orders allowing us states like california to enact tougher vehicle emissions rules - the first step towards reversing a bush administration block on such state action .
but obama 's actions mark only the first steps in a long and complicated process , both in the united states and abroad , which environmental groups say will require an ongoing commitment from the new administration in order to make a serious dent in us and global climate policy .
bold steps must be sustained , say environmentalists obama 's first moves have been " bolder " than even many environmentalists expected , reid detchon , head of the energy future coalition , said in an interview .
but " this is going to require a sustained effort , and more importantly political leadership " from the president himself , detchon said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stern will the point man on climate for the us stern will become the country 's chief negotiator in international climate talks that have already entered the final phase .
governments have resolved to agree on a comprehensive climate treaty that would impose tough new restrictions on greenhouse-gas emissions by the end of this year .
stern led the us delegation to the kyoto protocol talks in 1997 , which resulted in the world 's first climate treaty .
that experience will allow obama 's administration to get up and running immediately , shaving as much as four to six months off the transition process had obama chosen a less veteran negotiator , said detchon .
but while former president bill clinton signed the kyoto protocol , widespread opposition among lawmakers meant it was never ratified by the us senate .
the talks on a successor to kyoto also remain in the balance .
us opposition to the kyoto treaty rested on its failure to include emerging countries in its emissions targets .
developing countries have said that advanced economies , which industrialized earlier , bear greater responsibility for the earth 's warming to this point and should pay a heavier price .
many of the current sticking points on replacing kyoto , which expires in 2012 , revolve around the same issue .
obama ready to engage polluters in finding solution obama has not backed away from calling on developing countries , such as china and india , to share more of the burden in reducing emissions .
but he hopes to set an example for those countries by enacting sweeping new restrictions on polluting industries at home in the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama signed on to help fight climate change obama pledged during the presidential campaign to push for a cap- and-trade plan through congress that would effectively put a price on industries ' carbon emissions blamed for global warming .
supporters express hope that such legislation could be approved by december , when government delegates from around the world meet in copenhagen to thrash out a global climate deal .
but that could be a tough sell with the us facing a serious recession and us carmakers - who will bear the brunt of tougher fuel-efficiency standards - threatened with bankruptcy .
the eu looks set to pile more pressure on the us and other large polluters to sign up to an ambitious strategy to reduce greenhouse gases when ministers meet later this week .
the united states is the biggest polluter with 5.8 billion tons , followed by china with 5.1 billion tons of co2 per year .
with four billion tons of co2 a year , the eu generates 14 percent of the 27 billion tons that escape into the atmosphere each year .
last month european leaders approved a climate change action plan that the 27-nation bloc hopes will become a model for international negotiations in copenhagen in december .
eu ready to put its money where its mouth is bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commission president barroso will lead the eu 's fight the european commission will on wednesday unveil a strategy for gradually ramping up investments aimed at tackling climate change to a target of 175 billion euros -lrb- $ 231 billion -rrb- per year by 2020 .
the overall eu goal is to prevent a global temperature increase of more than two degrees centigrade over pre-industrial levels .
to do so it will encourage developed nations to commit to cut their emissions by 30 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 .
the target for developing nations should be set at 15-30 percent , according to the eu 's executive arm , with " significantly increased financial resources " required , including help from richer nations .
among the sources of finance , the commission recommends making polluters pay for each ton of carbon dioxide that they emit , according to draft proposals .
eu leaders committed last month to a climate-energy package that would decrease the bloc 's greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 , make 20 percent energy savings and bring renewable energy sources up to 20 percent of total energy use . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

28 . wealthy nations will experience their worst recession in the post-war period as a financial crisis continues to spread throughout their economies , the international monetary fund said as it slashed its global economic forecasts .
a contraction of two percent is expected in 2009 , even with massive fiscal stimulus packages planned by all rich countries . a recovery to 1.1 percent is possible in 2010 , the imf said , but only with drastic government intervention to help revive demand and stabilize financial institutions at the heart of the downturn . germany to contract 2.5 percent the united states will contract by 1.6 percent and germany - europe 's largest economy - by 2.5 per cent in 2009 .
japan , asia 's biggest economy , will contract 2.6 percent , the imf predicted . growth in emerging and developing countries will also slow dramatically in 2009 to 3.3 percent from 6.3 percent in 2008 . china 's economy will slow to 6.7 percent in 2009 from nine percent , india 's will drop to 5.1 percent and brazil 's growth will plummet a whopping four percentage points to 1.8 percent in 2009 . the imf 's predictions represented another sharp revision from its last forecast in november , a fact attributed to dramatic collapses in consumer and business confidence , plummeting global trade and demand , frozen credit markets and even greater losses for financial institutions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international monetary fund 's chief economist olivier blanchard " we expect the global economy to come to a virtual standstill in 2009 , " olivier blanchard , the imf 's chief economist , told reporters . in its november update , the imf had forecast 2.2 percent global growth for 2009 , a contraction of 0.3 percent in advanced economies and 5.1 percent growth in developing countries .
world growth below three percent is considered a global recession . global trade volumes are also expected to collapse in 2009 , contracting 2.8 percent after growth of 4.1 percent the year before .
in november , the imf still predicted a 2.1 percent increase in trade for this year . deflation becoming a serious risk at the same time , the imf warned that deflation was now becoming a serious risk for some wealthy nations .
consumer prices were expected to rise by only 0.3 percent in industrial nations in 2009 and 0.8 percent in 2010 . the global downturn continues to be driven by the debilitating financial crisis which began with a collapse in the us housing market but has since spread to all corners of the globe . financial firms are now projected to lose a total of $ 2.2 trillion before the crisis is over - about $ 500 billion more than banks currently have in their reserves - and will require more government aid . the imf also expects the world 's 20 largest economies to spend at least 1.5 percent of their gross domestic product on massive fiscal stimulus packages .
the us is currently mulling an $ 825 billion package worth some five percent of gdp . such government spending is crucial to reviving consumer demand , but would only provide a relatively short-term boost to economies : stabilizing the financial system is the key in the long run . " restoring financial health is a necessary condition for durable economic recovery , " blanchard said , adding that governments needed to take more " aggressive " measures to stem the collapse of financial firms . prescription for recovery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : banks have cut back on lending , stalling economies banks ' need for cash has stopped them from lending to each other and to consumers .
developing countries have seen foreign investments in their economies dry up as a result . governments , especially the us , must inject more capital into banks to keep them afloat , but should also take the damaged mortgage-related assets off their balance sheets in order to promote a long-term recovery , the imf said . the price of commodities like oil , food and metals has also plummeted in the last few months due to falling demand , putting even more pressure on some poorer countries dependent on their exports of natural resources . dpa news agency -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

28 . wealthy nations will experience their worst recession in the post-war period as a financial crisis continues to spread throughout their economies , the international monetary fund said as it slashed its global economic forecasts .
a contraction of two percent is expected in 2009 , even with massive fiscal stimulus packages planned by all rich countries . a recovery to 1.1 percent is possible in 2010 , the imf said , but only with drastic government intervention to help revive demand and stabilize financial institutions at the heart of the downturn . germany to contract 2.5 percent the united states will contract by 1.6 percent and germany - europe 's largest economy - by 2.5 per cent in 2009 .
japan , asia 's biggest economy , will contract 2.6 percent , the imf predicted . growth in emerging and developing countries will also slow dramatically in 2009 to 3.3 percent from 6.3 percent in 2008 . china 's economy will slow to 6.7 percent in 2009 from nine percent , india 's will drop to 5.1 percent and brazil 's growth will plummet a whopping four percentage points to 1.8 percent in 2009 . the imf 's predictions represented another sharp revision from its last forecast in november , a fact attributed to dramatic collapses in consumer and business confidence , plummeting global trade and demand , frozen credit markets and even greater losses for financial institutions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international monetary fund 's chief economist olivier blanchard " we expect the global economy to come to a virtual standstill in 2009 , " olivier blanchard , the imf 's chief economist , told reporters . in its november update , the imf had forecast 2.2 percent global growth for 2009 , a contraction of 0.3 percent in advanced economies and 5.1 percent growth in developing countries .
world growth below three percent is considered a global recession . global trade volumes are also expected to collapse in 2009 , contracting 2.8 percent after growth of 4.1 percent the year before .
in november , the imf still predicted a 2.1 percent increase in trade for this year . deflation becoming a serious risk at the same time , the imf warned that deflation was now becoming a serious risk for some wealthy nations .
consumer prices were expected to rise by only 0.3 percent in industrial nations in 2009 and 0.8 percent in 2010 . the global downturn continues to be driven by the debilitating financial crisis which began with a collapse in the us housing market but has since spread to all corners of the globe . financial firms are now projected to lose a total of $ 2.2 trillion before the crisis is over - about $ 500 billion more than banks currently have in their reserves - and will require more government aid . the imf also expects the world 's 20 largest economies to spend at least 1.5 percent of their gross domestic product on massive fiscal stimulus packages .
the us is currently mulling an $ 825 billion package worth some five percent of gdp . such government spending is crucial to reviving consumer demand , but would only provide a relatively short-term boost to economies : stabilizing the financial system is the key in the long run . " restoring financial health is a necessary condition for durable economic recovery , " blanchard said , adding that governments needed to take more " aggressive " measures to stem the collapse of financial firms . prescription for recovery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : banks have cut back on lending , stalling economies banks ' need for cash has stopped them from lending to each other and to consumers .
developing countries have seen foreign investments in their economies dry up as a result . governments , especially the us , must inject more capital into banks to keep them afloat , but should also take the damaged mortgage-related assets off their balance sheets in order to promote a long-term recovery , the imf said . the price of commodities like oil , food and metals has also plummeted in the last few months due to falling demand , putting even more pressure on some poorer countries dependent on their exports of natural resources . dpa news agency -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche welle 's michael knigge caught up with him at the conference . dw-world.de : what do you expect from this world economic forum ? michael dell : we have all come here with great interest to hear what the central bankers have to say , what other world leaders have to say about the financial situation and how the major economies of the world navigate out of the current crisis . do you feel that this year ’ s world economic forum is special in a way from all the other economic forums ? i think i had that question every time i came so yes , everyone is special . let ’ s talk about the global economic crisis .
how does it affect your business and how do you see it go forward ? dell is a company with an exceptionally strong balance sheet and so it gives us an opportunity to use that really as a weapon to consolidate the industry and grow by acquisitions .
so we are acquiring a few companies , but also make sure that we retain that strength that we have and that we continue to serve our customers really really well during this challenging time . coming from europe , how does europe fare right now compared to other regions of the world like the u.s. or asia ? i ’ d say europe has held up pretty well , comparatively speaking .
some of the new europe hasn ’ t held up quite as well as the old europe , if i can say that .
but i ’ d say it has held up pretty well . i have to ask you a question about president obama , who has been in office now for less than two weeks .
he took some pretty big steps right from the start .
how do you rate him so far in his first days with the new administration ? i think it provides a lot of encouragement and hope to americans and maybe around the world .
it ’ s a bit early to give a lot of ratings . what do you expect from his economic team which has been called a dream team ?
tim geithner has now also been confirmed . i know larry summers .
i think they are talented individuals , a good team . america ’ s image in the world has suffered so much in the last years and the expectations for obama are really high .
do you think america ’ s image can go up again with new administration ? well , it seems like it would be fairly easy to improve .
i think brand america has already improved based on the obama election .
now the administration and the country have to deliver . if you could have one wish for obama , one thing you would really like him to do , what would that be ? well , i see him next week and i ’ ll tell him . michael knigge interviewed michael dell -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a former veteran democratic lawmaker and past chairman of the senate foreign relations committee , biden will represent obama 's foreign policy on the world stage for the first time since the president 's historic inauguration last week .
this year 's munich security conference is expected to focus on the future of nato , european security organizations and non-proliferation .
but news agency ap reported that biden is widely expected to use the meeting to push america 's european allies to expand their role in afghanistan .
" afghanistan is us ' biggest military challenge " biden 's visit comes as the new us administration signals that it wants to break with the bush era and reverse many of the foreign policies of the previous administration .

earlier this week , obama discussed afghanistan by phone on monday with french president nicolas sarkozy , german chancellor angela merkel and russian president dmitry medvedev .
on tuesday , us defense minister robert gates described afghanistan as america 's greatest military challenge and warned the war could be lost if the west failed to address the problem of civilian casualties .
" there is little doubt that our greatest military challenge right now is afghanistan , " gates said .
" president -lrb- barack -rrb- obama has made it clear that the afghanistan theater should be our top overseas military priority . "

28 , that global warming might be more devastating than previously thought and stressed that any market system to slash emissions and make them more costly must include developing nations in the long run . the statements are part of a report drawn up by the commission which it hopes will replace the kyoto protocol to fight climate change which expires in 2012 . powers such as china and india , which are not members of the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , should join such a system no later than 2020 , the report says . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dimas has called for rich nations to help poorer ones tackle climate change the wealthy world should also offer developing countries substantial funding to help them cut their emissions , so that the world can reach a deal on fighting climate change at a conference in copenhagen in december , the european commission said as it set out its negotiating platform for the copenhagen talks . " without a credible financial package , it 's clear that there will be no deal in copenhagen : no money , no deal , " eu environment commissioner stavros dimas told journalists in brussels . green groups : proposals do n't go far enough but environmentalist groups criticized the proposals as too vague and under-funded , with greenpeace accusing the commission of backing down on a call for rich countries to offer poorer ones at least 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 40 billion -rrb- a year in climate aid by 2020 . the lack of specific funding targets shows that the eu is " unable to put its euros where its mouth is , " greenpeace said in a statement , while fellow-green group wwf said that the question of specific sums of funding would be the " make or break issue " in copenhagen . in 2005 , the eu set up a system capping the amount of greenhouse gases the bloc 's heavy industries could emit and allowing firms which reduced their emissions to sell the surplus emissions permits - the world 's first greenhouse gas emissions trading system -lrb- ets -rrb- . the commission proposal calls on all 30 oecd members - countries such as the united states , japan and south korea - to set up a similar ets by 2013 , and to allow permits to be traded between them by 2015 . rich states should help finance poorer ones major developing economies , meanwhile , should draw up national plans to tackle global warming before the copenhagen talks , and have their own ets ready to link into the oecd one by 2020 , the report says . that is becoming an " increasingly realistic " goal , as australia is currently setting up an ets , with new zealand and the us expected to follow suit , dimas said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's new tack on climate change has sparked relief in the eu the report by the european commission came just a day after new us president barack obama named todd stern as the country 's first-ever climate change envoy , confirming his plans to reverse the skeptical approach to the issue displayed by former president george w. bush . clean energy research the commission also proposed a number of measures aimed at enticing the world 's major economies , both developed and developing , into a binding global deal on fighting climate change at talks in copenhagen . they include calling on developed economies to pledge to cut their emissions to an average of 30 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 , and agree to a formula for setting binding country-specific targets based on each one 's current emissions , energy efficiency and population . the eu has already vowed to cut emissions to 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 , and to go to 30 percent if other developed economies accept a comparable cut . the eu 's proposals also call on rich states to set up a legally binding system for paying developing countries to fight climate change , either by agreeing rules and targets for bilateral aid or by sharing some of the revenue from the sale of emissions permits . it calls on countries to double investment in clean-energy research by 2013 and quadruple it by 2020 , and to raise spending on climate-change issues by 175 billion euros -lrb- $ 230 billion -rrb- a year by 2020 . in return , developing powers should curb their emissions growth so that they release between 15 and 30 percent less greenhouse gas in 2020 than they would do if they pursued their current policies . blueprint faces tough hurdles the commission also called for the tightening of a system which allows rich countries to gain credit for sponsoring emissions-reduction projects in poorer ones , making it harder to claim such credits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rich nations will no sponsor emissions-reduction projects in countries such as india , if the eu gets its way such projects would be limited to the poorest countries , cutting out rising powers such as china , india and brazil . eu officials say that the wealthiest developing countries are already richer than the bloc 's poorest members , such as bulgaria and romania , making it only fair for them to pay for their emissions . but the eu report will have to pass two tough political tests if it is to have any chance of global acceptance . first , it will have to be approved by the eu 's 27 member states , who are currently reeling under the impact of the global financial crisis , and who have little appetite for expensive new initiatives . they then have to win approval from all major world powers in copenhagen - a negotiation which promises to be anything but simple . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

28 , commemorating the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall on november 9 , 1989 . at a gathering at berlin 's landmark potsdamer platz , the city 's senate representative richard meng said 2009 is a " year of remembrance , " as well as a " year of respect for the people who contributed to the peaceful fall of the wall . " throughout the year , exhibitions , talks and guided walks will remind people of the huge changes berlin has undergone . the highlight of the year will be a weekend of celebrations and a huge series of domino stones , set to topple on november 9 , symbolically marking the sequence of events that brought an end to communism . " in berlin , germany grew together more than anywhere else , " meng said , adding that it 's time to " show and describe the change which has occurred everywhere in berlin . " from thursday , a red information booth at potsdamer platz highlights the city 's transformation since 1989 . the booth has a flight of stairs , granting a panoramic view of the square which was redeveloped in glass and steel with the aim of helping it regain the central role it played before the city was divided . travelling display traces history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wall divided berlin from 1961 to 1989 an interactive display , replicated in a mobile box travelling the city , reveals pictures of berlin 's changing face over the course of the last 20 years . as the infobox visits 15 historically significant locations across berlin , a large helium-filled arrow will float above it , pointing to the sites from a height of 100 meters . these booths are needed , city officials said , in part because very little is left of the original berlin wall .
tourists and locals alike are baffled by the fact that it 's now difficult to see the former division between east and west . berlin 's mayor , klaus wowereit , said there was an urge to remove all traces of the city 's division after 1989 .
" we were in a euphoric mood , " he told berlin 's rbb inforadio on wednesday . " nobody wanted to bear this wall any longer , this wall of disgrace that divided the city , that brought so much distress to the city , to the families , to the individuals affected . " despite the posters , maps and interactive displays , it 's difficult to transmit " the horror of the wall , this system of terror with its mines , its dogs and the orders to shoot , " the mayor said . wowereit added that , in retrospect , maybe the wall was removed too hastily .
" maybe more should have been left standing as an example , " he said . dpa news agency -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

28 , commemorating the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall on november 9 , 1989 . at a gathering at berlin 's landmark potsdamer platz , the city 's senate representative richard meng said 2009 is a " year of remembrance , " as well as a " year of respect for the people who contributed to the peaceful fall of the wall . " throughout the year , exhibitions , talks and guided walks will remind people of the huge changes berlin has undergone . the highlight of the year will be a weekend of celebrations and a huge series of domino stones , set to topple on november 9 , symbolically marking the sequence of events that brought an end to communism . " in berlin , germany grew together more than anywhere else , " meng said , adding that it 's time to " show and describe the change which has occurred everywhere in berlin . " from thursday , a red information booth at potsdamer platz highlights the city 's transformation since 1989 . the booth has a flight of stairs , granting a panoramic view of the square which was redeveloped in glass and steel with the aim of helping it regain the central role it played before the city was divided . travelling display traces history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wall divided berlin from 1961 to 1989 an interactive display , replicated in a mobile box travelling the city , reveals pictures of berlin 's changing face over the course of the last 20 years . as the infobox visits 15 historically significant locations across berlin , a large helium-filled arrow will float above it , pointing to the sites from a height of 100 meters . these booths are needed , city officials said , in part because very little is left of the original berlin wall .
tourists and locals alike are baffled by the fact that it 's now difficult to see the former division between east and west . berlin 's mayor , klaus wowereit , said there was an urge to remove all traces of the city 's division after 1989 .
" we were in a euphoric mood , " he told berlin 's rbb inforadio on wednesday . " nobody wanted to bear this wall any longer , this wall of disgrace that divided the city , that brought so much distress to the city , to the families , to the individuals affected . " despite the posters , maps and interactive displays , it 's difficult to transmit " the horror of the wall , this system of terror with its mines , its dogs and the orders to shoot , " the mayor said . wowereit added that , in retrospect , maybe the wall was removed too hastily .
" maybe more should have been left standing as an example , " he said . dpa news agency -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in addition to being an anchor and political correspondent for dw-tv , brian is a guest lecturer in political science at the university of jena , where he gives classes and conducts research on post-9-11 press freedom in the united states .
prior to coming to berlin for the start up of dw-tv 's 24 hour international news programme , journal , brian thomas hosted and reported for the network 's political magazines produced in the european union 's capital , brussels , and in the former german capital , bonn .
among other assignments he 's worked as a news director for oregon public broadcasting and covered regional and local news in the us for various affiliates , including nbc .
brian has received a number of broadcasting awards , including special recognition for the associated press and a best foreign corresponding award from cnn .
" there is no question that my experience in these two important capitals gives me a well balanced and behind the scenes knowledge of events that we report on regularly in the journal .
i think that experience helps me , as an anchor , put the news coming out of the eu-capital and out of berlin in a perspective that makes sense for our international viewers " , thomas said .
" when you look at the news market in the us there 's no question that there 's a dearth of international news , and we provide a crucial source of world news for millions of americans .
along with the bbc and cnn , we 're the world 's biggest international television broadcaster .
and i think one of our many strengths , one i see everyday in the newsroom , is that we do not have the anglo-american predication that our two competitors have .
i think this is an immense asset , one many of our viewers tell us they appreciate .
we have more english language viewers in russia for example than cnn or bbc .
i think that says a lot . " said brian thomas when asked how he views dw-tv in comparison to the global competition .
brian has received a number of broadcasting awards , including special recognition from the associated press and best foreign corresponding award from cnn .
academically , he 's received degrees in english literature from loyola marymount university 's honour 's programme in los angeles , in telecommunications from north arizona university , and was awarded a fellowship by the university of california , irvine . < back send us an e-mail mail to brian thomas www-links www.netzzeitung.de www.bassler.com www.spiegel.de my favourite websites ! radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

28 , that global warming might be more devastating than previously thought and stressed that any market system to slash emissions and make them more costly must include developing nations in the long run . the statements are part of a report drawn up by the commission which it hopes will replace the kyoto protocol to fight climate change which expires in 2012 . powers such as china and india , which are not members of the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , should join such a system no later than 2020 , the report says . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dimas has called for rich nations to help poorer ones tackle climate change the wealthy world should also offer developing countries substantial funding to help them cut their emissions , so that the world can reach a deal on fighting climate change at a conference in copenhagen in december , the european commission said as it set out its negotiating platform for the copenhagen talks . " without a credible financial package , it 's clear that there will be no deal in copenhagen : no money , no deal , " eu environment commissioner stavros dimas told journalists in brussels . green groups : proposals do n't go far enough but environmentalist groups criticized the proposals as too vague and under-funded , with greenpeace accusing the commission of backing down on a call for rich countries to offer poorer ones at least 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 40 billion -rrb- a year in climate aid by 2020 . the lack of specific funding targets shows that the eu is " unable to put its euros where its mouth is , " greenpeace said in a statement , while fellow-green group wwf said that the question of specific sums of funding would be the " make or break issue " in copenhagen . in 2005 , the eu set up a system capping the amount of greenhouse gases the bloc 's heavy industries could emit and allowing firms which reduced their emissions to sell the surplus emissions permits - the world 's first greenhouse gas emissions trading system -lrb- ets -rrb- . the commission proposal calls on all 30 oecd members - countries such as the united states , japan and south korea - to set up a similar ets by 2013 , and to allow permits to be traded between them by 2015 . rich states should help finance poorer ones major developing economies , meanwhile , should draw up national plans to tackle global warming before the copenhagen talks , and have their own ets ready to link into the oecd one by 2020 , the report says . that is becoming an " increasingly realistic " goal , as australia is currently setting up an ets , with new zealand and the us expected to follow suit , dimas said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's new tack on climate change has sparked relief in the eu the report by the european commission came just a day after new us president barack obama named todd stern as the country 's first-ever climate change envoy , confirming his plans to reverse the skeptical approach to the issue displayed by former president george w. bush . clean energy research the commission also proposed a number of measures aimed at enticing the world 's major economies , both developed and developing , into a binding global deal on fighting climate change at talks in copenhagen . they include calling on developed economies to pledge to cut their emissions to an average of 30 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 , and agree to a formula for setting binding country-specific targets based on each one 's current emissions , energy efficiency and population . the eu has already vowed to cut emissions to 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 , and to go to 30 percent if other developed economies accept a comparable cut . the eu 's proposals also call on rich states to set up a legally binding system for paying developing countries to fight climate change , either by agreeing rules and targets for bilateral aid or by sharing some of the revenue from the sale of emissions permits . it calls on countries to double investment in clean-energy research by 2013 and quadruple it by 2020 , and to raise spending on climate-change issues by 175 billion euros -lrb- $ 230 billion -rrb- a year by 2020 . in return , developing powers should curb their emissions growth so that they release between 15 and 30 percent less greenhouse gas in 2020 than they would do if they pursued their current policies . blueprint faces tough hurdles the commission also called for the tightening of a system which allows rich countries to gain credit for sponsoring emissions-reduction projects in poorer ones , making it harder to claim such credits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rich nations will no sponsor emissions-reduction projects in countries such as india , if the eu gets its way such projects would be limited to the poorest countries , cutting out rising powers such as china , india and brazil . eu officials say that the wealthiest developing countries are already richer than the bloc 's poorest members , such as bulgaria and romania , making it only fair for them to pay for their emissions . but the eu report will have to pass two tough political tests if it is to have any chance of global acceptance . first , it will have to be approved by the eu 's 27 member states , who are currently reeling under the impact of the global financial crisis , and who have little appetite for expensive new initiatives . they then have to win approval from all major world powers in copenhagen - a negotiation which promises to be anything but simple . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

27 , as the eu prepared to unveil its own environmental action plan . " europe has gained a strong partner , " said czech environment minister martin bursik , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
" barack obama is quickly implementing what he has promised .
he acts efficiently , " he added .
" to protect our climate and our collective security , we must call together a truly global coalition , " president obama said at a white house ceremony , in an apparent swipe at former president george w. bush 's reluctance to take control of international efforts to combat climate change .
" we will make it clear to the world that america is ready to lead . "
he also vowed his policies would be dictated by the " sound science " behind climate change , rather than " rigid ideology . "
obama has signaled a sharp departure from climate change politics-as-usual in the united states , but this is only the beginning .
the obama administration on monday took some initial steps towards reversing the policies of former president george w. bush , drawing widespread praise from us environmental groups who had felt sidelined for much of the last eight years under bush .
obama named todd stern as the country 's first-ever climate-change envoy to lead international negotiations .
he also signed executive orders allowing us states like california to enact tougher vehicle emissions rules - the first step towards reversing a bush administration block on such state action .
but obama 's actions mark only the first steps in a long and complicated process , both in the united states and abroad , which environmental groups say will require an ongoing commitment from the new administration in order to make a serious dent in us and global climate policy .
bold steps must be sustained , say environmentalists obama 's first moves have been " bolder " than even many environmentalists expected , reid detchon , head of the energy future coalition , said in an interview .

but that could be a tough sell with the us facing a serious recession and us carmakers - who will bear the brunt of tougher fuel-efficiency standards - threatened with bankruptcy .
the eu looks set to pile more pressure on the us and other large polluters to sign up to an ambitious strategy to reduce greenhouse gases when ministers meet later this week .
the united states is the biggest polluter with 5.8 billion tons , followed by china with 5.1 billion tons of co2 per year .
with four billion tons of co2 a year , the eu generates 14 percent of the 27 billion tons that escape into the atmosphere each year .

27 , as the eu prepared to unveil its own environmental action plan . " europe has gained a strong partner , " said czech environment minister martin bursik , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
" barack obama is quickly implementing what he has promised .
he acts efficiently , " he added .
" to protect our climate and our collective security , we must call together a truly global coalition , " president obama said at a white house ceremony , in an apparent swipe at former president george w. bush 's reluctance to take control of international efforts to combat climate change .
" we will make it clear to the world that america is ready to lead . "
he also vowed his policies would be dictated by the " sound science " behind climate change , rather than " rigid ideology . "
obama has signaled a sharp departure from climate change politics-as-usual in the united states , but this is only the beginning .
the obama administration on monday took some initial steps towards reversing the policies of former president george w. bush , drawing widespread praise from us environmental groups who had felt sidelined for much of the last eight years under bush .
obama named todd stern as the country 's first-ever climate-change envoy to lead international negotiations .
he also signed executive orders allowing us states like california to enact tougher vehicle emissions rules - the first step towards reversing a bush administration block on such state action .
but obama 's actions mark only the first steps in a long and complicated process , both in the united states and abroad , which environmental groups say will require an ongoing commitment from the new administration in order to make a serious dent in us and global climate policy .
bold steps must be sustained , say environmentalists obama 's first moves have been " bolder " than even many environmentalists expected , reid detchon , head of the energy future coalition , said in an interview .
but " this is going to require a sustained effort , and more importantly political leadership " from the president himself , detchon said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stern will the point man on climate for the us stern will become the country 's chief negotiator in international climate talks that have already entered the final phase .
governments have resolved to agree on a comprehensive climate treaty that would impose tough new restrictions on greenhouse-gas emissions by the end of this year .
stern led the us delegation to the kyoto protocol talks in 1997 , which resulted in the world 's first climate treaty .
that experience will allow obama 's administration to get up and running immediately , shaving as much as four to six months off the transition process had obama chosen a less veteran negotiator , said detchon .
but while former president bill clinton signed the kyoto protocol , widespread opposition among lawmakers meant it was never ratified by the us senate .
the talks on a successor to kyoto also remain in the balance .
us opposition to the kyoto treaty rested on its failure to include emerging countries in its emissions targets .
developing countries have said that advanced economies , which industrialized earlier , bear greater responsibility for the earth 's warming to this point and should pay a heavier price .
many of the current sticking points on replacing kyoto , which expires in 2012 , revolve around the same issue .
obama ready to engage polluters in finding solution obama has not backed away from calling on developing countries , such as china and india , to share more of the burden in reducing emissions .
but he hopes to set an example for those countries by enacting sweeping new restrictions on polluting industries at home in the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama signed on to help fight climate change obama pledged during the presidential campaign to push for a cap- and-trade plan through congress that would effectively put a price on industries ' carbon emissions blamed for global warming .
supporters express hope that such legislation could be approved by december , when government delegates from around the world meet in copenhagen to thrash out a global climate deal .
but that could be a tough sell with the us facing a serious recession and us carmakers - who will bear the brunt of tougher fuel-efficiency standards - threatened with bankruptcy .
the eu looks set to pile more pressure on the us and other large polluters to sign up to an ambitious strategy to reduce greenhouse gases when ministers meet later this week .
the united states is the biggest polluter with 5.8 billion tons , followed by china with 5.1 billion tons of co2 per year .
with four billion tons of co2 a year , the eu generates 14 percent of the 27 billion tons that escape into the atmosphere each year .
last month european leaders approved a climate change action plan that the 27-nation bloc hopes will become a model for international negotiations in copenhagen in december .
eu ready to put its money where its mouth is bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commission president barroso will lead the eu 's fight the european commission will on wednesday unveil a strategy for gradually ramping up investments aimed at tackling climate change to a target of 175 billion euros -lrb- $ 231 billion -rrb- per year by 2020 .
the overall eu goal is to prevent a global temperature increase of more than two degrees centigrade over pre-industrial levels .
to do so it will encourage developed nations to commit to cut their emissions by 30 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 .
the target for developing nations should be set at 15-30 percent , according to the eu 's executive arm , with " significantly increased financial resources " required , including help from richer nations .

but obama 's actions mark only the first steps in a long and complicated process , both in the united states and abroad , which environmental groups say will require an ongoing commitment from the new administration in order to make a serious dent in us and global climate policy .
bold steps must be sustained , say environmentalists obama 's first moves have been " bolder " than even many environmentalists expected , reid detchon , head of the energy future coalition , said in an interview .
but " this is going to require a sustained effort , and more importantly political leadership " from the president himself , detchon said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stern will the point man on climate for the us stern will become the country 's chief negotiator in international climate talks that have already entered the final phase .
governments have resolved to agree on a comprehensive climate treaty that would impose tough new restrictions on greenhouse-gas emissions by the end of this year .
stern led the us delegation to the kyoto protocol talks in 1997 , which resulted in the world 's first climate treaty .
that experience will allow obama 's administration to get up and running immediately , shaving as much as four to six months off the transition process had obama chosen a less veteran negotiator , said detchon .
but while former president bill clinton signed the kyoto protocol , widespread opposition among lawmakers meant it was never ratified by the us senate .
the talks on a successor to kyoto also remain in the balance .
us opposition to the kyoto treaty rested on its failure to include emerging countries in its emissions targets .
developing countries have said that advanced economies , which industrialized earlier , bear greater responsibility for the earth 's warming to this point and should pay a heavier price .
many of the current sticking points on replacing kyoto , which expires in 2012 , revolve around the same issue .
obama ready to engage polluters in finding solution obama has not backed away from calling on developing countries , such as china and india , to share more of the burden in reducing emissions .
but he hopes to set an example for those countries by enacting sweeping new restrictions on polluting industries at home in the united states .

but that could be a tough sell with the us facing a serious recession and us carmakers - who will bear the brunt of tougher fuel-efficiency standards - threatened with bankruptcy .
the eu looks set to pile more pressure on the us and other large polluters to sign up to an ambitious strategy to reduce greenhouse gases when ministers meet later this week .
the united states is the biggest polluter with 5.8 billion tons , followed by china with 5.1 billion tons of co2 per year .
with four billion tons of co2 a year , the eu generates 14 percent of the 27 billion tons that escape into the atmosphere each year .

27 , as the eu prepared to unveil its own environmental action plan . " europe has gained a strong partner , " said czech environment minister martin bursik , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
" barack obama is quickly implementing what he has promised .
he acts efficiently , " he added .
" to protect our climate and our collective security , we must call together a truly global coalition , " president obama said at a white house ceremony , in an apparent swipe at former president george w. bush 's reluctance to take control of international efforts to combat climate change .
" we will make it clear to the world that america is ready to lead . "
he also vowed his policies would be dictated by the " sound science " behind climate change , rather than " rigid ideology . "
obama has signaled a sharp departure from climate change politics-as-usual in the united states , but this is only the beginning .
the obama administration on monday took some initial steps towards reversing the policies of former president george w. bush , drawing widespread praise from us environmental groups who had felt sidelined for much of the last eight years under bush .
obama named todd stern as the country 's first-ever climate-change envoy to lead international negotiations .
he also signed executive orders allowing us states like california to enact tougher vehicle emissions rules - the first step towards reversing a bush administration block on such state action .
but obama 's actions mark only the first steps in a long and complicated process , both in the united states and abroad , which environmental groups say will require an ongoing commitment from the new administration in order to make a serious dent in us and global climate policy .

it was , to say the least , an impressive start to 2009 for the men in red . stuttgart came into the match feeling as though they had a legitimate chance for an upset since they were playing at home and had managed to split the points with bayern in the last league match before the winter break .

bayern pounced on their opponents right from the outset .
midfielder bastian schweinsteiger staked the visitors to the lead in the 14th minute with a well-placed shot past stuttgart keeper jens lehmann .
two minutes later it was 2-nil , with playmaker frank ribery creating havoc in stuttgart 's box and slotting home from close range .
bayern were awarded a penalty in minute 21 after a foul by luckless stuttgart defender arthur boka .
but ribery chipped the penalty straight into the arms of a waiting lehmann , who had anticipated the frenchman 's attempted trick .
no matter .
shortly before the break , bayern striker luca toni found the net from ten meters out to essentially put the game beyond reach .

28 , that global warming might be more devastating than previously thought and stressed that any market system to slash emissions and make them more costly must include developing nations in the long run . the statements are part of a report drawn up by the commission which it hopes will replace the kyoto protocol to fight climate change which expires in 2012 . powers such as china and india , which are not members of the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , should join such a system no later than 2020 , the report says . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dimas has called for rich nations to help poorer ones tackle climate change the wealthy world should also offer developing countries substantial funding to help them cut their emissions , so that the world can reach a deal on fighting climate change at a conference in copenhagen in december , the european commission said as it set out its negotiating platform for the copenhagen talks . " without a credible financial package , it 's clear that there will be no deal in copenhagen : no money , no deal , " eu environment commissioner stavros dimas told journalists in brussels . green groups : proposals do n't go far enough but environmentalist groups criticized the proposals as too vague and under-funded , with greenpeace accusing the commission of backing down on a call for rich countries to offer poorer ones at least 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 40 billion -rrb- a year in climate aid by 2020 . the lack of specific funding targets shows that the eu is " unable to put its euros where its mouth is , " greenpeace said in a statement , while fellow-green group wwf said that the question of specific sums of funding would be the " make or break issue " in copenhagen . in 2005 , the eu set up a system capping the amount of greenhouse gases the bloc 's heavy industries could emit and allowing firms which reduced their emissions to sell the surplus emissions permits - the world 's first greenhouse gas emissions trading system -lrb- ets -rrb- . the commission proposal calls on all 30 oecd members - countries such as the united states , japan and south korea - to set up a similar ets by 2013 , and to allow permits to be traded between them by 2015 . rich states should help finance poorer ones major developing economies , meanwhile , should draw up national plans to tackle global warming before the copenhagen talks , and have their own ets ready to link into the oecd one by 2020 , the report says . that is becoming an " increasingly realistic " goal , as australia is currently setting up an ets , with new zealand and the us expected to follow suit , dimas said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's new tack on climate change has sparked relief in the eu the report by the european commission came just a day after new us president barack obama named todd stern as the country 's first-ever climate change envoy , confirming his plans to reverse the skeptical approach to the issue displayed by former president george w. bush . clean energy research the commission also proposed a number of measures aimed at enticing the world 's major economies , both developed and developing , into a binding global deal on fighting climate change at talks in copenhagen . they include calling on developed economies to pledge to cut their emissions to an average of 30 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 , and agree to a formula for setting binding country-specific targets based on each one 's current emissions , energy efficiency and population . the eu has already vowed to cut emissions to 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 , and to go to 30 percent if other developed economies accept a comparable cut . the eu 's proposals also call on rich states to set up a legally binding system for paying developing countries to fight climate change , either by agreeing rules and targets for bilateral aid or by sharing some of the revenue from the sale of emissions permits . it calls on countries to double investment in clean-energy research by 2013 and quadruple it by 2020 , and to raise spending on climate-change issues by 175 billion euros -lrb- $ 230 billion -rrb- a year by 2020 . in return , developing powers should curb their emissions growth so that they release between 15 and 30 percent less greenhouse gas in 2020 than they would do if they pursued their current policies . blueprint faces tough hurdles the commission also called for the tightening of a system which allows rich countries to gain credit for sponsoring emissions-reduction projects in poorer ones , making it harder to claim such credits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rich nations will no sponsor emissions-reduction projects in countries such as india , if the eu gets its way such projects would be limited to the poorest countries , cutting out rising powers such as china , india and brazil . eu officials say that the wealthiest developing countries are already richer than the bloc 's poorest members , such as bulgaria and romania , making it only fair for them to pay for their emissions . but the eu report will have to pass two tough political tests if it is to have any chance of global acceptance . first , it will have to be approved by the eu 's 27 member states , who are currently reeling under the impact of the global financial crisis , and who have little appetite for expensive new initiatives . they then have to win approval from all major world powers in copenhagen - a negotiation which promises to be anything but simple . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

28 , that global warming might be more devastating than previously thought and stressed that any market system to slash emissions and make them more costly must include developing nations in the long run . the statements are part of a report drawn up by the commission which it hopes will replace the kyoto protocol to fight climate change which expires in 2012 . powers such as china and india , which are not members of the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , should join such a system no later than 2020 , the report says . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dimas has called for rich nations to help poorer ones tackle climate change the wealthy world should also offer developing countries substantial funding to help them cut their emissions , so that the world can reach a deal on fighting climate change at a conference in copenhagen in december , the european commission said as it set out its negotiating platform for the copenhagen talks . " without a credible financial package , it 's clear that there will be no deal in copenhagen : no money , no deal , " eu environment commissioner stavros dimas told journalists in brussels . green groups : proposals do n't go far enough but environmentalist groups criticized the proposals as too vague and under-funded , with greenpeace accusing the commission of backing down on a call for rich countries to offer poorer ones at least 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 40 billion -rrb- a year in climate aid by 2020 . the lack of specific funding targets shows that the eu is " unable to put its euros where its mouth is , " greenpeace said in a statement , while fellow-green group wwf said that the question of specific sums of funding would be the " make or break issue " in copenhagen . in 2005 , the eu set up a system capping the amount of greenhouse gases the bloc 's heavy industries could emit and allowing firms which reduced their emissions to sell the surplus emissions permits - the world 's first greenhouse gas emissions trading system -lrb- ets -rrb- . the commission proposal calls on all 30 oecd members - countries such as the united states , japan and south korea - to set up a similar ets by 2013 , and to allow permits to be traded between them by 2015 . rich states should help finance poorer ones major developing economies , meanwhile , should draw up national plans to tackle global warming before the copenhagen talks , and have their own ets ready to link into the oecd one by 2020 , the report says . that is becoming an " increasingly realistic " goal , as australia is currently setting up an ets , with new zealand and the us expected to follow suit , dimas said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's new tack on climate change has sparked relief in the eu the report by the european commission came just a day after new us president barack obama named todd stern as the country 's first-ever climate change envoy , confirming his plans to reverse the skeptical approach to the issue displayed by former president george w. bush . clean energy research the commission also proposed a number of measures aimed at enticing the world 's major economies , both developed and developing , into a binding global deal on fighting climate change at talks in copenhagen . they include calling on developed economies to pledge to cut their emissions to an average of 30 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 , and agree to a formula for setting binding country-specific targets based on each one 's current emissions , energy efficiency and population . the eu has already vowed to cut emissions to 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 , and to go to 30 percent if other developed economies accept a comparable cut . the eu 's proposals also call on rich states to set up a legally binding system for paying developing countries to fight climate change , either by agreeing rules and targets for bilateral aid or by sharing some of the revenue from the sale of emissions permits . it calls on countries to double investment in clean-energy research by 2013 and quadruple it by 2020 , and to raise spending on climate-change issues by 175 billion euros -lrb- $ 230 billion -rrb- a year by 2020 . in return , developing powers should curb their emissions growth so that they release between 15 and 30 percent less greenhouse gas in 2020 than they would do if they pursued their current policies . blueprint faces tough hurdles the commission also called for the tightening of a system which allows rich countries to gain credit for sponsoring emissions-reduction projects in poorer ones , making it harder to claim such credits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rich nations will no sponsor emissions-reduction projects in countries such as india , if the eu gets its way such projects would be limited to the poorest countries , cutting out rising powers such as china , india and brazil . eu officials say that the wealthiest developing countries are already richer than the bloc 's poorest members , such as bulgaria and romania , making it only fair for them to pay for their emissions . but the eu report will have to pass two tough political tests if it is to have any chance of global acceptance . first , it will have to be approved by the eu 's 27 member states , who are currently reeling under the impact of the global financial crisis , and who have little appetite for expensive new initiatives . they then have to win approval from all major world powers in copenhagen - a negotiation which promises to be anything but simple . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a former veteran democratic lawmaker and past chairman of the senate foreign relations committee , biden will represent obama 's foreign policy on the world stage for the first time since the president 's historic inauguration last week .
this year 's munich security conference is expected to focus on the future of nato , european security organizations and non-proliferation .
but news agency ap reported that biden is widely expected to use the meeting to push america 's european allies to expand their role in afghanistan .
" afghanistan is us ' biggest military challenge " biden 's visit comes as the new us administration signals that it wants to break with the bush era and reverse many of the foreign policies of the previous administration .

earlier this week , obama discussed afghanistan by phone on monday with french president nicolas sarkozy , german chancellor angela merkel and russian president dmitry medvedev .
on tuesday , us defense minister robert gates described afghanistan as america 's greatest military challenge and warned the war could be lost if the west failed to address the problem of civilian casualties .
" there is little doubt that our greatest military challenge right now is afghanistan , " gates said .
" president -lrb- barack -rrb- obama has made it clear that the afghanistan theater should be our top overseas military priority . "
sarkozy , merkel and afghan president hamid karzai are expected to take part in the 45th munich conference on security policy on feb 7-8 , organizers said on the web site . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

28 . wealthy nations will experience their worst recession in the post-war period as a financial crisis continues to spread throughout their economies , the international monetary fund said as it slashed its global economic forecasts .
a contraction of two percent is expected in 2009 , even with massive fiscal stimulus packages planned by all rich countries . a recovery to 1.1 percent is possible in 2010 , the imf said , but only with drastic government intervention to help revive demand and stabilize financial institutions at the heart of the downturn . germany to contract 2.5 percent the united states will contract by 1.6 percent and germany - europe 's largest economy - by 2.5 per cent in 2009 .
japan , asia 's biggest economy , will contract 2.6 percent , the imf predicted . growth in emerging and developing countries will also slow dramatically in 2009 to 3.3 percent from 6.3 percent in 2008 . china 's economy will slow to 6.7 percent in 2009 from nine percent , india 's will drop to 5.1 percent and brazil 's growth will plummet a whopping four percentage points to 1.8 percent in 2009 . the imf 's predictions represented another sharp revision from its last forecast in november , a fact attributed to dramatic collapses in consumer and business confidence , plummeting global trade and demand , frozen credit markets and even greater losses for financial institutions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international monetary fund 's chief economist olivier blanchard " we expect the global economy to come to a virtual standstill in 2009 , " olivier blanchard , the imf 's chief economist , told reporters . in its november update , the imf had forecast 2.2 percent global growth for 2009 , a contraction of 0.3 percent in advanced economies and 5.1 percent growth in developing countries .

28 , that global warming might be more devastating than previously thought and stressed that any market system to slash emissions and make them more costly must include developing nations in the long run . the statements are part of a report drawn up by the commission which it hopes will replace the kyoto protocol to fight climate change which expires in 2012 . powers such as china and india , which are not members of the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , should join such a system no later than 2020 , the report says . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dimas has called for rich nations to help poorer ones tackle climate change the wealthy world should also offer developing countries substantial funding to help them cut their emissions , so that the world can reach a deal on fighting climate change at a conference in copenhagen in december , the european commission said as it set out its negotiating platform for the copenhagen talks . " without a credible financial package , it 's clear that there will be no deal in copenhagen : no money , no deal , " eu environment commissioner stavros dimas told journalists in brussels . green groups : proposals do n't go far enough but environmentalist groups criticized the proposals as too vague and under-funded , with greenpeace accusing the commission of backing down on a call for rich countries to offer poorer ones at least 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 40 billion -rrb- a year in climate aid by 2020 . the lack of specific funding targets shows that the eu is " unable to put its euros where its mouth is , " greenpeace said in a statement , while fellow-green group wwf said that the question of specific sums of funding would be the " make or break issue " in copenhagen . in 2005 , the eu set up a system capping the amount of greenhouse gases the bloc 's heavy industries could emit and allowing firms which reduced their emissions to sell the surplus emissions permits - the world 's first greenhouse gas emissions trading system -lrb- ets -rrb- . the commission proposal calls on all 30 oecd members - countries such as the united states , japan and south korea - to set up a similar ets by 2013 , and to allow permits to be traded between them by 2015 . rich states should help finance poorer ones major developing economies , meanwhile , should draw up national plans to tackle global warming before the copenhagen talks , and have their own ets ready to link into the oecd one by 2020 , the report says . that is becoming an " increasingly realistic " goal , as australia is currently setting up an ets , with new zealand and the us expected to follow suit , dimas said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's new tack on climate change has sparked relief in the eu the report by the european commission came just a day after new us president barack obama named todd stern as the country 's first-ever climate change envoy , confirming his plans to reverse the skeptical approach to the issue displayed by former president george w. bush . clean energy research the commission also proposed a number of measures aimed at enticing the world 's major economies , both developed and developing , into a binding global deal on fighting climate change at talks in copenhagen . they include calling on developed economies to pledge to cut their emissions to an average of 30 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 , and agree to a formula for setting binding country-specific targets based on each one 's current emissions , energy efficiency and population . the eu has already vowed to cut emissions to 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 , and to go to 30 percent if other developed economies accept a comparable cut . the eu 's proposals also call on rich states to set up a legally binding system for paying developing countries to fight climate change , either by agreeing rules and targets for bilateral aid or by sharing some of the revenue from the sale of emissions permits . it calls on countries to double investment in clean-energy research by 2013 and quadruple it by 2020 , and to raise spending on climate-change issues by 175 billion euros -lrb- $ 230 billion -rrb- a year by 2020 . in return , developing powers should curb their emissions growth so that they release between 15 and 30 percent less greenhouse gas in 2020 than they would do if they pursued their current policies . blueprint faces tough hurdles the commission also called for the tightening of a system which allows rich countries to gain credit for sponsoring emissions-reduction projects in poorer ones , making it harder to claim such credits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rich nations will no sponsor emissions-reduction projects in countries such as india , if the eu gets its way such projects would be limited to the poorest countries , cutting out rising powers such as china , india and brazil . eu officials say that the wealthiest developing countries are already richer than the bloc 's poorest members , such as bulgaria and romania , making it only fair for them to pay for their emissions . but the eu report will have to pass two tough political tests if it is to have any chance of global acceptance . first , it will have to be approved by the eu 's 27 member states , who are currently reeling under the impact of the global financial crisis , and who have little appetite for expensive new initiatives . they then have to win approval from all major world powers in copenhagen - a negotiation which promises to be anything but simple . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 28.01.2009 imf : world suffering worst downturn in postwar era großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german economy is expected to shrink by 2.5 percent the world economy will grow by only 0.5 percent in 2009 , the worst rate since world war two , as industrial nations battle a recession that is dragging developing countries down with them , the imf said wednesday , jan .
28 . wealthy nations will experience their worst recession in the post-war period as a financial crisis continues to spread throughout their economies , the international monetary fund said as it slashed its global economic forecasts .
a contraction of two percent is expected in 2009 , even with massive fiscal stimulus packages planned by all rich countries . a recovery to 1.1 percent is possible in 2010 , the imf said , but only with drastic government intervention to help revive demand and stabilize financial institutions at the heart of the downturn . germany to contract 2.5 percent the united states will contract by 1.6 percent and germany - europe 's largest economy - by 2.5 per cent in 2009 .
japan , asia 's biggest economy , will contract 2.6 percent , the imf predicted . growth in emerging and developing countries will also slow dramatically in 2009 to 3.3 percent from 6.3 percent in 2008 . china 's economy will slow to 6.7 percent in 2009 from nine percent , india 's will drop to 5.1 percent and brazil 's growth will plummet a whopping four percentage points to 1.8 percent in 2009 . the imf 's predictions represented another sharp revision from its last forecast in november , a fact attributed to dramatic collapses in consumer and business confidence , plummeting global trade and demand , frozen credit markets and even greater losses for financial institutions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international monetary fund 's chief economist olivier blanchard " we expect the global economy to come to a virtual standstill in 2009 , " olivier blanchard , the imf 's chief economist , told reporters . in its november update , the imf had forecast 2.2 percent global growth for 2009 , a contraction of 0.3 percent in advanced economies and 5.1 percent growth in developing countries .
world growth below three percent is considered a global recession . global trade volumes are also expected to collapse in 2009 , contracting 2.8 percent after growth of 4.1 percent the year before .
in november , the imf still predicted a 2.1 percent increase in trade for this year . deflation becoming a serious risk at the same time , the imf warned that deflation was now becoming a serious risk for some wealthy nations .
consumer prices were expected to rise by only 0.3 percent in industrial nations in 2009 and 0.8 percent in 2010 . the global downturn continues to be driven by the debilitating financial crisis which began with a collapse in the us housing market but has since spread to all corners of the globe . financial firms are now projected to lose a total of $ 2.2 trillion before the crisis is over - about $ 500 billion more than banks currently have in their reserves - and will require more government aid . the imf also expects the world 's 20 largest economies to spend at least 1.5 percent of their gross domestic product on massive fiscal stimulus packages .
the us is currently mulling an $ 825 billion package worth some five percent of gdp . such government spending is crucial to reviving consumer demand , but would only provide a relatively short-term boost to economies : stabilizing the financial system is the key in the long run . " restoring financial health is a necessary condition for durable economic recovery , " blanchard said , adding that governments needed to take more " aggressive " measures to stem the collapse of financial firms . prescription for recovery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : banks have cut back on lending , stalling economies banks ' need for cash has stopped them from lending to each other and to consumers .
developing countries have seen foreign investments in their economies dry up as a result . governments , especially the us , must inject more capital into banks to keep them afloat , but should also take the damaged mortgage-related assets off their balance sheets in order to promote a long-term recovery , the imf said . the price of commodities like oil , food and metals has also plummeted in the last few months due to falling demand , putting even more pressure on some poorer countries dependent on their exports of natural resources . dpa news agency -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the us is currently mulling an $ 825 billion package worth some five percent of gdp . such government spending is crucial to reviving consumer demand , but would only provide a relatively short-term boost to economies : stabilizing the financial system is the key in the long run .

" restoring financial health is a necessary condition for durable economic recovery , " blanchard said , adding that governments needed to take more " aggressive " measures to stem the collapse of financial firms . prescription for recovery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : banks have cut back on lending , stalling economies banks ' need for cash has stopped them from lending to each other and to consumers .
developing countries have seen foreign investments in their economies dry up as a result . governments , especially the us , must inject more capital into banks to keep them afloat , but should also take the damaged mortgage-related assets off their balance sheets in order to promote a long-term recovery , the imf said . the price of commodities like oil , food and metals has also plummeted in the last few months due to falling demand , putting even more pressure on some poorer countries dependent on their exports of natural resources . dpa news agency -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

meggin became a member of the united states peace corps and went on a mission which took her to mali , west africa for three years .
there she lived and worked in a small rural village on a number of humanitarian projects , mainly focussed in the health sector .
capitalising on the opportunities of cultural exchange in mali , and being part lebanese herself , meggin also became actively involved in the relatively large lebanese community which resides in mali ’ s capital , bamako .
when her contract with peace corps came to an end , meggin wanted to continue riding on the international wave , so she moved to germany to pursue a career in journalism , while learning german at the same time .
after a period of working as a freelance journalist and teacher , she joined the dw radio team in cologne in 2000 , where she worked as a news writer and presenter for the english program .
meggin ’ s work for radio also took her out in the field , where she found herself on several occasions in remote locations , rubbing elbows with some of the world ’ s most powerful decision-makers , such as us president george w. bush , former us secretary of state colin powell and even german chancellor gerhard schroeder .
in december of 2005 , meggin joined the dw tv news team in berlin as an anchor of the english news program " journal . " when it ’ s not " lights , camera , and action , " meggin is behind the scenes , working as a producer of the various dw-tv magazine shows .
fluent in two foreign languages , meggin enjoys travel .

27 , as the eu prepared to unveil its own environmental action plan . " europe has gained a strong partner , " said czech environment minister martin bursik , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
" barack obama is quickly implementing what he has promised .
he acts efficiently , " he added .
" to protect our climate and our collective security , we must call together a truly global coalition , " president obama said at a white house ceremony , in an apparent swipe at former president george w. bush 's reluctance to take control of international efforts to combat climate change .
" we will make it clear to the world that america is ready to lead . "
he also vowed his policies would be dictated by the " sound science " behind climate change , rather than " rigid ideology . "
obama has signaled a sharp departure from climate change politics-as-usual in the united states , but this is only the beginning .
the obama administration on monday took some initial steps towards reversing the policies of former president george w. bush , drawing widespread praise from us environmental groups who had felt sidelined for much of the last eight years under bush .
obama named todd stern as the country 's first-ever climate-change envoy to lead international negotiations .
he also signed executive orders allowing us states like california to enact tougher vehicle emissions rules - the first step towards reversing a bush administration block on such state action .
but obama 's actions mark only the first steps in a long and complicated process , both in the united states and abroad , which environmental groups say will require an ongoing commitment from the new administration in order to make a serious dent in us and global climate policy .
bold steps must be sustained , say environmentalists obama 's first moves have been " bolder " than even many environmentalists expected , reid detchon , head of the energy future coalition , said in an interview .
but " this is going to require a sustained effort , and more importantly political leadership " from the president himself , detchon said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stern will the point man on climate for the us stern will become the country 's chief negotiator in international climate talks that have already entered the final phase .
governments have resolved to agree on a comprehensive climate treaty that would impose tough new restrictions on greenhouse-gas emissions by the end of this year .
stern led the us delegation to the kyoto protocol talks in 1997 , which resulted in the world 's first climate treaty .
that experience will allow obama 's administration to get up and running immediately , shaving as much as four to six months off the transition process had obama chosen a less veteran negotiator , said detchon .
but while former president bill clinton signed the kyoto protocol , widespread opposition among lawmakers meant it was never ratified by the us senate .
the talks on a successor to kyoto also remain in the balance .
us opposition to the kyoto treaty rested on its failure to include emerging countries in its emissions targets .
developing countries have said that advanced economies , which industrialized earlier , bear greater responsibility for the earth 's warming to this point and should pay a heavier price .
many of the current sticking points on replacing kyoto , which expires in 2012 , revolve around the same issue .
obama ready to engage polluters in finding solution obama has not backed away from calling on developing countries , such as china and india , to share more of the burden in reducing emissions .
but he hopes to set an example for those countries by enacting sweeping new restrictions on polluting industries at home in the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama signed on to help fight climate change obama pledged during the presidential campaign to push for a cap- and-trade plan through congress that would effectively put a price on industries ' carbon emissions blamed for global warming .
supporters express hope that such legislation could be approved by december , when government delegates from around the world meet in copenhagen to thrash out a global climate deal .
but that could be a tough sell with the us facing a serious recession and us carmakers - who will bear the brunt of tougher fuel-efficiency standards - threatened with bankruptcy .
the eu looks set to pile more pressure on the us and other large polluters to sign up to an ambitious strategy to reduce greenhouse gases when ministers meet later this week .
the united states is the biggest polluter with 5.8 billion tons , followed by china with 5.1 billion tons of co2 per year .
with four billion tons of co2 a year , the eu generates 14 percent of the 27 billion tons that escape into the atmosphere each year .
last month european leaders approved a climate change action plan that the 27-nation bloc hopes will become a model for international negotiations in copenhagen in december .
eu ready to put its money where its mouth is bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commission president barroso will lead the eu 's fight the european commission will on wednesday unveil a strategy for gradually ramping up investments aimed at tackling climate change to a target of 175 billion euros -lrb- $ 231 billion -rrb- per year by 2020 .
the overall eu goal is to prevent a global temperature increase of more than two degrees centigrade over pre-industrial levels .
to do so it will encourage developed nations to commit to cut their emissions by 30 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 .
the target for developing nations should be set at 15-30 percent , according to the eu 's executive arm , with " significantly increased financial resources " required , including help from richer nations .
among the sources of finance , the commission recommends making polluters pay for each ton of carbon dioxide that they emit , according to draft proposals .
eu leaders committed last month to a climate-energy package that would decrease the bloc 's greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 , make 20 percent energy savings and bring renewable energy sources up to 20 percent of total energy use . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

27 , as the eu prepared to unveil its own environmental action plan . " europe has gained a strong partner , " said czech environment minister martin bursik , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
" barack obama is quickly implementing what he has promised .
he acts efficiently , " he added .
" to protect our climate and our collective security , we must call together a truly global coalition , " president obama said at a white house ceremony , in an apparent swipe at former president george w. bush 's reluctance to take control of international efforts to combat climate change .
" we will make it clear to the world that america is ready to lead . "
he also vowed his policies would be dictated by the " sound science " behind climate change , rather than " rigid ideology . "
obama has signaled a sharp departure from climate change politics-as-usual in the united states , but this is only the beginning .
the obama administration on monday took some initial steps towards reversing the policies of former president george w. bush , drawing widespread praise from us environmental groups who had felt sidelined for much of the last eight years under bush .
obama named todd stern as the country 's first-ever climate-change envoy to lead international negotiations .
he also signed executive orders allowing us states like california to enact tougher vehicle emissions rules - the first step towards reversing a bush administration block on such state action .
but obama 's actions mark only the first steps in a long and complicated process , both in the united states and abroad , which environmental groups say will require an ongoing commitment from the new administration in order to make a serious dent in us and global climate policy .
bold steps must be sustained , say environmentalists obama 's first moves have been " bolder " than even many environmentalists expected , reid detchon , head of the energy future coalition , said in an interview .
but " this is going to require a sustained effort , and more importantly political leadership " from the president himself , detchon said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stern will the point man on climate for the us stern will become the country 's chief negotiator in international climate talks that have already entered the final phase .
governments have resolved to agree on a comprehensive climate treaty that would impose tough new restrictions on greenhouse-gas emissions by the end of this year .
stern led the us delegation to the kyoto protocol talks in 1997 , which resulted in the world 's first climate treaty .
that experience will allow obama 's administration to get up and running immediately , shaving as much as four to six months off the transition process had obama chosen a less veteran negotiator , said detchon .
but while former president bill clinton signed the kyoto protocol , widespread opposition among lawmakers meant it was never ratified by the us senate .
the talks on a successor to kyoto also remain in the balance .
us opposition to the kyoto treaty rested on its failure to include emerging countries in its emissions targets .
developing countries have said that advanced economies , which industrialized earlier , bear greater responsibility for the earth 's warming to this point and should pay a heavier price .
many of the current sticking points on replacing kyoto , which expires in 2012 , revolve around the same issue .
obama ready to engage polluters in finding solution obama has not backed away from calling on developing countries , such as china and india , to share more of the burden in reducing emissions .
but he hopes to set an example for those countries by enacting sweeping new restrictions on polluting industries at home in the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama signed on to help fight climate change obama pledged during the presidential campaign to push for a cap- and-trade plan through congress that would effectively put a price on industries ' carbon emissions blamed for global warming .
supporters express hope that such legislation could be approved by december , when government delegates from around the world meet in copenhagen to thrash out a global climate deal .
but that could be a tough sell with the us facing a serious recession and us carmakers - who will bear the brunt of tougher fuel-efficiency standards - threatened with bankruptcy .
the eu looks set to pile more pressure on the us and other large polluters to sign up to an ambitious strategy to reduce greenhouse gases when ministers meet later this week .
the united states is the biggest polluter with 5.8 billion tons , followed by china with 5.1 billion tons of co2 per year .
with four billion tons of co2 a year , the eu generates 14 percent of the 27 billion tons that escape into the atmosphere each year .
last month european leaders approved a climate change action plan that the 27-nation bloc hopes will become a model for international negotiations in copenhagen in december .
eu ready to put its money where its mouth is bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commission president barroso will lead the eu 's fight the european commission will on wednesday unveil a strategy for gradually ramping up investments aimed at tackling climate change to a target of 175 billion euros -lrb- $ 231 billion -rrb- per year by 2020 .
the overall eu goal is to prevent a global temperature increase of more than two degrees centigrade over pre-industrial levels .
to do so it will encourage developed nations to commit to cut their emissions by 30 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 .
the target for developing nations should be set at 15-30 percent , according to the eu 's executive arm , with " significantly increased financial resources " required , including help from richer nations .
among the sources of finance , the commission recommends making polluters pay for each ton of carbon dioxide that they emit , according to draft proposals .
eu leaders committed last month to a climate-energy package that would decrease the bloc 's greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 , make 20 percent energy savings and bring renewable energy sources up to 20 percent of total energy use . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

27 , as the eu prepared to unveil its own environmental action plan . " europe has gained a strong partner , " said czech environment minister martin bursik , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
" barack obama is quickly implementing what he has promised .
he acts efficiently , " he added .
" to protect our climate and our collective security , we must call together a truly global coalition , " president obama said at a white house ceremony , in an apparent swipe at former president george w. bush 's reluctance to take control of international efforts to combat climate change .
" we will make it clear to the world that america is ready to lead . "
he also vowed his policies would be dictated by the " sound science " behind climate change , rather than " rigid ideology . "
obama has signaled a sharp departure from climate change politics-as-usual in the united states , but this is only the beginning .
the obama administration on monday took some initial steps towards reversing the policies of former president george w. bush , drawing widespread praise from us environmental groups who had felt sidelined for much of the last eight years under bush .
obama named todd stern as the country 's first-ever climate-change envoy to lead international negotiations .
he also signed executive orders allowing us states like california to enact tougher vehicle emissions rules - the first step towards reversing a bush administration block on such state action .
but obama 's actions mark only the first steps in a long and complicated process , both in the united states and abroad , which environmental groups say will require an ongoing commitment from the new administration in order to make a serious dent in us and global climate policy .
bold steps must be sustained , say environmentalists obama 's first moves have been " bolder " than even many environmentalists expected , reid detchon , head of the energy future coalition , said in an interview .
but " this is going to require a sustained effort , and more importantly political leadership " from the president himself , detchon said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stern will the point man on climate for the us stern will become the country 's chief negotiator in international climate talks that have already entered the final phase .
governments have resolved to agree on a comprehensive climate treaty that would impose tough new restrictions on greenhouse-gas emissions by the end of this year .
stern led the us delegation to the kyoto protocol talks in 1997 , which resulted in the world 's first climate treaty .
that experience will allow obama 's administration to get up and running immediately , shaving as much as four to six months off the transition process had obama chosen a less veteran negotiator , said detchon .
but while former president bill clinton signed the kyoto protocol , widespread opposition among lawmakers meant it was never ratified by the us senate .
the talks on a successor to kyoto also remain in the balance .
us opposition to the kyoto treaty rested on its failure to include emerging countries in its emissions targets .
developing countries have said that advanced economies , which industrialized earlier , bear greater responsibility for the earth 's warming to this point and should pay a heavier price .
many of the current sticking points on replacing kyoto , which expires in 2012 , revolve around the same issue .
obama ready to engage polluters in finding solution obama has not backed away from calling on developing countries , such as china and india , to share more of the burden in reducing emissions .
but he hopes to set an example for those countries by enacting sweeping new restrictions on polluting industries at home in the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama signed on to help fight climate change obama pledged during the presidential campaign to push for a cap- and-trade plan through congress that would effectively put a price on industries ' carbon emissions blamed for global warming .
supporters express hope that such legislation could be approved by december , when government delegates from around the world meet in copenhagen to thrash out a global climate deal .
but that could be a tough sell with the us facing a serious recession and us carmakers - who will bear the brunt of tougher fuel-efficiency standards - threatened with bankruptcy .
the eu looks set to pile more pressure on the us and other large polluters to sign up to an ambitious strategy to reduce greenhouse gases when ministers meet later this week .
the united states is the biggest polluter with 5.8 billion tons , followed by china with 5.1 billion tons of co2 per year .
with four billion tons of co2 a year , the eu generates 14 percent of the 27 billion tons that escape into the atmosphere each year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 28.01.2009 imf : world suffering worst downturn in postwar era großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german economy is expected to shrink by 2.5 percent the world economy will grow by only 0.5 percent in 2009 , the worst rate since world war two , as industrial nations battle a recession that is dragging developing countries down with them , the imf said wednesday , jan .
28 . wealthy nations will experience their worst recession in the post-war period as a financial crisis continues to spread throughout their economies , the international monetary fund said as it slashed its global economic forecasts .
a contraction of two percent is expected in 2009 , even with massive fiscal stimulus packages planned by all rich countries . a recovery to 1.1 percent is possible in 2010 , the imf said , but only with drastic government intervention to help revive demand and stabilize financial institutions at the heart of the downturn . germany to contract 2.5 percent the united states will contract by 1.6 percent and germany - europe 's largest economy - by 2.5 per cent in 2009 .
japan , asia 's biggest economy , will contract 2.6 percent , the imf predicted . growth in emerging and developing countries will also slow dramatically in 2009 to 3.3 percent from 6.3 percent in 2008 . china 's economy will slow to 6.7 percent in 2009 from nine percent , india 's will drop to 5.1 percent and brazil 's growth will plummet a whopping four percentage points to 1.8 percent in 2009 . the imf 's predictions represented another sharp revision from its last forecast in november , a fact attributed to dramatic collapses in consumer and business confidence , plummeting global trade and demand , frozen credit markets and even greater losses for financial institutions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international monetary fund 's chief economist olivier blanchard " we expect the global economy to come to a virtual standstill in 2009 , " olivier blanchard , the imf 's chief economist , told reporters . in its november update , the imf had forecast 2.2 percent global growth for 2009 , a contraction of 0.3 percent in advanced economies and 5.1 percent growth in developing countries .
world growth below three percent is considered a global recession . global trade volumes are also expected to collapse in 2009 , contracting 2.8 percent after growth of 4.1 percent the year before .
in november , the imf still predicted a 2.1 percent increase in trade for this year . deflation becoming a serious risk at the same time , the imf warned that deflation was now becoming a serious risk for some wealthy nations .
consumer prices were expected to rise by only 0.3 percent in industrial nations in 2009 and 0.8 percent in 2010 . the global downturn continues to be driven by the debilitating financial crisis which began with a collapse in the us housing market but has since spread to all corners of the globe . financial firms are now projected to lose a total of $ 2.2 trillion before the crisis is over - about $ 500 billion more than banks currently have in their reserves - and will require more government aid . the imf also expects the world 's 20 largest economies to spend at least 1.5 percent of their gross domestic product on massive fiscal stimulus packages .
the us is currently mulling an $ 825 billion package worth some five percent of gdp . such government spending is crucial to reviving consumer demand , but would only provide a relatively short-term boost to economies : stabilizing the financial system is the key in the long run . " restoring financial health is a necessary condition for durable economic recovery , " blanchard said , adding that governments needed to take more " aggressive " measures to stem the collapse of financial firms . prescription for recovery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : banks have cut back on lending , stalling economies banks ' need for cash has stopped them from lending to each other and to consumers .
developing countries have seen foreign investments in their economies dry up as a result . governments , especially the us , must inject more capital into banks to keep them afloat , but should also take the damaged mortgage-related assets off their balance sheets in order to promote a long-term recovery , the imf said . the price of commodities like oil , food and metals has also plummeted in the last few months due to falling demand , putting even more pressure on some poorer countries dependent on their exports of natural resources . dpa news agency -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

28 . wealthy nations will experience their worst recession in the post-war period as a financial crisis continues to spread throughout their economies , the international monetary fund said as it slashed its global economic forecasts .
a contraction of two percent is expected in 2009 , even with massive fiscal stimulus packages planned by all rich countries . a recovery to 1.1 percent is possible in 2010 , the imf said , but only with drastic government intervention to help revive demand and stabilize financial institutions at the heart of the downturn . germany to contract 2.5 percent the united states will contract by 1.6 percent and germany - europe 's largest economy - by 2.5 per cent in 2009 .
japan , asia 's biggest economy , will contract 2.6 percent , the imf predicted . growth in emerging and developing countries will also slow dramatically in 2009 to 3.3 percent from 6.3 percent in 2008 . china 's economy will slow to 6.7 percent in 2009 from nine percent , india 's will drop to 5.1 percent and brazil 's growth will plummet a whopping four percentage points to 1.8 percent in 2009 . the imf 's predictions represented another sharp revision from its last forecast in november , a fact attributed to dramatic collapses in consumer and business confidence , plummeting global trade and demand , frozen credit markets and even greater losses for financial institutions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international monetary fund 's chief economist olivier blanchard " we expect the global economy to come to a virtual standstill in 2009 , " olivier blanchard , the imf 's chief economist , told reporters . in its november update , the imf had forecast 2.2 percent global growth for 2009 , a contraction of 0.3 percent in advanced economies and 5.1 percent growth in developing countries .
world growth below three percent is considered a global recession . global trade volumes are also expected to collapse in 2009 , contracting 2.8 percent after growth of 4.1 percent the year before .
in november , the imf still predicted a 2.1 percent increase in trade for this year . deflation becoming a serious risk at the same time , the imf warned that deflation was now becoming a serious risk for some wealthy nations .
consumer prices were expected to rise by only 0.3 percent in industrial nations in 2009 and 0.8 percent in 2010 . the global downturn continues to be driven by the debilitating financial crisis which began with a collapse in the us housing market but has since spread to all corners of the globe . financial firms are now projected to lose a total of $ 2.2 trillion before the crisis is over - about $ 500 billion more than banks currently have in their reserves - and will require more government aid . the imf also expects the world 's 20 largest economies to spend at least 1.5 percent of their gross domestic product on massive fiscal stimulus packages .
the us is currently mulling an $ 825 billion package worth some five percent of gdp . such government spending is crucial to reviving consumer demand , but would only provide a relatively short-term boost to economies : stabilizing the financial system is the key in the long run . " restoring financial health is a necessary condition for durable economic recovery , " blanchard said , adding that governments needed to take more " aggressive " measures to stem the collapse of financial firms . prescription for recovery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : banks have cut back on lending , stalling economies banks ' need for cash has stopped them from lending to each other and to consumers .
developing countries have seen foreign investments in their economies dry up as a result . governments , especially the us , must inject more capital into banks to keep them afloat , but should also take the damaged mortgage-related assets off their balance sheets in order to promote a long-term recovery , the imf said . the price of commodities like oil , food and metals has also plummeted in the last few months due to falling demand , putting even more pressure on some poorer countries dependent on their exports of natural resources . dpa news agency -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

24 , following their excommunication in 1988 .
the four men ran the society of saint pius x -lrb- sspx -rrb- , an ultra-traditionalist catholic group that broke with rome over reforms introduced in the 1960s through the second vatican council . williamson 's rehabilitation has provoked a storm of outrage because he denies the existence of the nazi gas chambers and claims that " only 200,000 to 300,000 " jews died in concentration camps instead of some six million . such denial of the holocaust is both " inhuman " and " sacrilegious , " mueller said . the diocese released its response a day after a holocaust memorial service in regensburg , which is also the home base of pope benedict . aides : ban is more symbolic aides conceded that mueller 's ban was more symbolic than disciplinary , since mueller has no control over the sspx or its training center at zaitzkofen , near regensburg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british bishop richard williamson public prosecutors have opened an inquiry against williamson over his denial of the holocaust during an interview recorded with swedish television last week at zaitzkofen .
holocaust denial is a crime in germany . the german conference of catholic bishops has also rejected williamson 's remarks .
in rome , pope benedict xvi expressed " solidarity " wednesday with the jewish people and said the reality of the holocaust can not be cancelled through any form of denial . on wednesday , the israeli chief rabbi officially broke off ties with the vatican in protest at the decision to lift the excommunication on williamson . the sspx publicly dissociated itself on tuesday from williamson . historical research using population data suggests between 5 million and 6 million european jews were killed by privation and violence during world war ii .

28 , that global warming might be more devastating than previously thought and stressed that any market system to slash emissions and make them more costly must include developing nations in the long run . the statements are part of a report drawn up by the commission which it hopes will replace the kyoto protocol to fight climate change which expires in 2012 . powers such as china and india , which are not members of the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , should join such a system no later than 2020 , the report says . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dimas has called for rich nations to help poorer ones tackle climate change the wealthy world should also offer developing countries substantial funding to help them cut their emissions , so that the world can reach a deal on fighting climate change at a conference in copenhagen in december , the european commission said as it set out its negotiating platform for the copenhagen talks . " without a credible financial package , it 's clear that there will be no deal in copenhagen : no money , no deal , " eu environment commissioner stavros dimas told journalists in brussels . green groups : proposals do n't go far enough but environmentalist groups criticized the proposals as too vague and under-funded , with greenpeace accusing the commission of backing down on a call for rich countries to offer poorer ones at least 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 40 billion -rrb- a year in climate aid by 2020 . the lack of specific funding targets shows that the eu is " unable to put its euros where its mouth is , " greenpeace said in a statement , while fellow-green group wwf said that the question of specific sums of funding would be the " make or break issue " in copenhagen . in 2005 , the eu set up a system capping the amount of greenhouse gases the bloc 's heavy industries could emit and allowing firms which reduced their emissions to sell the surplus emissions permits - the world 's first greenhouse gas emissions trading system -lrb- ets -rrb- . the commission proposal calls on all 30 oecd members - countries such as the united states , japan and south korea - to set up a similar ets by 2013 , and to allow permits to be traded between them by 2015 . rich states should help finance poorer ones major developing economies , meanwhile , should draw up national plans to tackle global warming before the copenhagen talks , and have their own ets ready to link into the oecd one by 2020 , the report says . that is becoming an " increasingly realistic " goal , as australia is currently setting up an ets , with new zealand and the us expected to follow suit , dimas said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's new tack on climate change has sparked relief in the eu the report by the european commission came just a day after new us president barack obama named todd stern as the country 's first-ever climate change envoy , confirming his plans to reverse the skeptical approach to the issue displayed by former president george w. bush . clean energy research the commission also proposed a number of measures aimed at enticing the world 's major economies , both developed and developing , into a binding global deal on fighting climate change at talks in copenhagen . they include calling on developed economies to pledge to cut their emissions to an average of 30 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 , and agree to a formula for setting binding country-specific targets based on each one 's current emissions , energy efficiency and population . the eu has already vowed to cut emissions to 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 , and to go to 30 percent if other developed economies accept a comparable cut . the eu 's proposals also call on rich states to set up a legally binding system for paying developing countries to fight climate change , either by agreeing rules and targets for bilateral aid or by sharing some of the revenue from the sale of emissions permits . it calls on countries to double investment in clean-energy research by 2013 and quadruple it by 2020 , and to raise spending on climate-change issues by 175 billion euros -lrb- $ 230 billion -rrb- a year by 2020 . in return , developing powers should curb their emissions growth so that they release between 15 and 30 percent less greenhouse gas in 2020 than they would do if they pursued their current policies . blueprint faces tough hurdles the commission also called for the tightening of a system which allows rich countries to gain credit for sponsoring emissions-reduction projects in poorer ones , making it harder to claim such credits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rich nations will no sponsor emissions-reduction projects in countries such as india , if the eu gets its way such projects would be limited to the poorest countries , cutting out rising powers such as china , india and brazil . eu officials say that the wealthiest developing countries are already richer than the bloc 's poorest members , such as bulgaria and romania , making it only fair for them to pay for their emissions . but the eu report will have to pass two tough political tests if it is to have any chance of global acceptance . first , it will have to be approved by the eu 's 27 member states , who are currently reeling under the impact of the global financial crisis , and who have little appetite for expensive new initiatives . they then have to win approval from all major world powers in copenhagen - a negotiation which promises to be anything but simple . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

27 , as the eu prepared to unveil its own environmental action plan . " europe has gained a strong partner , " said czech environment minister martin bursik , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
" barack obama is quickly implementing what he has promised .
he acts efficiently , " he added .
" to protect our climate and our collective security , we must call together a truly global coalition , " president obama said at a white house ceremony , in an apparent swipe at former president george w. bush 's reluctance to take control of international efforts to combat climate change .
" we will make it clear to the world that america is ready to lead . "
he also vowed his policies would be dictated by the " sound science " behind climate change , rather than " rigid ideology . "
obama has signaled a sharp departure from climate change politics-as-usual in the united states , but this is only the beginning .
the obama administration on monday took some initial steps towards reversing the policies of former president george w. bush , drawing widespread praise from us environmental groups who had felt sidelined for much of the last eight years under bush .
obama named todd stern as the country 's first-ever climate-change envoy to lead international negotiations .
he also signed executive orders allowing us states like california to enact tougher vehicle emissions rules - the first step towards reversing a bush administration block on such state action .
but obama 's actions mark only the first steps in a long and complicated process , both in the united states and abroad , which environmental groups say will require an ongoing commitment from the new administration in order to make a serious dent in us and global climate policy .
bold steps must be sustained , say environmentalists obama 's first moves have been " bolder " than even many environmentalists expected , reid detchon , head of the energy future coalition , said in an interview .
but " this is going to require a sustained effort , and more importantly political leadership " from the president himself , detchon said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stern will the point man on climate for the us stern will become the country 's chief negotiator in international climate talks that have already entered the final phase .
governments have resolved to agree on a comprehensive climate treaty that would impose tough new restrictions on greenhouse-gas emissions by the end of this year .
stern led the us delegation to the kyoto protocol talks in 1997 , which resulted in the world 's first climate treaty .
that experience will allow obama 's administration to get up and running immediately , shaving as much as four to six months off the transition process had obama chosen a less veteran negotiator , said detchon .
but while former president bill clinton signed the kyoto protocol , widespread opposition among lawmakers meant it was never ratified by the us senate .
the talks on a successor to kyoto also remain in the balance .
us opposition to the kyoto treaty rested on its failure to include emerging countries in its emissions targets .
developing countries have said that advanced economies , which industrialized earlier , bear greater responsibility for the earth 's warming to this point and should pay a heavier price .
many of the current sticking points on replacing kyoto , which expires in 2012 , revolve around the same issue .
obama ready to engage polluters in finding solution obama has not backed away from calling on developing countries , such as china and india , to share more of the burden in reducing emissions .
but he hopes to set an example for those countries by enacting sweeping new restrictions on polluting industries at home in the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama signed on to help fight climate change obama pledged during the presidential campaign to push for a cap- and-trade plan through congress that would effectively put a price on industries ' carbon emissions blamed for global warming .
supporters express hope that such legislation could be approved by december , when government delegates from around the world meet in copenhagen to thrash out a global climate deal .
but that could be a tough sell with the us facing a serious recession and us carmakers - who will bear the brunt of tougher fuel-efficiency standards - threatened with bankruptcy .
the eu looks set to pile more pressure on the us and other large polluters to sign up to an ambitious strategy to reduce greenhouse gases when ministers meet later this week .
the united states is the biggest polluter with 5.8 billion tons , followed by china with 5.1 billion tons of co2 per year .
with four billion tons of co2 a year , the eu generates 14 percent of the 27 billion tons that escape into the atmosphere each year .
last month european leaders approved a climate change action plan that the 27-nation bloc hopes will become a model for international negotiations in copenhagen in december .
eu ready to put its money where its mouth is bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commission president barroso will lead the eu 's fight the european commission will on wednesday unveil a strategy for gradually ramping up investments aimed at tackling climate change to a target of 175 billion euros -lrb- $ 231 billion -rrb- per year by 2020 .
the overall eu goal is to prevent a global temperature increase of more than two degrees centigrade over pre-industrial levels .
to do so it will encourage developed nations to commit to cut their emissions by 30 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 .
the target for developing nations should be set at 15-30 percent , according to the eu 's executive arm , with " significantly increased financial resources " required , including help from richer nations .
among the sources of finance , the commission recommends making polluters pay for each ton of carbon dioxide that they emit , according to draft proposals .
eu leaders committed last month to a climate-energy package that would decrease the bloc 's greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 , make 20 percent energy savings and bring renewable energy sources up to 20 percent of total energy use . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

27 , as the eu prepared to unveil its own environmental action plan . " europe has gained a strong partner , " said czech environment minister martin bursik , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
" barack obama is quickly implementing what he has promised .
he acts efficiently , " he added .
" to protect our climate and our collective security , we must call together a truly global coalition , " president obama said at a white house ceremony , in an apparent swipe at former president george w. bush 's reluctance to take control of international efforts to combat climate change .
" we will make it clear to the world that america is ready to lead . "
he also vowed his policies would be dictated by the " sound science " behind climate change , rather than " rigid ideology . "
obama has signaled a sharp departure from climate change politics-as-usual in the united states , but this is only the beginning .
the obama administration on monday took some initial steps towards reversing the policies of former president george w. bush , drawing widespread praise from us environmental groups who had felt sidelined for much of the last eight years under bush .
obama named todd stern as the country 's first-ever climate-change envoy to lead international negotiations .
he also signed executive orders allowing us states like california to enact tougher vehicle emissions rules - the first step towards reversing a bush administration block on such state action .
but obama 's actions mark only the first steps in a long and complicated process , both in the united states and abroad , which environmental groups say will require an ongoing commitment from the new administration in order to make a serious dent in us and global climate policy .
bold steps must be sustained , say environmentalists obama 's first moves have been " bolder " than even many environmentalists expected , reid detchon , head of the energy future coalition , said in an interview .
but " this is going to require a sustained effort , and more importantly political leadership " from the president himself , detchon said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stern will the point man on climate for the us stern will become the country 's chief negotiator in international climate talks that have already entered the final phase .
governments have resolved to agree on a comprehensive climate treaty that would impose tough new restrictions on greenhouse-gas emissions by the end of this year .
stern led the us delegation to the kyoto protocol talks in 1997 , which resulted in the world 's first climate treaty .
that experience will allow obama 's administration to get up and running immediately , shaving as much as four to six months off the transition process had obama chosen a less veteran negotiator , said detchon .
but while former president bill clinton signed the kyoto protocol , widespread opposition among lawmakers meant it was never ratified by the us senate .
the talks on a successor to kyoto also remain in the balance .
us opposition to the kyoto treaty rested on its failure to include emerging countries in its emissions targets .
developing countries have said that advanced economies , which industrialized earlier , bear greater responsibility for the earth 's warming to this point and should pay a heavier price .
many of the current sticking points on replacing kyoto , which expires in 2012 , revolve around the same issue .
obama ready to engage polluters in finding solution obama has not backed away from calling on developing countries , such as china and india , to share more of the burden in reducing emissions .
but he hopes to set an example for those countries by enacting sweeping new restrictions on polluting industries at home in the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama signed on to help fight climate change obama pledged during the presidential campaign to push for a cap- and-trade plan through congress that would effectively put a price on industries ' carbon emissions blamed for global warming .
supporters express hope that such legislation could be approved by december , when government delegates from around the world meet in copenhagen to thrash out a global climate deal .
but that could be a tough sell with the us facing a serious recession and us carmakers - who will bear the brunt of tougher fuel-efficiency standards - threatened with bankruptcy .
the eu looks set to pile more pressure on the us and other large polluters to sign up to an ambitious strategy to reduce greenhouse gases when ministers meet later this week .
the united states is the biggest polluter with 5.8 billion tons , followed by china with 5.1 billion tons of co2 per year .
with four billion tons of co2 a year , the eu generates 14 percent of the 27 billion tons that escape into the atmosphere each year .
last month european leaders approved a climate change action plan that the 27-nation bloc hopes will become a model for international negotiations in copenhagen in december .
eu ready to put its money where its mouth is bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commission president barroso will lead the eu 's fight the european commission will on wednesday unveil a strategy for gradually ramping up investments aimed at tackling climate change to a target of 175 billion euros -lrb- $ 231 billion -rrb- per year by 2020 .
the overall eu goal is to prevent a global temperature increase of more than two degrees centigrade over pre-industrial levels .
to do so it will encourage developed nations to commit to cut their emissions by 30 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 .
the target for developing nations should be set at 15-30 percent , according to the eu 's executive arm , with " significantly increased financial resources " required , including help from richer nations .
among the sources of finance , the commission recommends making polluters pay for each ton of carbon dioxide that they emit , according to draft proposals .
eu leaders committed last month to a climate-energy package that would decrease the bloc 's greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 , make 20 percent energy savings and bring renewable energy sources up to 20 percent of total energy use . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

obama ready to engage polluters in finding solution obama has not backed away from calling on developing countries , such as china and india , to share more of the burden in reducing emissions .
but he hopes to set an example for those countries by enacting sweeping new restrictions on polluting industries at home in the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama signed on to help fight climate change obama pledged during the presidential campaign to push for a cap- and-trade plan through congress that would effectively put a price on industries ' carbon emissions blamed for global warming .
supporters express hope that such legislation could be approved by december , when government delegates from around the world meet in copenhagen to thrash out a global climate deal .
but that could be a tough sell with the us facing a serious recession and us carmakers - who will bear the brunt of tougher fuel-efficiency standards - threatened with bankruptcy .
the eu looks set to pile more pressure on the us and other large polluters to sign up to an ambitious strategy to reduce greenhouse gases when ministers meet later this week .
the united states is the biggest polluter with 5.8 billion tons , followed by china with 5.1 billion tons of co2 per year .
with four billion tons of co2 a year , the eu generates 14 percent of the 27 billion tons that escape into the atmosphere each year .
last month european leaders approved a climate change action plan that the 27-nation bloc hopes will become a model for international negotiations in copenhagen in december .
eu ready to put its money where its mouth is bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commission president barroso will lead the eu 's fight the european commission will on wednesday unveil a strategy for gradually ramping up investments aimed at tackling climate change to a target of 175 billion euros -lrb- $ 231 billion -rrb- per year by 2020 .
the overall eu goal is to prevent a global temperature increase of more than two degrees centigrade over pre-industrial levels .
to do so it will encourage developed nations to commit to cut their emissions by 30 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 .
the target for developing nations should be set at 15-30 percent , according to the eu 's executive arm , with " significantly increased financial resources " required , including help from richer nations .
among the sources of finance , the commission recommends making polluters pay for each ton of carbon dioxide that they emit , according to draft proposals .
eu leaders committed last month to a climate-energy package that would decrease the bloc 's greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 , make 20 percent energy savings and bring renewable energy sources up to 20 percent of total energy use . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

28 , that global warming might be more devastating than previously thought and stressed that any market system to slash emissions and make them more costly must include developing nations in the long run . the statements are part of a report drawn up by the commission which it hopes will replace the kyoto protocol to fight climate change which expires in 2012 . powers such as china and india , which are not members of the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , should join such a system no later than 2020 , the report says . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dimas has called for rich nations to help poorer ones tackle climate change the wealthy world should also offer developing countries substantial funding to help them cut their emissions , so that the world can reach a deal on fighting climate change at a conference in copenhagen in december , the european commission said as it set out its negotiating platform for the copenhagen talks . " without a credible financial package , it 's clear that there will be no deal in copenhagen : no money , no deal , " eu environment commissioner stavros dimas told journalists in brussels . green groups : proposals do n't go far enough but environmentalist groups criticized the proposals as too vague and under-funded , with greenpeace accusing the commission of backing down on a call for rich countries to offer poorer ones at least 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 40 billion -rrb- a year in climate aid by 2020 . the lack of specific funding targets shows that the eu is " unable to put its euros where its mouth is , " greenpeace said in a statement , while fellow-green group wwf said that the question of specific sums of funding would be the " make or break issue " in copenhagen . in 2005 , the eu set up a system capping the amount of greenhouse gases the bloc 's heavy industries could emit and allowing firms which reduced their emissions to sell the surplus emissions permits - the world 's first greenhouse gas emissions trading system -lrb- ets -rrb- . the commission proposal calls on all 30 oecd members - countries such as the united states , japan and south korea - to set up a similar ets by 2013 , and to allow permits to be traded between them by 2015 . rich states should help finance poorer ones major developing economies , meanwhile , should draw up national plans to tackle global warming before the copenhagen talks , and have their own ets ready to link into the oecd one by 2020 , the report says . that is becoming an " increasingly realistic " goal , as australia is currently setting up an ets , with new zealand and the us expected to follow suit , dimas said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's new tack on climate change has sparked relief in the eu the report by the european commission came just a day after new us president barack obama named todd stern as the country 's first-ever climate change envoy , confirming his plans to reverse the skeptical approach to the issue displayed by former president george w. bush . clean energy research the commission also proposed a number of measures aimed at enticing the world 's major economies , both developed and developing , into a binding global deal on fighting climate change at talks in copenhagen . they include calling on developed economies to pledge to cut their emissions to an average of 30 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 , and agree to a formula for setting binding country-specific targets based on each one 's current emissions , energy efficiency and population . the eu has already vowed to cut emissions to 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 , and to go to 30 percent if other developed economies accept a comparable cut . the eu 's proposals also call on rich states to set up a legally binding system for paying developing countries to fight climate change , either by agreeing rules and targets for bilateral aid or by sharing some of the revenue from the sale of emissions permits . it calls on countries to double investment in clean-energy research by 2013 and quadruple it by 2020 , and to raise spending on climate-change issues by 175 billion euros -lrb- $ 230 billion -rrb- a year by 2020 . in return , developing powers should curb their emissions growth so that they release between 15 and 30 percent less greenhouse gas in 2020 than they would do if they pursued their current policies . blueprint faces tough hurdles the commission also called for the tightening of a system which allows rich countries to gain credit for sponsoring emissions-reduction projects in poorer ones , making it harder to claim such credits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rich nations will no sponsor emissions-reduction projects in countries such as india , if the eu gets its way such projects would be limited to the poorest countries , cutting out rising powers such as china , india and brazil . eu officials say that the wealthiest developing countries are already richer than the bloc 's poorest members , such as bulgaria and romania , making it only fair for them to pay for their emissions . but the eu report will have to pass two tough political tests if it is to have any chance of global acceptance . first , it will have to be approved by the eu 's 27 member states , who are currently reeling under the impact of the global financial crisis , and who have little appetite for expensive new initiatives . they then have to win approval from all major world powers in copenhagen - a negotiation which promises to be anything but simple . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it was , to say the least , an impressive start to 2009 for the men in red . stuttgart came into the match feeling as though they had a legitimate chance for an upset since they were playing at home and had managed to split the points with bayern in the last league match before the winter break .
how wrong they were .
bayern pounced on their opponents right from the outset .
midfielder bastian schweinsteiger staked the visitors to the lead in the 14th minute with a well-placed shot past stuttgart keeper jens lehmann .
two minutes later it was 2-nil , with playmaker frank ribery creating havoc in stuttgart 's box and slotting home from close range .
bayern were awarded a penalty in minute 21 after a foul by luckless stuttgart defender arthur boka .
but ribery chipped the penalty straight into the arms of a waiting lehmann , who had anticipated the frenchman 's attempted trick .
no matter .
shortly before the break , bayern striker luca toni found the net from ten meters out to essentially put the game beyond reach .
any hopes fans might have had for a stuttgart fight-back in the second half were quickly dashed as bastian schweinsteiger scored a penalty in the 55th minute .

a contraction of two percent is expected in 2009 , even with massive fiscal stimulus packages planned by all rich countries . a recovery to 1.1 percent is possible in 2010 , the imf said , but only with drastic government intervention to help revive demand and stabilize financial institutions at the heart of the downturn . germany to contract 2.5 percent the united states will contract by 1.6 percent and germany - europe 's largest economy - by 2.5 per cent in 2009 .
japan , asia 's biggest economy , will contract 2.6 percent , the imf predicted . growth in emerging and developing countries will also slow dramatically in 2009 to 3.3 percent from 6.3 percent in 2008 . china 's economy will slow to 6.7 percent in 2009 from nine percent , india 's will drop to 5.1 percent and brazil 's growth will plummet a whopping four percentage points to 1.8 percent in 2009 . the imf 's predictions represented another sharp revision from its last forecast in november , a fact attributed to dramatic collapses in consumer and business confidence , plummeting global trade and demand , frozen credit markets and even greater losses for financial institutions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international monetary fund 's chief economist olivier blanchard " we expect the global economy to come to a virtual standstill in 2009 , " olivier blanchard , the imf 's chief economist , told reporters . in its november update , the imf had forecast 2.2 percent global growth for 2009 , a contraction of 0.3 percent in advanced economies and 5.1 percent growth in developing countries .
world growth below three percent is considered a global recession . global trade volumes are also expected to collapse in 2009 , contracting 2.8 percent after growth of 4.1 percent the year before .
in november , the imf still predicted a 2.1 percent increase in trade for this year . deflation becoming a serious risk at the same time , the imf warned that deflation was now becoming a serious risk for some wealthy nations .
consumer prices were expected to rise by only 0.3 percent in industrial nations in 2009 and 0.8 percent in 2010 . the global downturn continues to be driven by the debilitating financial crisis which began with a collapse in the us housing market but has since spread to all corners of the globe . financial firms are now projected to lose a total of $ 2.2 trillion before the crisis is over - about $ 500 billion more than banks currently have in their reserves - and will require more government aid . the imf also expects the world 's 20 largest economies to spend at least 1.5 percent of their gross domestic product on massive fiscal stimulus packages .
the us is currently mulling an $ 825 billion package worth some five percent of gdp . such government spending is crucial to reviving consumer demand , but would only provide a relatively short-term boost to economies : stabilizing the financial system is the key in the long run . " restoring financial health is a necessary condition for durable economic recovery , " blanchard said , adding that governments needed to take more " aggressive " measures to stem the collapse of financial firms . prescription for recovery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : banks have cut back on lending , stalling economies banks ' need for cash has stopped them from lending to each other and to consumers .
developing countries have seen foreign investments in their economies dry up as a result . governments , especially the us , must inject more capital into banks to keep them afloat , but should also take the damaged mortgage-related assets off their balance sheets in order to promote a long-term recovery , the imf said . the price of commodities like oil , food and metals has also plummeted in the last few months due to falling demand , putting even more pressure on some poorer countries dependent on their exports of natural resources . dpa news agency -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

midfielder bastian schweinsteiger staked the visitors to the lead in the 14th minute with a well-placed shot past stuttgart keeper jens lehmann .
two minutes later it was 2-nil , with playmaker frank ribery creating havoc in stuttgart 's box and slotting home from close range .

but ribery chipped the penalty straight into the arms of a waiting lehmann , who had anticipated the frenchman 's attempted trick .

shortly before the break , bayern striker luca toni found the net from ten meters out to essentially put the game beyond reach .
any hopes fans might have had for a stuttgart fight-back in the second half were quickly dashed as bastian schweinsteiger scored a penalty in the 55th minute .

the four men ran the society of saint pius x -lrb- sspx -rrb- , an ultra-traditionalist catholic group that broke with rome over reforms introduced in the 1960s through the second vatican council . williamson 's rehabilitation has provoked a storm of outrage because he denies the existence of the nazi gas chambers and claims that " only 200,000 to 300,000 " jews died in concentration camps instead of some six million . such denial of the holocaust is both " inhuman " and " sacrilegious , " mueller said . the diocese released its response a day after a holocaust memorial service in regensburg , which is also the home base of pope benedict . aides : ban is more symbolic aides conceded that mueller 's ban was more symbolic than disciplinary , since mueller has no control over the sspx or its training center at zaitzkofen , near regensburg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british bishop richard williamson public prosecutors have opened an inquiry against williamson over his denial of the holocaust during an interview recorded with swedish television last week at zaitzkofen .

in rome , pope benedict xvi expressed " solidarity " wednesday with the jewish people and said the reality of the holocaust can not be cancelled through any form of denial . on wednesday , the israeli chief rabbi officially broke off ties with the vatican in protest at the decision to lift the excommunication on williamson . the sspx publicly dissociated itself on tuesday from williamson . historical research using population data suggests between 5 million and 6 million european jews were killed by privation and violence during world war ii .

how does it affect your business and how do you see it go forward ? dell is a company with an exceptionally strong balance sheet and so it gives us an opportunity to use that really as a weapon to consolidate the industry and grow by acquisitions .
so we are acquiring a few companies , but also make sure that we retain that strength that we have and that we continue to serve our customers really really well during this challenging time . coming from europe , how does europe fare right now compared to other regions of the world like the u.s. or asia ? i ’ d say europe has held up pretty well , comparatively speaking .
some of the new europe hasn ’ t held up quite as well as the old europe , if i can say that .
but i ’ d say it has held up pretty well . i have to ask you a question about president obama , who has been in office now for less than two weeks .
he took some pretty big steps right from the start .
how do you rate him so far in his first days with the new administration ? i think it provides a lot of encouragement and hope to americans and maybe around the world .
it ’ s a bit early to give a lot of ratings . what do you expect from his economic team which has been called a dream team ?
tim geithner has now also been confirmed . i know larry summers .
i think they are talented individuals , a good team . america ’ s image in the world has suffered so much in the last years and the expectations for obama are really high .
do you think america ’ s image can go up again with new administration ? well , it seems like it would be fairly easy to improve .
i think brand america has already improved based on the obama election .
now the administration and the country have to deliver . if you could have one wish for obama , one thing you would really like him to do , what would that be ? well , i see him next week and i ’ ll tell him . michael knigge interviewed michael dell -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

24 , following their excommunication in 1988 .
the four men ran the society of saint pius x -lrb- sspx -rrb- , an ultra-traditionalist catholic group that broke with rome over reforms introduced in the 1960s through the second vatican council . williamson 's rehabilitation has provoked a storm of outrage because he denies the existence of the nazi gas chambers and claims that " only 200,000 to 300,000 " jews died in concentration camps instead of some six million . such denial of the holocaust is both " inhuman " and " sacrilegious , " mueller said . the diocese released its response a day after a holocaust memorial service in regensburg , which is also the home base of pope benedict . aides : ban is more symbolic aides conceded that mueller 's ban was more symbolic than disciplinary , since mueller has no control over the sspx or its training center at zaitzkofen , near regensburg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british bishop richard williamson public prosecutors have opened an inquiry against williamson over his denial of the holocaust during an interview recorded with swedish television last week at zaitzkofen .
holocaust denial is a crime in germany . the german conference of catholic bishops has also rejected williamson 's remarks .
in rome , pope benedict xvi expressed " solidarity " wednesday with the jewish people and said the reality of the holocaust can not be cancelled through any form of denial . on wednesday , the israeli chief rabbi officially broke off ties with the vatican in protest at the decision to lift the excommunication on williamson . the sspx publicly dissociated itself on tuesday from williamson . historical research using population data suggests between 5 million and 6 million european jews were killed by privation and violence during world war ii .

28 , that global warming might be more devastating than previously thought and stressed that any market system to slash emissions and make them more costly must include developing nations in the long run . the statements are part of a report drawn up by the commission which it hopes will replace the kyoto protocol to fight climate change which expires in 2012 . powers such as china and india , which are not members of the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , should join such a system no later than 2020 , the report says . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dimas has called for rich nations to help poorer ones tackle climate change the wealthy world should also offer developing countries substantial funding to help them cut their emissions , so that the world can reach a deal on fighting climate change at a conference in copenhagen in december , the european commission said as it set out its negotiating platform for the copenhagen talks . " without a credible financial package , it 's clear that there will be no deal in copenhagen : no money , no deal , " eu environment commissioner stavros dimas told journalists in brussels . green groups : proposals do n't go far enough but environmentalist groups criticized the proposals as too vague and under-funded , with greenpeace accusing the commission of backing down on a call for rich countries to offer poorer ones at least 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 40 billion -rrb- a year in climate aid by 2020 . the lack of specific funding targets shows that the eu is " unable to put its euros where its mouth is , " greenpeace said in a statement , while fellow-green group wwf said that the question of specific sums of funding would be the " make or break issue " in copenhagen . in 2005 , the eu set up a system capping the amount of greenhouse gases the bloc 's heavy industries could emit and allowing firms which reduced their emissions to sell the surplus emissions permits - the world 's first greenhouse gas emissions trading system -lrb- ets -rrb- . the commission proposal calls on all 30 oecd members - countries such as the united states , japan and south korea - to set up a similar ets by 2013 , and to allow permits to be traded between them by 2015 . rich states should help finance poorer ones major developing economies , meanwhile , should draw up national plans to tackle global warming before the copenhagen talks , and have their own ets ready to link into the oecd one by 2020 , the report says . that is becoming an " increasingly realistic " goal , as australia is currently setting up an ets , with new zealand and the us expected to follow suit , dimas said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's new tack on climate change has sparked relief in the eu the report by the european commission came just a day after new us president barack obama named todd stern as the country 's first-ever climate change envoy , confirming his plans to reverse the skeptical approach to the issue displayed by former president george w. bush . clean energy research the commission also proposed a number of measures aimed at enticing the world 's major economies , both developed and developing , into a binding global deal on fighting climate change at talks in copenhagen . they include calling on developed economies to pledge to cut their emissions to an average of 30 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 , and agree to a formula for setting binding country-specific targets based on each one 's current emissions , energy efficiency and population . the eu has already vowed to cut emissions to 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 , and to go to 30 percent if other developed economies accept a comparable cut . the eu 's proposals also call on rich states to set up a legally binding system for paying developing countries to fight climate change , either by agreeing rules and targets for bilateral aid or by sharing some of the revenue from the sale of emissions permits . it calls on countries to double investment in clean-energy research by 2013 and quadruple it by 2020 , and to raise spending on climate-change issues by 175 billion euros -lrb- $ 230 billion -rrb- a year by 2020 . in return , developing powers should curb their emissions growth so that they release between 15 and 30 percent less greenhouse gas in 2020 than they would do if they pursued their current policies . blueprint faces tough hurdles the commission also called for the tightening of a system which allows rich countries to gain credit for sponsoring emissions-reduction projects in poorer ones , making it harder to claim such credits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rich nations will no sponsor emissions-reduction projects in countries such as india , if the eu gets its way such projects would be limited to the poorest countries , cutting out rising powers such as china , india and brazil . eu officials say that the wealthiest developing countries are already richer than the bloc 's poorest members , such as bulgaria and romania , making it only fair for them to pay for their emissions . but the eu report will have to pass two tough political tests if it is to have any chance of global acceptance . first , it will have to be approved by the eu 's 27 member states , who are currently reeling under the impact of the global financial crisis , and who have little appetite for expensive new initiatives . they then have to win approval from all major world powers in copenhagen - a negotiation which promises to be anything but simple . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche welle 's michael knigge caught up with him at the conference . dw-world.de : what do you expect from this world economic forum ? michael dell : we have all come here with great interest to hear what the central bankers have to say , what other world leaders have to say about the financial situation and how the major economies of the world navigate out of the current crisis . do you feel that this year ’ s world economic forum is special in a way from all the other economic forums ? i think i had that question every time i came so yes , everyone is special . let ’ s talk about the global economic crisis .
how does it affect your business and how do you see it go forward ? dell is a company with an exceptionally strong balance sheet and so it gives us an opportunity to use that really as a weapon to consolidate the industry and grow by acquisitions .
so we are acquiring a few companies , but also make sure that we retain that strength that we have and that we continue to serve our customers really really well during this challenging time . coming from europe , how does europe fare right now compared to other regions of the world like the u.s. or asia ? i ’ d say europe has held up pretty well , comparatively speaking .
some of the new europe hasn ’ t held up quite as well as the old europe , if i can say that .
but i ’ d say it has held up pretty well . i have to ask you a question about president obama , who has been in office now for less than two weeks .
he took some pretty big steps right from the start .
how do you rate him so far in his first days with the new administration ? i think it provides a lot of encouragement and hope to americans and maybe around the world .
it ’ s a bit early to give a lot of ratings . what do you expect from his economic team which has been called a dream team ?
tim geithner has now also been confirmed . i know larry summers .
i think they are talented individuals , a good team . america ’ s image in the world has suffered so much in the last years and the expectations for obama are really high .

it was , to say the least , an impressive start to 2009 for the men in red . stuttgart came into the match feeling as though they had a legitimate chance for an upset since they were playing at home and had managed to split the points with bayern in the last league match before the winter break .
how wrong they were .
bayern pounced on their opponents right from the outset .
midfielder bastian schweinsteiger staked the visitors to the lead in the 14th minute with a well-placed shot past stuttgart keeper jens lehmann .
two minutes later it was 2-nil , with playmaker frank ribery creating havoc in stuttgart 's box and slotting home from close range .
bayern were awarded a penalty in minute 21 after a foul by luckless stuttgart defender arthur boka .
but ribery chipped the penalty straight into the arms of a waiting lehmann , who had anticipated the frenchman 's attempted trick .
no matter .
shortly before the break , bayern striker luca toni found the net from ten meters out to essentially put the game beyond reach .
any hopes fans might have had for a stuttgart fight-back in the second half were quickly dashed as bastian schweinsteiger scored a penalty in the 55th minute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hosts utterly failed to measure up to munich ze roberto struck four minutes later to end the scoring for bayern , while stuttgart 's mario gomez picked up a late consolation goal that hardly deserved the appellation .
indeed , if the match is any indication of the form and sense of purpose with which bayern intend to begin the second half of the league season , bundesliga rivals have every reason to be afraid .
very afraid .

24 , following their excommunication in 1988 .
the four men ran the society of saint pius x -lrb- sspx -rrb- , an ultra-traditionalist catholic group that broke with rome over reforms introduced in the 1960s through the second vatican council . williamson 's rehabilitation has provoked a storm of outrage because he denies the existence of the nazi gas chambers and claims that " only 200,000 to 300,000 " jews died in concentration camps instead of some six million . such denial of the holocaust is both " inhuman " and " sacrilegious , " mueller said . the diocese released its response a day after a holocaust memorial service in regensburg , which is also the home base of pope benedict . aides : ban is more symbolic aides conceded that mueller 's ban was more symbolic than disciplinary , since mueller has no control over the sspx or its training center at zaitzkofen , near regensburg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british bishop richard williamson public prosecutors have opened an inquiry against williamson over his denial of the holocaust during an interview recorded with swedish television last week at zaitzkofen .

" without a credible financial package , it 's clear that there will be no deal in copenhagen : no money , no deal , " eu environment commissioner stavros dimas told journalists in brussels . green groups : proposals do n't go far enough but environmentalist groups criticized the proposals as too vague and under-funded , with greenpeace accusing the commission of backing down on a call for rich countries to offer poorer ones at least 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 40 billion -rrb- a year in climate aid by 2020 . the lack of specific funding targets shows that the eu is " unable to put its euros where its mouth is , " greenpeace said in a statement , while fellow-green group wwf said that the question of specific sums of funding would be the " make or break issue " in copenhagen . in 2005 , the eu set up a system capping the amount of greenhouse gases the bloc 's heavy industries could emit and allowing firms which reduced their emissions to sell the surplus emissions permits - the world 's first greenhouse gas emissions trading system -lrb- ets -rrb- . the commission proposal calls on all 30 oecd members - countries such as the united states , japan and south korea - to set up a similar ets by 2013 , and to allow permits to be traded between them by 2015 . rich states should help finance poorer ones major developing economies , meanwhile , should draw up national plans to tackle global warming before the copenhagen talks , and have their own ets ready to link into the oecd one by 2020 , the report says . that is becoming an " increasingly realistic " goal , as australia is currently setting up an ets , with new zealand and the us expected to follow suit , dimas said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's new tack on climate change has sparked relief in the eu the report by the european commission came just a day after new us president barack obama named todd stern as the country 's first-ever climate change envoy , confirming his plans to reverse the skeptical approach to the issue displayed by former president george w. bush . clean energy research the commission also proposed a number of measures aimed at enticing the world 's major economies , both developed and developing , into a binding global deal on fighting climate change at talks in copenhagen . they include calling on developed economies to pledge to cut their emissions to an average of 30 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 , and agree to a formula for setting binding country-specific targets based on each one 's current emissions , energy efficiency and population . the eu has already vowed to cut emissions to 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 , and to go to 30 percent if other developed economies accept a comparable cut . the eu 's proposals also call on rich states to set up a legally binding system for paying developing countries to fight climate change , either by agreeing rules and targets for bilateral aid or by sharing some of the revenue from the sale of emissions permits . it calls on countries to double investment in clean-energy research by 2013 and quadruple it by 2020 , and to raise spending on climate-change issues by 175 billion euros -lrb- $ 230 billion -rrb- a year by 2020 . in return , developing powers should curb their emissions growth so that they release between 15 and 30 percent less greenhouse gas in 2020 than they would do if they pursued their current policies . blueprint faces tough hurdles the commission also called for the tightening of a system which allows rich countries to gain credit for sponsoring emissions-reduction projects in poorer ones , making it harder to claim such credits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rich nations will no sponsor emissions-reduction projects in countries such as india , if the eu gets its way such projects would be limited to the poorest countries , cutting out rising powers such as china , india and brazil . eu officials say that the wealthiest developing countries are already richer than the bloc 's poorest members , such as bulgaria and romania , making it only fair for them to pay for their emissions . but the eu report will have to pass two tough political tests if it is to have any chance of global acceptance . first , it will have to be approved by the eu 's 27 member states , who are currently reeling under the impact of the global financial crisis , and who have little appetite for expensive new initiatives . they then have to win approval from all major world powers in copenhagen - a negotiation which promises to be anything but simple . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 28.01.2009 imf : world suffering worst downturn in postwar era großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german economy is expected to shrink by 2.5 percent the world economy will grow by only 0.5 percent in 2009 , the worst rate since world war two , as industrial nations battle a recession that is dragging developing countries down with them , the imf said wednesday , jan .
28 . wealthy nations will experience their worst recession in the post-war period as a financial crisis continues to spread throughout their economies , the international monetary fund said as it slashed its global economic forecasts .
a contraction of two percent is expected in 2009 , even with massive fiscal stimulus packages planned by all rich countries . a recovery to 1.1 percent is possible in 2010 , the imf said , but only with drastic government intervention to help revive demand and stabilize financial institutions at the heart of the downturn . germany to contract 2.5 percent the united states will contract by 1.6 percent and germany - europe 's largest economy - by 2.5 per cent in 2009 .
japan , asia 's biggest economy , will contract 2.6 percent , the imf predicted . growth in emerging and developing countries will also slow dramatically in 2009 to 3.3 percent from 6.3 percent in 2008 . china 's economy will slow to 6.7 percent in 2009 from nine percent , india 's will drop to 5.1 percent and brazil 's growth will plummet a whopping four percentage points to 1.8 percent in 2009 . the imf 's predictions represented another sharp revision from its last forecast in november , a fact attributed to dramatic collapses in consumer and business confidence , plummeting global trade and demand , frozen credit markets and even greater losses for financial institutions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international monetary fund 's chief economist olivier blanchard " we expect the global economy to come to a virtual standstill in 2009 , " olivier blanchard , the imf 's chief economist , told reporters . in its november update , the imf had forecast 2.2 percent global growth for 2009 , a contraction of 0.3 percent in advanced economies and 5.1 percent growth in developing countries .
world growth below three percent is considered a global recession . global trade volumes are also expected to collapse in 2009 , contracting 2.8 percent after growth of 4.1 percent the year before .
in november , the imf still predicted a 2.1 percent increase in trade for this year . deflation becoming a serious risk at the same time , the imf warned that deflation was now becoming a serious risk for some wealthy nations .
consumer prices were expected to rise by only 0.3 percent in industrial nations in 2009 and 0.8 percent in 2010 . the global downturn continues to be driven by the debilitating financial crisis which began with a collapse in the us housing market but has since spread to all corners of the globe . financial firms are now projected to lose a total of $ 2.2 trillion before the crisis is over - about $ 500 billion more than banks currently have in their reserves - and will require more government aid . the imf also expects the world 's 20 largest economies to spend at least 1.5 percent of their gross domestic product on massive fiscal stimulus packages .
the us is currently mulling an $ 825 billion package worth some five percent of gdp . such government spending is crucial to reviving consumer demand , but would only provide a relatively short-term boost to economies : stabilizing the financial system is the key in the long run . " restoring financial health is a necessary condition for durable economic recovery , " blanchard said , adding that governments needed to take more " aggressive " measures to stem the collapse of financial firms . prescription for recovery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : banks have cut back on lending , stalling economies banks ' need for cash has stopped them from lending to each other and to consumers .
developing countries have seen foreign investments in their economies dry up as a result . governments , especially the us , must inject more capital into banks to keep them afloat , but should also take the damaged mortgage-related assets off their balance sheets in order to promote a long-term recovery , the imf said . the price of commodities like oil , food and metals has also plummeted in the last few months due to falling demand , putting even more pressure on some poorer countries dependent on their exports of natural resources . dpa news agency -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

28 . wealthy nations will experience their worst recession in the post-war period as a financial crisis continues to spread throughout their economies , the international monetary fund said as it slashed its global economic forecasts .
a contraction of two percent is expected in 2009 , even with massive fiscal stimulus packages planned by all rich countries . a recovery to 1.1 percent is possible in 2010 , the imf said , but only with drastic government intervention to help revive demand and stabilize financial institutions at the heart of the downturn . germany to contract 2.5 percent the united states will contract by 1.6 percent and germany - europe 's largest economy - by 2.5 per cent in 2009 .
japan , asia 's biggest economy , will contract 2.6 percent , the imf predicted . growth in emerging and developing countries will also slow dramatically in 2009 to 3.3 percent from 6.3 percent in 2008 . china 's economy will slow to 6.7 percent in 2009 from nine percent , india 's will drop to 5.1 percent and brazil 's growth will plummet a whopping four percentage points to 1.8 percent in 2009 . the imf 's predictions represented another sharp revision from its last forecast in november , a fact attributed to dramatic collapses in consumer and business confidence , plummeting global trade and demand , frozen credit markets and even greater losses for financial institutions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international monetary fund 's chief economist olivier blanchard " we expect the global economy to come to a virtual standstill in 2009 , " olivier blanchard , the imf 's chief economist , told reporters . in its november update , the imf had forecast 2.2 percent global growth for 2009 , a contraction of 0.3 percent in advanced economies and 5.1 percent growth in developing countries .
world growth below three percent is considered a global recession . global trade volumes are also expected to collapse in 2009 , contracting 2.8 percent after growth of 4.1 percent the year before .
in november , the imf still predicted a 2.1 percent increase in trade for this year . deflation becoming a serious risk at the same time , the imf warned that deflation was now becoming a serious risk for some wealthy nations .
consumer prices were expected to rise by only 0.3 percent in industrial nations in 2009 and 0.8 percent in 2010 . the global downturn continues to be driven by the debilitating financial crisis which began with a collapse in the us housing market but has since spread to all corners of the globe . financial firms are now projected to lose a total of $ 2.2 trillion before the crisis is over - about $ 500 billion more than banks currently have in their reserves - and will require more government aid . the imf also expects the world 's 20 largest economies to spend at least 1.5 percent of their gross domestic product on massive fiscal stimulus packages .
the us is currently mulling an $ 825 billion package worth some five percent of gdp . such government spending is crucial to reviving consumer demand , but would only provide a relatively short-term boost to economies : stabilizing the financial system is the key in the long run . " restoring financial health is a necessary condition for durable economic recovery , " blanchard said , adding that governments needed to take more " aggressive " measures to stem the collapse of financial firms . prescription for recovery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : banks have cut back on lending , stalling economies banks ' need for cash has stopped them from lending to each other and to consumers .
developing countries have seen foreign investments in their economies dry up as a result . governments , especially the us , must inject more capital into banks to keep them afloat , but should also take the damaged mortgage-related assets off their balance sheets in order to promote a long-term recovery , the imf said . the price of commodities like oil , food and metals has also plummeted in the last few months due to falling demand , putting even more pressure on some poorer countries dependent on their exports of natural resources . dpa news agency -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it was , to say the least , an impressive start to 2009 for the men in red . stuttgart came into the match feeling as though they had a legitimate chance for an upset since they were playing at home and had managed to split the points with bayern in the last league match before the winter break .
how wrong they were .
bayern pounced on their opponents right from the outset .
midfielder bastian schweinsteiger staked the visitors to the lead in the 14th minute with a well-placed shot past stuttgart keeper jens lehmann .
two minutes later it was 2-nil , with playmaker frank ribery creating havoc in stuttgart 's box and slotting home from close range .
bayern were awarded a penalty in minute 21 after a foul by luckless stuttgart defender arthur boka .
but ribery chipped the penalty straight into the arms of a waiting lehmann , who had anticipated the frenchman 's attempted trick .
no matter .
shortly before the break , bayern striker luca toni found the net from ten meters out to essentially put the game beyond reach .
any hopes fans might have had for a stuttgart fight-back in the second half were quickly dashed as bastian schweinsteiger scored a penalty in the 55th minute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hosts utterly failed to measure up to munich ze roberto struck four minutes later to end the scoring for bayern , while stuttgart 's mario gomez picked up a late consolation goal that hardly deserved the appellation .
indeed , if the match is any indication of the form and sense of purpose with which bayern intend to begin the second half of the league season , bundesliga rivals have every reason to be afraid .
very afraid .

24 , following their excommunication in 1988 .
the four men ran the society of saint pius x -lrb- sspx -rrb- , an ultra-traditionalist catholic group that broke with rome over reforms introduced in the 1960s through the second vatican council . williamson 's rehabilitation has provoked a storm of outrage because he denies the existence of the nazi gas chambers and claims that " only 200,000 to 300,000 " jews died in concentration camps instead of some six million . such denial of the holocaust is both " inhuman " and " sacrilegious , " mueller said . the diocese released its response a day after a holocaust memorial service in regensburg , which is also the home base of pope benedict . aides : ban is more symbolic aides conceded that mueller 's ban was more symbolic than disciplinary , since mueller has no control over the sspx or its training center at zaitzkofen , near regensburg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british bishop richard williamson public prosecutors have opened an inquiry against williamson over his denial of the holocaust during an interview recorded with swedish television last week at zaitzkofen .
holocaust denial is a crime in germany . the german conference of catholic bishops has also rejected williamson 's remarks .
in rome , pope benedict xvi expressed " solidarity " wednesday with the jewish people and said the reality of the holocaust can not be cancelled through any form of denial . on wednesday , the israeli chief rabbi officially broke off ties with the vatican in protest at the decision to lift the excommunication on williamson . the sspx publicly dissociated itself on tuesday from williamson . historical research using population data suggests between 5 million and 6 million european jews were killed by privation and violence during world war ii .

it was , to say the least , an impressive start to 2009 for the men in red . stuttgart came into the match feeling as though they had a legitimate chance for an upset since they were playing at home and had managed to split the points with bayern in the last league match before the winter break .
how wrong they were .
bayern pounced on their opponents right from the outset .
midfielder bastian schweinsteiger staked the visitors to the lead in the 14th minute with a well-placed shot past stuttgart keeper jens lehmann .
two minutes later it was 2-nil , with playmaker frank ribery creating havoc in stuttgart 's box and slotting home from close range .
bayern were awarded a penalty in minute 21 after a foul by luckless stuttgart defender arthur boka .
but ribery chipped the penalty straight into the arms of a waiting lehmann , who had anticipated the frenchman 's attempted trick .
no matter .
shortly before the break , bayern striker luca toni found the net from ten meters out to essentially put the game beyond reach .
any hopes fans might have had for a stuttgart fight-back in the second half were quickly dashed as bastian schweinsteiger scored a penalty in the 55th minute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hosts utterly failed to measure up to munich ze roberto struck four minutes later to end the scoring for bayern , while stuttgart 's mario gomez picked up a late consolation goal that hardly deserved the appellation .
indeed , if the match is any indication of the form and sense of purpose with which bayern intend to begin the second half of the league season , bundesliga rivals have every reason to be afraid .
very afraid .

24 , following their excommunication in 1988 .
the four men ran the society of saint pius x -lrb- sspx -rrb- , an ultra-traditionalist catholic group that broke with rome over reforms introduced in the 1960s through the second vatican council . williamson 's rehabilitation has provoked a storm of outrage because he denies the existence of the nazi gas chambers and claims that " only 200,000 to 300,000 " jews died in concentration camps instead of some six million . such denial of the holocaust is both " inhuman " and " sacrilegious , " mueller said . the diocese released its response a day after a holocaust memorial service in regensburg , which is also the home base of pope benedict . aides : ban is more symbolic aides conceded that mueller 's ban was more symbolic than disciplinary , since mueller has no control over the sspx or its training center at zaitzkofen , near regensburg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british bishop richard williamson public prosecutors have opened an inquiry against williamson over his denial of the holocaust during an interview recorded with swedish television last week at zaitzkofen .
holocaust denial is a crime in germany . the german conference of catholic bishops has also rejected williamson 's remarks .
in rome , pope benedict xvi expressed " solidarity " wednesday with the jewish people and said the reality of the holocaust can not be cancelled through any form of denial . on wednesday , the israeli chief rabbi officially broke off ties with the vatican in protest at the decision to lift the excommunication on williamson . the sspx publicly dissociated itself on tuesday from williamson . historical research using population data suggests between 5 million and 6 million european jews were killed by privation and violence during world war ii .

the four men ran the society of saint pius x -lrb- sspx -rrb- , an ultra-traditionalist catholic group that broke with rome over reforms introduced in the 1960s through the second vatican council . williamson 's rehabilitation has provoked a storm of outrage because he denies the existence of the nazi gas chambers and claims that " only 200,000 to 300,000 " jews died in concentration camps instead of some six million . such denial of the holocaust is both " inhuman " and " sacrilegious , " mueller said . the diocese released its response a day after a holocaust memorial service in regensburg , which is also the home base of pope benedict . aides : ban is more symbolic aides conceded that mueller 's ban was more symbolic than disciplinary , since mueller has no control over the sspx or its training center at zaitzkofen , near regensburg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british bishop richard williamson public prosecutors have opened an inquiry against williamson over his denial of the holocaust during an interview recorded with swedish television last week at zaitzkofen .

" the realization of these plans has been suspended in connection with the fact that that the new us administration is not forging ahead with plans to deploy us missile defense elements in poland and the czech republic , " he said . obama spoke with russian president dmitry medvedev by telephone on monday , and the two men agreed to stop the " drift " in their countries ' relations , the white house said on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president dmitry medvedev spoke with new us president barack obama earlier this week medvedev had said in november that he was ordering the deployment of the iskander missiles systems to russia 's european exclave of kaliningrad in response to a proposed us missile shield in europe . under the bush administration , washington said the defense shield was needed to protect against strikes from rogue states such as iran , but moscow viewed the planned bases in eastern europe as a threat to its deterrent . ties suffered during bush era while former us president george w. bush was in office , disagreement over the shield and a host of other security issues caused russia 's diplomatic ties with the us to fall to their most sensitive level since the cold war . but russian officials have voiced hope of better relations with obama 's team . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's announcement is being seen as an olive branch to the new administration in washington " we are ready for any succession of events , but we hope that there will be a window of opportunity to restart our relations , " russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said in televised comments on wednesday . " statements by representatives of the new us administration allow to us to hope that they will be more ready to engage in joint analytical work , in contrast with the previous administration , " he said . ahead of obama 's inauguration , a nominee for a top pentagon post said that the missile defense shield would be reviewed along with other policy matters . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

28 . wealthy nations will experience their worst recession in the post-war period as a financial crisis continues to spread throughout their economies , the international monetary fund said as it slashed its global economic forecasts .
a contraction of two percent is expected in 2009 , even with massive fiscal stimulus packages planned by all rich countries . a recovery to 1.1 percent is possible in 2010 , the imf said , but only with drastic government intervention to help revive demand and stabilize financial institutions at the heart of the downturn . germany to contract 2.5 percent the united states will contract by 1.6 percent and germany - europe 's largest economy - by 2.5 per cent in 2009 .
japan , asia 's biggest economy , will contract 2.6 percent , the imf predicted . growth in emerging and developing countries will also slow dramatically in 2009 to 3.3 percent from 6.3 percent in 2008 . china 's economy will slow to 6.7 percent in 2009 from nine percent , india 's will drop to 5.1 percent and brazil 's growth will plummet a whopping four percentage points to 1.8 percent in 2009 . the imf 's predictions represented another sharp revision from its last forecast in november , a fact attributed to dramatic collapses in consumer and business confidence , plummeting global trade and demand , frozen credit markets and even greater losses for financial institutions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international monetary fund 's chief economist olivier blanchard " we expect the global economy to come to a virtual standstill in 2009 , " olivier blanchard , the imf 's chief economist , told reporters . in its november update , the imf had forecast 2.2 percent global growth for 2009 , a contraction of 0.3 percent in advanced economies and 5.1 percent growth in developing countries .

the us is currently mulling an $ 825 billion package worth some five percent of gdp . such government spending is crucial to reviving consumer demand , but would only provide a relatively short-term boost to economies : stabilizing the financial system is the key in the long run .

in the video , which features details of dead children and injured people , six men threaten violence against germany .
" we have a few surprise packages prepared this year , " the men reportedly say .

" where is the us ?
where is mrs. merkel and her cabinet ? "

28 . wealthy nations will experience their worst recession in the post-war period as a financial crisis continues to spread throughout their economies , the international monetary fund said as it slashed its global economic forecasts .
a contraction of two percent is expected in 2009 , even with massive fiscal stimulus packages planned by all rich countries . a recovery to 1.1 percent is possible in 2010 , the imf said , but only with drastic government intervention to help revive demand and stabilize financial institutions at the heart of the downturn . germany to contract 2.5 percent the united states will contract by 1.6 percent and germany - europe 's largest economy - by 2.5 per cent in 2009 .
japan , asia 's biggest economy , will contract 2.6 percent , the imf predicted . growth in emerging and developing countries will also slow dramatically in 2009 to 3.3 percent from 6.3 percent in 2008 . china 's economy will slow to 6.7 percent in 2009 from nine percent , india 's will drop to 5.1 percent and brazil 's growth will plummet a whopping four percentage points to 1.8 percent in 2009 . the imf 's predictions represented another sharp revision from its last forecast in november , a fact attributed to dramatic collapses in consumer and business confidence , plummeting global trade and demand , frozen credit markets and even greater losses for financial institutions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international monetary fund 's chief economist olivier blanchard " we expect the global economy to come to a virtual standstill in 2009 , " olivier blanchard , the imf 's chief economist , told reporters . in its november update , the imf had forecast 2.2 percent global growth for 2009 , a contraction of 0.3 percent in advanced economies and 5.1 percent growth in developing countries .
world growth below three percent is considered a global recession . global trade volumes are also expected to collapse in 2009 , contracting 2.8 percent after growth of 4.1 percent the year before .
in november , the imf still predicted a 2.1 percent increase in trade for this year . deflation becoming a serious risk at the same time , the imf warned that deflation was now becoming a serious risk for some wealthy nations .
consumer prices were expected to rise by only 0.3 percent in industrial nations in 2009 and 0.8 percent in 2010 . the global downturn continues to be driven by the debilitating financial crisis which began with a collapse in the us housing market but has since spread to all corners of the globe . financial firms are now projected to lose a total of $ 2.2 trillion before the crisis is over - about $ 500 billion more than banks currently have in their reserves - and will require more government aid . the imf also expects the world 's 20 largest economies to spend at least 1.5 percent of their gross domestic product on massive fiscal stimulus packages .
the us is currently mulling an $ 825 billion package worth some five percent of gdp . such government spending is crucial to reviving consumer demand , but would only provide a relatively short-term boost to economies : stabilizing the financial system is the key in the long run . " restoring financial health is a necessary condition for durable economic recovery , " blanchard said , adding that governments needed to take more " aggressive " measures to stem the collapse of financial firms . prescription for recovery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : banks have cut back on lending , stalling economies banks ' need for cash has stopped them from lending to each other and to consumers .
developing countries have seen foreign investments in their economies dry up as a result . governments , especially the us , must inject more capital into banks to keep them afloat , but should also take the damaged mortgage-related assets off their balance sheets in order to promote a long-term recovery , the imf said . the price of commodities like oil , food and metals has also plummeted in the last few months due to falling demand , putting even more pressure on some poorer countries dependent on their exports of natural resources . dpa news agency -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

28 , commemorating the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall on november 9 , 1989 . at a gathering at berlin 's landmark potsdamer platz , the city 's senate representative richard meng said 2009 is a " year of remembrance , " as well as a " year of respect for the people who contributed to the peaceful fall of the wall . " throughout the year , exhibitions , talks and guided walks will remind people of the huge changes berlin has undergone . the highlight of the year will be a weekend of celebrations and a huge series of domino stones , set to topple on november 9 , symbolically marking the sequence of events that brought an end to communism . " in berlin , germany grew together more than anywhere else , " meng said , adding that it 's time to " show and describe the change which has occurred everywhere in berlin . " from thursday , a red information booth at potsdamer platz highlights the city 's transformation since 1989 . the booth has a flight of stairs , granting a panoramic view of the square which was redeveloped in glass and steel with the aim of helping it regain the central role it played before the city was divided . travelling display traces history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wall divided berlin from 1961 to 1989 an interactive display , replicated in a mobile box travelling the city , reveals pictures of berlin 's changing face over the course of the last 20 years . as the infobox visits 15 historically significant locations across berlin , a large helium-filled arrow will float above it , pointing to the sites from a height of 100 meters . these booths are needed , city officials said , in part because very little is left of the original berlin wall .
tourists and locals alike are baffled by the fact that it 's now difficult to see the former division between east and west . berlin 's mayor , klaus wowereit , said there was an urge to remove all traces of the city 's division after 1989 .
" we were in a euphoric mood , " he told berlin 's rbb inforadio on wednesday . " nobody wanted to bear this wall any longer , this wall of disgrace that divided the city , that brought so much distress to the city , to the families , to the individuals affected . " despite the posters , maps and interactive displays , it 's difficult to transmit " the horror of the wall , this system of terror with its mines , its dogs and the orders to shoot , " the mayor said . wowereit added that , in retrospect , maybe the wall was removed too hastily .
" maybe more should have been left standing as an example , " he said . dpa news agency -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche welle 's michael knigge caught up with him at the conference . dw-world.de : what do you expect from this world economic forum ? michael dell : we have all come here with great interest to hear what the central bankers have to say , what other world leaders have to say about the financial situation and how the major economies of the world navigate out of the current crisis . do you feel that this year ’ s world economic forum is special in a way from all the other economic forums ? i think i had that question every time i came so yes , everyone is special . let ’ s talk about the global economic crisis .
how does it affect your business and how do you see it go forward ? dell is a company with an exceptionally strong balance sheet and so it gives us an opportunity to use that really as a weapon to consolidate the industry and grow by acquisitions .
so we are acquiring a few companies , but also make sure that we retain that strength that we have and that we continue to serve our customers really really well during this challenging time . coming from europe , how does europe fare right now compared to other regions of the world like the u.s. or asia ? i ’ d say europe has held up pretty well , comparatively speaking .
some of the new europe hasn ’ t held up quite as well as the old europe , if i can say that .
but i ’ d say it has held up pretty well . i have to ask you a question about president obama , who has been in office now for less than two weeks .
he took some pretty big steps right from the start .
how do you rate him so far in his first days with the new administration ? i think it provides a lot of encouragement and hope to americans and maybe around the world .
it ’ s a bit early to give a lot of ratings . what do you expect from his economic team which has been called a dream team ?
tim geithner has now also been confirmed . i know larry summers .
i think they are talented individuals , a good team . america ’ s image in the world has suffered so much in the last years and the expectations for obama are really high .
do you think america ’ s image can go up again with new administration ? well , it seems like it would be fairly easy to improve .
i think brand america has already improved based on the obama election .
now the administration and the country have to deliver . if you could have one wish for obama , one thing you would really like him to do , what would that be ? well , i see him next week and i ’ ll tell him . michael knigge interviewed michael dell -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the four men ran the society of saint pius x -lrb- sspx -rrb- , an ultra-traditionalist catholic group that broke with rome over reforms introduced in the 1960s through the second vatican council . williamson 's rehabilitation has provoked a storm of outrage because he denies the existence of the nazi gas chambers and claims that " only 200,000 to 300,000 " jews died in concentration camps instead of some six million . such denial of the holocaust is both " inhuman " and " sacrilegious , " mueller said . the diocese released its response a day after a holocaust memorial service in regensburg , which is also the home base of pope benedict . aides : ban is more symbolic aides conceded that mueller 's ban was more symbolic than disciplinary , since mueller has no control over the sspx or its training center at zaitzkofen , near regensburg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british bishop richard williamson public prosecutors have opened an inquiry against williamson over his denial of the holocaust during an interview recorded with swedish television last week at zaitzkofen .
holocaust denial is a crime in germany . the german conference of catholic bishops has also rejected williamson 's remarks .
in rome , pope benedict xvi expressed " solidarity " wednesday with the jewish people and said the reality of the holocaust can not be cancelled through any form of denial . on wednesday , the israeli chief rabbi officially broke off ties with the vatican in protest at the decision to lift the excommunication on williamson . the sspx publicly dissociated itself on tuesday from williamson . historical research using population data suggests between 5 million and 6 million european jews were killed by privation and violence during world war ii .

28 . wealthy nations will experience their worst recession in the post-war period as a financial crisis continues to spread throughout their economies , the international monetary fund said as it slashed its global economic forecasts .
a contraction of two percent is expected in 2009 , even with massive fiscal stimulus packages planned by all rich countries . a recovery to 1.1 percent is possible in 2010 , the imf said , but only with drastic government intervention to help revive demand and stabilize financial institutions at the heart of the downturn . germany to contract 2.5 percent the united states will contract by 1.6 percent and germany - europe 's largest economy - by 2.5 per cent in 2009 .
japan , asia 's biggest economy , will contract 2.6 percent , the imf predicted . growth in emerging and developing countries will also slow dramatically in 2009 to 3.3 percent from 6.3 percent in 2008 . china 's economy will slow to 6.7 percent in 2009 from nine percent , india 's will drop to 5.1 percent and brazil 's growth will plummet a whopping four percentage points to 1.8 percent in 2009 . the imf 's predictions represented another sharp revision from its last forecast in november , a fact attributed to dramatic collapses in consumer and business confidence , plummeting global trade and demand , frozen credit markets and even greater losses for financial institutions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international monetary fund 's chief economist olivier blanchard " we expect the global economy to come to a virtual standstill in 2009 , " olivier blanchard , the imf 's chief economist , told reporters . in its november update , the imf had forecast 2.2 percent global growth for 2009 , a contraction of 0.3 percent in advanced economies and 5.1 percent growth in developing countries .
world growth below three percent is considered a global recession . global trade volumes are also expected to collapse in 2009 , contracting 2.8 percent after growth of 4.1 percent the year before .
in november , the imf still predicted a 2.1 percent increase in trade for this year . deflation becoming a serious risk at the same time , the imf warned that deflation was now becoming a serious risk for some wealthy nations .
consumer prices were expected to rise by only 0.3 percent in industrial nations in 2009 and 0.8 percent in 2010 . the global downturn continues to be driven by the debilitating financial crisis which began with a collapse in the us housing market but has since spread to all corners of the globe . financial firms are now projected to lose a total of $ 2.2 trillion before the crisis is over - about $ 500 billion more than banks currently have in their reserves - and will require more government aid . the imf also expects the world 's 20 largest economies to spend at least 1.5 percent of their gross domestic product on massive fiscal stimulus packages .
the us is currently mulling an $ 825 billion package worth some five percent of gdp . such government spending is crucial to reviving consumer demand , but would only provide a relatively short-term boost to economies : stabilizing the financial system is the key in the long run . " restoring financial health is a necessary condition for durable economic recovery , " blanchard said , adding that governments needed to take more " aggressive " measures to stem the collapse of financial firms . prescription for recovery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : banks have cut back on lending , stalling economies banks ' need for cash has stopped them from lending to each other and to consumers .
developing countries have seen foreign investments in their economies dry up as a result . governments , especially the us , must inject more capital into banks to keep them afloat , but should also take the damaged mortgage-related assets off their balance sheets in order to promote a long-term recovery , the imf said . the price of commodities like oil , food and metals has also plummeted in the last few months due to falling demand , putting even more pressure on some poorer countries dependent on their exports of natural resources . dpa news agency -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" restoring financial health is a necessary condition for durable economic recovery , " blanchard said , adding that governments needed to take more " aggressive " measures to stem the collapse of financial firms . prescription for recovery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : banks have cut back on lending , stalling economies banks ' need for cash has stopped them from lending to each other and to consumers .
developing countries have seen foreign investments in their economies dry up as a result . governments , especially the us , must inject more capital into banks to keep them afloat , but should also take the damaged mortgage-related assets off their balance sheets in order to promote a long-term recovery , the imf said . the price of commodities like oil , food and metals has also plummeted in the last few months due to falling demand , putting even more pressure on some poorer countries dependent on their exports of natural resources . dpa news agency -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it was , to say the least , an impressive start to 2009 for the men in red . stuttgart came into the match feeling as though they had a legitimate chance for an upset since they were playing at home and had managed to split the points with bayern in the last league match before the winter break .
how wrong they were .
bayern pounced on their opponents right from the outset .
midfielder bastian schweinsteiger staked the visitors to the lead in the 14th minute with a well-placed shot past stuttgart keeper jens lehmann .
two minutes later it was 2-nil , with playmaker frank ribery creating havoc in stuttgart 's box and slotting home from close range .
bayern were awarded a penalty in minute 21 after a foul by luckless stuttgart defender arthur boka .
but ribery chipped the penalty straight into the arms of a waiting lehmann , who had anticipated the frenchman 's attempted trick .
no matter .
shortly before the break , bayern striker luca toni found the net from ten meters out to essentially put the game beyond reach .
any hopes fans might have had for a stuttgart fight-back in the second half were quickly dashed as bastian schweinsteiger scored a penalty in the 55th minute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hosts utterly failed to measure up to munich ze roberto struck four minutes later to end the scoring for bayern , while stuttgart 's mario gomez picked up a late consolation goal that hardly deserved the appellation .
indeed , if the match is any indication of the form and sense of purpose with which bayern intend to begin the second half of the league season , bundesliga rivals have every reason to be afraid .
very afraid .

27 , as the eu prepared to unveil its own environmental action plan . " europe has gained a strong partner , " said czech environment minister martin bursik , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
" barack obama is quickly implementing what he has promised .
he acts efficiently , " he added .
" to protect our climate and our collective security , we must call together a truly global coalition , " president obama said at a white house ceremony , in an apparent swipe at former president george w. bush 's reluctance to take control of international efforts to combat climate change .
" we will make it clear to the world that america is ready to lead . "
he also vowed his policies would be dictated by the " sound science " behind climate change , rather than " rigid ideology . "
obama has signaled a sharp departure from climate change politics-as-usual in the united states , but this is only the beginning .
the obama administration on monday took some initial steps towards reversing the policies of former president george w. bush , drawing widespread praise from us environmental groups who had felt sidelined for much of the last eight years under bush .
obama named todd stern as the country 's first-ever climate-change envoy to lead international negotiations .
he also signed executive orders allowing us states like california to enact tougher vehicle emissions rules - the first step towards reversing a bush administration block on such state action .
but obama 's actions mark only the first steps in a long and complicated process , both in the united states and abroad , which environmental groups say will require an ongoing commitment from the new administration in order to make a serious dent in us and global climate policy .
bold steps must be sustained , say environmentalists obama 's first moves have been " bolder " than even many environmentalists expected , reid detchon , head of the energy future coalition , said in an interview .
but " this is going to require a sustained effort , and more importantly political leadership " from the president himself , detchon said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stern will the point man on climate for the us stern will become the country 's chief negotiator in international climate talks that have already entered the final phase .
governments have resolved to agree on a comprehensive climate treaty that would impose tough new restrictions on greenhouse-gas emissions by the end of this year .
stern led the us delegation to the kyoto protocol talks in 1997 , which resulted in the world 's first climate treaty .
that experience will allow obama 's administration to get up and running immediately , shaving as much as four to six months off the transition process had obama chosen a less veteran negotiator , said detchon .
but while former president bill clinton signed the kyoto protocol , widespread opposition among lawmakers meant it was never ratified by the us senate .
the talks on a successor to kyoto also remain in the balance .

27 , as the eu prepared to unveil its own environmental action plan . " europe has gained a strong partner , " said czech environment minister martin bursik , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
" barack obama is quickly implementing what he has promised .
he acts efficiently , " he added .
" to protect our climate and our collective security , we must call together a truly global coalition , " president obama said at a white house ceremony , in an apparent swipe at former president george w. bush 's reluctance to take control of international efforts to combat climate change .
" we will make it clear to the world that america is ready to lead . "
he also vowed his policies would be dictated by the " sound science " behind climate change , rather than " rigid ideology . "
obama has signaled a sharp departure from climate change politics-as-usual in the united states , but this is only the beginning .
the obama administration on monday took some initial steps towards reversing the policies of former president george w. bush , drawing widespread praise from us environmental groups who had felt sidelined for much of the last eight years under bush .
obama named todd stern as the country 's first-ever climate-change envoy to lead international negotiations .
he also signed executive orders allowing us states like california to enact tougher vehicle emissions rules - the first step towards reversing a bush administration block on such state action .
but obama 's actions mark only the first steps in a long and complicated process , both in the united states and abroad , which environmental groups say will require an ongoing commitment from the new administration in order to make a serious dent in us and global climate policy .
bold steps must be sustained , say environmentalists obama 's first moves have been " bolder " than even many environmentalists expected , reid detchon , head of the energy future coalition , said in an interview .
but " this is going to require a sustained effort , and more importantly political leadership " from the president himself , detchon said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stern will the point man on climate for the us stern will become the country 's chief negotiator in international climate talks that have already entered the final phase .
governments have resolved to agree on a comprehensive climate treaty that would impose tough new restrictions on greenhouse-gas emissions by the end of this year .
stern led the us delegation to the kyoto protocol talks in 1997 , which resulted in the world 's first climate treaty .
that experience will allow obama 's administration to get up and running immediately , shaving as much as four to six months off the transition process had obama chosen a less veteran negotiator , said detchon .
but while former president bill clinton signed the kyoto protocol , widespread opposition among lawmakers meant it was never ratified by the us senate .
the talks on a successor to kyoto also remain in the balance .
us opposition to the kyoto treaty rested on its failure to include emerging countries in its emissions targets .

27 , as the eu prepared to unveil its own environmental action plan . " europe has gained a strong partner , " said czech environment minister martin bursik , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
" barack obama is quickly implementing what he has promised .
he acts efficiently , " he added .
" to protect our climate and our collective security , we must call together a truly global coalition , " president obama said at a white house ceremony , in an apparent swipe at former president george w. bush 's reluctance to take control of international efforts to combat climate change .
" we will make it clear to the world that america is ready to lead . "
he also vowed his policies would be dictated by the " sound science " behind climate change , rather than " rigid ideology . "
obama has signaled a sharp departure from climate change politics-as-usual in the united states , but this is only the beginning .
the obama administration on monday took some initial steps towards reversing the policies of former president george w. bush , drawing widespread praise from us environmental groups who had felt sidelined for much of the last eight years under bush .
obama named todd stern as the country 's first-ever climate-change envoy to lead international negotiations .
he also signed executive orders allowing us states like california to enact tougher vehicle emissions rules - the first step towards reversing a bush administration block on such state action .
but obama 's actions mark only the first steps in a long and complicated process , both in the united states and abroad , which environmental groups say will require an ongoing commitment from the new administration in order to make a serious dent in us and global climate policy .
bold steps must be sustained , say environmentalists obama 's first moves have been " bolder " than even many environmentalists expected , reid detchon , head of the energy future coalition , said in an interview .
but " this is going to require a sustained effort , and more importantly political leadership " from the president himself , detchon said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stern will the point man on climate for the us stern will become the country 's chief negotiator in international climate talks that have already entered the final phase .
governments have resolved to agree on a comprehensive climate treaty that would impose tough new restrictions on greenhouse-gas emissions by the end of this year .
stern led the us delegation to the kyoto protocol talks in 1997 , which resulted in the world 's first climate treaty .
that experience will allow obama 's administration to get up and running immediately , shaving as much as four to six months off the transition process had obama chosen a less veteran negotiator , said detchon .
but while former president bill clinton signed the kyoto protocol , widespread opposition among lawmakers meant it was never ratified by the us senate .
the talks on a successor to kyoto also remain in the balance .
us opposition to the kyoto treaty rested on its failure to include emerging countries in its emissions targets .
developing countries have said that advanced economies , which industrialized earlier , bear greater responsibility for the earth 's warming to this point and should pay a heavier price .
many of the current sticking points on replacing kyoto , which expires in 2012 , revolve around the same issue .
obama ready to engage polluters in finding solution obama has not backed away from calling on developing countries , such as china and india , to share more of the burden in reducing emissions .
but he hopes to set an example for those countries by enacting sweeping new restrictions on polluting industries at home in the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama signed on to help fight climate change obama pledged during the presidential campaign to push for a cap- and-trade plan through congress that would effectively put a price on industries ' carbon emissions blamed for global warming .
supporters express hope that such legislation could be approved by december , when government delegates from around the world meet in copenhagen to thrash out a global climate deal .
but that could be a tough sell with the us facing a serious recession and us carmakers - who will bear the brunt of tougher fuel-efficiency standards - threatened with bankruptcy .
the eu looks set to pile more pressure on the us and other large polluters to sign up to an ambitious strategy to reduce greenhouse gases when ministers meet later this week .
the united states is the biggest polluter with 5.8 billion tons , followed by china with 5.1 billion tons of co2 per year .
with four billion tons of co2 a year , the eu generates 14 percent of the 27 billion tons that escape into the atmosphere each year .
last month european leaders approved a climate change action plan that the 27-nation bloc hopes will become a model for international negotiations in copenhagen in december .
eu ready to put its money where its mouth is bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commission president barroso will lead the eu 's fight the european commission will on wednesday unveil a strategy for gradually ramping up investments aimed at tackling climate change to a target of 175 billion euros -lrb- $ 231 billion -rrb- per year by 2020 .
the overall eu goal is to prevent a global temperature increase of more than two degrees centigrade over pre-industrial levels .
to do so it will encourage developed nations to commit to cut their emissions by 30 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 .
the target for developing nations should be set at 15-30 percent , according to the eu 's executive arm , with " significantly increased financial resources " required , including help from richer nations .
among the sources of finance , the commission recommends making polluters pay for each ton of carbon dioxide that they emit , according to draft proposals .
eu leaders committed last month to a climate-energy package that would decrease the bloc 's greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 , make 20 percent energy savings and bring renewable energy sources up to 20 percent of total energy use . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a former veteran democratic lawmaker and past chairman of the senate foreign relations committee , biden will represent obama 's foreign policy on the world stage for the first time since the president 's historic inauguration last week .
this year 's munich security conference is expected to focus on the future of nato , european security organizations and non-proliferation .
but news agency ap reported that biden is widely expected to use the meeting to push america 's european allies to expand their role in afghanistan .
" afghanistan is us ' biggest military challenge " biden 's visit comes as the new us administration signals that it wants to break with the bush era and reverse many of the foreign policies of the previous administration .

it was , to say the least , an impressive start to 2009 for the men in red . stuttgart came into the match feeling as though they had a legitimate chance for an upset since they were playing at home and had managed to split the points with bayern in the last league match before the winter break .
how wrong they were .
bayern pounced on their opponents right from the outset .
midfielder bastian schweinsteiger staked the visitors to the lead in the 14th minute with a well-placed shot past stuttgart keeper jens lehmann .
two minutes later it was 2-nil , with playmaker frank ribery creating havoc in stuttgart 's box and slotting home from close range .
bayern were awarded a penalty in minute 21 after a foul by luckless stuttgart defender arthur boka .
but ribery chipped the penalty straight into the arms of a waiting lehmann , who had anticipated the frenchman 's attempted trick .
no matter .
shortly before the break , bayern striker luca toni found the net from ten meters out to essentially put the game beyond reach .
any hopes fans might have had for a stuttgart fight-back in the second half were quickly dashed as bastian schweinsteiger scored a penalty in the 55th minute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hosts utterly failed to measure up to munich ze roberto struck four minutes later to end the scoring for bayern , while stuttgart 's mario gomez picked up a late consolation goal that hardly deserved the appellation .
indeed , if the match is any indication of the form and sense of purpose with which bayern intend to begin the second half of the league season , bundesliga rivals have every reason to be afraid .

deutsche welle 's michael knigge caught up with him at the conference . dw-world.de : what do you expect from this world economic forum ? michael dell : we have all come here with great interest to hear what the central bankers have to say , what other world leaders have to say about the financial situation and how the major economies of the world navigate out of the current crisis . do you feel that this year ’ s world economic forum is special in a way from all the other economic forums ? i think i had that question every time i came so yes , everyone is special . let ’ s talk about the global economic crisis .
how does it affect your business and how do you see it go forward ? dell is a company with an exceptionally strong balance sheet and so it gives us an opportunity to use that really as a weapon to consolidate the industry and grow by acquisitions .
so we are acquiring a few companies , but also make sure that we retain that strength that we have and that we continue to serve our customers really really well during this challenging time . coming from europe , how does europe fare right now compared to other regions of the world like the u.s. or asia ? i ’ d say europe has held up pretty well , comparatively speaking .
some of the new europe hasn ’ t held up quite as well as the old europe , if i can say that .
but i ’ d say it has held up pretty well . i have to ask you a question about president obama , who has been in office now for less than two weeks .
he took some pretty big steps right from the start .
how do you rate him so far in his first days with the new administration ? i think it provides a lot of encouragement and hope to americans and maybe around the world .
it ’ s a bit early to give a lot of ratings . what do you expect from his economic team which has been called a dream team ?
tim geithner has now also been confirmed . i know larry summers .
i think they are talented individuals , a good team . america ’ s image in the world has suffered so much in the last years and the expectations for obama are really high .
do you think america ’ s image can go up again with new administration ? well , it seems like it would be fairly easy to improve .
i think brand america has already improved based on the obama election .
now the administration and the country have to deliver . if you could have one wish for obama , one thing you would really like him to do , what would that be ? well , i see him next week and i ’ ll tell him . michael knigge interviewed michael dell -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it was , to say the least , an impressive start to 2009 for the men in red . stuttgart came into the match feeling as though they had a legitimate chance for an upset since they were playing at home and had managed to split the points with bayern in the last league match before the winter break .
how wrong they were .
bayern pounced on their opponents right from the outset .
midfielder bastian schweinsteiger staked the visitors to the lead in the 14th minute with a well-placed shot past stuttgart keeper jens lehmann .
two minutes later it was 2-nil , with playmaker frank ribery creating havoc in stuttgart 's box and slotting home from close range .
bayern were awarded a penalty in minute 21 after a foul by luckless stuttgart defender arthur boka .
but ribery chipped the penalty straight into the arms of a waiting lehmann , who had anticipated the frenchman 's attempted trick .
no matter .
shortly before the break , bayern striker luca toni found the net from ten meters out to essentially put the game beyond reach .
any hopes fans might have had for a stuttgart fight-back in the second half were quickly dashed as bastian schweinsteiger scored a penalty in the 55th minute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hosts utterly failed to measure up to munich ze roberto struck four minutes later to end the scoring for bayern , while stuttgart 's mario gomez picked up a late consolation goal that hardly deserved the appellation .
indeed , if the match is any indication of the form and sense of purpose with which bayern intend to begin the second half of the league season , bundesliga rivals have every reason to be afraid .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 28.01.2009 imf : world suffering worst downturn in postwar era großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german economy is expected to shrink by 2.5 percent the world economy will grow by only 0.5 percent in 2009 , the worst rate since world war two , as industrial nations battle a recession that is dragging developing countries down with them , the imf said wednesday , jan .
28 . wealthy nations will experience their worst recession in the post-war period as a financial crisis continues to spread throughout their economies , the international monetary fund said as it slashed its global economic forecasts .
a contraction of two percent is expected in 2009 , even with massive fiscal stimulus packages planned by all rich countries . a recovery to 1.1 percent is possible in 2010 , the imf said , but only with drastic government intervention to help revive demand and stabilize financial institutions at the heart of the downturn . germany to contract 2.5 percent the united states will contract by 1.6 percent and germany - europe 's largest economy - by 2.5 per cent in 2009 .
japan , asia 's biggest economy , will contract 2.6 percent , the imf predicted . growth in emerging and developing countries will also slow dramatically in 2009 to 3.3 percent from 6.3 percent in 2008 . china 's economy will slow to 6.7 percent in 2009 from nine percent , india 's will drop to 5.1 percent and brazil 's growth will plummet a whopping four percentage points to 1.8 percent in 2009 . the imf 's predictions represented another sharp revision from its last forecast in november , a fact attributed to dramatic collapses in consumer and business confidence , plummeting global trade and demand , frozen credit markets and even greater losses for financial institutions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international monetary fund 's chief economist olivier blanchard " we expect the global economy to come to a virtual standstill in 2009 , " olivier blanchard , the imf 's chief economist , told reporters . in its november update , the imf had forecast 2.2 percent global growth for 2009 , a contraction of 0.3 percent in advanced economies and 5.1 percent growth in developing countries .
world growth below three percent is considered a global recession . global trade volumes are also expected to collapse in 2009 , contracting 2.8 percent after growth of 4.1 percent the year before .
in november , the imf still predicted a 2.1 percent increase in trade for this year . deflation becoming a serious risk at the same time , the imf warned that deflation was now becoming a serious risk for some wealthy nations .
consumer prices were expected to rise by only 0.3 percent in industrial nations in 2009 and 0.8 percent in 2010 . the global downturn continues to be driven by the debilitating financial crisis which began with a collapse in the us housing market but has since spread to all corners of the globe . financial firms are now projected to lose a total of $ 2.2 trillion before the crisis is over - about $ 500 billion more than banks currently have in their reserves - and will require more government aid . the imf also expects the world 's 20 largest economies to spend at least 1.5 percent of their gross domestic product on massive fiscal stimulus packages .
the us is currently mulling an $ 825 billion package worth some five percent of gdp . such government spending is crucial to reviving consumer demand , but would only provide a relatively short-term boost to economies : stabilizing the financial system is the key in the long run . " restoring financial health is a necessary condition for durable economic recovery , " blanchard said , adding that governments needed to take more " aggressive " measures to stem the collapse of financial firms . prescription for recovery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : banks have cut back on lending , stalling economies banks ' need for cash has stopped them from lending to each other and to consumers .
developing countries have seen foreign investments in their economies dry up as a result . governments , especially the us , must inject more capital into banks to keep them afloat , but should also take the damaged mortgage-related assets off their balance sheets in order to promote a long-term recovery , the imf said . the price of commodities like oil , food and metals has also plummeted in the last few months due to falling demand , putting even more pressure on some poorer countries dependent on their exports of natural resources . dpa news agency -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche welle 's michael knigge caught up with him at the conference . dw-world.de : what do you expect from this world economic forum ? michael dell : we have all come here with great interest to hear what the central bankers have to say , what other world leaders have to say about the financial situation and how the major economies of the world navigate out of the current crisis . do you feel that this year ’ s world economic forum is special in a way from all the other economic forums ? i think i had that question every time i came so yes , everyone is special . let ’ s talk about the global economic crisis .
how does it affect your business and how do you see it go forward ? dell is a company with an exceptionally strong balance sheet and so it gives us an opportunity to use that really as a weapon to consolidate the industry and grow by acquisitions .
so we are acquiring a few companies , but also make sure that we retain that strength that we have and that we continue to serve our customers really really well during this challenging time . coming from europe , how does europe fare right now compared to other regions of the world like the u.s. or asia ? i ’ d say europe has held up pretty well , comparatively speaking .
some of the new europe hasn ’ t held up quite as well as the old europe , if i can say that .
but i ’ d say it has held up pretty well . i have to ask you a question about president obama , who has been in office now for less than two weeks .
he took some pretty big steps right from the start .
how do you rate him so far in his first days with the new administration ? i think it provides a lot of encouragement and hope to americans and maybe around the world .
it ’ s a bit early to give a lot of ratings . what do you expect from his economic team which has been called a dream team ?
tim geithner has now also been confirmed . i know larry summers .
i think they are talented individuals , a good team . america ’ s image in the world has suffered so much in the last years and the expectations for obama are really high .
do you think america ’ s image can go up again with new administration ? well , it seems like it would be fairly easy to improve .
i think brand america has already improved based on the obama election .
now the administration and the country have to deliver . if you could have one wish for obama , one thing you would really like him to do , what would that be ? well , i see him next week and i ’ ll tell him . michael knigge interviewed michael dell -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 28.01.2009 imf : world suffering worst downturn in postwar era großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german economy is expected to shrink by 2.5 percent the world economy will grow by only 0.5 percent in 2009 , the worst rate since world war two , as industrial nations battle a recession that is dragging developing countries down with them , the imf said wednesday , jan .
28 . wealthy nations will experience their worst recession in the post-war period as a financial crisis continues to spread throughout their economies , the international monetary fund said as it slashed its global economic forecasts .
a contraction of two percent is expected in 2009 , even with massive fiscal stimulus packages planned by all rich countries . a recovery to 1.1 percent is possible in 2010 , the imf said , but only with drastic government intervention to help revive demand and stabilize financial institutions at the heart of the downturn . germany to contract 2.5 percent the united states will contract by 1.6 percent and germany - europe 's largest economy - by 2.5 per cent in 2009 .
japan , asia 's biggest economy , will contract 2.6 percent , the imf predicted . growth in emerging and developing countries will also slow dramatically in 2009 to 3.3 percent from 6.3 percent in 2008 . china 's economy will slow to 6.7 percent in 2009 from nine percent , india 's will drop to 5.1 percent and brazil 's growth will plummet a whopping four percentage points to 1.8 percent in 2009 . the imf 's predictions represented another sharp revision from its last forecast in november , a fact attributed to dramatic collapses in consumer and business confidence , plummeting global trade and demand , frozen credit markets and even greater losses for financial institutions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international monetary fund 's chief economist olivier blanchard " we expect the global economy to come to a virtual standstill in 2009 , " olivier blanchard , the imf 's chief economist , told reporters . in its november update , the imf had forecast 2.2 percent global growth for 2009 , a contraction of 0.3 percent in advanced economies and 5.1 percent growth in developing countries .
world growth below three percent is considered a global recession . global trade volumes are also expected to collapse in 2009 , contracting 2.8 percent after growth of 4.1 percent the year before .
in november , the imf still predicted a 2.1 percent increase in trade for this year . deflation becoming a serious risk at the same time , the imf warned that deflation was now becoming a serious risk for some wealthy nations .
consumer prices were expected to rise by only 0.3 percent in industrial nations in 2009 and 0.8 percent in 2010 . the global downturn continues to be driven by the debilitating financial crisis which began with a collapse in the us housing market but has since spread to all corners of the globe . financial firms are now projected to lose a total of $ 2.2 trillion before the crisis is over - about $ 500 billion more than banks currently have in their reserves - and will require more government aid . the imf also expects the world 's 20 largest economies to spend at least 1.5 percent of their gross domestic product on massive fiscal stimulus packages .
the us is currently mulling an $ 825 billion package worth some five percent of gdp . such government spending is crucial to reviving consumer demand , but would only provide a relatively short-term boost to economies : stabilizing the financial system is the key in the long run . " restoring financial health is a necessary condition for durable economic recovery , " blanchard said , adding that governments needed to take more " aggressive " measures to stem the collapse of financial firms . prescription for recovery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : banks have cut back on lending , stalling economies banks ' need for cash has stopped them from lending to each other and to consumers .
developing countries have seen foreign investments in their economies dry up as a result . governments , especially the us , must inject more capital into banks to keep them afloat , but should also take the damaged mortgage-related assets off their balance sheets in order to promote a long-term recovery , the imf said . the price of commodities like oil , food and metals has also plummeted in the last few months due to falling demand , putting even more pressure on some poorer countries dependent on their exports of natural resources . dpa news agency -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it was , to say the least , an impressive start to 2009 for the men in red . stuttgart came into the match feeling as though they had a legitimate chance for an upset since they were playing at home and had managed to split the points with bayern in the last league match before the winter break .
how wrong they were .
bayern pounced on their opponents right from the outset .
midfielder bastian schweinsteiger staked the visitors to the lead in the 14th minute with a well-placed shot past stuttgart keeper jens lehmann .
two minutes later it was 2-nil , with playmaker frank ribery creating havoc in stuttgart 's box and slotting home from close range .
bayern were awarded a penalty in minute 21 after a foul by luckless stuttgart defender arthur boka .
but ribery chipped the penalty straight into the arms of a waiting lehmann , who had anticipated the frenchman 's attempted trick .
no matter .
shortly before the break , bayern striker luca toni found the net from ten meters out to essentially put the game beyond reach .
any hopes fans might have had for a stuttgart fight-back in the second half were quickly dashed as bastian schweinsteiger scored a penalty in the 55th minute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hosts utterly failed to measure up to munich ze roberto struck four minutes later to end the scoring for bayern , while stuttgart 's mario gomez picked up a late consolation goal that hardly deserved the appellation .
indeed , if the match is any indication of the form and sense of purpose with which bayern intend to begin the second half of the league season , bundesliga rivals have every reason to be afraid .
very afraid .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 28.01.2009 eu welcomes obama 's vow to lead on fighting climate change großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama pledges to lead the world in the fight to save the planet us president barack obama 's vow to lead the world in tackling climate change was welcomed by the european union presidency on tuesday , jan .
27 , as the eu prepared to unveil its own environmental action plan . " europe has gained a strong partner , " said czech environment minister martin bursik , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
" barack obama is quickly implementing what he has promised .
he acts efficiently , " he added .
" to protect our climate and our collective security , we must call together a truly global coalition , " president obama said at a white house ceremony , in an apparent swipe at former president george w. bush 's reluctance to take control of international efforts to combat climate change .
" we will make it clear to the world that america is ready to lead . "
he also vowed his policies would be dictated by the " sound science " behind climate change , rather than " rigid ideology . "
obama has signaled a sharp departure from climate change politics-as-usual in the united states , but this is only the beginning .
the obama administration on monday took some initial steps towards reversing the policies of former president george w. bush , drawing widespread praise from us environmental groups who had felt sidelined for much of the last eight years under bush .
obama named todd stern as the country 's first-ever climate-change envoy to lead international negotiations .
he also signed executive orders allowing us states like california to enact tougher vehicle emissions rules - the first step towards reversing a bush administration block on such state action .
but obama 's actions mark only the first steps in a long and complicated process , both in the united states and abroad , which environmental groups say will require an ongoing commitment from the new administration in order to make a serious dent in us and global climate policy .
bold steps must be sustained , say environmentalists obama 's first moves have been " bolder " than even many environmentalists expected , reid detchon , head of the energy future coalition , said in an interview .
but " this is going to require a sustained effort , and more importantly political leadership " from the president himself , detchon said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stern will the point man on climate for the us stern will become the country 's chief negotiator in international climate talks that have already entered the final phase .
governments have resolved to agree on a comprehensive climate treaty that would impose tough new restrictions on greenhouse-gas emissions by the end of this year .
stern led the us delegation to the kyoto protocol talks in 1997 , which resulted in the world 's first climate treaty .
that experience will allow obama 's administration to get up and running immediately , shaving as much as four to six months off the transition process had obama chosen a less veteran negotiator , said detchon .
but while former president bill clinton signed the kyoto protocol , widespread opposition among lawmakers meant it was never ratified by the us senate .
the talks on a successor to kyoto also remain in the balance .
us opposition to the kyoto treaty rested on its failure to include emerging countries in its emissions targets .
developing countries have said that advanced economies , which industrialized earlier , bear greater responsibility for the earth 's warming to this point and should pay a heavier price .
many of the current sticking points on replacing kyoto , which expires in 2012 , revolve around the same issue .
obama ready to engage polluters in finding solution obama has not backed away from calling on developing countries , such as china and india , to share more of the burden in reducing emissions .
but he hopes to set an example for those countries by enacting sweeping new restrictions on polluting industries at home in the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama signed on to help fight climate change obama pledged during the presidential campaign to push for a cap- and-trade plan through congress that would effectively put a price on industries ' carbon emissions blamed for global warming .
supporters express hope that such legislation could be approved by december , when government delegates from around the world meet in copenhagen to thrash out a global climate deal .
but that could be a tough sell with the us facing a serious recession and us carmakers - who will bear the brunt of tougher fuel-efficiency standards - threatened with bankruptcy .
the eu looks set to pile more pressure on the us and other large polluters to sign up to an ambitious strategy to reduce greenhouse gases when ministers meet later this week .
the united states is the biggest polluter with 5.8 billion tons , followed by china with 5.1 billion tons of co2 per year .
with four billion tons of co2 a year , the eu generates 14 percent of the 27 billion tons that escape into the atmosphere each year .
last month european leaders approved a climate change action plan that the 27-nation bloc hopes will become a model for international negotiations in copenhagen in december .
eu ready to put its money where its mouth is bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commission president barroso will lead the eu 's fight the european commission will on wednesday unveil a strategy for gradually ramping up investments aimed at tackling climate change to a target of 175 billion euros -lrb- $ 231 billion -rrb- per year by 2020 .

27 , as the eu prepared to unveil its own environmental action plan . " europe has gained a strong partner , " said czech environment minister martin bursik , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
" barack obama is quickly implementing what he has promised .
he acts efficiently , " he added .
" to protect our climate and our collective security , we must call together a truly global coalition , " president obama said at a white house ceremony , in an apparent swipe at former president george w. bush 's reluctance to take control of international efforts to combat climate change .
" we will make it clear to the world that america is ready to lead . "
he also vowed his policies would be dictated by the " sound science " behind climate change , rather than " rigid ideology . "
obama has signaled a sharp departure from climate change politics-as-usual in the united states , but this is only the beginning .
the obama administration on monday took some initial steps towards reversing the policies of former president george w. bush , drawing widespread praise from us environmental groups who had felt sidelined for much of the last eight years under bush .
obama named todd stern as the country 's first-ever climate-change envoy to lead international negotiations .
he also signed executive orders allowing us states like california to enact tougher vehicle emissions rules - the first step towards reversing a bush administration block on such state action .
but obama 's actions mark only the first steps in a long and complicated process , both in the united states and abroad , which environmental groups say will require an ongoing commitment from the new administration in order to make a serious dent in us and global climate policy .
bold steps must be sustained , say environmentalists obama 's first moves have been " bolder " than even many environmentalists expected , reid detchon , head of the energy future coalition , said in an interview .
but " this is going to require a sustained effort , and more importantly political leadership " from the president himself , detchon said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stern will the point man on climate for the us stern will become the country 's chief negotiator in international climate talks that have already entered the final phase .
governments have resolved to agree on a comprehensive climate treaty that would impose tough new restrictions on greenhouse-gas emissions by the end of this year .
stern led the us delegation to the kyoto protocol talks in 1997 , which resulted in the world 's first climate treaty .
that experience will allow obama 's administration to get up and running immediately , shaving as much as four to six months off the transition process had obama chosen a less veteran negotiator , said detchon .
but while former president bill clinton signed the kyoto protocol , widespread opposition among lawmakers meant it was never ratified by the us senate .
the talks on a successor to kyoto also remain in the balance .
us opposition to the kyoto treaty rested on its failure to include emerging countries in its emissions targets .
developing countries have said that advanced economies , which industrialized earlier , bear greater responsibility for the earth 's warming to this point and should pay a heavier price .
many of the current sticking points on replacing kyoto , which expires in 2012 , revolve around the same issue .
obama ready to engage polluters in finding solution obama has not backed away from calling on developing countries , such as china and india , to share more of the burden in reducing emissions .
but he hopes to set an example for those countries by enacting sweeping new restrictions on polluting industries at home in the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama signed on to help fight climate change obama pledged during the presidential campaign to push for a cap- and-trade plan through congress that would effectively put a price on industries ' carbon emissions blamed for global warming .
supporters express hope that such legislation could be approved by december , when government delegates from around the world meet in copenhagen to thrash out a global climate deal .
but that could be a tough sell with the us facing a serious recession and us carmakers - who will bear the brunt of tougher fuel-efficiency standards - threatened with bankruptcy .
the eu looks set to pile more pressure on the us and other large polluters to sign up to an ambitious strategy to reduce greenhouse gases when ministers meet later this week .
the united states is the biggest polluter with 5.8 billion tons , followed by china with 5.1 billion tons of co2 per year .
with four billion tons of co2 a year , the eu generates 14 percent of the 27 billion tons that escape into the atmosphere each year .
last month european leaders approved a climate change action plan that the 27-nation bloc hopes will become a model for international negotiations in copenhagen in december .
eu ready to put its money where its mouth is bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commission president barroso will lead the eu 's fight the european commission will on wednesday unveil a strategy for gradually ramping up investments aimed at tackling climate change to a target of 175 billion euros -lrb- $ 231 billion -rrb- per year by 2020 .

it was , to say the least , an impressive start to 2009 for the men in red . stuttgart came into the match feeling as though they had a legitimate chance for an upset since they were playing at home and had managed to split the points with bayern in the last league match before the winter break .

bayern pounced on their opponents right from the outset .
midfielder bastian schweinsteiger staked the visitors to the lead in the 14th minute with a well-placed shot past stuttgart keeper jens lehmann .
two minutes later it was 2-nil , with playmaker frank ribery creating havoc in stuttgart 's box and slotting home from close range .
bayern were awarded a penalty in minute 21 after a foul by luckless stuttgart defender arthur boka .
but ribery chipped the penalty straight into the arms of a waiting lehmann , who had anticipated the frenchman 's attempted trick .

shortly before the break , bayern striker luca toni found the net from ten meters out to essentially put the game beyond reach .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 28.01.2009 eu welcomes obama 's vow to lead on fighting climate change großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama pledges to lead the world in the fight to save the planet us president barack obama 's vow to lead the world in tackling climate change was welcomed by the european union presidency on tuesday , jan .
27 , as the eu prepared to unveil its own environmental action plan . " europe has gained a strong partner , " said czech environment minister martin bursik , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
" barack obama is quickly implementing what he has promised .
he acts efficiently , " he added .
" to protect our climate and our collective security , we must call together a truly global coalition , " president obama said at a white house ceremony , in an apparent swipe at former president george w. bush 's reluctance to take control of international efforts to combat climate change .
" we will make it clear to the world that america is ready to lead . "
he also vowed his policies would be dictated by the " sound science " behind climate change , rather than " rigid ideology . "
obama has signaled a sharp departure from climate change politics-as-usual in the united states , but this is only the beginning .
the obama administration on monday took some initial steps towards reversing the policies of former president george w. bush , drawing widespread praise from us environmental groups who had felt sidelined for much of the last eight years under bush .
obama named todd stern as the country 's first-ever climate-change envoy to lead international negotiations .
he also signed executive orders allowing us states like california to enact tougher vehicle emissions rules - the first step towards reversing a bush administration block on such state action .
but obama 's actions mark only the first steps in a long and complicated process , both in the united states and abroad , which environmental groups say will require an ongoing commitment from the new administration in order to make a serious dent in us and global climate policy .
bold steps must be sustained , say environmentalists obama 's first moves have been " bolder " than even many environmentalists expected , reid detchon , head of the energy future coalition , said in an interview .
but " this is going to require a sustained effort , and more importantly political leadership " from the president himself , detchon said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stern will the point man on climate for the us stern will become the country 's chief negotiator in international climate talks that have already entered the final phase .
governments have resolved to agree on a comprehensive climate treaty that would impose tough new restrictions on greenhouse-gas emissions by the end of this year .
stern led the us delegation to the kyoto protocol talks in 1997 , which resulted in the world 's first climate treaty .
that experience will allow obama 's administration to get up and running immediately , shaving as much as four to six months off the transition process had obama chosen a less veteran negotiator , said detchon .
but while former president bill clinton signed the kyoto protocol , widespread opposition among lawmakers meant it was never ratified by the us senate .
the talks on a successor to kyoto also remain in the balance .
us opposition to the kyoto treaty rested on its failure to include emerging countries in its emissions targets .
developing countries have said that advanced economies , which industrialized earlier , bear greater responsibility for the earth 's warming to this point and should pay a heavier price .
many of the current sticking points on replacing kyoto , which expires in 2012 , revolve around the same issue .
obama ready to engage polluters in finding solution obama has not backed away from calling on developing countries , such as china and india , to share more of the burden in reducing emissions .
but he hopes to set an example for those countries by enacting sweeping new restrictions on polluting industries at home in the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama signed on to help fight climate change obama pledged during the presidential campaign to push for a cap- and-trade plan through congress that would effectively put a price on industries ' carbon emissions blamed for global warming .
supporters express hope that such legislation could be approved by december , when government delegates from around the world meet in copenhagen to thrash out a global climate deal .
but that could be a tough sell with the us facing a serious recession and us carmakers - who will bear the brunt of tougher fuel-efficiency standards - threatened with bankruptcy .
the eu looks set to pile more pressure on the us and other large polluters to sign up to an ambitious strategy to reduce greenhouse gases when ministers meet later this week .
the united states is the biggest polluter with 5.8 billion tons , followed by china with 5.1 billion tons of co2 per year .
with four billion tons of co2 a year , the eu generates 14 percent of the 27 billion tons that escape into the atmosphere each year .
last month european leaders approved a climate change action plan that the 27-nation bloc hopes will become a model for international negotiations in copenhagen in december .
eu ready to put its money where its mouth is bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commission president barroso will lead the eu 's fight the european commission will on wednesday unveil a strategy for gradually ramping up investments aimed at tackling climate change to a target of 175 billion euros -lrb- $ 231 billion -rrb- per year by 2020 .
the overall eu goal is to prevent a global temperature increase of more than two degrees centigrade over pre-industrial levels .
to do so it will encourage developed nations to commit to cut their emissions by 30 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 .
the target for developing nations should be set at 15-30 percent , according to the eu 's executive arm , with " significantly increased financial resources " required , including help from richer nations .
among the sources of finance , the commission recommends making polluters pay for each ton of carbon dioxide that they emit , according to draft proposals .
eu leaders committed last month to a climate-energy package that would decrease the bloc 's greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 , make 20 percent energy savings and bring renewable energy sources up to 20 percent of total energy use . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

27 , as the eu prepared to unveil its own environmental action plan . " europe has gained a strong partner , " said czech environment minister martin bursik , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
" barack obama is quickly implementing what he has promised .
he acts efficiently , " he added .
" to protect our climate and our collective security , we must call together a truly global coalition , " president obama said at a white house ceremony , in an apparent swipe at former president george w. bush 's reluctance to take control of international efforts to combat climate change .
" we will make it clear to the world that america is ready to lead . "
he also vowed his policies would be dictated by the " sound science " behind climate change , rather than " rigid ideology . "
obama has signaled a sharp departure from climate change politics-as-usual in the united states , but this is only the beginning .
the obama administration on monday took some initial steps towards reversing the policies of former president george w. bush , drawing widespread praise from us environmental groups who had felt sidelined for much of the last eight years under bush .
obama named todd stern as the country 's first-ever climate-change envoy to lead international negotiations .
he also signed executive orders allowing us states like california to enact tougher vehicle emissions rules - the first step towards reversing a bush administration block on such state action .
but obama 's actions mark only the first steps in a long and complicated process , both in the united states and abroad , which environmental groups say will require an ongoing commitment from the new administration in order to make a serious dent in us and global climate policy .
bold steps must be sustained , say environmentalists obama 's first moves have been " bolder " than even many environmentalists expected , reid detchon , head of the energy future coalition , said in an interview .
but " this is going to require a sustained effort , and more importantly political leadership " from the president himself , detchon said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stern will the point man on climate for the us stern will become the country 's chief negotiator in international climate talks that have already entered the final phase .
governments have resolved to agree on a comprehensive climate treaty that would impose tough new restrictions on greenhouse-gas emissions by the end of this year .
stern led the us delegation to the kyoto protocol talks in 1997 , which resulted in the world 's first climate treaty .
that experience will allow obama 's administration to get up and running immediately , shaving as much as four to six months off the transition process had obama chosen a less veteran negotiator , said detchon .
but while former president bill clinton signed the kyoto protocol , widespread opposition among lawmakers meant it was never ratified by the us senate .
the talks on a successor to kyoto also remain in the balance .
us opposition to the kyoto treaty rested on its failure to include emerging countries in its emissions targets .
developing countries have said that advanced economies , which industrialized earlier , bear greater responsibility for the earth 's warming to this point and should pay a heavier price .
many of the current sticking points on replacing kyoto , which expires in 2012 , revolve around the same issue .
obama ready to engage polluters in finding solution obama has not backed away from calling on developing countries , such as china and india , to share more of the burden in reducing emissions .
but he hopes to set an example for those countries by enacting sweeping new restrictions on polluting industries at home in the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama signed on to help fight climate change obama pledged during the presidential campaign to push for a cap- and-trade plan through congress that would effectively put a price on industries ' carbon emissions blamed for global warming .
supporters express hope that such legislation could be approved by december , when government delegates from around the world meet in copenhagen to thrash out a global climate deal .
but that could be a tough sell with the us facing a serious recession and us carmakers - who will bear the brunt of tougher fuel-efficiency standards - threatened with bankruptcy .
the eu looks set to pile more pressure on the us and other large polluters to sign up to an ambitious strategy to reduce greenhouse gases when ministers meet later this week .
the united states is the biggest polluter with 5.8 billion tons , followed by china with 5.1 billion tons of co2 per year .
with four billion tons of co2 a year , the eu generates 14 percent of the 27 billion tons that escape into the atmosphere each year .
last month european leaders approved a climate change action plan that the 27-nation bloc hopes will become a model for international negotiations in copenhagen in december .
eu ready to put its money where its mouth is bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commission president barroso will lead the eu 's fight the european commission will on wednesday unveil a strategy for gradually ramping up investments aimed at tackling climate change to a target of 175 billion euros -lrb- $ 231 billion -rrb- per year by 2020 .
the overall eu goal is to prevent a global temperature increase of more than two degrees centigrade over pre-industrial levels .
to do so it will encourage developed nations to commit to cut their emissions by 30 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 .
the target for developing nations should be set at 15-30 percent , according to the eu 's executive arm , with " significantly increased financial resources " required , including help from richer nations .
among the sources of finance , the commission recommends making polluters pay for each ton of carbon dioxide that they emit , according to draft proposals .
eu leaders committed last month to a climate-energy package that would decrease the bloc 's greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 , make 20 percent energy savings and bring renewable energy sources up to 20 percent of total energy use . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it was , to say the least , an impressive start to 2009 for the men in red . stuttgart came into the match feeling as though they had a legitimate chance for an upset since they were playing at home and had managed to split the points with bayern in the last league match before the winter break .
how wrong they were .
bayern pounced on their opponents right from the outset .
midfielder bastian schweinsteiger staked the visitors to the lead in the 14th minute with a well-placed shot past stuttgart keeper jens lehmann .
two minutes later it was 2-nil , with playmaker frank ribery creating havoc in stuttgart 's box and slotting home from close range .
bayern were awarded a penalty in minute 21 after a foul by luckless stuttgart defender arthur boka .
but ribery chipped the penalty straight into the arms of a waiting lehmann , who had anticipated the frenchman 's attempted trick .
no matter .
shortly before the break , bayern striker luca toni found the net from ten meters out to essentially put the game beyond reach .
any hopes fans might have had for a stuttgart fight-back in the second half were quickly dashed as bastian schweinsteiger scored a penalty in the 55th minute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hosts utterly failed to measure up to munich ze roberto struck four minutes later to end the scoring for bayern , while stuttgart 's mario gomez picked up a late consolation goal that hardly deserved the appellation .
indeed , if the match is any indication of the form and sense of purpose with which bayern intend to begin the second half of the league season , bundesliga rivals have every reason to be afraid .
very afraid .

hamburg beat second-division 1860 munich 3-1 .

the details are chilling . the german public television station first reported on the video , which is being attributed to islamic jihad union , a radical group active in afghanistan and pakistan .
in the video , which features details of dead children and injured people , six men threaten violence against germany .
" we have a few surprise packages prepared this year , " the men reportedly say .
" allies of the occupation powers must always reckon with our attacks . "
germany currently has 3,600 troops in afghanistan as part of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in that country .
the video also made reference to the latest conflict between israelis and palestinians and to german chancellor angela merkel .
" for 10 days the world has watched as muslims in the gaza strip have been massacred , " the men in the video reportedly say .
" where is the us ?
where is mrs. merkel and her cabinet ? "

28 , commemorating the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall on november 9 , 1989 . at a gathering at berlin 's landmark potsdamer platz , the city 's senate representative richard meng said 2009 is a " year of remembrance , " as well as a " year of respect for the people who contributed to the peaceful fall of the wall . " throughout the year , exhibitions , talks and guided walks will remind people of the huge changes berlin has undergone . the highlight of the year will be a weekend of celebrations and a huge series of domino stones , set to topple on november 9 , symbolically marking the sequence of events that brought an end to communism . " in berlin , germany grew together more than anywhere else , " meng said , adding that it 's time to " show and describe the change which has occurred everywhere in berlin . " from thursday , a red information booth at potsdamer platz highlights the city 's transformation since 1989 . the booth has a flight of stairs , granting a panoramic view of the square which was redeveloped in glass and steel with the aim of helping it regain the central role it played before the city was divided . travelling display traces history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wall divided berlin from 1961 to 1989 an interactive display , replicated in a mobile box travelling the city , reveals pictures of berlin 's changing face over the course of the last 20 years . as the infobox visits 15 historically significant locations across berlin , a large helium-filled arrow will float above it , pointing to the sites from a height of 100 meters . these booths are needed , city officials said , in part because very little is left of the original berlin wall .
tourists and locals alike are baffled by the fact that it 's now difficult to see the former division between east and west . berlin 's mayor , klaus wowereit , said there was an urge to remove all traces of the city 's division after 1989 .
" we were in a euphoric mood , " he told berlin 's rbb inforadio on wednesday . " nobody wanted to bear this wall any longer , this wall of disgrace that divided the city , that brought so much distress to the city , to the families , to the individuals affected . " despite the posters , maps and interactive displays , it 's difficult to transmit " the horror of the wall , this system of terror with its mines , its dogs and the orders to shoot , " the mayor said . wowereit added that , in retrospect , maybe the wall was removed too hastily .

27 , as the eu prepared to unveil its own environmental action plan . " europe has gained a strong partner , " said czech environment minister martin bursik , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
" barack obama is quickly implementing what he has promised .
he acts efficiently , " he added .
" to protect our climate and our collective security , we must call together a truly global coalition , " president obama said at a white house ceremony , in an apparent swipe at former president george w. bush 's reluctance to take control of international efforts to combat climate change .
" we will make it clear to the world that america is ready to lead . "
he also vowed his policies would be dictated by the " sound science " behind climate change , rather than " rigid ideology . "
obama has signaled a sharp departure from climate change politics-as-usual in the united states , but this is only the beginning .
the obama administration on monday took some initial steps towards reversing the policies of former president george w. bush , drawing widespread praise from us environmental groups who had felt sidelined for much of the last eight years under bush .
obama named todd stern as the country 's first-ever climate-change envoy to lead international negotiations .
he also signed executive orders allowing us states like california to enact tougher vehicle emissions rules - the first step towards reversing a bush administration block on such state action .
but obama 's actions mark only the first steps in a long and complicated process , both in the united states and abroad , which environmental groups say will require an ongoing commitment from the new administration in order to make a serious dent in us and global climate policy .
bold steps must be sustained , say environmentalists obama 's first moves have been " bolder " than even many environmentalists expected , reid detchon , head of the energy future coalition , said in an interview .
but " this is going to require a sustained effort , and more importantly political leadership " from the president himself , detchon said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stern will the point man on climate for the us stern will become the country 's chief negotiator in international climate talks that have already entered the final phase .
governments have resolved to agree on a comprehensive climate treaty that would impose tough new restrictions on greenhouse-gas emissions by the end of this year .
stern led the us delegation to the kyoto protocol talks in 1997 , which resulted in the world 's first climate treaty .
that experience will allow obama 's administration to get up and running immediately , shaving as much as four to six months off the transition process had obama chosen a less veteran negotiator , said detchon .
but while former president bill clinton signed the kyoto protocol , widespread opposition among lawmakers meant it was never ratified by the us senate .
the talks on a successor to kyoto also remain in the balance .
us opposition to the kyoto treaty rested on its failure to include emerging countries in its emissions targets .
developing countries have said that advanced economies , which industrialized earlier , bear greater responsibility for the earth 's warming to this point and should pay a heavier price .
many of the current sticking points on replacing kyoto , which expires in 2012 , revolve around the same issue .
obama ready to engage polluters in finding solution obama has not backed away from calling on developing countries , such as china and india , to share more of the burden in reducing emissions .
but he hopes to set an example for those countries by enacting sweeping new restrictions on polluting industries at home in the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama signed on to help fight climate change obama pledged during the presidential campaign to push for a cap- and-trade plan through congress that would effectively put a price on industries ' carbon emissions blamed for global warming .
supporters express hope that such legislation could be approved by december , when government delegates from around the world meet in copenhagen to thrash out a global climate deal .
but that could be a tough sell with the us facing a serious recession and us carmakers - who will bear the brunt of tougher fuel-efficiency standards - threatened with bankruptcy .
the eu looks set to pile more pressure on the us and other large polluters to sign up to an ambitious strategy to reduce greenhouse gases when ministers meet later this week .
the united states is the biggest polluter with 5.8 billion tons , followed by china with 5.1 billion tons of co2 per year .
with four billion tons of co2 a year , the eu generates 14 percent of the 27 billion tons that escape into the atmosphere each year .
last month european leaders approved a climate change action plan that the 27-nation bloc hopes will become a model for international negotiations in copenhagen in december .
eu ready to put its money where its mouth is bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commission president barroso will lead the eu 's fight the european commission will on wednesday unveil a strategy for gradually ramping up investments aimed at tackling climate change to a target of 175 billion euros -lrb- $ 231 billion -rrb- per year by 2020 .
the overall eu goal is to prevent a global temperature increase of more than two degrees centigrade over pre-industrial levels .
to do so it will encourage developed nations to commit to cut their emissions by 30 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 .
the target for developing nations should be set at 15-30 percent , according to the eu 's executive arm , with " significantly increased financial resources " required , including help from richer nations .
among the sources of finance , the commission recommends making polluters pay for each ton of carbon dioxide that they emit , according to draft proposals .
eu leaders committed last month to a climate-energy package that would decrease the bloc 's greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 , make 20 percent energy savings and bring renewable energy sources up to 20 percent of total energy use . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de team shane fankhauser großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shane ’ s foray into journalism was more by circumstance than plan .
until the age of 30 he was consumed by " wanderlust " .
the thrill of travel took centre stage and work was merely a means to an end .
europe and north america beckoned . lots of travel , lots of nature , lots of mundane work , not much responsibility .
finally , having exhausted many career options , money and shoe leather , a chance meeting led to work as a tv reporter with special broadcasting service -lrb- sbs -rrb- in australia .
every day a new story , every day a new challenge .
the former building labourer , bartender , waiter , insurance clerk , university graduate and dreamer was hooked . after a 12 month apprenticeship at sbs , it was time to head “ bush ” to hone other broadcasting skills .
from city reporter to outback news anchor , talk-show host , voice and dogs-body in the inland city of wagga wagga .
the challenges of outback broadcasting were unique – when it rained , it poured on the studio ’ s tin roof .
you were never sure whether the sound broadcast would be you or the rain !
and when it got hot ... jackets off , ties loosened or abandoned . finally it was back to melbourne .
more radio and tv .
eventually a desire to be part of international broadcasting led to a stint with radio australia .
specialising in the pacific region , shane wrote and broadcast documentaries as well as reading news bulletins .
from radio australia to the south australian capital , adelaide , and more tv newsreading , interviewing and reporting for the australian broadcasting corporation -lrb- abc tv -rrb- . the years rolled on .
eventually , shane decided to try his luck overseas again , and , after an audition with dw-tv in berlin , he returned to europe in 2002 to work and travel . < back send us an e-mail email : mail to shane fankhauser www-links externer link : www.billabong.de my favourite website ! radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

in an interview with the new zealand-based hindi-language radio tarana , frank bainimarama said he felt under no pressure to set a date for elections .
he described new zealand 's prime minister , john key , as being very rude and uninformed .
mr bainimarama took control of fiji in a military coup in 2006 .
the pacific islands forum met on tuesday and agreed that if fiji did not announce an election date by the start of may , and hold elections by the end of the year , it would face sanctions by the regional grouping , including a loss of development funding .
' declaration of war ' in the interview , mr bainimarama said the forum should not hold its breath waiting for instant action .
i have never come across a situation where a country gives an ultimatum to another country unless , of course , there is a declaration of war frank bainimarama , military ruler , fiji " it is going to be a long wait .
we have already given our explanation , right now i do n't think we need to explain anymore , " mr bainimarama said in the interview , repeating his comment that elections could take up to 10 years .
he described the summit 's ultimatum as unprecedented .
" i have never come across a situation where a country gives an ultimatum to another country unless , of course , there is a declaration of war " , he told radio tarana .
he also singled out new zealand 's prime minister for criticism .
" i do n't think , from the explanation that was given to me by the attorney general , that -lsb- john key -rsb- completely understands what is happening in fiji because during the discussion yesterday he was very rude to the attorney general - he was very personal in his questions to him , " he said .
a spokeswoman for mr key was reported in new zealand media as saying he was not available for comment .
reforms fiji 's attorney general aiyaz saiyed khaiyum has said fiji was not in crisis .
" you have a government in place that 's been held to be legally and validly appointed by his excellency our president -lsb- by -rsb- a three member panel of the high court .
so we do not understand what the crisis is , " radio new zealand quoted him as saying .
the country wanted " long-term and sustainable " democracy which " seems lost on some people " , radio new zealand reported .
fiji 's deposed former leader laisenia qarase said the ultimatum was unlikely to persuade mr bainimarama to change his position .
mr bainimarama " has become addicted to political power ... he likes the power and that is why i feel it will be very unlikely that he will hold elections by the end of the year " , mr qarase said .
academics based outside fiji concurred , saying the military man was not the sort of person to react well to outside pressures .
' unaccountable government ' meanwhile , the publisher of the fiji times expelled this week from fiji , rex gardner , criticised his deportation .
" they 're acting with somewhat of a bunker mentality at the moment and i think some of the actions are a little irrational and i think my deportation is one of those such actions , " said mr gardner in an interview with the australia -lrb- tv -rrb- network .
" we in the media feel -lsb- fiji 's military-backed leaders -rsb- are not accountable , they 're not transparent in any way , they do n't get called to account . "
mr gardner was the third foreign publisher to have been deported from fiji in the past year .

in an interview with the new zealand-based hindi-language radio tarana , frank bainimarama said he felt under no pressure to set a date for elections .
he described new zealand 's prime minister , john key , as being very rude and uninformed .
mr bainimarama took control of fiji in a military coup in 2006 .
the pacific islands forum met on tuesday and agreed that if fiji did not announce an election date by the start of may , and hold elections by the end of the year , it would face sanctions by the regional grouping , including a loss of development funding .
' declaration of war ' in the interview , mr bainimarama said the forum should not hold its breath waiting for instant action .
i have never come across a situation where a country gives an ultimatum to another country unless , of course , there is a declaration of war frank bainimarama , military ruler , fiji " it is going to be a long wait .
we have already given our explanation , right now i do n't think we need to explain anymore , " mr bainimarama said in the interview , repeating his comment that elections could take up to 10 years .
he described the summit 's ultimatum as unprecedented .
" i have never come across a situation where a country gives an ultimatum to another country unless , of course , there is a declaration of war " , he told radio tarana .
he also singled out new zealand 's prime minister for criticism .
" i do n't think , from the explanation that was given to me by the attorney general , that -lsb- john key -rsb- completely understands what is happening in fiji because during the discussion yesterday he was very rude to the attorney general - he was very personal in his questions to him , " he said .
a spokeswoman for mr key was reported in new zealand media as saying he was not available for comment .
reforms fiji 's attorney general aiyaz saiyed khaiyum has said fiji was not in crisis .
" you have a government in place that 's been held to be legally and validly appointed by his excellency our president -lsb- by -rsb- a three member panel of the high court .
so we do not understand what the crisis is , " radio new zealand quoted him as saying .
the country wanted " long-term and sustainable " democracy which " seems lost on some people " , radio new zealand reported .
fiji 's deposed former leader laisenia qarase said the ultimatum was unlikely to persuade mr bainimarama to change his position .
mr bainimarama " has become addicted to political power ... he likes the power and that is why i feel it will be very unlikely that he will hold elections by the end of the year " , mr qarase said .
academics based outside fiji concurred , saying the military man was not the sort of person to react well to outside pressures .
' unaccountable government ' meanwhile , the publisher of the fiji times expelled this week from fiji , rex gardner , criticised his deportation .
" they 're acting with somewhat of a bunker mentality at the moment and i think some of the actions are a little irrational and i think my deportation is one of those such actions , " said mr gardner in an interview with the australia -lrb- tv -rrb- network .
" we in the media feel -lsb- fiji 's military-backed leaders -rsb- are not accountable , they 're not transparent in any way , they do n't get called to account . "
mr gardner was the third foreign publisher to have been deported from fiji in the past year .

elaine murphy - now baroness murphy - dreamt up the painful complaint in the 1970s , sending a report to the british medical journal .
she came clean when the hoax resurfaced in the 2008 christmas edition .
a bmj spokesman said the inclusion and subsequent debunking of " cello scrotum " had " added to the gaiety of life " .
anyone who has ever watched a cello being played would realise the physical impossibility of our claim baroness murphy the spoof was inspired by a report of a phenomenon called " guitar nipple " , which reportedly occurred when the edge of the guitar was pressed against the breast , causing irritation .

" anyone who has ever watched a cello being played would realise the physical impossibility of our claim .

baroness murphy , formerly a professor at guy 's and st thomas ' hospital in london , did not sign the 1974 letter herself , fearing that she might get into trouble .
her husband john , now chairman of a suffolk brewery , signed it instead .
scrotal flak the couple said that they had been " dining out " on the hoax for years , but decided to confess after seeing " cello scrotum " referenced in an article last month in the journal .
a spokesman for the bmj said that , 34 years on , no-one faced the sack for failing to spot the implausible condition .
he said : " we did , actually , get a letter from another doctor at the time pointing out how unlikely it was .
" we may have to organise a formal retraction or correction now .
once these things get into the scientific literature , they stay there for good .
but it all adds to the gaiety of life . "
his point was illustrated by a brief search of other medical journals - with " cello scrotum " referenced several times over the years , including by one scholar who debated whether it was in fact an awkward contact with the chair , rather than the instrument itself , that might be the source of irritation .

the uk firm , which supplies carmakers including land rover and ford , said it had cut 242 uk positions so far .
gkn said all its car part plants were now continuing to work shorter weeks due to the falling demand .
car firms are meeting lord mandelson later for talks on the government 's £ 2.3bn loan guarantee package .
' headcount reduction ' gkn said that its automotive business made a loss in both november and december , and that conditions in the global car industry had continued to decline since then .
this is another body blow for an already beleaguered engineering industry gmb official joe morgan bbc uk jobs tracker as a result , it said it was moving ahead with further " selected headcount reduction programmes " .
the redditch-based firm has four uk factories manufacturing car parts in the west midlands and telford , that currently employ 2,000 permanent staff out of a uk total of 6,300 .
gkn said 2009 's additional job cuts and wider restructuring would cost it an estimated £ 120m .
" this is another body blow for an already beleaguered engineering industry , " said gmb official joe morgan .
" we need to discuss the implications of this on a plant-by-plant basis , and see if there is any scope for government assistance . "
gkn 's announcement comes after almost all of the big car firms have announced cuts in production as a result of a substantial fall in demand .
jaguar land rover , to which gkn supplies the main chassis for both the land rover defender and range rover sport models , said earlier this month that it had seen a " severe reduction in demand " .
the carmaker is also cutting its workforce by 450 .
jaguar land rover chief executive david smith said he did not expect sales to return to normal levels " for some time " .
government support the uk government has now moved to try to assist the country 's car sector .
business secretary lord mandelson on tuesday outlined a package of government support for the uk car industry potentially worth up to £ 2.3bn.
the package includes a scheme to unlock £ 1.3bn of loans from europe for car manufacturers and major suppliers .
he said the government would also guarantee up to £ 1bn of further loans .
lord mandelson is now due to meet car industry leaders to discuss the finer details .
however , the conservatives said the european loans had already been announced last year .
in addition to making car parts , gkn supplies components to the aerospace industry .
in september last year gkn bought airbus ' filton plant in bristol - which makes wing parts for airbus planes - for £ 136m .

there had been mounting speculation about government legislation on the issue as the music industry steps up its fight against the pirates .
other countries , such as france , have supported tough action on file-sharers , who the industry claims cost them dear .
but mr lammy said legislation would be too complex .
" we ca n't have a system where we 're talking about arresting teenagers in their bedrooms , " he told the times newspaper .
talk of the government forcing internet service providers to evict file-sharers from their networks grew last year as the british phonographic industry adopted a tougher stance .
the bpi , which represents the uk music industry , favours a " three strikes " policy , where file-sharers offenders are initially sent warning letters .
persistent offenders could be thrown off the network .
true potential while some isps , most notably virgin media , sent out initial warning letters , the rest of the bpi policy has yet to be firmed up .
according to analyst firm forrester , a fifth of europeans use file-sharing networks .
paid-for digital music services such as itunes are used by just 10 % and make up just 8 % of overall music revenue .
feargal sharkey , ex-pop star and now head of the pan-industry body uk music , has said that he believes 80 % of file-sharers would be prepared to pay for a legitimate file-sharing service .
the challenge for the uk music industry was to find a way to " unlock the true potential of digital music " , he said at an industry talking shop at the beginning of the year .
some experts predict that lord carter 's report on the state of digital britain , expected at the end of the month , to make recommendations about how to crack down on file-sharers without legislation .

there had been mounting speculation about government legislation on the issue as the music industry steps up its fight against the pirates .
other countries , such as france , have supported tough action on file-sharers , who the industry claims cost them dear .
but mr lammy said legislation would be too complex .
" we ca n't have a system where we 're talking about arresting teenagers in their bedrooms , " he told the times newspaper .
talk of the government forcing internet service providers to evict file-sharers from their networks grew last year as the british phonographic industry adopted a tougher stance .
the bpi , which represents the uk music industry , favours a " three strikes " policy , where file-sharers offenders are initially sent warning letters .
persistent offenders could be thrown off the network .
true potential feargal sharkey thinks file-sharers would be prepared to pay while some isps , most notably virgin media , sent out initial warning letters , the rest of the bpi policy has yet to be firmed up .
according to analyst firm forrester , a fifth of europeans use file-sharing networks .
paid-for digital music services such as itunes are used by just 10 % and make up just 8 % of overall music revenue .
feargal sharkey , ex-pop star and now head of the pan-industry body uk music , has said that he believes 80 % of file-sharers would be prepared to pay for a legitimate file-sharing service .
the challenge for the uk music industry was to find a way to " unlock the true potential of digital music " , he said at an industry talking shop at the beginning of the year .
some experts predict that lord carter 's report on the state of digital britain , expected at the end of the month , to make recommendations about how to crack down on file-sharers without legislation .

rather than slaving away for hours in the gym , people should focus their attention on quick " sprints " with each workout lasting just a few minutes .
james timmons , heriot-watt university professor of exercise biology has studied the effects of quick exercise .
he recommends 4 x 30 second sprints on an exercise bike three times a week .
he said people could reduce their risk of diabetes and heart disease substantially with short , intense workouts - with such " time-efficient " exercising appealing to busy workers .
in his study , published in the journal bmc endocrine disorders , 16 men exercised for three sessions a week for two weeks .
each session was made up of 4 x 30 second sprints on an exercise bike .
this involved the men going as fast as they could for 30 seconds and then taking a few minutes of complete rest between each sprint .
after two weeks , prof timmons said the results were " substantial " , with a 23 % improvement in insulin function .
while his research focused on young men , prof timmons said it would work for people of all ages and for both men and women .
he said : " this study looked at the way we break down stores of glycogen .
" think about diabetes as being glucose circulating in the blood rather than stored in the muscles where it should be .
" if we take out the glycogen from the muscles through exercise , then the muscles draw in that excess glucose from the blood . "
intense contractions he added : " if you go for a jog or a run you oxidise glycogen but you are not depleting the glycogen in your muscles .
" the only way to get to this glycogen is through very intense contractions of the muscles .
" if we can get people in their 20s , 30s and 40s doing these exercises twice a week then it could have a very dramatic effect on the future prevalence of diabetes . "
he said the effects were bigger than the traditional " one hour of running per day " .
the exercise routine is known as " high-intensity interval training " or hit for short .
prof timmons said current guidelines on how much exercise people should take may need revising .
diabetes uk research manager victoria king said short duration , high-intensity training improved insulin action in young healthy males but the research had only been undertaken in a small group of people without diabetes .
she said : " whilst the improvement in the control of insulin action in those who undertook the training is interesting , it 's limited at this stage as to what we can learn . "

rather than slaving away for hours in the gym , people should focus their attention on quick " sprints " with each workout lasting just a few minutes .
james timmons , heriot-watt university professor of exercise biology has studied the effects of quick exercise .
he recommends 4 x 30 second sprints on an exercise bike three times a week .
he said people could reduce their risk of diabetes and heart disease substantially with short , intense workouts - with such " time-efficient " exercising appealing to busy workers .

an intense workout for a few minutes may keep heart disease and diabetes at bay in his study , published in the journal bmc endocrine disorders , 16 men exercised for three sessions a week for two weeks .
each session was made up of 4 x 30 second sprints on an exercise bike .
this involved the men going as fast as they could for 30 seconds and then taking a few minutes of complete rest between each sprint .
after two weeks , prof timmons said the results were " substantial " , with a 23 % improvement in insulin function .
while his research focused on young men , prof timmons said it would work for people of all ages and for both men and women .
he said : " this study looked at the way we break down stores of glycogen .
" think about diabetes as being glucose circulating in the blood rather than stored in the muscles where it should be .
" if we take out the glycogen from the muscles through exercise , then the muscles draw in that excess glucose from the blood . "
intense contractions he added : " if you go for a jog or a run you oxidise glycogen but you are not depleting the glycogen in your muscles .
" the only way to get to this glycogen is through very intense contractions of the muscles .
" if we can get people in their 20s , 30s and 40s doing these exercises twice a week then it could have a very dramatic effect on the future prevalence of diabetes . "
he said the effects were bigger than the traditional " one hour of running per day " .
the exercise routine is known as " high-intensity interval training " or hit for short .
prof timmons said current guidelines on how much exercise people should take may need revising .
diabetes uk research manager victoria king said short duration , high-intensity training improved insulin action in young healthy males but the research had only been undertaken in a small group of people without diabetes .
she said : " whilst the improvement in the control of insulin action in those who undertook the training is interesting , it 's limited at this stage as to what we can learn . "
