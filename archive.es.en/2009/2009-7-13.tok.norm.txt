she is a lawyer , who gained entrance to the faculty of law at tehran university in 1965 . in 1975 she became the first woman in the history of iran 's justice system , to be made the president of bench 24 of the tehran city court .
she then set up her own practice after receiving her lawyer 's license in 1992 .
ebadi has written several books and many of her articles have been published in iranian journals .
one of the most talked about topics in the world right now is the disputed iranian presidential election .
do you believe the vote was fair ?
with their street protests , iranians have shown that they do not accept the announced results of the election which they believe was rigged .
you have also said that a new election will take place .
do you believe this will make any difference ?
the iranian people have called for a new election . and it is also my belief that these new elections should take place under the supervision of the united nations .
otherwise these disputes will continue and the people will again protest against election manipulation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2003 nobel peace prize winner 's visit generated a lot of media attention the scale of protests in iran and the reaction of the police indicate that the government was guilty .
if the elections were fair , as the government claims , why was there such a strong presence of security forces in the streets ?
that is a good question .
what happened in iran is an obvious human rights violation .
when the iranian people demonstrated peacefully , there were no problems – not even a window was broken .
but towards the end of the demonstrations shots were fired from office buildings .
some died and many more were injured .
that was the beginning of the state 's crackdown .
that night at 3 a.m. , a student residence was attacked , five students were shot dead and several were injured . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ebadi meets deutsche welle 's director-general , erik bettermann can other countries or institutions such as the united nations make a difference , or is it up to the iranian people now ?
first and foremost it is iranians who are fighting for their rights .
this movement , which has in the meantime turned into a national movement , was created by the iranian people .
president mahmoud ahmadinejad and the iranian government have said that the west is to blame for the protests in iran . what ahmadinejad has said is a major insult .
it is not true and in no way reflects the truth .
this is a pure national protest movement formed by the iranian people .
have these protests had any impact on the human rights situation ?
the movement started completely peacefully which shows the political maturity of the iranian people .
sadly , the people got a violent response to their peaceful movement .
when you give interviews like today , does it cause problems for you in iran ?
that 's not that important to me .
i consider this a task that has to be done .
will you go back to iran ?
of course i will return .
i have my husband , family and my house in iran .
and after i have finished my job here , i will go back .

low rainfall , deforestation , soil erosion and desertification all contribute to the hard life of mauritania 's farmers . ' drought is not simply our inevitable destiny , ' says cheikh abdellahai , vice president of the environmental protection agency , ampemn .
' like any other people in the world , mauritanians have always adapted themselves to their environment .
so if drought is not a prerequisite then we can do something about it .
we could improve our quality of life – we could for example construct artificial oases in the desert . ' cheikh abdellahib knows what he is talking about .
since the 1970s he and his colleagues have been leading a campaign to combat the effects of drought in mauritania .
they plant trees in sandy areas to stop the desert from spreading .
they cultivate arable land to be able to plant fruit and vegetables .
and they support local communities in building facilities to catch and store water to enable them to saturate parts of the dry earth . forced migration because of water scarcity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fleeing to the cities after bad droughts : nomads mauritania has a hot , dry climate and although it is three times the size of germany it has a population of only three million .
the sahara stretches deep into the country and a large percentage of the population has since moved to the cities - a result of the infertile land and inhospitable rural conditions .
in 1970 and 1984 two particularly bad droughts caused a massive migratory movement .
the nomadic population fled to the cities in desperation - and then stayed .
the state support system at the time was almost non-existent , says cheikh abdellahi .
' politicians gave fiery speeches .
but in the end nothing was done .
lately , politicians do seem to be developing a consciousness of environmental problems ; there is even a state secretary for the environment .
i hope that actual environmental strategies emerge from this . ' every drop counts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : destroys arable land : desertification is a big problem despite the emerging change in government mentality towards environmental protection , initiatives against soil erosion and desertification are still rare .
water shortage continues to be the biggest challenge facing the population .
in some areas rainfall is less than 50mm a year .
against overwhelming odds , mauritanians have not given up in their quest for water .
for the mauritanians this battle is not just about environmentalism , they are fighting for survival .
recent initiatives are starting to show signs of success , proving that drought is not an inevitable cycle .
there is a chance that it can be beaten . pk send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 07 dw-tv europe live journal - nachrichten mit tagesthema we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

" of course it is still a long way off , but the enormous interest in the scheme shows we are on the right path , " a spokesman for munich re said .

there are no details on when the trial would begin .
the filing of charges comes 10 days after medical experts at munich 's stadelheim prison said demjanjuk was fit to stand trial as long as court sessions do not exceed two 90-minute sessions per day .
demjanjuk 's family had said the octogenarian was too frail to withstand the proceedings because he suffers from kidney disease , cancer and arthritis .
most-wanted nazi war criminal demjanjuk has denied accusations that he was a guard at the sobibor death camp in nazi-occupied poland in 1943 and helped murder jews .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a monument in sobibor in eastern poland remembers the victims at the nazi death camp he has said he was captured by the germans in ukraine while fighting for the red army and held as a prisoner of war .
until being deported to germany in may , the ukrainian-born demjanjuk had headed the list of the simon wiesenthal center 's 10 most-wanted suspected war criminals .
efraim zuroff from the simon wiesenthal centre welcomed monday 's move by german prosecutors .
" this is obviously an important step forward , " zufroff told the associated press .
" we hope that the trial itself will be expedited so that justice will be achieved and he can be given the appropriate punishment . "
" the effort to bring demjanjuk to justice sends a very powerful message that the passage of time in no way diminishes the guilt of the perpetrator . "
possibly last holocaust trial demjanjuk was deported by us authorities from his home in ohio on may 12 .
he had appealed against the deportation in a last ditch attempt to avoid facing charges but had his request rejected by a german court last week . demjanjuk 's trial is the last expected time a german court will prosecute for holocaust crimes in the country .
demjanjuk has lived in the us since 1952 .
he arrived there as a refugee and worked in the car industry in cleveland , ohio .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a former id card of demjanjuk 's with the word " sobibor " printed on it in 1988 , he was sentenced to death in israel for crimes against humanity after holocaust survivors identified him as the notorious " ivan the terrible , " a guard at the treblinka death camp .
but israel 's highest court later overturned his sentence , after documents from the former soviet union indicated that " ivan the terrible " had probably been a different man .
demjanjuk returned to the us , but in 2002 had his us citizenship revoked because of his failure to disclose his work at nazi camps when he first arrived . sp / reuters / dpa editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the hijacking has led to a debate in germany and the question what can be done about it . the situation for the hansa stavanger 's crew of 24 has become desperate .
according to germany 's spiegel magazine , the captain reported to his wife a week ago that there was a lack of drinking water , food and medication .
many crew members are supposedly ill .
negotiations between the pirates and the hamburg based ship owner leonhardt & blumberg are ongoing .
the pirates originally demanded $ 15 million ransom .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : special forces during a naval training mission three weeks after the hijacking special troops from the german federal police prepared to storm the ship and free the hostages .
two hundred german anti-terror specialists practised the operation on board of the us navy ship uss boxer less then fifty nautical miles away from the hansa stavanger .
but before german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble in berlin could give the go-ahead for the operation , us national security advisor james jones in washington called the operation off , saying it was too risky .
but without american logistical support germany 's elite troops were grounded .
jason alderwick , a maritime defense analyst with the international institute for strategic studies -lrb- iiss -rrb- in london , supports the stance taken by the us .
" the german contribution is just part of a wider international coalition .
so unilaterally deciding to storm a ship is n't necessarily the right approach . "
better funding and cooperation wolfgang bosbach , the vice-chairman of chancellor angela merkel 's christian-democratic group in parliament , argues that german police have the right to storm a hijacked german ship in any case .
" when we need the support of other states , we ca n't decide alone .
we need our own capacities as far as helicopter air transport is concerned .
we need better air supported reconnaissance and we need better communication between the authorities in charge . "
bosbach wants better funding , so germany can carry out operations without international help . and he also urges better cooperation between the defense and interior ministries .
there was speculation in the media , that defense minister franz-josef jung asked washington to stop interior minister schaeuble .
jung is in charge of the military , schaeuble is responsible for the police , which includes the unit that was supposed to carry out the anti-terror operation .
wolfgang bosbach does n't want to address the media speculation , but emphasizes that the german military has a special mandate for fighting piracy at the horn of africa , but that it is the general responsibility of germany 's federal police to free hostages when necessary .
bosbach adds that for germany , given its recent century history , every international military operation remains a balancing act between modesty and responsibility .
" we have good reasons to say ' never first , never alone , never without an international mandate ' .
but when we say a , we also must say b. when we decide to send troops , we must make sure that they are equipped appropriately . "
fighting the root problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : capturing and trying somali pirates is difficult still , the larger question remains whether soldiers and policemen can stop pirates .
for more than six months now , the navies of nine european nations have been patrolling the somali coastline .
and yet piracy has continued .
wolfgang bosbach admits that the military alone ca n't stop piracy .
" we are talking here about organized crime .
we have to look at the causes .
that 's why besides the defense and interior ministries , foreign affairs and development ministries must be involved as well . "
still , he says , the european military patrols around the somali coast - operation atalanta - has had an impact : " the shipping companies must decide to join a convoy , which gets navy protection .
none of the convoys we accompanied got into trouble . "
jason alderwick agrees in principle that piracy is a matter of international crime and therefore rather a police than a military issue : " it would be great to hand over the operation to coast guard assets .
but europeans do n't have a huge coast guard , which is able to deploy in a counter piracy role .
so you have to go with the forces and capabilities you have .
the military instrument is a blunt instrument , but it 's adapting as best as it can with the situation down there . "
overall , says alderwick , europe 's atalanta operation at the horn of africa makes sense .
" there has arguably been an escalation in the number of piracy attacks , but that is n't a direct consequence of the operation .
it 's just a consequence of the overall situation .
without atalanta , piracy in the region would definitely have been worse . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 13.07.2009 african solar power for europe could promote security , experts say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : capturing sunshine could lead to energy development and security hurdles remain , but mediterranean countries should cooperate on economic development and environmental protection including a new solar power project , according to guest commentators matthias ruchser and stefan gaenzle . last year , on july 13 , the " union for the mediterranean " was launched amid much diplomatic fanfare .
heads of state and government from 43 european union and the mediterranean-rim countries had accepted an invitation to paris extended by french president nicolas sarkozy to give new impetus to mediterranean cooperation .
the union for the mediterranean follows up on the barcelona process , initiated in 1995 , which also had a pronounced security dimension . ultimately , the union for the mediterranean set itself a six-point agenda , among others the " mediterranean solar plan . "
the recent gaza war has upset these plans .
no high-ranking ministerial meetings have taken place since december 2008 , and some important issues dealing with the institutional design of the union have been shelved . similar to the constraints imposed on the baltic sea co-operation of the 1970s -lrb- due to the east-west conflict -rrb- , it would be recommendable for the union for the mediterranean to put high politics as well as security issues aside and focus on economic matters and the protection of the environment and the climate .
against this backdrop , can it be mere coincidence that it was precisely for july 13 that the munich re group issued invitations for the inaugural meeting of the so-called " desertec initiative " in munich ? energy security based on solar thermal power plants ? bildunterschrift : the desertec project aims to feed solar power from africa and the middle east to the eu while the idea behind the desertec project is nothing new , it is still fascinating : solar thermal power plants in northern africa would contribute to supplying europe with the clean energy it needs .
a total of roughly 400 billion euros in investments would be needed by the year 2050 to cover 15 percent of europe 's electricity needs .
so is the - privately financed - desertec consortium set to get the better of the european mediterranean solar plan , or indeed to replace it ? to start with the good news : the technology needed to generate solar thermal power , known as concentrated solar power -lrb- csp -rrb- , is already available , as are the high-voltage , direct current -lrb- hvdc -rrb- electric power transmission lines required to transport it .
in kramer junction , california , the first parabolic trough power plants have been connected to the grid since the mid-1980s .
more advanced csp power plants have been built in the united states and spain and are already several years old .
another csp plant , an integrated solar combined cycle plant -lrb- iscc -rrb- , is currently under construction in kuraymat , egypt .
parabolic trough power plants are already in the planning stages in some other countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german companies lead the field in concentrated solar power technology another piece of good news - at least from the german perspective - is that german companies lead the field when it comes to csp technology .
the parabolic mirrors are built by flabeg , the receivers by schott solar , the turbines , generators and control technology are available from siemens , and solar millennium and man ferrostaal operate as general contractors . looking for safe locations for solar plants is the only task remaining to secure the financing for the desertec initiative and to integrate it politically into the union for the mediterranean ?
not quite .
it will not prove so easy to enlist the southern mediterranean-rim countries as potential locations for power plants .
many of these countries are ruled by authoritarian regimes of different stripes , and there is an ever-present danger in the region of terrorist attacks .
population growth and unemployment are also very high in this part of the world , and such social problems are aggravated by migration pressure from sub-saharan africa .
all in all , an explosive mix , with important implications for our security as well . most of the non-eu mediterranean-rim countries have major development needs .
one prerequisite for development is energy .
however , most of the power plants currently in operation there are conventional , carbon-based plants .
in times of an accelerated climate change that has the gravest of implications for developing and transition countries , the latter need to switch their energy supply , as early as possible , to a non-conventional energy path , and that means , in effect , to renewable energy sources . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. stefan gaenzle is an expert on multilateral development cooperation with die large-scale solar thermal power plants may offer one solution to the problem .
even though energy production costs - 15 euros to 23 euro cents per kilowatt hour - are still higher than those for conventional power plants .
it would be possible -based , for example , on the model of the german renewable energy law - to close the viability gap either by raising the feed-in tariff for renewable electricity -lrb- to be paid by the end user -rrb- or by having government set ambitious quotas for the share of renewably generated electricity as a means of attracting investments in csp plants .
the important thing is to set clear-cut framework conditions for electricity sales in countries with the potential to operate csp plants , in this way ensuring that the billions that need to be invested will pay off in the long term for private investors . grid development as a pan-european task some successes in economic transformation have already been observed in the context of the euro-mediterranean partnership , in tunisia for instance , although there has been less movement when it comes to political change .
be that as it may , though , the union for the mediterranean does offer a dynamic normative frame of reference for the southern mediterranean-rim countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias ruchser is an energy consultant and head of media and public relations at die however , the eu 's tasks in the framework of the union for the mediterranean should not be to offset the financial risk for private-sector projects like the desertec initiative .
this , though , may be a different matter when it comes to support for the development and expansion of the power grid in the overall mediterranean region .
grid development must be viewed under the aspect of public welfare , and here the eu could provide an important contribution to collective energy security in the mediterranean region , one that would entail a security dividend over the longer term . to put it in a nutshell : renewable energy sources promote development , and development promotes security .
looked at in this way , the evolving desertec consortium should provide a new and innovative boost for the union for the mediterranean . authors : matthias ruchser , dr. stefan gaenzle -lrb- ar -rrb- editor : sean sinico matthias ruchser is a consultant in the energy industry and head of media and public relations at the german development institute / deutsches institut für entwicklungspolitik -lrb- die -rrb- .

" " the safety systems worked at kruemmel and there is no reason to question them , " he told a news conference in berlin . " tug of war " needs to end bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel has called for older nuclear facilities to be shut down but vattenfall 's failure to act according to established safety rules as well as regulators ' inability to uncover such breaches before an accident occurs prompted german environment minister sigmar gabriel to call for a single oversight body for the country 's nuclear power plants . " this tug of war between the states and the federal government does n't exist anywhere else in the world , " gabriel said . currently , the federal government is responsible for dealing with all radioactive material - including its production , use and disposal .
but the federal office for radiation protection delegates the task of fulfilling its regulations to authorities in germany 's 16 states . a similar set of rules applies to the operation of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants .
the states watch the plant operators and the federal government watches the states .
but each level of government oversight relies on separate sets of consultants and expert panels , which are largely chosen by the political party in power at the state or federal level regulation of nuclear power plants is often a major bone of political contention . greens want stricter inspections the greens chancellor candidate , renate kuenast , said state agencies needed to be more stringent in their tests of nuclear plant operators ' practices , adding that it was " completely irresponsible " for state authorities to allow kruemmel to be reopened with a safety sensor missing . " you ca n't get a registration sticker for your car before an inspector has seen that problems had been taken care of , " she told the tagesspiegel am sonntag newpaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recent poll shows 72 percent of germans want nuclear power phased out one of the issues where germany 's two largest parties are diametrically opposed , the use , oversight and future of nuclear power seems certain to become a major issue as german politicians begin a summer of campaigning for september 's general election . frank-walter steinmeier , the current foreign minister and social democratic chancellor candidate , has the kruemmel incident shook his faith in the safety of nuclear power and called for the plant to be permanently closed . chancellor angela merkel , who also heads the christian democratic union , has said the current regulations have proven to work . but it 's not politicians who are best suited to decide on the fate of nuclear power , baden-wuerttemberg 's premier guenther oettinger told the bild am sonntag newspaper .

low rainfall , deforestation , soil erosion and desertification all contribute to the hard life of mauritania 's farmers . ' drought is not simply our inevitable destiny , ' says cheikh abdellahai , vice president of the environmental protection agency , ampemn .
' like any other people in the world , mauritanians have always adapted themselves to their environment .
so if drought is not a prerequisite then we can do something about it .
we could improve our quality of life – we could for example construct artificial oases in the desert . ' cheikh abdellahib knows what he is talking about .
since the 1970s he and his colleagues have been leading a campaign to combat the effects of drought in mauritania .
they plant trees in sandy areas to stop the desert from spreading .
they cultivate arable land to be able to plant fruit and vegetables .
and they support local communities in building facilities to catch and store water to enable them to saturate parts of the dry earth . forced migration because of water scarcity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fleeing to the cities after bad droughts : nomads mauritania has a hot , dry climate and although it is three times the size of germany it has a population of only three million .
the sahara stretches deep into the country and a large percentage of the population has since moved to the cities - a result of the infertile land and inhospitable rural conditions .
in 1970 and 1984 two particularly bad droughts caused a massive migratory movement .
the nomadic population fled to the cities in desperation - and then stayed .
the state support system at the time was almost non-existent , says cheikh abdellahi .
' politicians gave fiery speeches .
but in the end nothing was done .
lately , politicians do seem to be developing a consciousness of environmental problems ; there is even a state secretary for the environment .
i hope that actual environmental strategies emerge from this .

the hijacking has led to a debate in germany and the question what can be done about it . the situation for the hansa stavanger 's crew of 24 has become desperate .
according to germany 's spiegel magazine , the captain reported to his wife a week ago that there was a lack of drinking water , food and medication .
many crew members are supposedly ill .
negotiations between the pirates and the hamburg based ship owner leonhardt & blumberg are ongoing .
the pirates originally demanded $ 15 million ransom .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : special forces during a naval training mission three weeks after the hijacking special troops from the german federal police prepared to storm the ship and free the hostages .
two hundred german anti-terror specialists practised the operation on board of the us navy ship uss boxer less then fifty nautical miles away from the hansa stavanger .
but before german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble in berlin could give the go-ahead for the operation , us national security advisor james jones in washington called the operation off , saying it was too risky .
but without american logistical support germany 's elite troops were grounded .
jason alderwick , a maritime defense analyst with the international institute for strategic studies -lrb- iiss -rrb- in london , supports the stance taken by the us .
" the german contribution is just part of a wider international coalition .
so unilaterally deciding to storm a ship is n't necessarily the right approach . "
better funding and cooperation wolfgang bosbach , the vice-chairman of chancellor angela merkel 's christian-democratic group in parliament , argues that german police have the right to storm a hijacked german ship in any case .
" when we need the support of other states , we ca n't decide alone .
we need our own capacities as far as helicopter air transport is concerned .
we need better air supported reconnaissance and we need better communication between the authorities in charge . "
bosbach wants better funding , so germany can carry out operations without international help . and he also urges better cooperation between the defense and interior ministries .
there was speculation in the media , that defense minister franz-josef jung asked washington to stop interior minister schaeuble .
jung is in charge of the military , schaeuble is responsible for the police , which includes the unit that was supposed to carry out the anti-terror operation .
wolfgang bosbach does n't want to address the media speculation , but emphasizes that the german military has a special mandate for fighting piracy at the horn of africa , but that it is the general responsibility of germany 's federal police to free hostages when necessary .
bosbach adds that for germany , given its recent century history , every international military operation remains a balancing act between modesty and responsibility .
" we have good reasons to say ' never first , never alone , never without an international mandate ' .
but when we say a , we also must say b. when we decide to send troops , we must make sure that they are equipped appropriately . "
fighting the root problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : capturing and trying somali pirates is difficult still , the larger question remains whether soldiers and policemen can stop pirates .
for more than six months now , the navies of nine european nations have been patrolling the somali coastline .
and yet piracy has continued .
wolfgang bosbach admits that the military alone ca n't stop piracy .
" we are talking here about organized crime .
we have to look at the causes .
that 's why besides the defense and interior ministries , foreign affairs and development ministries must be involved as well . "
still , he says , the european military patrols around the somali coast - operation atalanta - has had an impact : " the shipping companies must decide to join a convoy , which gets navy protection .
none of the convoys we accompanied got into trouble . "
jason alderwick agrees in principle that piracy is a matter of international crime and therefore rather a police than a military issue : " it would be great to hand over the operation to coast guard assets .
but europeans do n't have a huge coast guard , which is able to deploy in a counter piracy role .
so you have to go with the forces and capabilities you have .
the military instrument is a blunt instrument , but it 's adapting as best as it can with the situation down there . "
overall , says alderwick , europe 's atalanta operation at the horn of africa makes sense .
" there has arguably been an escalation in the number of piracy attacks , but that is n't a direct consequence of the operation .
it 's just a consequence of the overall situation .
without atalanta , piracy in the region would definitely have been worse . "

the hijacking has led to a debate in germany and the question what can be done about it . the situation for the hansa stavanger 's crew of 24 has become desperate .
according to germany 's spiegel magazine , the captain reported to his wife a week ago that there was a lack of drinking water , food and medication .
many crew members are supposedly ill .
negotiations between the pirates and the hamburg based ship owner leonhardt & blumberg are ongoing .
the pirates originally demanded $ 15 million ransom .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : special forces during a naval training mission three weeks after the hijacking special troops from the german federal police prepared to storm the ship and free the hostages .
two hundred german anti-terror specialists practised the operation on board of the us navy ship uss boxer less then fifty nautical miles away from the hansa stavanger .
but before german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble in berlin could give the go-ahead for the operation , us national security advisor james jones in washington called the operation off , saying it was too risky .
but without american logistical support germany 's elite troops were grounded .
jason alderwick , a maritime defense analyst with the international institute for strategic studies -lrb- iiss -rrb- in london , supports the stance taken by the us .
" the german contribution is just part of a wider international coalition .
so unilaterally deciding to storm a ship is n't necessarily the right approach . "
better funding and cooperation wolfgang bosbach , the vice-chairman of chancellor angela merkel 's christian-democratic group in parliament , argues that german police have the right to storm a hijacked german ship in any case .
" when we need the support of other states , we ca n't decide alone .
we need our own capacities as far as helicopter air transport is concerned .
we need better air supported reconnaissance and we need better communication between the authorities in charge . "
bosbach wants better funding , so germany can carry out operations without international help . and he also urges better cooperation between the defense and interior ministries .
there was speculation in the media , that defense minister franz-josef jung asked washington to stop interior minister schaeuble .
jung is in charge of the military , schaeuble is responsible for the police , which includes the unit that was supposed to carry out the anti-terror operation .
wolfgang bosbach does n't want to address the media speculation , but emphasizes that the german military has a special mandate for fighting piracy at the horn of africa , but that it is the general responsibility of germany 's federal police to free hostages when necessary .
bosbach adds that for germany , given its recent century history , every international military operation remains a balancing act between modesty and responsibility .
" we have good reasons to say ' never first , never alone , never without an international mandate ' .
but when we say a , we also must say b. when we decide to send troops , we must make sure that they are equipped appropriately . "
fighting the root problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : capturing and trying somali pirates is difficult still , the larger question remains whether soldiers and policemen can stop pirates .
for more than six months now , the navies of nine european nations have been patrolling the somali coastline .
and yet piracy has continued .
wolfgang bosbach admits that the military alone ca n't stop piracy .
" we are talking here about organized crime .
we have to look at the causes .
that 's why besides the defense and interior ministries , foreign affairs and development ministries must be involved as well . "
still , he says , the european military patrols around the somali coast - operation atalanta - has had an impact : " the shipping companies must decide to join a convoy , which gets navy protection .
none of the convoys we accompanied got into trouble . "
jason alderwick agrees in principle that piracy is a matter of international crime and therefore rather a police than a military issue : " it would be great to hand over the operation to coast guard assets .
but europeans do n't have a huge coast guard , which is able to deploy in a counter piracy role .
so you have to go with the forces and capabilities you have .
the military instrument is a blunt instrument , but it 's adapting as best as it can with the situation down there . "
overall , says alderwick , europe 's atalanta operation at the horn of africa makes sense .
" there has arguably been an escalation in the number of piracy attacks , but that is n't a direct consequence of the operation .
it 's just a consequence of the overall situation .
without atalanta , piracy in the region would definitely have been worse . "

" today we have taken a step forward -lrb- towards the project 's realization -rrb- , " said nikolaus von bomhard , head of munich re , which hosted the signing .
the firms grouped under the desertec industrial initiative -lrb- dii -rrb- plan to build solar power generators in north africa and the middle east .
the massive project will see investments of up to 400 billion euros over a period of 40 years .
" of course it is still a long way off , but the enormous interest in the scheme shows we are on the right path , " a spokesman for munich re said .
a study suggests that with the use of thermal power plants and high voltage direct current transmission lines , desertec 's pioneering foray into the desert could meet 15 percent of europe 's electricity needs by the year 2050 .
bildunterschrift : the project could meet 15 percent of europe 's electricity needs by 2050 gerhard knies , chairman of the desertec supervisory board said the desert is an obvious source of clean power .
" within six hours deserts receive more energy from the sun than humankind consumes within a year , " he said adding that the " time appears right for a truly comprehensive maneuver to combat climate change . "
firms hope project will help combat climate change other companies involved in the venture are the spanish firm abengoa solar and the algerian conglomerate cevital as well as several german banks and engineering companies .
under the agreement , a desertec study office to be established by october will have three years to detail investment plans to create the network of solar farms .
representatives of the arab league and the egyptian energy ministry were also present at the signing of the protocol .
munich re board member torsten jeworrek said the european companies involved had pledged to work " as equals in a sincere and fair " manner with the producer countries .
" if we 're successful , we 'll make a huge contribution to the fight against climate change , " jeworrek said .
environmental organization greenpeace has welcomed the initiative and urged the german government to support it by channelling research funds earmarked for nuclear energy to the solar energy project .
critics slam huge costs but critics of the desertec project have warned that the political situation in many of the producer countries in north africa is unstable .

the new rules are intended to prevent future financial collapse . analysts say the meltdown of the financial system , which has led to the worst recession in over 60 years , was due in part to banks ' inability to assess the risk level of some of their investments .
if the proposal becomes law - which requires the approval from the eu parliament and the 27 eu governments - banks would have to demonstrate that they fully understood the risks involved when making an investment , especially in the case of highly-complex " re-securitization " investments .
banks that encouraged staff to take too much risk by offering bonuses could face sanctions .
in addition , the proposal calls for banks to keep more money and assets on hand to cover any potential losses if the value of an investment were to significantly deflate . " the proposal aims to ensure that banks hold enough capital to reflect the true risks they are taking , " european commission chief jose manuel barroso said in a statement .
he added that the plan would " legally oblige banks and investment firms to have remuneration policies consistent with effective risk management . "
the european banking federation said that the banks had anticipated the changes and were not surprised by monday 's announcement .
" what we do n't want is a supervisory authority to determine the level or form of remuneration , " an ebf spokeswoman said .
" we also insist that the new rules in terms of remuneration are international .
we want a level playing field . "
the new rules are not likely to take effect until the end of 2011 , and therefore , are not meant to address the current financial crisis .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 13.07.2009 original eau de cologne celebrates 300 years großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it smells like an italian spring morning , said the perfumer the world 's oldest existing perfume maker is celebrating its 300th birthday .
the original eau de cologne , survived wars and imitations and still sells well in a market saturated with modern scents . the first bottle of eau de cologne was created by giovanni maria farina , an italian expatriate living in the eastern german city of cologne .
on july 13 , 1709 , farina opened a luxury goods shop where the fragrance was sold . in a letter to his brother dated in 1709 , farina wrote , " i have discovered a scent that reminds me of an italian spring morning , of daffodils and orange blossoms after the rain . "
he named it after the city he lived in . over the course of the last three centuries , only 30 people have been privy to the secret recipe - including johann maria farina , a descendant of the perfumer and the company 's current managing director . " it 's crucial that the original eau de cologne always smells the same , " said farina .
" like champagne that 's made from many different wines and has a specific taste or aroma . " an eau de cologne differs from a so-called eau de toilette in that it has a smaller concentration of essential oils , which give the solution its scent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the original eau de cologne was a top seller in giovanni maria farina 's luxury shop napoleon allegedly used one vial of the valuable liquid each day .
a vial cost a week 's wages for a master craftsman - or well over 1,000 euros -lrb- $ 1,400 -rrb- in today 's money - making the perfume only accessible to the extremely wealthy . but the hefty price tag did n't always mean big earnings for farina 's company . " there were many crises , " said the firm 's current managing director .
" the french revolution and the first and second world wars were the biggest crises for us - not because our customers could n't pay but because we were cut off from the raw materials and could n't produce . " a respected imitation in addition to political conflicts , the original eau de cologne has also had to deal with stiff competition from a popular imitation : 4711 . in the 18th century , the muehlens , a merchant family from cologne , produced a citrus-based scent similar to the original eau de cologne , calling it by the house number of the factory on glockengasse in downtown cologne .
while 4711 is known around the world - and boasts an over 200-year history - it 's not the original . in 1994 , the muehlens family sold its company to the german wella corporation .
it was then acquired by procter and gamble in 2003 and returned to german hands in 2007 , when the company was bought by maeurer und wirtz , best known for its perfume brand tabac original . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 4711 has a large following of its own while farina 's eau de cologne may be the true original , 4711 has always been the more commercially successful scent . it is marketed in 75 countries today and is especially popular with the older generation of germans .
the fragrance also sells well in japan , where men perfume their hair with it . farina , however , said there are no bad feelings between his family and the muehlens , the founders of 4711 . " i once had a dance class with a daughter of ferdinand muehlens and know the others as well , " said farina .
" there have never been any problems between the two families . " today , the farina house in cologne 's old town has its very own museum , where visitors can learn more about the art of perfume making and the original koelnisch wasser - eau de cologne . author : catrin moederler -lrb- kjb / ab -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she is a lawyer , who gained entrance to the faculty of law at tehran university in 1965 . in 1975 she became the first woman in the history of iran 's justice system , to be made the president of bench 24 of the tehran city court .
she then set up her own practice after receiving her lawyer 's license in 1992 .
ebadi has written several books and many of her articles have been published in iranian journals .
one of the most talked about topics in the world right now is the disputed iranian presidential election .
do you believe the vote was fair ?
with their street protests , iranians have shown that they do not accept the announced results of the election which they believe was rigged .
you have also said that a new election will take place .
do you believe this will make any difference ?
the iranian people have called for a new election . and it is also my belief that these new elections should take place under the supervision of the united nations .
otherwise these disputes will continue and the people will again protest against election manipulation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2003 nobel peace prize winner 's visit generated a lot of media attention the scale of protests in iran and the reaction of the police indicate that the government was guilty .
if the elections were fair , as the government claims , why was there such a strong presence of security forces in the streets ?
that is a good question .
what happened in iran is an obvious human rights violation .
when the iranian people demonstrated peacefully , there were no problems – not even a window was broken .
but towards the end of the demonstrations shots were fired from office buildings .
some died and many more were injured .
that was the beginning of the state 's crackdown .
that night at 3 a.m. , a student residence was attacked , five students were shot dead and several were injured . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ebadi meets deutsche welle 's director-general , erik bettermann can other countries or institutions such as the united nations make a difference , or is it up to the iranian people now ?
first and foremost it is iranians who are fighting for their rights .
this movement , which has in the meantime turned into a national movement , was created by the iranian people .
president mahmoud ahmadinejad and the iranian government have said that the west is to blame for the protests in iran . what ahmadinejad has said is a major insult .
it is not true and in no way reflects the truth .
this is a pure national protest movement formed by the iranian people .
have these protests had any impact on the human rights situation ?
the movement started completely peacefully which shows the political maturity of the iranian people .
sadly , the people got a violent response to their peaceful movement .
when you give interviews like today , does it cause problems for you in iran ?
that 's not that important to me .
i consider this a task that has to be done .
will you go back to iran ?
of course i will return .
i have my husband , family and my house in iran .
and after i have finished my job here , i will go back .

if the elections were fair , as the government claims , why was there such a strong presence of security forces in the streets ?
that is a good question .
what happened in iran is an obvious human rights violation .
when the iranian people demonstrated peacefully , there were no problems – not even a window was broken .
but towards the end of the demonstrations shots were fired from office buildings .
some died and many more were injured .
that was the beginning of the state 's crackdown .

this movement , which has in the meantime turned into a national movement , was created by the iranian people .
president mahmoud ahmadinejad and the iranian government have said that the west is to blame for the protests in iran . what ahmadinejad has said is a major insult .
it is not true and in no way reflects the truth .
this is a pure national protest movement formed by the iranian people .
have these protests had any impact on the human rights situation ?
the movement started completely peacefully which shows the political maturity of the iranian people .
sadly , the people got a violent response to their peaceful movement .
when you give interviews like today , does it cause problems for you in iran ?
that 's not that important to me .
i consider this a task that has to be done .

a study suggests that with the use of thermal power plants and high voltage direct current transmission lines , desertec 's pioneering foray into the desert could meet 15 percent of europe 's electricity needs by the year 2050 .
bildunterschrift : the project could meet 15 percent of europe 's electricity needs by 2050 gerhard knies , chairman of the desertec supervisory board said the desert is an obvious source of clean power .
" within six hours deserts receive more energy from the sun than humankind consumes within a year , " he said adding that the " time appears right for a truly comprehensive maneuver to combat climate change . "
firms hope project will help combat climate change other companies involved in the venture are the spanish firm abengoa solar and the algerian conglomerate cevital as well as several german banks and engineering companies .
under the agreement , a desertec study office to be established by october will have three years to detail investment plans to create the network of solar farms .
representatives of the arab league and the egyptian energy ministry were also present at the signing of the protocol .
munich re board member torsten jeworrek said the european companies involved had pledged to work " as equals in a sincere and fair " manner with the producer countries .
" if we 're successful , we 'll make a huge contribution to the fight against climate change , " jeworrek said .
environmental organization greenpeace has welcomed the initiative and urged the german government to support it by channelling research funds earmarked for nuclear energy to the solar energy project .
critics slam huge costs but critics of the desertec project have warned that the political situation in many of the producer countries in north africa is unstable .
the european association for renewable energy , eurosolar , has said the desertec initiative is completely unviable .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the desertec initiative envisages solar power plants in africa and the middle east herman scheer , head of eurosolar and social democratic lawmaker in the german parliament said it was not necessary to go to north africa to collect the sun 's rays .
" we could invest the 400 billion euros here " scheer said , referring to the recession-hit eurozone .
he also said he preferred a network of decentralized operators that produced renewable energy from many sources rather than having one key project in the hands of major corporations .
" nothing will ever come of it -lrb- the project -rrb- , " scheer said .
he added that the astronomical costs of the gigantic project had been played down while the technical possibilities promised by it had been exaggerated. sp / afp / reuters / dpa editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on july 13 , 1709 , farina opened a luxury goods shop where the fragrance was sold . in a letter to his brother dated in 1709 , farina wrote , " i have discovered a scent that reminds me of an italian spring morning , of daffodils and orange blossoms after the rain . "
he named it after the city he lived in . over the course of the last three centuries , only 30 people have been privy to the secret recipe - including johann maria farina , a descendant of the perfumer and the company 's current managing director . " it 's crucial that the original eau de cologne always smells the same , " said farina .

while 4711 is known around the world - and boasts an over 200-year history - it 's not the original . in 1994 , the muehlens family sold its company to the german wella corporation .
it was then acquired by procter and gamble in 2003 and returned to german hands in 2007 , when the company was bought by maeurer und wirtz , best known for its perfume brand tabac original . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 4711 has a large following of its own while farina 's eau de cologne may be the true original , 4711 has always been the more commercially successful scent . it is marketed in 75 countries today and is especially popular with the older generation of germans .

she added that iranians are dependent upon support from outside the country in their current “ and very sensitive state of emergency . ”
the government ’ s actions “ aren ’ t compatible with the iranian constitution , nor with islam , nor with human rights . ”
she claimed that the protests would continue in new ways and that criticism from iranian religious leaders will weaken the new government even more .
the nobel prize winner appealed to germany and europe to put more political pressure on the iranian government .
“ i am against economic sanctions and military interventions , ” declared ebadi , explaining that both are introduced at the cost of the iranian people .
she added that this , in turn , creates new battle fronts and leads people to establish solidarity with their government .
instead , she affirmed , political sanctions must be imposed .
in negotiations and contractual relationships with iran , the west must “ constantly insist upon the preservation of human rights . ” this stands for western political as well as economic delegates to iran , according to ebadi .
for example , she suggests that countries could remove their embassies from iran without completely breaking off diplomatic relations .
ebadi noted that for the last two years , the west has engaged with iran exclusively on the issue of atomic conflict .
“ one wonders whether europeans are concerned only with their own security instead of with that of iranians , ” she said .
regarding economic relations with iran , ebadi said that “ weapons and software supporting the suppression or control of iranian citizens ” should be blocked .
“ ask siemens and nokia why they have released these types of technologies in iran . ”
ebadi , who is currently staying in bonn as a guest of deutsche welle , revealed that her negotiations with high-level un officials have prompted the un to send a delegation to tehran to contribute to reporting on the situation there .
“ if the government does not permit the delegation to enter , it will prove that protestors ’ grievances are representative of the truth , ” according to ebadi .
the human-rights advocate also pointed out that the number of victims during the most recent protests is much higher than officially reported .
she said the brutality and violence on behalf of the government continues as the militias stand under supervision from the revolutionary guard .
ebadi noted that the number of people arrested is also very high and includes some of her colleagues .
recently , for example , the attorneys abdolfatah sultani and mohammad ali dadkhah , two prominent figures in the coalition for the defense of human rights , were arrested . the organization is headed by ebadi .
the nobel prize winner further explained that the head of the iranian judiciary had , “ under political pressure , ” issued a regulation whereby attorneys can lose their licenses to practice at any time .
“ this regulation discouraged lawyers from defending political prisoners and others whose opinions conflict with the government ’ s position . ”
according to ebadi , many prisoners have been isolated and prevented from contacting their families or attorneys .
ebadi , who emphasized that she has no close personal relationship with any of the presidential candidates , commented on further developments in iran as follows : “ increasing criticism from influential spiritual leaders will lead the government to become weaker and lose its legitimacy . ”
she noted that the protests will continue and that the populace is creative and has found new forms of protest .
for example , calling “ god is great ” from one ’ s windows or roof in the evening has established itself as a new form of protest , while mourning mothers meet regularly to engage in sit-ins .
ebadi herself will remain in europe for the time being in order to campaign for human rights in iran .
thereafter , she will “ most certainly ” return to her homeland .

“ one wonders whether europeans are concerned only with their own security instead of with that of iranians , ” she said .
regarding economic relations with iran , ebadi said that “ weapons and software supporting the suppression or control of iranian citizens ” should be blocked .
“ ask siemens and nokia why they have released these types of technologies in iran . ”
ebadi , who is currently staying in bonn as a guest of deutsche welle , revealed that her negotiations with high-level un officials have prompted the un to send a delegation to tehran to contribute to reporting on the situation there .
“ if the government does not permit the delegation to enter , it will prove that protestors ’ grievances are representative of the truth , ” according to ebadi .
the human-rights advocate also pointed out that the number of victims during the most recent protests is much higher than officially reported .
she said the brutality and violence on behalf of the government continues as the militias stand under supervision from the revolutionary guard .
ebadi noted that the number of people arrested is also very high and includes some of her colleagues .
recently , for example , the attorneys abdolfatah sultani and mohammad ali dadkhah , two prominent figures in the coalition for the defense of human rights , were arrested . the organization is headed by ebadi .
the nobel prize winner further explained that the head of the iranian judiciary had , “ under political pressure , ” issued a regulation whereby attorneys can lose their licenses to practice at any time .
“ this regulation discouraged lawyers from defending political prisoners and others whose opinions conflict with the government ’ s position . ”
according to ebadi , many prisoners have been isolated and prevented from contacting their families or attorneys .
ebadi , who emphasized that she has no close personal relationship with any of the presidential candidates , commented on further developments in iran as follows : “ increasing criticism from influential spiritual leaders will lead the government to become weaker and lose its legitimacy . ”
she noted that the protests will continue and that the populace is creative and has found new forms of protest .
for example , calling “ god is great ” from one ’ s windows or roof in the evening has established itself as a new form of protest , while mourning mothers meet regularly to engage in sit-ins .
ebadi herself will remain in europe for the time being in order to campaign for human rights in iran .
thereafter , she will “ most certainly ” return to her homeland .

there are no details on when the trial would begin .
the filing of charges comes 10 days after medical experts at munich 's stadelheim prison said demjanjuk was fit to stand trial as long as court sessions do not exceed two 90-minute sessions per day .
demjanjuk 's family had said the octogenarian was too frail to withstand the proceedings because he suffers from kidney disease , cancer and arthritis .
most-wanted nazi war criminal demjanjuk has denied accusations that he was a guard at the sobibor death camp in nazi-occupied poland in 1943 and helped murder jews .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a monument in sobibor in eastern poland remembers the victims at the nazi death camp he has said he was captured by the germans in ukraine while fighting for the red army and held as a prisoner of war .
until being deported to germany in may , the ukrainian-born demjanjuk had headed the list of the simon wiesenthal center 's 10 most-wanted suspected war criminals .
efraim zuroff from the simon wiesenthal centre welcomed monday 's move by german prosecutors .
" this is obviously an important step forward , " zufroff told the associated press .
" we hope that the trial itself will be expedited so that justice will be achieved and he can be given the appropriate punishment . "
" the effort to bring demjanjuk to justice sends a very powerful message that the passage of time in no way diminishes the guilt of the perpetrator . "
possibly last holocaust trial demjanjuk was deported by us authorities from his home in ohio on may 12 .
he had appealed against the deportation in a last ditch attempt to avoid facing charges but had his request rejected by a german court last week . demjanjuk 's trial is the last expected time a german court will prosecute for holocaust crimes in the country .
demjanjuk has lived in the us since 1952 .
he arrived there as a refugee and worked in the car industry in cleveland , ohio .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a former id card of demjanjuk 's with the word " sobibor " printed on it in 1988 , he was sentenced to death in israel for crimes against humanity after holocaust survivors identified him as the notorious " ivan the terrible , " a guard at the treblinka death camp .
but israel 's highest court later overturned his sentence , after documents from the former soviet union indicated that " ivan the terrible " had probably been a different man .
demjanjuk returned to the us , but in 2002 had his us citizenship revoked because of his failure to disclose his work at nazi camps when he first arrived . sp / reuters / dpa editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she added that iranians are dependent upon support from outside the country in their current “ and very sensitive state of emergency . ”
the government ’ s actions “ aren ’ t compatible with the iranian constitution , nor with islam , nor with human rights . ”
she claimed that the protests would continue in new ways and that criticism from iranian religious leaders will weaken the new government even more .
the nobel prize winner appealed to germany and europe to put more political pressure on the iranian government .
“ i am against economic sanctions and military interventions , ” declared ebadi , explaining that both are introduced at the cost of the iranian people .
she added that this , in turn , creates new battle fronts and leads people to establish solidarity with their government .
instead , she affirmed , political sanctions must be imposed .
in negotiations and contractual relationships with iran , the west must “ constantly insist upon the preservation of human rights . ” this stands for western political as well as economic delegates to iran , according to ebadi .
for example , she suggests that countries could remove their embassies from iran without completely breaking off diplomatic relations .
ebadi noted that for the last two years , the west has engaged with iran exclusively on the issue of atomic conflict .
“ one wonders whether europeans are concerned only with their own security instead of with that of iranians , ” she said .
regarding economic relations with iran , ebadi said that “ weapons and software supporting the suppression or control of iranian citizens ” should be blocked .
“ ask siemens and nokia why they have released these types of technologies in iran . ”
ebadi , who is currently staying in bonn as a guest of deutsche welle , revealed that her negotiations with high-level un officials have prompted the un to send a delegation to tehran to contribute to reporting on the situation there .
“ if the government does not permit the delegation to enter , it will prove that protestors ’ grievances are representative of the truth , ” according to ebadi .
the human-rights advocate also pointed out that the number of victims during the most recent protests is much higher than officially reported .
she said the brutality and violence on behalf of the government continues as the militias stand under supervision from the revolutionary guard .
ebadi noted that the number of people arrested is also very high and includes some of her colleagues .
recently , for example , the attorneys abdolfatah sultani and mohammad ali dadkhah , two prominent figures in the coalition for the defense of human rights , were arrested . the organization is headed by ebadi .
the nobel prize winner further explained that the head of the iranian judiciary had , “ under political pressure , ” issued a regulation whereby attorneys can lose their licenses to practice at any time .
“ this regulation discouraged lawyers from defending political prisoners and others whose opinions conflict with the government ’ s position . ”
according to ebadi , many prisoners have been isolated and prevented from contacting their families or attorneys .
ebadi , who emphasized that she has no close personal relationship with any of the presidential candidates , commented on further developments in iran as follows : “ increasing criticism from influential spiritual leaders will lead the government to become weaker and lose its legitimacy . ”
she noted that the protests will continue and that the populace is creative and has found new forms of protest .
for example , calling “ god is great ” from one ’ s windows or roof in the evening has established itself as a new form of protest , while mourning mothers meet regularly to engage in sit-ins .
ebadi herself will remain in europe for the time being in order to campaign for human rights in iran .
thereafter , she will “ most certainly ” return to her homeland .

the 47-year-old diamond trader was sentenced to eight years in jail for actively supporting the terrorist group . prosecutors said aleem n. supported al-qaeda for years , raising money , distributing propaganda material and recruiting new members .
he is thought to be a key figure for the organization 's german operations .
the german man of pakistani descent was arrested in february of last year on allegations that he belonged to the terrorist group .
investigators say that in the summer of 2004 , he became part of the inner sanctum of the organization and received orders to recruit new members and supporters in germany .
investigators believe that by 2007 , aleem n. had sent four young fighters - together with letters of recommendation - to be trained in terror camps .

" after a fixed deadline , a un security council resolution should proclaim the adoption of the two-state solution . "
solana said , adding that such a resolution should include all the parameters of borders , refugees , jerusalem and security arrangements .

" " the safety systems worked at kruemmel and there is no reason to question them , " he told a news conference in berlin . " tug of war " needs to end bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel has called for older nuclear facilities to be shut down but vattenfall 's failure to act according to established safety rules as well as regulators ' inability to uncover such breaches before an accident occurs prompted german environment minister sigmar gabriel to call for a single oversight body for the country 's nuclear power plants . " this tug of war between the states and the federal government does n't exist anywhere else in the world , " gabriel said . currently , the federal government is responsible for dealing with all radioactive material - including its production , use and disposal .
but the federal office for radiation protection delegates the task of fulfilling its regulations to authorities in germany 's 16 states . a similar set of rules applies to the operation of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants .
the states watch the plant operators and the federal government watches the states .
but each level of government oversight relies on separate sets of consultants and expert panels , which are largely chosen by the political party in power at the state or federal level regulation of nuclear power plants is often a major bone of political contention . greens want stricter inspections the greens chancellor candidate , renate kuenast , said state agencies needed to be more stringent in their tests of nuclear plant operators ' practices , adding that it was " completely irresponsible " for state authorities to allow kruemmel to be reopened with a safety sensor missing . " you ca n't get a registration sticker for your car before an inspector has seen that problems had been taken care of , " she told the tagesspiegel am sonntag newpaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recent poll shows 72 percent of germans want nuclear power phased out one of the issues where germany 's two largest parties are diametrically opposed , the use , oversight and future of nuclear power seems certain to become a major issue as german politicians begin a summer of campaigning for september 's general election . frank-walter steinmeier , the current foreign minister and social democratic chancellor candidate , has the kruemmel incident shook his faith in the safety of nuclear power and called for the plant to be permanently closed . chancellor angela merkel , who also heads the christian democratic union , has said the current regulations have proven to work . but it 's not politicians who are best suited to decide on the fate of nuclear power , baden-wuerttemberg 's premier guenther oettinger told the bild am sonntag newspaper . " whether and for how long nuclear power plants run should be decided by engineers , technicians and regulators but not by candidates for the chancellery , " he said . sms / afp / dpa / ap editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 13.07.2009 african solar power for europe could promote security , experts say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : capturing sunshine could lead to energy development and security hurdles remain , but mediterranean countries should cooperate on economic development and environmental protection including a new solar power project , according to guest commentators matthias ruchser and stefan gaenzle . last year , on july 13 , the " union for the mediterranean " was launched amid much diplomatic fanfare .
heads of state and government from 43 european union and the mediterranean-rim countries had accepted an invitation to paris extended by french president nicolas sarkozy to give new impetus to mediterranean cooperation .
the union for the mediterranean follows up on the barcelona process , initiated in 1995 , which also had a pronounced security dimension . ultimately , the union for the mediterranean set itself a six-point agenda , among others the " mediterranean solar plan . "
the recent gaza war has upset these plans .
no high-ranking ministerial meetings have taken place since december 2008 , and some important issues dealing with the institutional design of the union have been shelved . similar to the constraints imposed on the baltic sea co-operation of the 1970s -lrb- due to the east-west conflict -rrb- , it would be recommendable for the union for the mediterranean to put high politics as well as security issues aside and focus on economic matters and the protection of the environment and the climate .
against this backdrop , can it be mere coincidence that it was precisely for july 13 that the munich re group issued invitations for the inaugural meeting of the so-called " desertec initiative " in munich ? energy security based on solar thermal power plants ? bildunterschrift : the desertec project aims to feed solar power from africa and the middle east to the eu while the idea behind the desertec project is nothing new , it is still fascinating : solar thermal power plants in northern africa would contribute to supplying europe with the clean energy it needs .
a total of roughly 400 billion euros in investments would be needed by the year 2050 to cover 15 percent of europe 's electricity needs .
so is the - privately financed - desertec consortium set to get the better of the european mediterranean solar plan , or indeed to replace it ? to start with the good news : the technology needed to generate solar thermal power , known as concentrated solar power -lrb- csp -rrb- , is already available , as are the high-voltage , direct current -lrb- hvdc -rrb- electric power transmission lines required to transport it .
in kramer junction , california , the first parabolic trough power plants have been connected to the grid since the mid-1980s .
more advanced csp power plants have been built in the united states and spain and are already several years old .
another csp plant , an integrated solar combined cycle plant -lrb- iscc -rrb- , is currently under construction in kuraymat , egypt .
parabolic trough power plants are already in the planning stages in some other countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german companies lead the field in concentrated solar power technology another piece of good news - at least from the german perspective - is that german companies lead the field when it comes to csp technology .
the parabolic mirrors are built by flabeg , the receivers by schott solar , the turbines , generators and control technology are available from siemens , and solar millennium and man ferrostaal operate as general contractors . looking for safe locations for solar plants is the only task remaining to secure the financing for the desertec initiative and to integrate it politically into the union for the mediterranean ?
not quite .
it will not prove so easy to enlist the southern mediterranean-rim countries as potential locations for power plants .
many of these countries are ruled by authoritarian regimes of different stripes , and there is an ever-present danger in the region of terrorist attacks .
population growth and unemployment are also very high in this part of the world , and such social problems are aggravated by migration pressure from sub-saharan africa .
all in all , an explosive mix , with important implications for our security as well . most of the non-eu mediterranean-rim countries have major development needs .
one prerequisite for development is energy .
however , most of the power plants currently in operation there are conventional , carbon-based plants .
in times of an accelerated climate change that has the gravest of implications for developing and transition countries , the latter need to switch their energy supply , as early as possible , to a non-conventional energy path , and that means , in effect , to renewable energy sources . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. stefan gaenzle is an expert on multilateral development cooperation with die large-scale solar thermal power plants may offer one solution to the problem .
even though energy production costs - 15 euros to 23 euro cents per kilowatt hour - are still higher than those for conventional power plants .
it would be possible -based , for example , on the model of the german renewable energy law - to close the viability gap either by raising the feed-in tariff for renewable electricity -lrb- to be paid by the end user -rrb- or by having government set ambitious quotas for the share of renewably generated electricity as a means of attracting investments in csp plants .
the important thing is to set clear-cut framework conditions for electricity sales in countries with the potential to operate csp plants , in this way ensuring that the billions that need to be invested will pay off in the long term for private investors . grid development as a pan-european task some successes in economic transformation have already been observed in the context of the euro-mediterranean partnership , in tunisia for instance , although there has been less movement when it comes to political change .
be that as it may , though , the union for the mediterranean does offer a dynamic normative frame of reference for the southern mediterranean-rim countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias ruchser is an energy consultant and head of media and public relations at die however , the eu 's tasks in the framework of the union for the mediterranean should not be to offset the financial risk for private-sector projects like the desertec initiative .
this , though , may be a different matter when it comes to support for the development and expansion of the power grid in the overall mediterranean region .
grid development must be viewed under the aspect of public welfare , and here the eu could provide an important contribution to collective energy security in the mediterranean region , one that would entail a security dividend over the longer term . to put it in a nutshell : renewable energy sources promote development , and development promotes security .
looked at in this way , the evolving desertec consortium should provide a new and innovative boost for the union for the mediterranean . authors : matthias ruchser , dr. stefan gaenzle -lrb- ar -rrb- editor : sean sinico matthias ruchser is a consultant in the energy industry and head of media and public relations at the german development institute / deutsches institut für entwicklungspolitik -lrb- die -rrb- .

heads of state and government from 43 european union and the mediterranean-rim countries had accepted an invitation to paris extended by french president nicolas sarkozy to give new impetus to mediterranean cooperation .
the union for the mediterranean follows up on the barcelona process , initiated in 1995 , which also had a pronounced security dimension . ultimately , the union for the mediterranean set itself a six-point agenda , among others the " mediterranean solar plan . "
the recent gaza war has upset these plans .
no high-ranking ministerial meetings have taken place since december 2008 , and some important issues dealing with the institutional design of the union have been shelved . similar to the constraints imposed on the baltic sea co-operation of the 1970s -lrb- due to the east-west conflict -rrb- , it would be recommendable for the union for the mediterranean to put high politics as well as security issues aside and focus on economic matters and the protection of the environment and the climate .
against this backdrop , can it be mere coincidence that it was precisely for july 13 that the munich re group issued invitations for the inaugural meeting of the so-called " desertec initiative " in munich ? energy security based on solar thermal power plants ? bildunterschrift : the desertec project aims to feed solar power from africa and the middle east to the eu while the idea behind the desertec project is nothing new , it is still fascinating : solar thermal power plants in northern africa would contribute to supplying europe with the clean energy it needs .
a total of roughly 400 billion euros in investments would be needed by the year 2050 to cover 15 percent of europe 's electricity needs .
so is the - privately financed - desertec consortium set to get the better of the european mediterranean solar plan , or indeed to replace it ? to start with the good news : the technology needed to generate solar thermal power , known as concentrated solar power -lrb- csp -rrb- , is already available , as are the high-voltage , direct current -lrb- hvdc -rrb- electric power transmission lines required to transport it .
in kramer junction , california , the first parabolic trough power plants have been connected to the grid since the mid-1980s .
more advanced csp power plants have been built in the united states and spain and are already several years old .
another csp plant , an integrated solar combined cycle plant -lrb- iscc -rrb- , is currently under construction in kuraymat , egypt .
parabolic trough power plants are already in the planning stages in some other countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german companies lead the field in concentrated solar power technology another piece of good news - at least from the german perspective - is that german companies lead the field when it comes to csp technology .
the parabolic mirrors are built by flabeg , the receivers by schott solar , the turbines , generators and control technology are available from siemens , and solar millennium and man ferrostaal operate as general contractors . looking for safe locations for solar plants is the only task remaining to secure the financing for the desertec initiative and to integrate it politically into the union for the mediterranean ?
not quite .
it will not prove so easy to enlist the southern mediterranean-rim countries as potential locations for power plants .
many of these countries are ruled by authoritarian regimes of different stripes , and there is an ever-present danger in the region of terrorist attacks .
population growth and unemployment are also very high in this part of the world , and such social problems are aggravated by migration pressure from sub-saharan africa .
all in all , an explosive mix , with important implications for our security as well . most of the non-eu mediterranean-rim countries have major development needs .
one prerequisite for development is energy .
however , most of the power plants currently in operation there are conventional , carbon-based plants .

the new rules are intended to prevent future financial collapse . analysts say the meltdown of the financial system , which has led to the worst recession in over 60 years , was due in part to banks ' inability to assess the risk level of some of their investments .
if the proposal becomes law - which requires the approval from the eu parliament and the 27 eu governments - banks would have to demonstrate that they fully understood the risks involved when making an investment , especially in the case of highly-complex " re-securitization " investments .
banks that encouraged staff to take too much risk by offering bonuses could face sanctions .
in addition , the proposal calls for banks to keep more money and assets on hand to cover any potential losses if the value of an investment were to significantly deflate . " the proposal aims to ensure that banks hold enough capital to reflect the true risks they are taking , " european commission chief jose manuel barroso said in a statement .
he added that the plan would " legally oblige banks and investment firms to have remuneration policies consistent with effective risk management . "
the european banking federation said that the banks had anticipated the changes and were not surprised by monday 's announcement .
" what we do n't want is a supervisory authority to determine the level or form of remuneration , " an ebf spokeswoman said .
" we also insist that the new rules in terms of remuneration are international .
we want a level playing field . "
the new rules are not likely to take effect until the end of 2011 , and therefore , are not meant to address the current financial crisis .
however , the eu said the proposal could " strengthen market confidence and banks ' financial health . " vj / dpa / ap / reuters / afp editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

parabolic trough power plants are already in the planning stages in some other countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german companies lead the field in concentrated solar power technology another piece of good news - at least from the german perspective - is that german companies lead the field when it comes to csp technology .
the parabolic mirrors are built by flabeg , the receivers by schott solar , the turbines , generators and control technology are available from siemens , and solar millennium and man ferrostaal operate as general contractors . looking for safe locations for solar plants is the only task remaining to secure the financing for the desertec initiative and to integrate it politically into the union for the mediterranean ?
not quite .
it will not prove so easy to enlist the southern mediterranean-rim countries as potential locations for power plants .
many of these countries are ruled by authoritarian regimes of different stripes , and there is an ever-present danger in the region of terrorist attacks .
population growth and unemployment are also very high in this part of the world , and such social problems are aggravated by migration pressure from sub-saharan africa .
all in all , an explosive mix , with important implications for our security as well . most of the non-eu mediterranean-rim countries have major development needs .
one prerequisite for development is energy .
however , most of the power plants currently in operation there are conventional , carbon-based plants .
in times of an accelerated climate change that has the gravest of implications for developing and transition countries , the latter need to switch their energy supply , as early as possible , to a non-conventional energy path , and that means , in effect , to renewable energy sources . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. stefan gaenzle is an expert on multilateral development cooperation with die large-scale solar thermal power plants may offer one solution to the problem .
even though energy production costs - 15 euros to 23 euro cents per kilowatt hour - are still higher than those for conventional power plants .
it would be possible -based , for example , on the model of the german renewable energy law - to close the viability gap either by raising the feed-in tariff for renewable electricity -lrb- to be paid by the end user -rrb- or by having government set ambitious quotas for the share of renewably generated electricity as a means of attracting investments in csp plants .
the important thing is to set clear-cut framework conditions for electricity sales in countries with the potential to operate csp plants , in this way ensuring that the billions that need to be invested will pay off in the long term for private investors . grid development as a pan-european task some successes in economic transformation have already been observed in the context of the euro-mediterranean partnership , in tunisia for instance , although there has been less movement when it comes to political change .
be that as it may , though , the union for the mediterranean does offer a dynamic normative frame of reference for the southern mediterranean-rim countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias ruchser is an energy consultant and head of media and public relations at die however , the eu 's tasks in the framework of the union for the mediterranean should not be to offset the financial risk for private-sector projects like the desertec initiative .
this , though , may be a different matter when it comes to support for the development and expansion of the power grid in the overall mediterranean region .
grid development must be viewed under the aspect of public welfare , and here the eu could provide an important contribution to collective energy security in the mediterranean region , one that would entail a security dividend over the longer term . to put it in a nutshell : renewable energy sources promote development , and development promotes security .
looked at in this way , the evolving desertec consortium should provide a new and innovative boost for the union for the mediterranean . authors : matthias ruchser , dr. stefan gaenzle -lrb- ar -rrb- editor : sean sinico matthias ruchser is a consultant in the energy industry and head of media and public relations at the german development institute / deutsches institut für entwicklungspolitik -lrb- die -rrb- .

" today we have taken a step forward -lrb- towards the project 's realization -rrb- , " said nikolaus von bomhard , head of munich re , which hosted the signing .
the firms grouped under the desertec industrial initiative -lrb- dii -rrb- plan to build solar power generators in north africa and the middle east .
the massive project will see investments of up to 400 billion euros over a period of 40 years .
" of course it is still a long way off , but the enormous interest in the scheme shows we are on the right path , " a spokesman for munich re said .
a study suggests that with the use of thermal power plants and high voltage direct current transmission lines , desertec 's pioneering foray into the desert could meet 15 percent of europe 's electricity needs by the year 2050 .
bildunterschrift : the project could meet 15 percent of europe 's electricity needs by 2050 gerhard knies , chairman of the desertec supervisory board said the desert is an obvious source of clean power .
" within six hours deserts receive more energy from the sun than humankind consumes within a year , " he said adding that the " time appears right for a truly comprehensive maneuver to combat climate change . "
firms hope project will help combat climate change other companies involved in the venture are the spanish firm abengoa solar and the algerian conglomerate cevital as well as several german banks and engineering companies .
under the agreement , a desertec study office to be established by october will have three years to detail investment plans to create the network of solar farms .
representatives of the arab league and the egyptian energy ministry were also present at the signing of the protocol .
munich re board member torsten jeworrek said the european companies involved had pledged to work " as equals in a sincere and fair " manner with the producer countries .
" if we 're successful , we 'll make a huge contribution to the fight against climate change , " jeworrek said .
environmental organization greenpeace has welcomed the initiative and urged the german government to support it by channelling research funds earmarked for nuclear energy to the solar energy project .
critics slam huge costs but critics of the desertec project have warned that the political situation in many of the producer countries in north africa is unstable .
the european association for renewable energy , eurosolar , has said the desertec initiative is completely unviable .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the desertec initiative envisages solar power plants in africa and the middle east herman scheer , head of eurosolar and social democratic lawmaker in the german parliament said it was not necessary to go to north africa to collect the sun 's rays .
" we could invest the 400 billion euros here " scheer said , referring to the recession-hit eurozone .
he also said he preferred a network of decentralized operators that produced renewable energy from many sources rather than having one key project in the hands of major corporations .
" nothing will ever come of it -lrb- the project -rrb- , " scheer said .
he added that the astronomical costs of the gigantic project had been played down while the technical possibilities promised by it had been exaggerated. sp / afp / reuters / dpa editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it marks the highest rate since the eu currency was introduced in 2002 . a statement released by the ecb said " a total of 413,000 counterfeit euro banknotes were withdrawn from circulation , " in the first half of 2009 .
it added that in the main , those bills originated from the same places as previously seized forgeries , meaning no new counterfeit sources had been found .
although the increase is high , the european central bank also said it was important to consider the number of genuine banknotes - some 12.5 billion - in circulation during the same timeframe .
in germany , the number of fakes rose in keeping with the overall figure , costing the economy 1.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.23 billion -rrb- .
but the federal bank said that was an improvement of some 100,000 euros over the last six months of 2008 .
it attributed the drop to the fact that the majority of notes seized between january and june of 2009 were of relatively small denominations .
twenty and fifty euro notes made up almost fifty percent of the total number largely recovered from across the 16 nations which use the common currency .
earlier this month , police in bulgaria and poland made several arrests in connection with the production of conterfeit cash. tkw / afp / dpa / ap editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she added that iranians are dependent upon support from outside the country in their current “ and very sensitive state of emergency . ”
the government ’ s actions “ aren ’ t compatible with the iranian constitution , nor with islam , nor with human rights . ”
she claimed that the protests would continue in new ways and that criticism from iranian religious leaders will weaken the new government even more .
the nobel prize winner appealed to germany and europe to put more political pressure on the iranian government .
“ i am against economic sanctions and military interventions , ” declared ebadi , explaining that both are introduced at the cost of the iranian people .
she added that this , in turn , creates new battle fronts and leads people to establish solidarity with their government .
instead , she affirmed , political sanctions must be imposed .
in negotiations and contractual relationships with iran , the west must “ constantly insist upon the preservation of human rights . ” this stands for western political as well as economic delegates to iran , according to ebadi .
for example , she suggests that countries could remove their embassies from iran without completely breaking off diplomatic relations .
ebadi noted that for the last two years , the west has engaged with iran exclusively on the issue of atomic conflict .
“ one wonders whether europeans are concerned only with their own security instead of with that of iranians , ” she said .
regarding economic relations with iran , ebadi said that “ weapons and software supporting the suppression or control of iranian citizens ” should be blocked .
“ ask siemens and nokia why they have released these types of technologies in iran . ”
ebadi , who is currently staying in bonn as a guest of deutsche welle , revealed that her negotiations with high-level un officials have prompted the un to send a delegation to tehran to contribute to reporting on the situation there .
“ if the government does not permit the delegation to enter , it will prove that protestors ’ grievances are representative of the truth , ” according to ebadi .
the human-rights advocate also pointed out that the number of victims during the most recent protests is much higher than officially reported .
she said the brutality and violence on behalf of the government continues as the militias stand under supervision from the revolutionary guard .
ebadi noted that the number of people arrested is also very high and includes some of her colleagues .
recently , for example , the attorneys abdolfatah sultani and mohammad ali dadkhah , two prominent figures in the coalition for the defense of human rights , were arrested . the organization is headed by ebadi .
the nobel prize winner further explained that the head of the iranian judiciary had , “ under political pressure , ” issued a regulation whereby attorneys can lose their licenses to practice at any time .
“ this regulation discouraged lawyers from defending political prisoners and others whose opinions conflict with the government ’ s position . ”
according to ebadi , many prisoners have been isolated and prevented from contacting their families or attorneys .
ebadi , who emphasized that she has no close personal relationship with any of the presidential candidates , commented on further developments in iran as follows : “ increasing criticism from influential spiritual leaders will lead the government to become weaker and lose its legitimacy . ”
she noted that the protests will continue and that the populace is creative and has found new forms of protest .
for example , calling “ god is great ” from one ’ s windows or roof in the evening has established itself as a new form of protest , while mourning mothers meet regularly to engage in sit-ins .
ebadi herself will remain in europe for the time being in order to campaign for human rights in iran .
thereafter , she will “ most certainly ” return to her homeland .

the new rules are intended to prevent future financial collapse . analysts say the meltdown of the financial system , which has led to the worst recession in over 60 years , was due in part to banks ' inability to assess the risk level of some of their investments .
if the proposal becomes law - which requires the approval from the eu parliament and the 27 eu governments - banks would have to demonstrate that they fully understood the risks involved when making an investment , especially in the case of highly-complex " re-securitization " investments .
banks that encouraged staff to take too much risk by offering bonuses could face sanctions .
in addition , the proposal calls for banks to keep more money and assets on hand to cover any potential losses if the value of an investment were to significantly deflate . " the proposal aims to ensure that banks hold enough capital to reflect the true risks they are taking , " european commission chief jose manuel barroso said in a statement .
he added that the plan would " legally oblige banks and investment firms to have remuneration policies consistent with effective risk management . "
the european banking federation said that the banks had anticipated the changes and were not surprised by monday 's announcement .
" what we do n't want is a supervisory authority to determine the level or form of remuneration , " an ebf spokeswoman said .
" we also insist that the new rules in terms of remuneration are international .
we want a level playing field . "
the new rules are not likely to take effect until the end of 2011 , and therefore , are not meant to address the current financial crisis .

she is a lawyer , who gained entrance to the faculty of law at tehran university in 1965 . in 1975 she became the first woman in the history of iran 's justice system , to be made the president of bench 24 of the tehran city court .
she then set up her own practice after receiving her lawyer 's license in 1992 .
ebadi has written several books and many of her articles have been published in iranian journals .
one of the most talked about topics in the world right now is the disputed iranian presidential election .
do you believe the vote was fair ?
with their street protests , iranians have shown that they do not accept the announced results of the election which they believe was rigged .
you have also said that a new election will take place .
do you believe this will make any difference ?
the iranian people have called for a new election . and it is also my belief that these new elections should take place under the supervision of the united nations .
otherwise these disputes will continue and the people will again protest against election manipulation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2003 nobel peace prize winner 's visit generated a lot of media attention the scale of protests in iran and the reaction of the police indicate that the government was guilty .
if the elections were fair , as the government claims , why was there such a strong presence of security forces in the streets ?
that is a good question .
what happened in iran is an obvious human rights violation .
when the iranian people demonstrated peacefully , there were no problems – not even a window was broken .
but towards the end of the demonstrations shots were fired from office buildings .
some died and many more were injured .
that was the beginning of the state 's crackdown .
that night at 3 a.m. , a student residence was attacked , five students were shot dead and several were injured . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ebadi meets deutsche welle 's director-general , erik bettermann can other countries or institutions such as the united nations make a difference , or is it up to the iranian people now ?
first and foremost it is iranians who are fighting for their rights .
this movement , which has in the meantime turned into a national movement , was created by the iranian people .
president mahmoud ahmadinejad and the iranian government have said that the west is to blame for the protests in iran . what ahmadinejad has said is a major insult .
it is not true and in no way reflects the truth .
this is a pure national protest movement formed by the iranian people .
have these protests had any impact on the human rights situation ?
the movement started completely peacefully which shows the political maturity of the iranian people .
sadly , the people got a violent response to their peaceful movement .
when you give interviews like today , does it cause problems for you in iran ?
that 's not that important to me .
i consider this a task that has to be done .
will you go back to iran ?
of course i will return .
i have my husband , family and my house in iran .
and after i have finished my job here , i will go back .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 13.07.2009 eu commission proposal discourages risky investments by banks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission president barroso wants banks punished for excessive risk taking regulators will be able to fine banks in the european union that encourage excessive risk-taking , according to a draft proposal from eu officials .
the new rules are intended to prevent future financial collapse . analysts say the meltdown of the financial system , which has led to the worst recession in over 60 years , was due in part to banks ' inability to assess the risk level of some of their investments .
if the proposal becomes law - which requires the approval from the eu parliament and the 27 eu governments - banks would have to demonstrate that they fully understood the risks involved when making an investment , especially in the case of highly-complex " re-securitization " investments .
banks that encouraged staff to take too much risk by offering bonuses could face sanctions .
in addition , the proposal calls for banks to keep more money and assets on hand to cover any potential losses if the value of an investment were to significantly deflate . " the proposal aims to ensure that banks hold enough capital to reflect the true risks they are taking , " european commission chief jose manuel barroso said in a statement .
he added that the plan would " legally oblige banks and investment firms to have remuneration policies consistent with effective risk management . "
the european banking federation said that the banks had anticipated the changes and were not surprised by monday 's announcement .
" what we do n't want is a supervisory authority to determine the level or form of remuneration , " an ebf spokeswoman said .
" we also insist that the new rules in terms of remuneration are international .

the new rules are intended to prevent future financial collapse . analysts say the meltdown of the financial system , which has led to the worst recession in over 60 years , was due in part to banks ' inability to assess the risk level of some of their investments .
if the proposal becomes law - which requires the approval from the eu parliament and the 27 eu governments - banks would have to demonstrate that they fully understood the risks involved when making an investment , especially in the case of highly-complex " re-securitization " investments .
banks that encouraged staff to take too much risk by offering bonuses could face sanctions .
in addition , the proposal calls for banks to keep more money and assets on hand to cover any potential losses if the value of an investment were to significantly deflate . " the proposal aims to ensure that banks hold enough capital to reflect the true risks they are taking , " european commission chief jose manuel barroso said in a statement .
he added that the plan would " legally oblige banks and investment firms to have remuneration policies consistent with effective risk management . "
the european banking federation said that the banks had anticipated the changes and were not surprised by monday 's announcement .

she added that iranians are dependent upon support from outside the country in their current “ and very sensitive state of emergency . ”
the government ’ s actions “ aren ’ t compatible with the iranian constitution , nor with islam , nor with human rights . ”
she claimed that the protests would continue in new ways and that criticism from iranian religious leaders will weaken the new government even more .
the nobel prize winner appealed to germany and europe to put more political pressure on the iranian government .
“ i am against economic sanctions and military interventions , ” declared ebadi , explaining that both are introduced at the cost of the iranian people .
she added that this , in turn , creates new battle fronts and leads people to establish solidarity with their government .
instead , she affirmed , political sanctions must be imposed .
in negotiations and contractual relationships with iran , the west must “ constantly insist upon the preservation of human rights . ” this stands for western political as well as economic delegates to iran , according to ebadi .
for example , she suggests that countries could remove their embassies from iran without completely breaking off diplomatic relations .
ebadi noted that for the last two years , the west has engaged with iran exclusively on the issue of atomic conflict .
“ one wonders whether europeans are concerned only with their own security instead of with that of iranians , ” she said .
regarding economic relations with iran , ebadi said that “ weapons and software supporting the suppression or control of iranian citizens ” should be blocked .
“ ask siemens and nokia why they have released these types of technologies in iran . ”
ebadi , who is currently staying in bonn as a guest of deutsche welle , revealed that her negotiations with high-level un officials have prompted the un to send a delegation to tehran to contribute to reporting on the situation there .
“ if the government does not permit the delegation to enter , it will prove that protestors ’ grievances are representative of the truth , ” according to ebadi .
the human-rights advocate also pointed out that the number of victims during the most recent protests is much higher than officially reported .
she said the brutality and violence on behalf of the government continues as the militias stand under supervision from the revolutionary guard .
ebadi noted that the number of people arrested is also very high and includes some of her colleagues .
recently , for example , the attorneys abdolfatah sultani and mohammad ali dadkhah , two prominent figures in the coalition for the defense of human rights , were arrested . the organization is headed by ebadi .
the nobel prize winner further explained that the head of the iranian judiciary had , “ under political pressure , ” issued a regulation whereby attorneys can lose their licenses to practice at any time .
“ this regulation discouraged lawyers from defending political prisoners and others whose opinions conflict with the government ’ s position . ”
according to ebadi , many prisoners have been isolated and prevented from contacting their families or attorneys .
ebadi , who emphasized that she has no close personal relationship with any of the presidential candidates , commented on further developments in iran as follows : “ increasing criticism from influential spiritual leaders will lead the government to become weaker and lose its legitimacy . ”
she noted that the protests will continue and that the populace is creative and has found new forms of protest .
for example , calling “ god is great ” from one ’ s windows or roof in the evening has established itself as a new form of protest , while mourning mothers meet regularly to engage in sit-ins .
ebadi herself will remain in europe for the time being in order to campaign for human rights in iran .
thereafter , she will “ most certainly ” return to her homeland .

she added that iranians are dependent upon support from outside the country in their current “ and very sensitive state of emergency . ”
the government ’ s actions “ aren ’ t compatible with the iranian constitution , nor with islam , nor with human rights . ”
she claimed that the protests would continue in new ways and that criticism from iranian religious leaders will weaken the new government even more .
the nobel prize winner appealed to germany and europe to put more political pressure on the iranian government .
“ i am against economic sanctions and military interventions , ” declared ebadi , explaining that both are introduced at the cost of the iranian people .
she added that this , in turn , creates new battle fronts and leads people to establish solidarity with their government .
instead , she affirmed , political sanctions must be imposed .
in negotiations and contractual relationships with iran , the west must “ constantly insist upon the preservation of human rights . ” this stands for western political as well as economic delegates to iran , according to ebadi .
for example , she suggests that countries could remove their embassies from iran without completely breaking off diplomatic relations .
ebadi noted that for the last two years , the west has engaged with iran exclusively on the issue of atomic conflict .
“ one wonders whether europeans are concerned only with their own security instead of with that of iranians , ” she said .
regarding economic relations with iran , ebadi said that “ weapons and software supporting the suppression or control of iranian citizens ” should be blocked .
“ ask siemens and nokia why they have released these types of technologies in iran . ”
ebadi , who is currently staying in bonn as a guest of deutsche welle , revealed that her negotiations with high-level un officials have prompted the un to send a delegation to tehran to contribute to reporting on the situation there .
“ if the government does not permit the delegation to enter , it will prove that protestors ’ grievances are representative of the truth , ” according to ebadi .
the human-rights advocate also pointed out that the number of victims during the most recent protests is much higher than officially reported .
she said the brutality and violence on behalf of the government continues as the militias stand under supervision from the revolutionary guard .
ebadi noted that the number of people arrested is also very high and includes some of her colleagues .
recently , for example , the attorneys abdolfatah sultani and mohammad ali dadkhah , two prominent figures in the coalition for the defense of human rights , were arrested . the organization is headed by ebadi .
the nobel prize winner further explained that the head of the iranian judiciary had , “ under political pressure , ” issued a regulation whereby attorneys can lose their licenses to practice at any time .
“ this regulation discouraged lawyers from defending political prisoners and others whose opinions conflict with the government ’ s position . ”
according to ebadi , many prisoners have been isolated and prevented from contacting their families or attorneys .
ebadi , who emphasized that she has no close personal relationship with any of the presidential candidates , commented on further developments in iran as follows : “ increasing criticism from influential spiritual leaders will lead the government to become weaker and lose its legitimacy . ”
she noted that the protests will continue and that the populace is creative and has found new forms of protest .
for example , calling “ god is great ” from one ’ s windows or roof in the evening has established itself as a new form of protest , while mourning mothers meet regularly to engage in sit-ins .
ebadi herself will remain in europe for the time being in order to campaign for human rights in iran .
thereafter , she will “ most certainly ” return to her homeland .

" we condemn such acts , wherever they take place , " said wilhelm .
the 31-year-old muslim woman , marwa al-sherbini , was killed by a russian-born german during his appeal hearing for insulting her with racist slurs , in a case that sparked anti-german demonstrations outside the german embassy in tehran over the weekend . ahmadinejad on sunday demanded the united nations impose sanctions against germany and accused the west of applying double standards when it comes to human rights . the incident was proof for of the " brutality of the german government and clear evidence for corruption in the german justice system , " said ahmadinejad . ahmadinejad added that while berlin and washington had plenty to say regarding events in tehran following iran 's presidential elections , no reaction had been registered regarding al-sherbini 's murder . " we want condemnation from the united nations security council and the imposition of sanctions , " said the iranian president . government spokesman ulrich wilhelm acknowledged the iranian president 's remarks but insisted that there was no climate that promoted such actions . he said it was now a matter for the german justice system to punish those who commit these acts . on july 1 , the pregnant egyptian woman mother of a three-year-old was stabbed 18 times in a courtroom in the eastern german city of dresden by a russian-born german , who was appealing an earlier conviction for making racist slurs against the egyptian in a children 's playground in 2008 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : piracy hansa stavanger arrives at kenyan port after piracy ordeal in gulf of aden , piracy scourge continues unabated fighting piracy requires better international cooperation crime -pipe- 13.07.2009 fighting piracy militarily has mixed success so far großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conditions are bad for the crew aboard the hijacked vessel for over three months now the german container ship ms hansa stavanger and its crew are in the hands of somali pirates .
the hijacking has led to a debate in germany and the question what can be done about it . the situation for the hansa stavanger 's crew of 24 has become desperate .
according to germany 's spiegel magazine , the captain reported to his wife a week ago that there was a lack of drinking water , food and medication .
many crew members are supposedly ill .
negotiations between the pirates and the hamburg based ship owner leonhardt & blumberg are ongoing .
the pirates originally demanded $ 15 million ransom .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : special forces during a naval training mission three weeks after the hijacking special troops from the german federal police prepared to storm the ship and free the hostages .
two hundred german anti-terror specialists practised the operation on board of the us navy ship uss boxer less then fifty nautical miles away from the hansa stavanger .
but before german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble in berlin could give the go-ahead for the operation , us national security advisor james jones in washington called the operation off , saying it was too risky .
but without american logistical support germany 's elite troops were grounded .
jason alderwick , a maritime defense analyst with the international institute for strategic studies -lrb- iiss -rrb- in london , supports the stance taken by the us .
" the german contribution is just part of a wider international coalition .
so unilaterally deciding to storm a ship is n't necessarily the right approach . "
better funding and cooperation wolfgang bosbach , the vice-chairman of chancellor angela merkel 's christian-democratic group in parliament , argues that german police have the right to storm a hijacked german ship in any case .
" when we need the support of other states , we ca n't decide alone .
we need our own capacities as far as helicopter air transport is concerned .
we need better air supported reconnaissance and we need better communication between the authorities in charge . "
bosbach wants better funding , so germany can carry out operations without international help . and he also urges better cooperation between the defense and interior ministries .
there was speculation in the media , that defense minister franz-josef jung asked washington to stop interior minister schaeuble .
jung is in charge of the military , schaeuble is responsible for the police , which includes the unit that was supposed to carry out the anti-terror operation .
wolfgang bosbach does n't want to address the media speculation , but emphasizes that the german military has a special mandate for fighting piracy at the horn of africa , but that it is the general responsibility of germany 's federal police to free hostages when necessary .
bosbach adds that for germany , given its recent century history , every international military operation remains a balancing act between modesty and responsibility .
" we have good reasons to say ' never first , never alone , never without an international mandate ' .
but when we say a , we also must say b. when we decide to send troops , we must make sure that they are equipped appropriately . "
fighting the root problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : capturing and trying somali pirates is difficult still , the larger question remains whether soldiers and policemen can stop pirates .
for more than six months now , the navies of nine european nations have been patrolling the somali coastline .
and yet piracy has continued .
wolfgang bosbach admits that the military alone ca n't stop piracy .
" we are talking here about organized crime .
we have to look at the causes .
that 's why besides the defense and interior ministries , foreign affairs and development ministries must be involved as well . "

jason alderwick agrees in principle that piracy is a matter of international crime and therefore rather a police than a military issue : " it would be great to hand over the operation to coast guard assets .

the hijacking has led to a debate in germany and the question what can be done about it . the situation for the hansa stavanger 's crew of 24 has become desperate .
according to germany 's spiegel magazine , the captain reported to his wife a week ago that there was a lack of drinking water , food and medication .
many crew members are supposedly ill .
negotiations between the pirates and the hamburg based ship owner leonhardt & blumberg are ongoing .
the pirates originally demanded $ 15 million ransom .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : special forces during a naval training mission three weeks after the hijacking special troops from the german federal police prepared to storm the ship and free the hostages .
two hundred german anti-terror specialists practised the operation on board of the us navy ship uss boxer less then fifty nautical miles away from the hansa stavanger .
but before german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble in berlin could give the go-ahead for the operation , us national security advisor james jones in washington called the operation off , saying it was too risky .
but without american logistical support germany 's elite troops were grounded .
jason alderwick , a maritime defense analyst with the international institute for strategic studies -lrb- iiss -rrb- in london , supports the stance taken by the us .
" the german contribution is just part of a wider international coalition .
so unilaterally deciding to storm a ship is n't necessarily the right approach . "
better funding and cooperation wolfgang bosbach , the vice-chairman of chancellor angela merkel 's christian-democratic group in parliament , argues that german police have the right to storm a hijacked german ship in any case .
" when we need the support of other states , we ca n't decide alone .
we need our own capacities as far as helicopter air transport is concerned .
we need better air supported reconnaissance and we need better communication between the authorities in charge . "
bosbach wants better funding , so germany can carry out operations without international help . and he also urges better cooperation between the defense and interior ministries .
there was speculation in the media , that defense minister franz-josef jung asked washington to stop interior minister schaeuble .
jung is in charge of the military , schaeuble is responsible for the police , which includes the unit that was supposed to carry out the anti-terror operation .
wolfgang bosbach does n't want to address the media speculation , but emphasizes that the german military has a special mandate for fighting piracy at the horn of africa , but that it is the general responsibility of germany 's federal police to free hostages when necessary .
bosbach adds that for germany , given its recent century history , every international military operation remains a balancing act between modesty and responsibility .
" we have good reasons to say ' never first , never alone , never without an international mandate ' .
but when we say a , we also must say b. when we decide to send troops , we must make sure that they are equipped appropriately . "
fighting the root problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : capturing and trying somali pirates is difficult still , the larger question remains whether soldiers and policemen can stop pirates .
for more than six months now , the navies of nine european nations have been patrolling the somali coastline .
and yet piracy has continued .
wolfgang bosbach admits that the military alone ca n't stop piracy .
" we are talking here about organized crime .
we have to look at the causes .
that 's why besides the defense and interior ministries , foreign affairs and development ministries must be involved as well . "

there are no details on when the trial would begin .
the filing of charges comes 10 days after medical experts at munich 's stadelheim prison said demjanjuk was fit to stand trial as long as court sessions do not exceed two 90-minute sessions per day .
demjanjuk 's family had said the octogenarian was too frail to withstand the proceedings because he suffers from kidney disease , cancer and arthritis .

" this is obviously an important step forward , " zufroff told the associated press .
" we hope that the trial itself will be expedited so that justice will be achieved and he can be given the appropriate punishment . "
" the effort to bring demjanjuk to justice sends a very powerful message that the passage of time in no way diminishes the guilt of the perpetrator . "
possibly last holocaust trial demjanjuk was deported by us authorities from his home in ohio on may 12 .
he had appealed against the deportation in a last ditch attempt to avoid facing charges but had his request rejected by a german court last week . demjanjuk 's trial is the last expected time a german court will prosecute for holocaust crimes in the country .

the original eau de cologne , survived wars and imitations and still sells well in a market saturated with modern scents . the first bottle of eau de cologne was created by giovanni maria farina , an italian expatriate living in the eastern german city of cologne .
on july 13 , 1709 , farina opened a luxury goods shop where the fragrance was sold . in a letter to his brother dated in 1709 , farina wrote , " i have discovered a scent that reminds me of an italian spring morning , of daffodils and orange blossoms after the rain . "
he named it after the city he lived in . over the course of the last three centuries , only 30 people have been privy to the secret recipe - including johann maria farina , a descendant of the perfumer and the company 's current managing director .

" today we have taken a step forward -lrb- towards the project 's realization -rrb- , " said nikolaus von bomhard , head of munich re , which hosted the signing .
the firms grouped under the desertec industrial initiative -lrb- dii -rrb- plan to build solar power generators in north africa and the middle east .
the massive project will see investments of up to 400 billion euros over a period of 40 years .
" of course it is still a long way off , but the enormous interest in the scheme shows we are on the right path , " a spokesman for munich re said .
a study suggests that with the use of thermal power plants and high voltage direct current transmission lines , desertec 's pioneering foray into the desert could meet 15 percent of europe 's electricity needs by the year 2050 .
bildunterschrift : the project could meet 15 percent of europe 's electricity needs by 2050 gerhard knies , chairman of the desertec supervisory board said the desert is an obvious source of clean power .
" within six hours deserts receive more energy from the sun than humankind consumes within a year , " he said adding that the " time appears right for a truly comprehensive maneuver to combat climate change . "
firms hope project will help combat climate change other companies involved in the venture are the spanish firm abengoa solar and the algerian conglomerate cevital as well as several german banks and engineering companies .
under the agreement , a desertec study office to be established by october will have three years to detail investment plans to create the network of solar farms .
representatives of the arab league and the egyptian energy ministry were also present at the signing of the protocol .
munich re board member torsten jeworrek said the european companies involved had pledged to work " as equals in a sincere and fair " manner with the producer countries .
" if we 're successful , we 'll make a huge contribution to the fight against climate change , " jeworrek said .
environmental organization greenpeace has welcomed the initiative and urged the german government to support it by channelling research funds earmarked for nuclear energy to the solar energy project .
critics slam huge costs but critics of the desertec project have warned that the political situation in many of the producer countries in north africa is unstable .
the european association for renewable energy , eurosolar , has said the desertec initiative is completely unviable .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the desertec initiative envisages solar power plants in africa and the middle east herman scheer , head of eurosolar and social democratic lawmaker in the german parliament said it was not necessary to go to north africa to collect the sun 's rays .
" we could invest the 400 billion euros here " scheer said , referring to the recession-hit eurozone .
he also said he preferred a network of decentralized operators that produced renewable energy from many sources rather than having one key project in the hands of major corporations .
" nothing will ever come of it -lrb- the project -rrb- , " scheer said .
he added that the astronomical costs of the gigantic project had been played down while the technical possibilities promised by it had been exaggerated. sp / afp / reuters / dpa editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" today we have taken a step forward -lrb- towards the project 's realization -rrb- , " said nikolaus von bomhard , head of munich re , which hosted the signing .
the firms grouped under the desertec industrial initiative -lrb- dii -rrb- plan to build solar power generators in north africa and the middle east .
the massive project will see investments of up to 400 billion euros over a period of 40 years .
" of course it is still a long way off , but the enormous interest in the scheme shows we are on the right path , " a spokesman for munich re said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 13.07.2009 african solar power for europe could promote security , experts say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : capturing sunshine could lead to energy development and security hurdles remain , but mediterranean countries should cooperate on economic development and environmental protection including a new solar power project , according to guest commentators matthias ruchser and stefan gaenzle . last year , on july 13 , the " union for the mediterranean " was launched amid much diplomatic fanfare .
heads of state and government from 43 european union and the mediterranean-rim countries had accepted an invitation to paris extended by french president nicolas sarkozy to give new impetus to mediterranean cooperation .
the union for the mediterranean follows up on the barcelona process , initiated in 1995 , which also had a pronounced security dimension . ultimately , the union for the mediterranean set itself a six-point agenda , among others the " mediterranean solar plan . "
the recent gaza war has upset these plans .
no high-ranking ministerial meetings have taken place since december 2008 , and some important issues dealing with the institutional design of the union have been shelved . similar to the constraints imposed on the baltic sea co-operation of the 1970s -lrb- due to the east-west conflict -rrb- , it would be recommendable for the union for the mediterranean to put high politics as well as security issues aside and focus on economic matters and the protection of the environment and the climate .
against this backdrop , can it be mere coincidence that it was precisely for july 13 that the munich re group issued invitations for the inaugural meeting of the so-called " desertec initiative " in munich ? energy security based on solar thermal power plants ? bildunterschrift : the desertec project aims to feed solar power from africa and the middle east to the eu while the idea behind the desertec project is nothing new , it is still fascinating : solar thermal power plants in northern africa would contribute to supplying europe with the clean energy it needs .
a total of roughly 400 billion euros in investments would be needed by the year 2050 to cover 15 percent of europe 's electricity needs .
so is the - privately financed - desertec consortium set to get the better of the european mediterranean solar plan , or indeed to replace it ? to start with the good news : the technology needed to generate solar thermal power , known as concentrated solar power -lrb- csp -rrb- , is already available , as are the high-voltage , direct current -lrb- hvdc -rrb- electric power transmission lines required to transport it .
in kramer junction , california , the first parabolic trough power plants have been connected to the grid since the mid-1980s .
more advanced csp power plants have been built in the united states and spain and are already several years old .
another csp plant , an integrated solar combined cycle plant -lrb- iscc -rrb- , is currently under construction in kuraymat , egypt .
parabolic trough power plants are already in the planning stages in some other countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german companies lead the field in concentrated solar power technology another piece of good news - at least from the german perspective - is that german companies lead the field when it comes to csp technology .
the parabolic mirrors are built by flabeg , the receivers by schott solar , the turbines , generators and control technology are available from siemens , and solar millennium and man ferrostaal operate as general contractors . looking for safe locations for solar plants is the only task remaining to secure the financing for the desertec initiative and to integrate it politically into the union for the mediterranean ?
not quite .
it will not prove so easy to enlist the southern mediterranean-rim countries as potential locations for power plants .
many of these countries are ruled by authoritarian regimes of different stripes , and there is an ever-present danger in the region of terrorist attacks .
population growth and unemployment are also very high in this part of the world , and such social problems are aggravated by migration pressure from sub-saharan africa .
all in all , an explosive mix , with important implications for our security as well . most of the non-eu mediterranean-rim countries have major development needs .
one prerequisite for development is energy .
however , most of the power plants currently in operation there are conventional , carbon-based plants .
in times of an accelerated climate change that has the gravest of implications for developing and transition countries , the latter need to switch their energy supply , as early as possible , to a non-conventional energy path , and that means , in effect , to renewable energy sources . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. stefan gaenzle is an expert on multilateral development cooperation with die large-scale solar thermal power plants may offer one solution to the problem .
even though energy production costs - 15 euros to 23 euro cents per kilowatt hour - are still higher than those for conventional power plants .
it would be possible -based , for example , on the model of the german renewable energy law - to close the viability gap either by raising the feed-in tariff for renewable electricity -lrb- to be paid by the end user -rrb- or by having government set ambitious quotas for the share of renewably generated electricity as a means of attracting investments in csp plants .
the important thing is to set clear-cut framework conditions for electricity sales in countries with the potential to operate csp plants , in this way ensuring that the billions that need to be invested will pay off in the long term for private investors . grid development as a pan-european task some successes in economic transformation have already been observed in the context of the euro-mediterranean partnership , in tunisia for instance , although there has been less movement when it comes to political change .
be that as it may , though , the union for the mediterranean does offer a dynamic normative frame of reference for the southern mediterranean-rim countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias ruchser is an energy consultant and head of media and public relations at die however , the eu 's tasks in the framework of the union for the mediterranean should not be to offset the financial risk for private-sector projects like the desertec initiative .
this , though , may be a different matter when it comes to support for the development and expansion of the power grid in the overall mediterranean region .
grid development must be viewed under the aspect of public welfare , and here the eu could provide an important contribution to collective energy security in the mediterranean region , one that would entail a security dividend over the longer term . to put it in a nutshell : renewable energy sources promote development , and development promotes security .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 13.07.2009 african solar power for europe could promote security , experts say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : capturing sunshine could lead to energy development and security hurdles remain , but mediterranean countries should cooperate on economic development and environmental protection including a new solar power project , according to guest commentators matthias ruchser and stefan gaenzle . last year , on july 13 , the " union for the mediterranean " was launched amid much diplomatic fanfare .
heads of state and government from 43 european union and the mediterranean-rim countries had accepted an invitation to paris extended by french president nicolas sarkozy to give new impetus to mediterranean cooperation .
the union for the mediterranean follows up on the barcelona process , initiated in 1995 , which also had a pronounced security dimension . ultimately , the union for the mediterranean set itself a six-point agenda , among others the " mediterranean solar plan . "
the recent gaza war has upset these plans .
no high-ranking ministerial meetings have taken place since december 2008 , and some important issues dealing with the institutional design of the union have been shelved . similar to the constraints imposed on the baltic sea co-operation of the 1970s -lrb- due to the east-west conflict -rrb- , it would be recommendable for the union for the mediterranean to put high politics as well as security issues aside and focus on economic matters and the protection of the environment and the climate .
against this backdrop , can it be mere coincidence that it was precisely for july 13 that the munich re group issued invitations for the inaugural meeting of the so-called " desertec initiative " in munich ? energy security based on solar thermal power plants ? bildunterschrift : the desertec project aims to feed solar power from africa and the middle east to the eu while the idea behind the desertec project is nothing new , it is still fascinating : solar thermal power plants in northern africa would contribute to supplying europe with the clean energy it needs .
a total of roughly 400 billion euros in investments would be needed by the year 2050 to cover 15 percent of europe 's electricity needs .
so is the - privately financed - desertec consortium set to get the better of the european mediterranean solar plan , or indeed to replace it ? to start with the good news : the technology needed to generate solar thermal power , known as concentrated solar power -lrb- csp -rrb- , is already available , as are the high-voltage , direct current -lrb- hvdc -rrb- electric power transmission lines required to transport it .
in kramer junction , california , the first parabolic trough power plants have been connected to the grid since the mid-1980s .
more advanced csp power plants have been built in the united states and spain and are already several years old .
another csp plant , an integrated solar combined cycle plant -lrb- iscc -rrb- , is currently under construction in kuraymat , egypt .
parabolic trough power plants are already in the planning stages in some other countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german companies lead the field in concentrated solar power technology another piece of good news - at least from the german perspective - is that german companies lead the field when it comes to csp technology .
the parabolic mirrors are built by flabeg , the receivers by schott solar , the turbines , generators and control technology are available from siemens , and solar millennium and man ferrostaal operate as general contractors . looking for safe locations for solar plants is the only task remaining to secure the financing for the desertec initiative and to integrate it politically into the union for the mediterranean ?
not quite .
it will not prove so easy to enlist the southern mediterranean-rim countries as potential locations for power plants .
many of these countries are ruled by authoritarian regimes of different stripes , and there is an ever-present danger in the region of terrorist attacks .
population growth and unemployment are also very high in this part of the world , and such social problems are aggravated by migration pressure from sub-saharan africa .
all in all , an explosive mix , with important implications for our security as well . most of the non-eu mediterranean-rim countries have major development needs .
one prerequisite for development is energy .
however , most of the power plants currently in operation there are conventional , carbon-based plants .
in times of an accelerated climate change that has the gravest of implications for developing and transition countries , the latter need to switch their energy supply , as early as possible , to a non-conventional energy path , and that means , in effect , to renewable energy sources . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. stefan gaenzle is an expert on multilateral development cooperation with die large-scale solar thermal power plants may offer one solution to the problem .
even though energy production costs - 15 euros to 23 euro cents per kilowatt hour - are still higher than those for conventional power plants .
it would be possible -based , for example , on the model of the german renewable energy law - to close the viability gap either by raising the feed-in tariff for renewable electricity -lrb- to be paid by the end user -rrb- or by having government set ambitious quotas for the share of renewably generated electricity as a means of attracting investments in csp plants .
the important thing is to set clear-cut framework conditions for electricity sales in countries with the potential to operate csp plants , in this way ensuring that the billions that need to be invested will pay off in the long term for private investors . grid development as a pan-european task some successes in economic transformation have already been observed in the context of the euro-mediterranean partnership , in tunisia for instance , although there has been less movement when it comes to political change .
be that as it may , though , the union for the mediterranean does offer a dynamic normative frame of reference for the southern mediterranean-rim countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias ruchser is an energy consultant and head of media and public relations at die however , the eu 's tasks in the framework of the union for the mediterranean should not be to offset the financial risk for private-sector projects like the desertec initiative .
this , though , may be a different matter when it comes to support for the development and expansion of the power grid in the overall mediterranean region .
grid development must be viewed under the aspect of public welfare , and here the eu could provide an important contribution to collective energy security in the mediterranean region , one that would entail a security dividend over the longer term . to put it in a nutshell : renewable energy sources promote development , and development promotes security .
looked at in this way , the evolving desertec consortium should provide a new and innovative boost for the union for the mediterranean . authors : matthias ruchser , dr. stefan gaenzle -lrb- ar -rrb- editor : sean sinico matthias ruchser is a consultant in the energy industry and head of media and public relations at the german development institute / deutsches institut für entwicklungspolitik -lrb- die -rrb- .

not quite .
it will not prove so easy to enlist the southern mediterranean-rim countries as potential locations for power plants .
many of these countries are ruled by authoritarian regimes of different stripes , and there is an ever-present danger in the region of terrorist attacks .
population growth and unemployment are also very high in this part of the world , and such social problems are aggravated by migration pressure from sub-saharan africa .
all in all , an explosive mix , with important implications for our security as well . most of the non-eu mediterranean-rim countries have major development needs .
one prerequisite for development is energy .
however , most of the power plants currently in operation there are conventional , carbon-based plants .
in times of an accelerated climate change that has the gravest of implications for developing and transition countries , the latter need to switch their energy supply , as early as possible , to a non-conventional energy path , and that means , in effect , to renewable energy sources . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. stefan gaenzle is an expert on multilateral development cooperation with die large-scale solar thermal power plants may offer one solution to the problem .
even though energy production costs - 15 euros to 23 euro cents per kilowatt hour - are still higher than those for conventional power plants .
it would be possible -based , for example , on the model of the german renewable energy law - to close the viability gap either by raising the feed-in tariff for renewable electricity -lrb- to be paid by the end user -rrb- or by having government set ambitious quotas for the share of renewably generated electricity as a means of attracting investments in csp plants .
the important thing is to set clear-cut framework conditions for electricity sales in countries with the potential to operate csp plants , in this way ensuring that the billions that need to be invested will pay off in the long term for private investors . grid development as a pan-european task some successes in economic transformation have already been observed in the context of the euro-mediterranean partnership , in tunisia for instance , although there has been less movement when it comes to political change .
be that as it may , though , the union for the mediterranean does offer a dynamic normative frame of reference for the southern mediterranean-rim countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias ruchser is an energy consultant and head of media and public relations at die however , the eu 's tasks in the framework of the union for the mediterranean should not be to offset the financial risk for private-sector projects like the desertec initiative .
this , though , may be a different matter when it comes to support for the development and expansion of the power grid in the overall mediterranean region .
grid development must be viewed under the aspect of public welfare , and here the eu could provide an important contribution to collective energy security in the mediterranean region , one that would entail a security dividend over the longer term . to put it in a nutshell : renewable energy sources promote development , and development promotes security .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 13.07.2009 african solar power for europe could promote security , experts say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : capturing sunshine could lead to energy development and security hurdles remain , but mediterranean countries should cooperate on economic development and environmental protection including a new solar power project , according to guest commentators matthias ruchser and stefan gaenzle . last year , on july 13 , the " union for the mediterranean " was launched amid much diplomatic fanfare .
heads of state and government from 43 european union and the mediterranean-rim countries had accepted an invitation to paris extended by french president nicolas sarkozy to give new impetus to mediterranean cooperation .
the union for the mediterranean follows up on the barcelona process , initiated in 1995 , which also had a pronounced security dimension . ultimately , the union for the mediterranean set itself a six-point agenda , among others the " mediterranean solar plan . "
the recent gaza war has upset these plans .
no high-ranking ministerial meetings have taken place since december 2008 , and some important issues dealing with the institutional design of the union have been shelved . similar to the constraints imposed on the baltic sea co-operation of the 1970s -lrb- due to the east-west conflict -rrb- , it would be recommendable for the union for the mediterranean to put high politics as well as security issues aside and focus on economic matters and the protection of the environment and the climate .
against this backdrop , can it be mere coincidence that it was precisely for july 13 that the munich re group issued invitations for the inaugural meeting of the so-called " desertec initiative " in munich ? energy security based on solar thermal power plants ? bildunterschrift : the desertec project aims to feed solar power from africa and the middle east to the eu while the idea behind the desertec project is nothing new , it is still fascinating : solar thermal power plants in northern africa would contribute to supplying europe with the clean energy it needs .
a total of roughly 400 billion euros in investments would be needed by the year 2050 to cover 15 percent of europe 's electricity needs .
so is the - privately financed - desertec consortium set to get the better of the european mediterranean solar plan , or indeed to replace it ? to start with the good news : the technology needed to generate solar thermal power , known as concentrated solar power -lrb- csp -rrb- , is already available , as are the high-voltage , direct current -lrb- hvdc -rrb- electric power transmission lines required to transport it .
in kramer junction , california , the first parabolic trough power plants have been connected to the grid since the mid-1980s .
more advanced csp power plants have been built in the united states and spain and are already several years old .
another csp plant , an integrated solar combined cycle plant -lrb- iscc -rrb- , is currently under construction in kuraymat , egypt .
parabolic trough power plants are already in the planning stages in some other countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german companies lead the field in concentrated solar power technology another piece of good news - at least from the german perspective - is that german companies lead the field when it comes to csp technology .

the 47-year-old diamond trader was sentenced to eight years in jail for actively supporting the terrorist group . prosecutors said aleem n. supported al-qaeda for years , raising money , distributing propaganda material and recruiting new members .
he is thought to be a key figure for the organization 's german operations .
the german man of pakistani descent was arrested in february of last year on allegations that he belonged to the terrorist group .
investigators say that in the summer of 2004 , he became part of the inner sanctum of the organization and received orders to recruit new members and supporters in germany .
investigators believe that by 2007 , aleem n. had sent four young fighters - together with letters of recommendation - to be trained in terror camps .

the hijacking has led to a debate in germany and the question what can be done about it . the situation for the hansa stavanger 's crew of 24 has become desperate .
according to germany 's spiegel magazine , the captain reported to his wife a week ago that there was a lack of drinking water , food and medication .
many crew members are supposedly ill .
negotiations between the pirates and the hamburg based ship owner leonhardt & blumberg are ongoing .
the pirates originally demanded $ 15 million ransom .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : special forces during a naval training mission three weeks after the hijacking special troops from the german federal police prepared to storm the ship and free the hostages .
two hundred german anti-terror specialists practised the operation on board of the us navy ship uss boxer less then fifty nautical miles away from the hansa stavanger .
but before german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble in berlin could give the go-ahead for the operation , us national security advisor james jones in washington called the operation off , saying it was too risky .
but without american logistical support germany 's elite troops were grounded .
jason alderwick , a maritime defense analyst with the international institute for strategic studies -lrb- iiss -rrb- in london , supports the stance taken by the us .
" the german contribution is just part of a wider international coalition .
so unilaterally deciding to storm a ship is n't necessarily the right approach . "
better funding and cooperation wolfgang bosbach , the vice-chairman of chancellor angela merkel 's christian-democratic group in parliament , argues that german police have the right to storm a hijacked german ship in any case .
" when we need the support of other states , we ca n't decide alone .
we need our own capacities as far as helicopter air transport is concerned .
we need better air supported reconnaissance and we need better communication between the authorities in charge . "
bosbach wants better funding , so germany can carry out operations without international help . and he also urges better cooperation between the defense and interior ministries .
there was speculation in the media , that defense minister franz-josef jung asked washington to stop interior minister schaeuble .
jung is in charge of the military , schaeuble is responsible for the police , which includes the unit that was supposed to carry out the anti-terror operation .
wolfgang bosbach does n't want to address the media speculation , but emphasizes that the german military has a special mandate for fighting piracy at the horn of africa , but that it is the general responsibility of germany 's federal police to free hostages when necessary .
bosbach adds that for germany , given its recent century history , every international military operation remains a balancing act between modesty and responsibility .
" we have good reasons to say ' never first , never alone , never without an international mandate ' .
but when we say a , we also must say b. when we decide to send troops , we must make sure that they are equipped appropriately . "
fighting the root problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : capturing and trying somali pirates is difficult still , the larger question remains whether soldiers and policemen can stop pirates .
for more than six months now , the navies of nine european nations have been patrolling the somali coastline .
and yet piracy has continued .
wolfgang bosbach admits that the military alone ca n't stop piracy .
" we are talking here about organized crime .
we have to look at the causes .
that 's why besides the defense and interior ministries , foreign affairs and development ministries must be involved as well . "
still , he says , the european military patrols around the somali coast - operation atalanta - has had an impact : " the shipping companies must decide to join a convoy , which gets navy protection .
none of the convoys we accompanied got into trouble . "
jason alderwick agrees in principle that piracy is a matter of international crime and therefore rather a police than a military issue : " it would be great to hand over the operation to coast guard assets .
but europeans do n't have a huge coast guard , which is able to deploy in a counter piracy role .
so you have to go with the forces and capabilities you have .
the military instrument is a blunt instrument , but it 's adapting as best as it can with the situation down there . "
overall , says alderwick , europe 's atalanta operation at the horn of africa makes sense .
" there has arguably been an escalation in the number of piracy attacks , but that is n't a direct consequence of the operation .
it 's just a consequence of the overall situation .
without atalanta , piracy in the region would definitely have been worse . "

it marks the highest rate since the eu currency was introduced in 2002 . a statement released by the ecb said " a total of 413,000 counterfeit euro banknotes were withdrawn from circulation , " in the first half of 2009 .
it added that in the main , those bills originated from the same places as previously seized forgeries , meaning no new counterfeit sources had been found .
although the increase is high , the european central bank also said it was important to consider the number of genuine banknotes - some 12.5 billion - in circulation during the same timeframe .
in germany , the number of fakes rose in keeping with the overall figure , costing the economy 1.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.23 billion -rrb- .
but the federal bank said that was an improvement of some 100,000 euros over the last six months of 2008 .
it attributed the drop to the fact that the majority of notes seized between january and june of 2009 were of relatively small denominations .
twenty and fifty euro notes made up almost fifty percent of the total number largely recovered from across the 16 nations which use the common currency .
earlier this month , police in bulgaria and poland made several arrests in connection with the production of conterfeit cash. tkw / afp / dpa / ap editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

do you believe this will make any difference ?
the iranian people have called for a new election . and it is also my belief that these new elections should take place under the supervision of the united nations .
otherwise these disputes will continue and the people will again protest against election manipulation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2003 nobel peace prize winner 's visit generated a lot of media attention the scale of protests in iran and the reaction of the police indicate that the government was guilty .
if the elections were fair , as the government claims , why was there such a strong presence of security forces in the streets ?
that is a good question .
what happened in iran is an obvious human rights violation .
when the iranian people demonstrated peacefully , there were no problems – not even a window was broken .
but towards the end of the demonstrations shots were fired from office buildings .
some died and many more were injured .
that was the beginning of the state 's crackdown .
that night at 3 a.m. , a student residence was attacked , five students were shot dead and several were injured . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ebadi meets deutsche welle 's director-general , erik bettermann can other countries or institutions such as the united nations make a difference , or is it up to the iranian people now ?
first and foremost it is iranians who are fighting for their rights .
this movement , which has in the meantime turned into a national movement , was created by the iranian people .
president mahmoud ahmadinejad and the iranian government have said that the west is to blame for the protests in iran . what ahmadinejad has said is a major insult .
it is not true and in no way reflects the truth .
this is a pure national protest movement formed by the iranian people .
have these protests had any impact on the human rights situation ?
the movement started completely peacefully which shows the political maturity of the iranian people .
sadly , the people got a violent response to their peaceful movement .
when you give interviews like today , does it cause problems for you in iran ?
that 's not that important to me .
i consider this a task that has to be done .
will you go back to iran ?
of course i will return .
i have my husband , family and my house in iran .

she is a lawyer , who gained entrance to the faculty of law at tehran university in 1965 . in 1975 she became the first woman in the history of iran 's justice system , to be made the president of bench 24 of the tehran city court .
she then set up her own practice after receiving her lawyer 's license in 1992 .
ebadi has written several books and many of her articles have been published in iranian journals .
one of the most talked about topics in the world right now is the disputed iranian presidential election .
do you believe the vote was fair ?
with their street protests , iranians have shown that they do not accept the announced results of the election which they believe was rigged .
you have also said that a new election will take place .
do you believe this will make any difference ?
the iranian people have called for a new election . and it is also my belief that these new elections should take place under the supervision of the united nations .
otherwise these disputes will continue and the people will again protest against election manipulation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2003 nobel peace prize winner 's visit generated a lot of media attention the scale of protests in iran and the reaction of the police indicate that the government was guilty .
if the elections were fair , as the government claims , why was there such a strong presence of security forces in the streets ?
that is a good question .
what happened in iran is an obvious human rights violation .
when the iranian people demonstrated peacefully , there were no problems – not even a window was broken .
but towards the end of the demonstrations shots were fired from office buildings .
some died and many more were injured .
that was the beginning of the state 's crackdown .
that night at 3 a.m. , a student residence was attacked , five students were shot dead and several were injured . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ebadi meets deutsche welle 's director-general , erik bettermann can other countries or institutions such as the united nations make a difference , or is it up to the iranian people now ?
first and foremost it is iranians who are fighting for their rights .
this movement , which has in the meantime turned into a national movement , was created by the iranian people .
president mahmoud ahmadinejad and the iranian government have said that the west is to blame for the protests in iran . what ahmadinejad has said is a major insult .
it is not true and in no way reflects the truth .
this is a pure national protest movement formed by the iranian people .
have these protests had any impact on the human rights situation ?
the movement started completely peacefully which shows the political maturity of the iranian people .
sadly , the people got a violent response to their peaceful movement .
when you give interviews like today , does it cause problems for you in iran ?
that 's not that important to me .
i consider this a task that has to be done .
will you go back to iran ?
of course i will return .
i have my husband , family and my house in iran .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : piracy hansa stavanger arrives at kenyan port after piracy ordeal in gulf of aden , piracy scourge continues unabated fighting piracy requires better international cooperation crime -pipe- 13.07.2009 fighting piracy militarily has mixed success so far großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conditions are bad for the crew aboard the hijacked vessel for over three months now the german container ship ms hansa stavanger and its crew are in the hands of somali pirates .
the hijacking has led to a debate in germany and the question what can be done about it . the situation for the hansa stavanger 's crew of 24 has become desperate .
according to germany 's spiegel magazine , the captain reported to his wife a week ago that there was a lack of drinking water , food and medication .
many crew members are supposedly ill .
negotiations between the pirates and the hamburg based ship owner leonhardt & blumberg are ongoing .
the pirates originally demanded $ 15 million ransom .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : special forces during a naval training mission three weeks after the hijacking special troops from the german federal police prepared to storm the ship and free the hostages .
two hundred german anti-terror specialists practised the operation on board of the us navy ship uss boxer less then fifty nautical miles away from the hansa stavanger .
but before german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble in berlin could give the go-ahead for the operation , us national security advisor james jones in washington called the operation off , saying it was too risky .
but without american logistical support germany 's elite troops were grounded .
jason alderwick , a maritime defense analyst with the international institute for strategic studies -lrb- iiss -rrb- in london , supports the stance taken by the us .
" the german contribution is just part of a wider international coalition .
so unilaterally deciding to storm a ship is n't necessarily the right approach . "
better funding and cooperation wolfgang bosbach , the vice-chairman of chancellor angela merkel 's christian-democratic group in parliament , argues that german police have the right to storm a hijacked german ship in any case .
" when we need the support of other states , we ca n't decide alone .
we need our own capacities as far as helicopter air transport is concerned .
we need better air supported reconnaissance and we need better communication between the authorities in charge . "
bosbach wants better funding , so germany can carry out operations without international help . and he also urges better cooperation between the defense and interior ministries .
there was speculation in the media , that defense minister franz-josef jung asked washington to stop interior minister schaeuble .
jung is in charge of the military , schaeuble is responsible for the police , which includes the unit that was supposed to carry out the anti-terror operation .
wolfgang bosbach does n't want to address the media speculation , but emphasizes that the german military has a special mandate for fighting piracy at the horn of africa , but that it is the general responsibility of germany 's federal police to free hostages when necessary .
bosbach adds that for germany , given its recent century history , every international military operation remains a balancing act between modesty and responsibility .
" we have good reasons to say ' never first , never alone , never without an international mandate ' .
but when we say a , we also must say b. when we decide to send troops , we must make sure that they are equipped appropriately . "
fighting the root problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : capturing and trying somali pirates is difficult still , the larger question remains whether soldiers and policemen can stop pirates .
for more than six months now , the navies of nine european nations have been patrolling the somali coastline .
and yet piracy has continued .
wolfgang bosbach admits that the military alone ca n't stop piracy .
" we are talking here about organized crime .
we have to look at the causes .
that 's why besides the defense and interior ministries , foreign affairs and development ministries must be involved as well . "
still , he says , the european military patrols around the somali coast - operation atalanta - has had an impact : " the shipping companies must decide to join a convoy , which gets navy protection .
none of the convoys we accompanied got into trouble . "
jason alderwick agrees in principle that piracy is a matter of international crime and therefore rather a police than a military issue : " it would be great to hand over the operation to coast guard assets .
but europeans do n't have a huge coast guard , which is able to deploy in a counter piracy role .
so you have to go with the forces and capabilities you have .
the military instrument is a blunt instrument , but it 's adapting as best as it can with the situation down there . "
overall , says alderwick , europe 's atalanta operation at the horn of africa makes sense .
" there has arguably been an escalation in the number of piracy attacks , but that is n't a direct consequence of the operation .
it 's just a consequence of the overall situation .
without atalanta , piracy in the region would definitely have been worse . "

jason alderwick agrees in principle that piracy is a matter of international crime and therefore rather a police than a military issue : " it would be great to hand over the operation to coast guard assets .

the hijacking has led to a debate in germany and the question what can be done about it . the situation for the hansa stavanger 's crew of 24 has become desperate .
according to germany 's spiegel magazine , the captain reported to his wife a week ago that there was a lack of drinking water , food and medication .
many crew members are supposedly ill .
negotiations between the pirates and the hamburg based ship owner leonhardt & blumberg are ongoing .
the pirates originally demanded $ 15 million ransom .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : special forces during a naval training mission three weeks after the hijacking special troops from the german federal police prepared to storm the ship and free the hostages .
two hundred german anti-terror specialists practised the operation on board of the us navy ship uss boxer less then fifty nautical miles away from the hansa stavanger .
but before german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble in berlin could give the go-ahead for the operation , us national security advisor james jones in washington called the operation off , saying it was too risky .
but without american logistical support germany 's elite troops were grounded .
jason alderwick , a maritime defense analyst with the international institute for strategic studies -lrb- iiss -rrb- in london , supports the stance taken by the us .
" the german contribution is just part of a wider international coalition .
so unilaterally deciding to storm a ship is n't necessarily the right approach . "
better funding and cooperation wolfgang bosbach , the vice-chairman of chancellor angela merkel 's christian-democratic group in parliament , argues that german police have the right to storm a hijacked german ship in any case .
" when we need the support of other states , we ca n't decide alone .
we need our own capacities as far as helicopter air transport is concerned .
we need better air supported reconnaissance and we need better communication between the authorities in charge . "
bosbach wants better funding , so germany can carry out operations without international help . and he also urges better cooperation between the defense and interior ministries .
there was speculation in the media , that defense minister franz-josef jung asked washington to stop interior minister schaeuble .
jung is in charge of the military , schaeuble is responsible for the police , which includes the unit that was supposed to carry out the anti-terror operation .
wolfgang bosbach does n't want to address the media speculation , but emphasizes that the german military has a special mandate for fighting piracy at the horn of africa , but that it is the general responsibility of germany 's federal police to free hostages when necessary .
bosbach adds that for germany , given its recent century history , every international military operation remains a balancing act between modesty and responsibility .
" we have good reasons to say ' never first , never alone , never without an international mandate ' .
but when we say a , we also must say b. when we decide to send troops , we must make sure that they are equipped appropriately . "
fighting the root problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : capturing and trying somali pirates is difficult still , the larger question remains whether soldiers and policemen can stop pirates .
for more than six months now , the navies of nine european nations have been patrolling the somali coastline .
and yet piracy has continued .
wolfgang bosbach admits that the military alone ca n't stop piracy .
" we are talking here about organized crime .
we have to look at the causes .
that 's why besides the defense and interior ministries , foreign affairs and development ministries must be involved as well . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 13.07.2009 nuclear power regulation becomes political minefield großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some in germany wonder who makes sure nuclear power plants are safe a short circuit that led to an automatic shutdown at the kruemmel nuclear power plant in northern germany sparked a debate over who should oversee nuclear power operations and how tight regulation should be . the malfunction was the second such incident in several days at the plant in northern germany , which had only just re-opened after two years of repairs following a malfunction in a transformer that had caused a fire and a shutdown . vattenfall , the power plant 's operator , has since said it failed to install an important safety sensor , and that all of kruemmel 's 80,000 fuel rods had to be checked after some appeared to be defective . tuomo hatakka , head of vattenfall europe , said the problems at kruemmel , which has been operating for over 25 years , " posed no risk to the population . " " the safety systems worked at kruemmel and there is no reason to question them , " he told a news conference in berlin . " tug of war " needs to end bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel has called for older nuclear facilities to be shut down but vattenfall 's failure to act according to established safety rules as well as regulators ' inability to uncover such breaches before an accident occurs prompted german environment minister sigmar gabriel to call for a single oversight body for the country 's nuclear power plants . " this tug of war between the states and the federal government does n't exist anywhere else in the world , " gabriel said . currently , the federal government is responsible for dealing with all radioactive material - including its production , use and disposal .

since the 1970s he and his colleagues have been leading a campaign to combat the effects of drought in mauritania .
they plant trees in sandy areas to stop the desert from spreading .
they cultivate arable land to be able to plant fruit and vegetables .
and they support local communities in building facilities to catch and store water to enable them to saturate parts of the dry earth . forced migration because of water scarcity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fleeing to the cities after bad droughts : nomads mauritania has a hot , dry climate and although it is three times the size of germany it has a population of only three million .
the sahara stretches deep into the country and a large percentage of the population has since moved to the cities - a result of the infertile land and inhospitable rural conditions .
in 1970 and 1984 two particularly bad droughts caused a massive migratory movement .
the nomadic population fled to the cities in desperation - and then stayed .
the state support system at the time was almost non-existent , says cheikh abdellahi .
' politicians gave fiery speeches .
but in the end nothing was done .
lately , politicians do seem to be developing a consciousness of environmental problems ; there is even a state secretary for the environment .
i hope that actual environmental strategies emerge from this . ' every drop counts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : destroys arable land : desertification is a big problem despite the emerging change in government mentality towards environmental protection , initiatives against soil erosion and desertification are still rare .
water shortage continues to be the biggest challenge facing the population .
in some areas rainfall is less than 50mm a year .
against overwhelming odds , mauritanians have not given up in their quest for water .
for the mauritanians this battle is not just about environmentalism , they are fighting for survival .
recent initiatives are starting to show signs of success , proving that drought is not an inevitable cycle .
there is a chance that it can be beaten . pk send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we condemn such acts , wherever they take place , " said wilhelm .
the 31-year-old muslim woman , marwa al-sherbini , was killed by a russian-born german during his appeal hearing for insulting her with racist slurs , in a case that sparked anti-german demonstrations outside the german embassy in tehran over the weekend . ahmadinejad on sunday demanded the united nations impose sanctions against germany and accused the west of applying double standards when it comes to human rights . the incident was proof for of the " brutality of the german government and clear evidence for corruption in the german justice system , " said ahmadinejad . ahmadinejad added that while berlin and washington had plenty to say regarding events in tehran following iran 's presidential elections , no reaction had been registered regarding al-sherbini 's murder . " we want condemnation from the united nations security council and the imposition of sanctions , " said the iranian president . government spokesman ulrich wilhelm acknowledged the iranian president 's remarks but insisted that there was no climate that promoted such actions . he said it was now a matter for the german justice system to punish those who commit these acts . on july 1 , the pregnant egyptian woman mother of a three-year-old was stabbed 18 times in a courtroom in the eastern german city of dresden by a russian-born german , who was appealing an earlier conviction for making racist slurs against the egyptian in a children 's playground in 2008 .

she added that iranians are dependent upon support from outside the country in their current “ and very sensitive state of emergency . ”
the government ’ s actions “ aren ’ t compatible with the iranian constitution , nor with islam , nor with human rights . ”
she claimed that the protests would continue in new ways and that criticism from iranian religious leaders will weaken the new government even more .
the nobel prize winner appealed to germany and europe to put more political pressure on the iranian government .
“ i am against economic sanctions and military interventions , ” declared ebadi , explaining that both are introduced at the cost of the iranian people .
she added that this , in turn , creates new battle fronts and leads people to establish solidarity with their government .
instead , she affirmed , political sanctions must be imposed .
in negotiations and contractual relationships with iran , the west must “ constantly insist upon the preservation of human rights . ” this stands for western political as well as economic delegates to iran , according to ebadi .
for example , she suggests that countries could remove their embassies from iran without completely breaking off diplomatic relations .
ebadi noted that for the last two years , the west has engaged with iran exclusively on the issue of atomic conflict .
“ one wonders whether europeans are concerned only with their own security instead of with that of iranians , ” she said .
regarding economic relations with iran , ebadi said that “ weapons and software supporting the suppression or control of iranian citizens ” should be blocked .
“ ask siemens and nokia why they have released these types of technologies in iran . ”
ebadi , who is currently staying in bonn as a guest of deutsche welle , revealed that her negotiations with high-level un officials have prompted the un to send a delegation to tehran to contribute to reporting on the situation there .
“ if the government does not permit the delegation to enter , it will prove that protestors ’ grievances are representative of the truth , ” according to ebadi .
the human-rights advocate also pointed out that the number of victims during the most recent protests is much higher than officially reported .
she said the brutality and violence on behalf of the government continues as the militias stand under supervision from the revolutionary guard .
ebadi noted that the number of people arrested is also very high and includes some of her colleagues .
recently , for example , the attorneys abdolfatah sultani and mohammad ali dadkhah , two prominent figures in the coalition for the defense of human rights , were arrested . the organization is headed by ebadi .
the nobel prize winner further explained that the head of the iranian judiciary had , “ under political pressure , ” issued a regulation whereby attorneys can lose their licenses to practice at any time .
“ this regulation discouraged lawyers from defending political prisoners and others whose opinions conflict with the government ’ s position . ”
according to ebadi , many prisoners have been isolated and prevented from contacting their families or attorneys .
ebadi , who emphasized that she has no close personal relationship with any of the presidential candidates , commented on further developments in iran as follows : “ increasing criticism from influential spiritual leaders will lead the government to become weaker and lose its legitimacy . ”
she noted that the protests will continue and that the populace is creative and has found new forms of protest .
for example , calling “ god is great ” from one ’ s windows or roof in the evening has established itself as a new form of protest , while mourning mothers meet regularly to engage in sit-ins .
ebadi herself will remain in europe for the time being in order to campaign for human rights in iran .
thereafter , she will “ most certainly ” return to her homeland .

she added that iranians are dependent upon support from outside the country in their current “ and very sensitive state of emergency . ”
the government ’ s actions “ aren ’ t compatible with the iranian constitution , nor with islam , nor with human rights . ”
she claimed that the protests would continue in new ways and that criticism from iranian religious leaders will weaken the new government even more .
the nobel prize winner appealed to germany and europe to put more political pressure on the iranian government .
“ i am against economic sanctions and military interventions , ” declared ebadi , explaining that both are introduced at the cost of the iranian people .
she added that this , in turn , creates new battle fronts and leads people to establish solidarity with their government .
instead , she affirmed , political sanctions must be imposed .
in negotiations and contractual relationships with iran , the west must “ constantly insist upon the preservation of human rights . ” this stands for western political as well as economic delegates to iran , according to ebadi .
for example , she suggests that countries could remove their embassies from iran without completely breaking off diplomatic relations .
ebadi noted that for the last two years , the west has engaged with iran exclusively on the issue of atomic conflict .
“ one wonders whether europeans are concerned only with their own security instead of with that of iranians , ” she said .
regarding economic relations with iran , ebadi said that “ weapons and software supporting the suppression or control of iranian citizens ” should be blocked .
“ ask siemens and nokia why they have released these types of technologies in iran . ”
ebadi , who is currently staying in bonn as a guest of deutsche welle , revealed that her negotiations with high-level un officials have prompted the un to send a delegation to tehran to contribute to reporting on the situation there .
“ if the government does not permit the delegation to enter , it will prove that protestors ’ grievances are representative of the truth , ” according to ebadi .
the human-rights advocate also pointed out that the number of victims during the most recent protests is much higher than officially reported .
she said the brutality and violence on behalf of the government continues as the militias stand under supervision from the revolutionary guard .
ebadi noted that the number of people arrested is also very high and includes some of her colleagues .
recently , for example , the attorneys abdolfatah sultani and mohammad ali dadkhah , two prominent figures in the coalition for the defense of human rights , were arrested . the organization is headed by ebadi .
the nobel prize winner further explained that the head of the iranian judiciary had , “ under political pressure , ” issued a regulation whereby attorneys can lose their licenses to practice at any time .
“ this regulation discouraged lawyers from defending political prisoners and others whose opinions conflict with the government ’ s position . ”
according to ebadi , many prisoners have been isolated and prevented from contacting their families or attorneys .
ebadi , who emphasized that she has no close personal relationship with any of the presidential candidates , commented on further developments in iran as follows : “ increasing criticism from influential spiritual leaders will lead the government to become weaker and lose its legitimacy . ”
she noted that the protests will continue and that the populace is creative and has found new forms of protest .
for example , calling “ god is great ” from one ’ s windows or roof in the evening has established itself as a new form of protest , while mourning mothers meet regularly to engage in sit-ins .
ebadi herself will remain in europe for the time being in order to campaign for human rights in iran .
thereafter , she will “ most certainly ” return to her homeland .

the new rules are intended to prevent future financial collapse . analysts say the meltdown of the financial system , which has led to the worst recession in over 60 years , was due in part to banks ' inability to assess the risk level of some of their investments .
if the proposal becomes law - which requires the approval from the eu parliament and the 27 eu governments - banks would have to demonstrate that they fully understood the risks involved when making an investment , especially in the case of highly-complex " re-securitization " investments .
banks that encouraged staff to take too much risk by offering bonuses could face sanctions .
in addition , the proposal calls for banks to keep more money and assets on hand to cover any potential losses if the value of an investment were to significantly deflate . " the proposal aims to ensure that banks hold enough capital to reflect the true risks they are taking , " european commission chief jose manuel barroso said in a statement .
he added that the plan would " legally oblige banks and investment firms to have remuneration policies consistent with effective risk management . "
the european banking federation said that the banks had anticipated the changes and were not surprised by monday 's announcement .
" what we do n't want is a supervisory authority to determine the level or form of remuneration , " an ebf spokeswoman said .
" we also insist that the new rules in terms of remuneration are international .
we want a level playing field . "
the new rules are not likely to take effect until the end of 2011 , and therefore , are not meant to address the current financial crisis .

the new rules are intended to prevent future financial collapse . analysts say the meltdown of the financial system , which has led to the worst recession in over 60 years , was due in part to banks ' inability to assess the risk level of some of their investments .
if the proposal becomes law - which requires the approval from the eu parliament and the 27 eu governments - banks would have to demonstrate that they fully understood the risks involved when making an investment , especially in the case of highly-complex " re-securitization " investments .
banks that encouraged staff to take too much risk by offering bonuses could face sanctions .
in addition , the proposal calls for banks to keep more money and assets on hand to cover any potential losses if the value of an investment were to significantly deflate . " the proposal aims to ensure that banks hold enough capital to reflect the true risks they are taking , " european commission chief jose manuel barroso said in a statement .
he added that the plan would " legally oblige banks and investment firms to have remuneration policies consistent with effective risk management . "
the european banking federation said that the banks had anticipated the changes and were not surprised by monday 's announcement .
" what we do n't want is a supervisory authority to determine the level or form of remuneration , " an ebf spokeswoman said .
" we also insist that the new rules in terms of remuneration are international .
we want a level playing field . "
the new rules are not likely to take effect until the end of 2011 , and therefore , are not meant to address the current financial crisis .
however , the eu said the proposal could " strengthen market confidence and banks ' financial health . " vj / dpa / ap / reuters / afp editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" today we have taken a step forward -lrb- towards the project 's realization -rrb- , " said nikolaus von bomhard , head of munich re , which hosted the signing .
the firms grouped under the desertec industrial initiative -lrb- dii -rrb- plan to build solar power generators in north africa and the middle east .
the massive project will see investments of up to 400 billion euros over a period of 40 years .
" of course it is still a long way off , but the enormous interest in the scheme shows we are on the right path , " a spokesman for munich re said .
a study suggests that with the use of thermal power plants and high voltage direct current transmission lines , desertec 's pioneering foray into the desert could meet 15 percent of europe 's electricity needs by the year 2050 .
bildunterschrift : the project could meet 15 percent of europe 's electricity needs by 2050 gerhard knies , chairman of the desertec supervisory board said the desert is an obvious source of clean power .
" within six hours deserts receive more energy from the sun than humankind consumes within a year , " he said adding that the " time appears right for a truly comprehensive maneuver to combat climate change . "
firms hope project will help combat climate change other companies involved in the venture are the spanish firm abengoa solar and the algerian conglomerate cevital as well as several german banks and engineering companies .
under the agreement , a desertec study office to be established by october will have three years to detail investment plans to create the network of solar farms .
representatives of the arab league and the egyptian energy ministry were also present at the signing of the protocol .
munich re board member torsten jeworrek said the european companies involved had pledged to work " as equals in a sincere and fair " manner with the producer countries .
" if we 're successful , we 'll make a huge contribution to the fight against climate change , " jeworrek said .
environmental organization greenpeace has welcomed the initiative and urged the german government to support it by channelling research funds earmarked for nuclear energy to the solar energy project .
critics slam huge costs but critics of the desertec project have warned that the political situation in many of the producer countries in north africa is unstable .
the european association for renewable energy , eurosolar , has said the desertec initiative is completely unviable .

" we could invest the 400 billion euros here " scheer said , referring to the recession-hit eurozone .
he also said he preferred a network of decentralized operators that produced renewable energy from many sources rather than having one key project in the hands of major corporations .

" today we have taken a step forward -lrb- towards the project 's realization -rrb- , " said nikolaus von bomhard , head of munich re , which hosted the signing .
the firms grouped under the desertec industrial initiative -lrb- dii -rrb- plan to build solar power generators in north africa and the middle east .
the massive project will see investments of up to 400 billion euros over a period of 40 years .
" of course it is still a long way off , but the enormous interest in the scheme shows we are on the right path , " a spokesman for munich re said .
a study suggests that with the use of thermal power plants and high voltage direct current transmission lines , desertec 's pioneering foray into the desert could meet 15 percent of europe 's electricity needs by the year 2050 .
bildunterschrift : the project could meet 15 percent of europe 's electricity needs by 2050 gerhard knies , chairman of the desertec supervisory board said the desert is an obvious source of clean power .
" within six hours deserts receive more energy from the sun than humankind consumes within a year , " he said adding that the " time appears right for a truly comprehensive maneuver to combat climate change . "
firms hope project will help combat climate change other companies involved in the venture are the spanish firm abengoa solar and the algerian conglomerate cevital as well as several german banks and engineering companies .
under the agreement , a desertec study office to be established by october will have three years to detail investment plans to create the network of solar farms .
representatives of the arab league and the egyptian energy ministry were also present at the signing of the protocol .
munich re board member torsten jeworrek said the european companies involved had pledged to work " as equals in a sincere and fair " manner with the producer countries .
" if we 're successful , we 'll make a huge contribution to the fight against climate change , " jeworrek said .
environmental organization greenpeace has welcomed the initiative and urged the german government to support it by channelling research funds earmarked for nuclear energy to the solar energy project .
critics slam huge costs but critics of the desertec project have warned that the political situation in many of the producer countries in north africa is unstable .
the european association for renewable energy , eurosolar , has said the desertec initiative is completely unviable .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the desertec initiative envisages solar power plants in africa and the middle east herman scheer , head of eurosolar and social democratic lawmaker in the german parliament said it was not necessary to go to north africa to collect the sun 's rays .
" we could invest the 400 billion euros here " scheer said , referring to the recession-hit eurozone .
he also said he preferred a network of decentralized operators that produced renewable energy from many sources rather than having one key project in the hands of major corporations .
" nothing will ever come of it -lrb- the project -rrb- , " scheer said .
he added that the astronomical costs of the gigantic project had been played down while the technical possibilities promised by it had been exaggerated. sp / afp / reuters / dpa editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

heads of state and government from 43 european union and the mediterranean-rim countries had accepted an invitation to paris extended by french president nicolas sarkozy to give new impetus to mediterranean cooperation .
the union for the mediterranean follows up on the barcelona process , initiated in 1995 , which also had a pronounced security dimension . ultimately , the union for the mediterranean set itself a six-point agenda , among others the " mediterranean solar plan . "
the recent gaza war has upset these plans .
no high-ranking ministerial meetings have taken place since december 2008 , and some important issues dealing with the institutional design of the union have been shelved . similar to the constraints imposed on the baltic sea co-operation of the 1970s -lrb- due to the east-west conflict -rrb- , it would be recommendable for the union for the mediterranean to put high politics as well as security issues aside and focus on economic matters and the protection of the environment and the climate .
against this backdrop , can it be mere coincidence that it was precisely for july 13 that the munich re group issued invitations for the inaugural meeting of the so-called " desertec initiative " in munich ? energy security based on solar thermal power plants ? bildunterschrift : the desertec project aims to feed solar power from africa and the middle east to the eu while the idea behind the desertec project is nothing new , it is still fascinating : solar thermal power plants in northern africa would contribute to supplying europe with the clean energy it needs .
a total of roughly 400 billion euros in investments would be needed by the year 2050 to cover 15 percent of europe 's electricity needs .
so is the - privately financed - desertec consortium set to get the better of the european mediterranean solar plan , or indeed to replace it ? to start with the good news : the technology needed to generate solar thermal power , known as concentrated solar power -lrb- csp -rrb- , is already available , as are the high-voltage , direct current -lrb- hvdc -rrb- electric power transmission lines required to transport it .
in kramer junction , california , the first parabolic trough power plants have been connected to the grid since the mid-1980s .
more advanced csp power plants have been built in the united states and spain and are already several years old .
another csp plant , an integrated solar combined cycle plant -lrb- iscc -rrb- , is currently under construction in kuraymat , egypt .
parabolic trough power plants are already in the planning stages in some other countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german companies lead the field in concentrated solar power technology another piece of good news - at least from the german perspective - is that german companies lead the field when it comes to csp technology .
the parabolic mirrors are built by flabeg , the receivers by schott solar , the turbines , generators and control technology are available from siemens , and solar millennium and man ferrostaal operate as general contractors . looking for safe locations for solar plants is the only task remaining to secure the financing for the desertec initiative and to integrate it politically into the union for the mediterranean ?
not quite .
it will not prove so easy to enlist the southern mediterranean-rim countries as potential locations for power plants .
many of these countries are ruled by authoritarian regimes of different stripes , and there is an ever-present danger in the region of terrorist attacks .
population growth and unemployment are also very high in this part of the world , and such social problems are aggravated by migration pressure from sub-saharan africa .
all in all , an explosive mix , with important implications for our security as well . most of the non-eu mediterranean-rim countries have major development needs .
one prerequisite for development is energy .
however , most of the power plants currently in operation there are conventional , carbon-based plants .
in times of an accelerated climate change that has the gravest of implications for developing and transition countries , the latter need to switch their energy supply , as early as possible , to a non-conventional energy path , and that means , in effect , to renewable energy sources . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. stefan gaenzle is an expert on multilateral development cooperation with die large-scale solar thermal power plants may offer one solution to the problem .
even though energy production costs - 15 euros to 23 euro cents per kilowatt hour - are still higher than those for conventional power plants .
it would be possible -based , for example , on the model of the german renewable energy law - to close the viability gap either by raising the feed-in tariff for renewable electricity -lrb- to be paid by the end user -rrb- or by having government set ambitious quotas for the share of renewably generated electricity as a means of attracting investments in csp plants .
the important thing is to set clear-cut framework conditions for electricity sales in countries with the potential to operate csp plants , in this way ensuring that the billions that need to be invested will pay off in the long term for private investors . grid development as a pan-european task some successes in economic transformation have already been observed in the context of the euro-mediterranean partnership , in tunisia for instance , although there has been less movement when it comes to political change .
be that as it may , though , the union for the mediterranean does offer a dynamic normative frame of reference for the southern mediterranean-rim countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias ruchser is an energy consultant and head of media and public relations at die however , the eu 's tasks in the framework of the union for the mediterranean should not be to offset the financial risk for private-sector projects like the desertec initiative .
this , though , may be a different matter when it comes to support for the development and expansion of the power grid in the overall mediterranean region .
grid development must be viewed under the aspect of public welfare , and here the eu could provide an important contribution to collective energy security in the mediterranean region , one that would entail a security dividend over the longer term . to put it in a nutshell : renewable energy sources promote development , and development promotes security .

heads of state and government from 43 european union and the mediterranean-rim countries had accepted an invitation to paris extended by french president nicolas sarkozy to give new impetus to mediterranean cooperation .
the union for the mediterranean follows up on the barcelona process , initiated in 1995 , which also had a pronounced security dimension . ultimately , the union for the mediterranean set itself a six-point agenda , among others the " mediterranean solar plan . "
the recent gaza war has upset these plans .
no high-ranking ministerial meetings have taken place since december 2008 , and some important issues dealing with the institutional design of the union have been shelved . similar to the constraints imposed on the baltic sea co-operation of the 1970s -lrb- due to the east-west conflict -rrb- , it would be recommendable for the union for the mediterranean to put high politics as well as security issues aside and focus on economic matters and the protection of the environment and the climate .
against this backdrop , can it be mere coincidence that it was precisely for july 13 that the munich re group issued invitations for the inaugural meeting of the so-called " desertec initiative " in munich ? energy security based on solar thermal power plants ? bildunterschrift : the desertec project aims to feed solar power from africa and the middle east to the eu while the idea behind the desertec project is nothing new , it is still fascinating : solar thermal power plants in northern africa would contribute to supplying europe with the clean energy it needs .
a total of roughly 400 billion euros in investments would be needed by the year 2050 to cover 15 percent of europe 's electricity needs .
so is the - privately financed - desertec consortium set to get the better of the european mediterranean solar plan , or indeed to replace it ? to start with the good news : the technology needed to generate solar thermal power , known as concentrated solar power -lrb- csp -rrb- , is already available , as are the high-voltage , direct current -lrb- hvdc -rrb- electric power transmission lines required to transport it .
in kramer junction , california , the first parabolic trough power plants have been connected to the grid since the mid-1980s .
more advanced csp power plants have been built in the united states and spain and are already several years old .
another csp plant , an integrated solar combined cycle plant -lrb- iscc -rrb- , is currently under construction in kuraymat , egypt .
parabolic trough power plants are already in the planning stages in some other countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german companies lead the field in concentrated solar power technology another piece of good news - at least from the german perspective - is that german companies lead the field when it comes to csp technology .
the parabolic mirrors are built by flabeg , the receivers by schott solar , the turbines , generators and control technology are available from siemens , and solar millennium and man ferrostaal operate as general contractors . looking for safe locations for solar plants is the only task remaining to secure the financing for the desertec initiative and to integrate it politically into the union for the mediterranean ?
not quite .
it will not prove so easy to enlist the southern mediterranean-rim countries as potential locations for power plants .
many of these countries are ruled by authoritarian regimes of different stripes , and there is an ever-present danger in the region of terrorist attacks .
population growth and unemployment are also very high in this part of the world , and such social problems are aggravated by migration pressure from sub-saharan africa .
all in all , an explosive mix , with important implications for our security as well . most of the non-eu mediterranean-rim countries have major development needs .
one prerequisite for development is energy .
however , most of the power plants currently in operation there are conventional , carbon-based plants .
in times of an accelerated climate change that has the gravest of implications for developing and transition countries , the latter need to switch their energy supply , as early as possible , to a non-conventional energy path , and that means , in effect , to renewable energy sources . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. stefan gaenzle is an expert on multilateral development cooperation with die large-scale solar thermal power plants may offer one solution to the problem .
even though energy production costs - 15 euros to 23 euro cents per kilowatt hour - are still higher than those for conventional power plants .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 13.07.2009 african solar power for europe could promote security , experts say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : capturing sunshine could lead to energy development and security hurdles remain , but mediterranean countries should cooperate on economic development and environmental protection including a new solar power project , according to guest commentators matthias ruchser and stefan gaenzle . last year , on july 13 , the " union for the mediterranean " was launched amid much diplomatic fanfare .
heads of state and government from 43 european union and the mediterranean-rim countries had accepted an invitation to paris extended by french president nicolas sarkozy to give new impetus to mediterranean cooperation .
the union for the mediterranean follows up on the barcelona process , initiated in 1995 , which also had a pronounced security dimension . ultimately , the union for the mediterranean set itself a six-point agenda , among others the " mediterranean solar plan . "
the recent gaza war has upset these plans .
no high-ranking ministerial meetings have taken place since december 2008 , and some important issues dealing with the institutional design of the union have been shelved . similar to the constraints imposed on the baltic sea co-operation of the 1970s -lrb- due to the east-west conflict -rrb- , it would be recommendable for the union for the mediterranean to put high politics as well as security issues aside and focus on economic matters and the protection of the environment and the climate .
against this backdrop , can it be mere coincidence that it was precisely for july 13 that the munich re group issued invitations for the inaugural meeting of the so-called " desertec initiative " in munich ? energy security based on solar thermal power plants ? bildunterschrift : the desertec project aims to feed solar power from africa and the middle east to the eu while the idea behind the desertec project is nothing new , it is still fascinating : solar thermal power plants in northern africa would contribute to supplying europe with the clean energy it needs .
a total of roughly 400 billion euros in investments would be needed by the year 2050 to cover 15 percent of europe 's electricity needs .
so is the - privately financed - desertec consortium set to get the better of the european mediterranean solar plan , or indeed to replace it ? to start with the good news : the technology needed to generate solar thermal power , known as concentrated solar power -lrb- csp -rrb- , is already available , as are the high-voltage , direct current -lrb- hvdc -rrb- electric power transmission lines required to transport it .
in kramer junction , california , the first parabolic trough power plants have been connected to the grid since the mid-1980s .
more advanced csp power plants have been built in the united states and spain and are already several years old .
another csp plant , an integrated solar combined cycle plant -lrb- iscc -rrb- , is currently under construction in kuraymat , egypt .
parabolic trough power plants are already in the planning stages in some other countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german companies lead the field in concentrated solar power technology another piece of good news - at least from the german perspective - is that german companies lead the field when it comes to csp technology .
the parabolic mirrors are built by flabeg , the receivers by schott solar , the turbines , generators and control technology are available from siemens , and solar millennium and man ferrostaal operate as general contractors . looking for safe locations for solar plants is the only task remaining to secure the financing for the desertec initiative and to integrate it politically into the union for the mediterranean ?
not quite .
it will not prove so easy to enlist the southern mediterranean-rim countries as potential locations for power plants .
many of these countries are ruled by authoritarian regimes of different stripes , and there is an ever-present danger in the region of terrorist attacks .
population growth and unemployment are also very high in this part of the world , and such social problems are aggravated by migration pressure from sub-saharan africa .
all in all , an explosive mix , with important implications for our security as well . most of the non-eu mediterranean-rim countries have major development needs .
one prerequisite for development is energy .
however , most of the power plants currently in operation there are conventional , carbon-based plants .
in times of an accelerated climate change that has the gravest of implications for developing and transition countries , the latter need to switch their energy supply , as early as possible , to a non-conventional energy path , and that means , in effect , to renewable energy sources . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. stefan gaenzle is an expert on multilateral development cooperation with die large-scale solar thermal power plants may offer one solution to the problem .
even though energy production costs - 15 euros to 23 euro cents per kilowatt hour - are still higher than those for conventional power plants .
it would be possible -based , for example , on the model of the german renewable energy law - to close the viability gap either by raising the feed-in tariff for renewable electricity -lrb- to be paid by the end user -rrb- or by having government set ambitious quotas for the share of renewably generated electricity as a means of attracting investments in csp plants .
the important thing is to set clear-cut framework conditions for electricity sales in countries with the potential to operate csp plants , in this way ensuring that the billions that need to be invested will pay off in the long term for private investors . grid development as a pan-european task some successes in economic transformation have already been observed in the context of the euro-mediterranean partnership , in tunisia for instance , although there has been less movement when it comes to political change .
be that as it may , though , the union for the mediterranean does offer a dynamic normative frame of reference for the southern mediterranean-rim countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias ruchser is an energy consultant and head of media and public relations at die however , the eu 's tasks in the framework of the union for the mediterranean should not be to offset the financial risk for private-sector projects like the desertec initiative .
this , though , may be a different matter when it comes to support for the development and expansion of the power grid in the overall mediterranean region .
grid development must be viewed under the aspect of public welfare , and here the eu could provide an important contribution to collective energy security in the mediterranean region , one that would entail a security dividend over the longer term . to put it in a nutshell : renewable energy sources promote development , and development promotes security .
looked at in this way , the evolving desertec consortium should provide a new and innovative boost for the union for the mediterranean . authors : matthias ruchser , dr. stefan gaenzle -lrb- ar -rrb- editor : sean sinico matthias ruchser is a consultant in the energy industry and head of media and public relations at the german development institute / deutsches institut für entwicklungspolitik -lrb- die -rrb- .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 13.07.2009 original eau de cologne celebrates 300 years großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it smells like an italian spring morning , said the perfumer the world 's oldest existing perfume maker is celebrating its 300th birthday .
the original eau de cologne , survived wars and imitations and still sells well in a market saturated with modern scents . the first bottle of eau de cologne was created by giovanni maria farina , an italian expatriate living in the eastern german city of cologne .
on july 13 , 1709 , farina opened a luxury goods shop where the fragrance was sold . in a letter to his brother dated in 1709 , farina wrote , " i have discovered a scent that reminds me of an italian spring morning , of daffodils and orange blossoms after the rain . "
he named it after the city he lived in . over the course of the last three centuries , only 30 people have been privy to the secret recipe - including johann maria farina , a descendant of the perfumer and the company 's current managing director . " it 's crucial that the original eau de cologne always smells the same , " said farina .
" like champagne that 's made from many different wines and has a specific taste or aroma . " an eau de cologne differs from a so-called eau de toilette in that it has a smaller concentration of essential oils , which give the solution its scent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the original eau de cologne was a top seller in giovanni maria farina 's luxury shop napoleon allegedly used one vial of the valuable liquid each day .
a vial cost a week 's wages for a master craftsman - or well over 1,000 euros -lrb- $ 1,400 -rrb- in today 's money - making the perfume only accessible to the extremely wealthy . but the hefty price tag did n't always mean big earnings for farina 's company . " there were many crises , " said the firm 's current managing director .
" the french revolution and the first and second world wars were the biggest crises for us - not because our customers could n't pay but because we were cut off from the raw materials and could n't produce . " a respected imitation in addition to political conflicts , the original eau de cologne has also had to deal with stiff competition from a popular imitation : 4711 . in the 18th century , the muehlens , a merchant family from cologne , produced a citrus-based scent similar to the original eau de cologne , calling it by the house number of the factory on glockengasse in downtown cologne .
while 4711 is known around the world - and boasts an over 200-year history - it 's not the original . in 1994 , the muehlens family sold its company to the german wella corporation .
it was then acquired by procter and gamble in 2003 and returned to german hands in 2007 , when the company was bought by maeurer und wirtz , best known for its perfume brand tabac original . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 4711 has a large following of its own while farina 's eau de cologne may be the true original , 4711 has always been the more commercially successful scent . it is marketed in 75 countries today and is especially popular with the older generation of germans .
the fragrance also sells well in japan , where men perfume their hair with it . farina , however , said there are no bad feelings between his family and the muehlens , the founders of 4711 . " i once had a dance class with a daughter of ferdinand muehlens and know the others as well , " said farina .
" there have never been any problems between the two families . " today , the farina house in cologne 's old town has its very own museum , where visitors can learn more about the art of perfume making and the original koelnisch wasser - eau de cologne . author : catrin moederler -lrb- kjb / ab -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the original eau de cologne , survived wars and imitations and still sells well in a market saturated with modern scents . the first bottle of eau de cologne was created by giovanni maria farina , an italian expatriate living in the eastern german city of cologne .
on july 13 , 1709 , farina opened a luxury goods shop where the fragrance was sold . in a letter to his brother dated in 1709 , farina wrote , " i have discovered a scent that reminds me of an italian spring morning , of daffodils and orange blossoms after the rain . "
he named it after the city he lived in . over the course of the last three centuries , only 30 people have been privy to the secret recipe - including johann maria farina , a descendant of the perfumer and the company 's current managing director . " it 's crucial that the original eau de cologne always smells the same , " said farina .
" like champagne that 's made from many different wines and has a specific taste or aroma . " an eau de cologne differs from a so-called eau de toilette in that it has a smaller concentration of essential oils , which give the solution its scent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the original eau de cologne was a top seller in giovanni maria farina 's luxury shop napoleon allegedly used one vial of the valuable liquid each day .
a vial cost a week 's wages for a master craftsman - or well over 1,000 euros -lrb- $ 1,400 -rrb- in today 's money - making the perfume only accessible to the extremely wealthy . but the hefty price tag did n't always mean big earnings for farina 's company . " there were many crises , " said the firm 's current managing director .
" the french revolution and the first and second world wars were the biggest crises for us - not because our customers could n't pay but because we were cut off from the raw materials and could n't produce . " a respected imitation in addition to political conflicts , the original eau de cologne has also had to deal with stiff competition from a popular imitation : 4711 . in the 18th century , the muehlens , a merchant family from cologne , produced a citrus-based scent similar to the original eau de cologne , calling it by the house number of the factory on glockengasse in downtown cologne .
while 4711 is known around the world - and boasts an over 200-year history - it 's not the original . in 1994 , the muehlens family sold its company to the german wella corporation .
it was then acquired by procter and gamble in 2003 and returned to german hands in 2007 , when the company was bought by maeurer und wirtz , best known for its perfume brand tabac original . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 4711 has a large following of its own while farina 's eau de cologne may be the true original , 4711 has always been the more commercially successful scent . it is marketed in 75 countries today and is especially popular with the older generation of germans .
the fragrance also sells well in japan , where men perfume their hair with it . farina , however , said there are no bad feelings between his family and the muehlens , the founders of 4711 . " i once had a dance class with a daughter of ferdinand muehlens and know the others as well , " said farina .

it was then acquired by procter and gamble in 2003 and returned to german hands in 2007 , when the company was bought by maeurer und wirtz , best known for its perfume brand tabac original . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 4711 has a large following of its own while farina 's eau de cologne may be the true original , 4711 has always been the more commercially successful scent . it is marketed in 75 countries today and is especially popular with the older generation of germans .
the fragrance also sells well in japan , where men perfume their hair with it . farina , however , said there are no bad feelings between his family and the muehlens , the founders of 4711 . " i once had a dance class with a daughter of ferdinand muehlens and know the others as well , " said farina .
" there have never been any problems between the two families . " today , the farina house in cologne 's old town has its very own museum , where visitors can learn more about the art of perfume making and the original koelnisch wasser - eau de cologne . author : catrin moederler -lrb- kjb / ab -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
during a speech in london on saturday , solana said it was up to the mediator to set a timetable for peace .
" after a fixed deadline , a un security council resolution should proclaim the adoption of the two-state solution . "
solana said , adding that such a resolution should include all the parameters of borders , refugees , jerusalem and security arrangements .
" it would accept the palestinian state as a full member of the un and set a calendar for implementation . "
speaking on israeli radio on monday , lieberman said " with all due respect to solana , he is about to retire ... and we should not overstate the importance of his statement .
' artificial ' road to peace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief javier solana wants a deadline while israel , which is under pressure from washington to move the middle east peace process forward , is deeply opposed to any " artificial " attempt to reach agreement over the future of the region , the palestinian reaction has been quite different .
a spokesman for palestinian president mahmud abbas said the proposed un resolution would be " one option " were israel to block its vision of a two-state solution .
" europe , as a member of the international quartet must continue in its efforts to apply pressure to israel to freeze the settlements and stop wasting time , " nabil abu rudeina told the afp news agency .
peace talks between the two sides stalled in december and the palestinians have made it clear that they will not resume negotiations until israel halts the construction of settlements on occupied land. tkw / reuters / afp editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it marks the highest rate since the eu currency was introduced in 2002 . a statement released by the ecb said " a total of 413,000 counterfeit euro banknotes were withdrawn from circulation , " in the first half of 2009 .
it added that in the main , those bills originated from the same places as previously seized forgeries , meaning no new counterfeit sources had been found .
although the increase is high , the european central bank also said it was important to consider the number of genuine banknotes - some 12.5 billion - in circulation during the same timeframe .
in germany , the number of fakes rose in keeping with the overall figure , costing the economy 1.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.23 billion -rrb- .
but the federal bank said that was an improvement of some 100,000 euros over the last six months of 2008 .
it attributed the drop to the fact that the majority of notes seized between january and june of 2009 were of relatively small denominations .
twenty and fifty euro notes made up almost fifty percent of the total number largely recovered from across the 16 nations which use the common currency .

it demonstrates how they have expanded their grip in vast swathes of the state and beyond .
the security establishment in new delhi is shaken by the assault and is re-examining the government 's approach to left-wing extremism . sunday saw the biggest single casualty inflicted by the maoists so far in 2009 but there have already been over a thousand such attacks in india ’ s nine maoist-hit states this year .
according to the indian home ministry , at least 450 people were killed by the maoists in the first six months of this year , with chhattisgarh alone accounting for about a third .
during the general elections in may , trains were hijacked and 17 people were murdered , including election officials .
“ there are incidents taking place in chhattisgarh , in jharkhand , orissa , some incidents in bihar , maharashtra and andhra pradesh .
but the two states that are worst affected are chhattisgarh and jharkhand , ” explained former home minister shivraj patil .
decade-long conflict claiming to be fighting for the rights of landless peasants and labourers in rural areas left behind by india 's rapid economic growth , the maoists , who don ’ t number more than 10,000 , have waged their war for over a decade now .
on monday , chhattisgarh chief minister raman singh put on a brave face .
“ the time has now come to take the fight to the maoists ' camp , ” he said .
“ our fight is carrying on and we have also suffered a lot .

despite the setting up of counter insurgency and anti-terrorism -lrb- ciat -rrb- schools , the sharing of intelligence between affected states and the improvement of inter-state coordination by the union government , the rebels still seem to have an upper hand .
the maoist insurgency threatens to disrupt the democratic process in several states , as well as hinder economic progress .
m r narayana swami , a close watcher of the maoists ’ activities , thinks they have achieved moderate success in their aims : “ they have caused immense financial losses to the industry and government by disrupting rail traffic in states , which are economically very active and in fact the losses amount to billions of rupees and that is a point to be noted . ”
disturbing pattern senior intelligence officials have found a disturbing pattern to attacks against the police , especially in chhattisgarh and jharkhand .
while rushing in reinforcements to thickly forested areas , police personnel seem to ignore the fact that vast tracts of terrain are heavily booby-trapped with improvised explosive devices -lrb- ieds -rrb- .
having a distinct advantage of the topography of these tracts , the rebels lie quietly in wait and trigger these devices , which often results in huge casualties of security personnel .
last month , the indian security forces captured a key maoist stronghold in west bengal after battling through landmines and gunfire with the rebels .
new delhi then formally banned the maoists , designating them officially as a terrorist organisation .
the government is now expected to call another meeting of the chief ministers of the maoist affected states to review their approach before mounting a serious offensive against the insurgent group .

most-wanted nazi war criminal demjanjuk has denied accusations that he was a guard at the sobibor death camp in nazi-occupied poland in 1943 and helped murder jews .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a monument in sobibor in eastern poland remembers the victims at the nazi death camp he has said he was captured by the germans in ukraine while fighting for the red army and held as a prisoner of war .
until being deported to germany in may , the ukrainian-born demjanjuk had headed the list of the simon wiesenthal center 's 10 most-wanted suspected war criminals .
efraim zuroff from the simon wiesenthal centre welcomed monday 's move by german prosecutors .
" this is obviously an important step forward , " zufroff told the associated press .
" we hope that the trial itself will be expedited so that justice will be achieved and he can be given the appropriate punishment . "
" the effort to bring demjanjuk to justice sends a very powerful message that the passage of time in no way diminishes the guilt of the perpetrator . "
possibly last holocaust trial demjanjuk was deported by us authorities from his home in ohio on may 12 .
he had appealed against the deportation in a last ditch attempt to avoid facing charges but had his request rejected by a german court last week . demjanjuk 's trial is the last expected time a german court will prosecute for holocaust crimes in the country .
demjanjuk has lived in the us since 1952 .
he arrived there as a refugee and worked in the car industry in cleveland , ohio .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a former id card of demjanjuk 's with the word " sobibor " printed on it in 1988 , he was sentenced to death in israel for crimes against humanity after holocaust survivors identified him as the notorious " ivan the terrible , " a guard at the treblinka death camp .
but israel 's highest court later overturned his sentence , after documents from the former soviet union indicated that " ivan the terrible " had probably been a different man .
demjanjuk returned to the us , but in 2002 had his us citizenship revoked because of his failure to disclose his work at nazi camps when he first arrived . sp / reuters / dpa editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 47-year-old diamond trader was sentenced to eight years in jail for actively supporting the terrorist group . prosecutors said aleem n. supported al-qaeda for years , raising money , distributing propaganda material and recruiting new members .
he is thought to be a key figure for the organization 's german operations .
the german man of pakistani descent was arrested in february of last year on allegations that he belonged to the terrorist group .
investigators say that in the summer of 2004 , he became part of the inner sanctum of the organization and received orders to recruit new members and supporters in germany .
investigators believe that by 2007 , aleem n. had sent four young fighters - together with letters of recommendation - to be trained in terror camps .
one of them is believed to be a bonn-based man , who appeared in an anti-german terrorist video earlier this year .

the hijacking has led to a debate in germany and the question what can be done about it . the situation for the hansa stavanger 's crew of 24 has become desperate .
according to germany 's spiegel magazine , the captain reported to his wife a week ago that there was a lack of drinking water , food and medication .
many crew members are supposedly ill .
negotiations between the pirates and the hamburg based ship owner leonhardt & blumberg are ongoing .
the pirates originally demanded $ 15 million ransom .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : special forces during a naval training mission three weeks after the hijacking special troops from the german federal police prepared to storm the ship and free the hostages .
two hundred german anti-terror specialists practised the operation on board of the us navy ship uss boxer less then fifty nautical miles away from the hansa stavanger .
but before german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble in berlin could give the go-ahead for the operation , us national security advisor james jones in washington called the operation off , saying it was too risky .
but without american logistical support germany 's elite troops were grounded .
jason alderwick , a maritime defense analyst with the international institute for strategic studies -lrb- iiss -rrb- in london , supports the stance taken by the us .
" the german contribution is just part of a wider international coalition .
so unilaterally deciding to storm a ship is n't necessarily the right approach . "
better funding and cooperation wolfgang bosbach , the vice-chairman of chancellor angela merkel 's christian-democratic group in parliament , argues that german police have the right to storm a hijacked german ship in any case .
" when we need the support of other states , we ca n't decide alone .
we need our own capacities as far as helicopter air transport is concerned .
we need better air supported reconnaissance and we need better communication between the authorities in charge . "
bosbach wants better funding , so germany can carry out operations without international help . and he also urges better cooperation between the defense and interior ministries .
there was speculation in the media , that defense minister franz-josef jung asked washington to stop interior minister schaeuble .
jung is in charge of the military , schaeuble is responsible for the police , which includes the unit that was supposed to carry out the anti-terror operation .
wolfgang bosbach does n't want to address the media speculation , but emphasizes that the german military has a special mandate for fighting piracy at the horn of africa , but that it is the general responsibility of germany 's federal police to free hostages when necessary .
bosbach adds that for germany , given its recent century history , every international military operation remains a balancing act between modesty and responsibility .
" we have good reasons to say ' never first , never alone , never without an international mandate ' .
but when we say a , we also must say b. when we decide to send troops , we must make sure that they are equipped appropriately . "
fighting the root problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : capturing and trying somali pirates is difficult still , the larger question remains whether soldiers and policemen can stop pirates .
for more than six months now , the navies of nine european nations have been patrolling the somali coastline .
and yet piracy has continued .
wolfgang bosbach admits that the military alone ca n't stop piracy .
" we are talking here about organized crime .
we have to look at the causes .
that 's why besides the defense and interior ministries , foreign affairs and development ministries must be involved as well . "
still , he says , the european military patrols around the somali coast - operation atalanta - has had an impact : " the shipping companies must decide to join a convoy , which gets navy protection .
none of the convoys we accompanied got into trouble . "
jason alderwick agrees in principle that piracy is a matter of international crime and therefore rather a police than a military issue : " it would be great to hand over the operation to coast guard assets .
but europeans do n't have a huge coast guard , which is able to deploy in a counter piracy role .
so you have to go with the forces and capabilities you have .
the military instrument is a blunt instrument , but it 's adapting as best as it can with the situation down there . "
overall , says alderwick , europe 's atalanta operation at the horn of africa makes sense .
" there has arguably been an escalation in the number of piracy attacks , but that is n't a direct consequence of the operation .
it 's just a consequence of the overall situation .
without atalanta , piracy in the region would definitely have been worse . "

negotiations between the pirates and the hamburg based ship owner leonhardt & blumberg are ongoing .
the pirates originally demanded $ 15 million ransom .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : special forces during a naval training mission three weeks after the hijacking special troops from the german federal police prepared to storm the ship and free the hostages .
two hundred german anti-terror specialists practised the operation on board of the us navy ship uss boxer less then fifty nautical miles away from the hansa stavanger .
but before german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble in berlin could give the go-ahead for the operation , us national security advisor james jones in washington called the operation off , saying it was too risky .
but without american logistical support germany 's elite troops were grounded .
jason alderwick , a maritime defense analyst with the international institute for strategic studies -lrb- iiss -rrb- in london , supports the stance taken by the us .
" the german contribution is just part of a wider international coalition .
so unilaterally deciding to storm a ship is n't necessarily the right approach . "
better funding and cooperation wolfgang bosbach , the vice-chairman of chancellor angela merkel 's christian-democratic group in parliament , argues that german police have the right to storm a hijacked german ship in any case .
" when we need the support of other states , we ca n't decide alone .
we need our own capacities as far as helicopter air transport is concerned .
we need better air supported reconnaissance and we need better communication between the authorities in charge . "
bosbach wants better funding , so germany can carry out operations without international help . and he also urges better cooperation between the defense and interior ministries .
there was speculation in the media , that defense minister franz-josef jung asked washington to stop interior minister schaeuble .
jung is in charge of the military , schaeuble is responsible for the police , which includes the unit that was supposed to carry out the anti-terror operation .
wolfgang bosbach does n't want to address the media speculation , but emphasizes that the german military has a special mandate for fighting piracy at the horn of africa , but that it is the general responsibility of germany 's federal police to free hostages when necessary .
bosbach adds that for germany , given its recent century history , every international military operation remains a balancing act between modesty and responsibility .
" we have good reasons to say ' never first , never alone , never without an international mandate ' .
but when we say a , we also must say b. when we decide to send troops , we must make sure that they are equipped appropriately . "
fighting the root problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : capturing and trying somali pirates is difficult still , the larger question remains whether soldiers and policemen can stop pirates .
for more than six months now , the navies of nine european nations have been patrolling the somali coastline .
and yet piracy has continued .
wolfgang bosbach admits that the military alone ca n't stop piracy .
" we are talking here about organized crime .
we have to look at the causes .
that 's why besides the defense and interior ministries , foreign affairs and development ministries must be involved as well . "
still , he says , the european military patrols around the somali coast - operation atalanta - has had an impact : " the shipping companies must decide to join a convoy , which gets navy protection .
none of the convoys we accompanied got into trouble . "
jason alderwick agrees in principle that piracy is a matter of international crime and therefore rather a police than a military issue : " it would be great to hand over the operation to coast guard assets .
but europeans do n't have a huge coast guard , which is able to deploy in a counter piracy role .
so you have to go with the forces and capabilities you have .
the military instrument is a blunt instrument , but it 's adapting as best as it can with the situation down there . "
overall , says alderwick , europe 's atalanta operation at the horn of africa makes sense .
" there has arguably been an escalation in the number of piracy attacks , but that is n't a direct consequence of the operation .
it 's just a consequence of the overall situation .
without atalanta , piracy in the region would definitely have been worse . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 13.07.2009 african solar power for europe could promote security , experts say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : capturing sunshine could lead to energy development and security hurdles remain , but mediterranean countries should cooperate on economic development and environmental protection including a new solar power project , according to guest commentators matthias ruchser and stefan gaenzle . last year , on july 13 , the " union for the mediterranean " was launched amid much diplomatic fanfare .
heads of state and government from 43 european union and the mediterranean-rim countries had accepted an invitation to paris extended by french president nicolas sarkozy to give new impetus to mediterranean cooperation .
the union for the mediterranean follows up on the barcelona process , initiated in 1995 , which also had a pronounced security dimension . ultimately , the union for the mediterranean set itself a six-point agenda , among others the " mediterranean solar plan . "
the recent gaza war has upset these plans .
no high-ranking ministerial meetings have taken place since december 2008 , and some important issues dealing with the institutional design of the union have been shelved . similar to the constraints imposed on the baltic sea co-operation of the 1970s -lrb- due to the east-west conflict -rrb- , it would be recommendable for the union for the mediterranean to put high politics as well as security issues aside and focus on economic matters and the protection of the environment and the climate .
against this backdrop , can it be mere coincidence that it was precisely for july 13 that the munich re group issued invitations for the inaugural meeting of the so-called " desertec initiative " in munich ? energy security based on solar thermal power plants ? bildunterschrift : the desertec project aims to feed solar power from africa and the middle east to the eu while the idea behind the desertec project is nothing new , it is still fascinating : solar thermal power plants in northern africa would contribute to supplying europe with the clean energy it needs .
a total of roughly 400 billion euros in investments would be needed by the year 2050 to cover 15 percent of europe 's electricity needs .
so is the - privately financed - desertec consortium set to get the better of the european mediterranean solar plan , or indeed to replace it ? to start with the good news : the technology needed to generate solar thermal power , known as concentrated solar power -lrb- csp -rrb- , is already available , as are the high-voltage , direct current -lrb- hvdc -rrb- electric power transmission lines required to transport it .
in kramer junction , california , the first parabolic trough power plants have been connected to the grid since the mid-1980s .
more advanced csp power plants have been built in the united states and spain and are already several years old .
another csp plant , an integrated solar combined cycle plant -lrb- iscc -rrb- , is currently under construction in kuraymat , egypt .
parabolic trough power plants are already in the planning stages in some other countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german companies lead the field in concentrated solar power technology another piece of good news - at least from the german perspective - is that german companies lead the field when it comes to csp technology .
the parabolic mirrors are built by flabeg , the receivers by schott solar , the turbines , generators and control technology are available from siemens , and solar millennium and man ferrostaal operate as general contractors . looking for safe locations for solar plants is the only task remaining to secure the financing for the desertec initiative and to integrate it politically into the union for the mediterranean ?
not quite .
it will not prove so easy to enlist the southern mediterranean-rim countries as potential locations for power plants .
many of these countries are ruled by authoritarian regimes of different stripes , and there is an ever-present danger in the region of terrorist attacks .
population growth and unemployment are also very high in this part of the world , and such social problems are aggravated by migration pressure from sub-saharan africa .
all in all , an explosive mix , with important implications for our security as well . most of the non-eu mediterranean-rim countries have major development needs .
one prerequisite for development is energy .
however , most of the power plants currently in operation there are conventional , carbon-based plants .
in times of an accelerated climate change that has the gravest of implications for developing and transition countries , the latter need to switch their energy supply , as early as possible , to a non-conventional energy path , and that means , in effect , to renewable energy sources . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. stefan gaenzle is an expert on multilateral development cooperation with die large-scale solar thermal power plants may offer one solution to the problem .
even though energy production costs - 15 euros to 23 euro cents per kilowatt hour - are still higher than those for conventional power plants .
it would be possible -based , for example , on the model of the german renewable energy law - to close the viability gap either by raising the feed-in tariff for renewable electricity -lrb- to be paid by the end user -rrb- or by having government set ambitious quotas for the share of renewably generated electricity as a means of attracting investments in csp plants .
the important thing is to set clear-cut framework conditions for electricity sales in countries with the potential to operate csp plants , in this way ensuring that the billions that need to be invested will pay off in the long term for private investors . grid development as a pan-european task some successes in economic transformation have already been observed in the context of the euro-mediterranean partnership , in tunisia for instance , although there has been less movement when it comes to political change .
be that as it may , though , the union for the mediterranean does offer a dynamic normative frame of reference for the southern mediterranean-rim countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias ruchser is an energy consultant and head of media and public relations at die however , the eu 's tasks in the framework of the union for the mediterranean should not be to offset the financial risk for private-sector projects like the desertec initiative .
this , though , may be a different matter when it comes to support for the development and expansion of the power grid in the overall mediterranean region .
grid development must be viewed under the aspect of public welfare , and here the eu could provide an important contribution to collective energy security in the mediterranean region , one that would entail a security dividend over the longer term . to put it in a nutshell : renewable energy sources promote development , and development promotes security .
looked at in this way , the evolving desertec consortium should provide a new and innovative boost for the union for the mediterranean . authors : matthias ruchser , dr. stefan gaenzle -lrb- ar -rrb- editor : sean sinico matthias ruchser is a consultant in the energy industry and head of media and public relations at the german development institute / deutsches institut für entwicklungspolitik -lrb- die -rrb- .

she added that iranians are dependent upon support from outside the country in their current “ and very sensitive state of emergency . ”
the government ’ s actions “ aren ’ t compatible with the iranian constitution , nor with islam , nor with human rights . ”
she claimed that the protests would continue in new ways and that criticism from iranian religious leaders will weaken the new government even more .
the nobel prize winner appealed to germany and europe to put more political pressure on the iranian government .
“ i am against economic sanctions and military interventions , ” declared ebadi , explaining that both are introduced at the cost of the iranian people .
she added that this , in turn , creates new battle fronts and leads people to establish solidarity with their government .
instead , she affirmed , political sanctions must be imposed .
in negotiations and contractual relationships with iran , the west must “ constantly insist upon the preservation of human rights . ” this stands for western political as well as economic delegates to iran , according to ebadi .
for example , she suggests that countries could remove their embassies from iran without completely breaking off diplomatic relations .
ebadi noted that for the last two years , the west has engaged with iran exclusively on the issue of atomic conflict .
“ one wonders whether europeans are concerned only with their own security instead of with that of iranians , ” she said .
regarding economic relations with iran , ebadi said that “ weapons and software supporting the suppression or control of iranian citizens ” should be blocked .
“ ask siemens and nokia why they have released these types of technologies in iran . ”
ebadi , who is currently staying in bonn as a guest of deutsche welle , revealed that her negotiations with high-level un officials have prompted the un to send a delegation to tehran to contribute to reporting on the situation there .
“ if the government does not permit the delegation to enter , it will prove that protestors ’ grievances are representative of the truth , ” according to ebadi .
the human-rights advocate also pointed out that the number of victims during the most recent protests is much higher than officially reported .
she said the brutality and violence on behalf of the government continues as the militias stand under supervision from the revolutionary guard .
ebadi noted that the number of people arrested is also very high and includes some of her colleagues .
recently , for example , the attorneys abdolfatah sultani and mohammad ali dadkhah , two prominent figures in the coalition for the defense of human rights , were arrested . the organization is headed by ebadi .
the nobel prize winner further explained that the head of the iranian judiciary had , “ under political pressure , ” issued a regulation whereby attorneys can lose their licenses to practice at any time .
“ this regulation discouraged lawyers from defending political prisoners and others whose opinions conflict with the government ’ s position . ”
according to ebadi , many prisoners have been isolated and prevented from contacting their families or attorneys .
ebadi , who emphasized that she has no close personal relationship with any of the presidential candidates , commented on further developments in iran as follows : “ increasing criticism from influential spiritual leaders will lead the government to become weaker and lose its legitimacy . ”
she noted that the protests will continue and that the populace is creative and has found new forms of protest .
for example , calling “ god is great ” from one ’ s windows or roof in the evening has established itself as a new form of protest , while mourning mothers meet regularly to engage in sit-ins .
ebadi herself will remain in europe for the time being in order to campaign for human rights in iran .
thereafter , she will “ most certainly ” return to her homeland .

the original eau de cologne , survived wars and imitations and still sells well in a market saturated with modern scents . the first bottle of eau de cologne was created by giovanni maria farina , an italian expatriate living in the eastern german city of cologne .
on july 13 , 1709 , farina opened a luxury goods shop where the fragrance was sold . in a letter to his brother dated in 1709 , farina wrote , " i have discovered a scent that reminds me of an italian spring morning , of daffodils and orange blossoms after the rain . "
he named it after the city he lived in . over the course of the last three centuries , only 30 people have been privy to the secret recipe - including johann maria farina , a descendant of the perfumer and the company 's current managing director .

the original eau de cologne , survived wars and imitations and still sells well in a market saturated with modern scents . the first bottle of eau de cologne was created by giovanni maria farina , an italian expatriate living in the eastern german city of cologne .
on july 13 , 1709 , farina opened a luxury goods shop where the fragrance was sold . in a letter to his brother dated in 1709 , farina wrote , " i have discovered a scent that reminds me of an italian spring morning , of daffodils and orange blossoms after the rain . "
he named it after the city he lived in . over the course of the last three centuries , only 30 people have been privy to the secret recipe - including johann maria farina , a descendant of the perfumer and the company 's current managing director . " it 's crucial that the original eau de cologne always smells the same , " said farina .

she added that iranians are dependent upon support from outside the country in their current “ and very sensitive state of emergency . ”
the government ’ s actions “ aren ’ t compatible with the iranian constitution , nor with islam , nor with human rights . ”
she claimed that the protests would continue in new ways and that criticism from iranian religious leaders will weaken the new government even more .
the nobel prize winner appealed to germany and europe to put more political pressure on the iranian government .
“ i am against economic sanctions and military interventions , ” declared ebadi , explaining that both are introduced at the cost of the iranian people .
she added that this , in turn , creates new battle fronts and leads people to establish solidarity with their government .
instead , she affirmed , political sanctions must be imposed .
in negotiations and contractual relationships with iran , the west must “ constantly insist upon the preservation of human rights . ” this stands for western political as well as economic delegates to iran , according to ebadi .
for example , she suggests that countries could remove their embassies from iran without completely breaking off diplomatic relations .
ebadi noted that for the last two years , the west has engaged with iran exclusively on the issue of atomic conflict .
“ one wonders whether europeans are concerned only with their own security instead of with that of iranians , ” she said .
regarding economic relations with iran , ebadi said that “ weapons and software supporting the suppression or control of iranian citizens ” should be blocked .
“ ask siemens and nokia why they have released these types of technologies in iran . ”
ebadi , who is currently staying in bonn as a guest of deutsche welle , revealed that her negotiations with high-level un officials have prompted the un to send a delegation to tehran to contribute to reporting on the situation there .
“ if the government does not permit the delegation to enter , it will prove that protestors ’ grievances are representative of the truth , ” according to ebadi .
the human-rights advocate also pointed out that the number of victims during the most recent protests is much higher than officially reported .
she said the brutality and violence on behalf of the government continues as the militias stand under supervision from the revolutionary guard .
ebadi noted that the number of people arrested is also very high and includes some of her colleagues .
recently , for example , the attorneys abdolfatah sultani and mohammad ali dadkhah , two prominent figures in the coalition for the defense of human rights , were arrested . the organization is headed by ebadi .
the nobel prize winner further explained that the head of the iranian judiciary had , “ under political pressure , ” issued a regulation whereby attorneys can lose their licenses to practice at any time .
“ this regulation discouraged lawyers from defending political prisoners and others whose opinions conflict with the government ’ s position . ”
according to ebadi , many prisoners have been isolated and prevented from contacting their families or attorneys .
ebadi , who emphasized that she has no close personal relationship with any of the presidential candidates , commented on further developments in iran as follows : “ increasing criticism from influential spiritual leaders will lead the government to become weaker and lose its legitimacy . ”
she noted that the protests will continue and that the populace is creative and has found new forms of protest .
for example , calling “ god is great ” from one ’ s windows or roof in the evening has established itself as a new form of protest , while mourning mothers meet regularly to engage in sit-ins .
ebadi herself will remain in europe for the time being in order to campaign for human rights in iran .
thereafter , she will “ most certainly ” return to her homeland .

she added that iranians are dependent upon support from outside the country in their current “ and very sensitive state of emergency . ”
the government ’ s actions “ aren ’ t compatible with the iranian constitution , nor with islam , nor with human rights . ”
she claimed that the protests would continue in new ways and that criticism from iranian religious leaders will weaken the new government even more .
the nobel prize winner appealed to germany and europe to put more political pressure on the iranian government .
“ i am against economic sanctions and military interventions , ” declared ebadi , explaining that both are introduced at the cost of the iranian people .
she added that this , in turn , creates new battle fronts and leads people to establish solidarity with their government .
instead , she affirmed , political sanctions must be imposed .
in negotiations and contractual relationships with iran , the west must “ constantly insist upon the preservation of human rights . ” this stands for western political as well as economic delegates to iran , according to ebadi .
for example , she suggests that countries could remove their embassies from iran without completely breaking off diplomatic relations .
ebadi noted that for the last two years , the west has engaged with iran exclusively on the issue of atomic conflict .
“ one wonders whether europeans are concerned only with their own security instead of with that of iranians , ” she said .
regarding economic relations with iran , ebadi said that “ weapons and software supporting the suppression or control of iranian citizens ” should be blocked .
“ ask siemens and nokia why they have released these types of technologies in iran . ”
ebadi , who is currently staying in bonn as a guest of deutsche welle , revealed that her negotiations with high-level un officials have prompted the un to send a delegation to tehran to contribute to reporting on the situation there .
“ if the government does not permit the delegation to enter , it will prove that protestors ’ grievances are representative of the truth , ” according to ebadi .
the human-rights advocate also pointed out that the number of victims during the most recent protests is much higher than officially reported .
she said the brutality and violence on behalf of the government continues as the militias stand under supervision from the revolutionary guard .
ebadi noted that the number of people arrested is also very high and includes some of her colleagues .
recently , for example , the attorneys abdolfatah sultani and mohammad ali dadkhah , two prominent figures in the coalition for the defense of human rights , were arrested . the organization is headed by ebadi .
the nobel prize winner further explained that the head of the iranian judiciary had , “ under political pressure , ” issued a regulation whereby attorneys can lose their licenses to practice at any time .
“ this regulation discouraged lawyers from defending political prisoners and others whose opinions conflict with the government ’ s position . ”
according to ebadi , many prisoners have been isolated and prevented from contacting their families or attorneys .
ebadi , who emphasized that she has no close personal relationship with any of the presidential candidates , commented on further developments in iran as follows : “ increasing criticism from influential spiritual leaders will lead the government to become weaker and lose its legitimacy . ”
she noted that the protests will continue and that the populace is creative and has found new forms of protest .
for example , calling “ god is great ” from one ’ s windows or roof in the evening has established itself as a new form of protest , while mourning mothers meet regularly to engage in sit-ins .
ebadi herself will remain in europe for the time being in order to campaign for human rights in iran .
thereafter , she will “ most certainly ” return to her homeland .

" we condemn such acts , wherever they take place , " said wilhelm .
the 31-year-old muslim woman , marwa al-sherbini , was killed by a russian-born german during his appeal hearing for insulting her with racist slurs , in a case that sparked anti-german demonstrations outside the german embassy in tehran over the weekend . ahmadinejad on sunday demanded the united nations impose sanctions against germany and accused the west of applying double standards when it comes to human rights . the incident was proof for of the " brutality of the german government and clear evidence for corruption in the german justice system , " said ahmadinejad . ahmadinejad added that while berlin and washington had plenty to say regarding events in tehran following iran 's presidential elections , no reaction had been registered regarding al-sherbini 's murder . " we want condemnation from the united nations security council and the imposition of sanctions , " said the iranian president . government spokesman ulrich wilhelm acknowledged the iranian president 's remarks but insisted that there was no climate that promoted such actions . he said it was now a matter for the german justice system to punish those who commit these acts . on july 1 , the pregnant egyptian woman mother of a three-year-old was stabbed 18 times in a courtroom in the eastern german city of dresden by a russian-born german , who was appealing an earlier conviction for making racist slurs against the egyptian in a children 's playground in 2008 .

the 31-year-old muslim woman , marwa al-sherbini , was killed by a russian-born german during his appeal hearing for insulting her with racist slurs , in a case that sparked anti-german demonstrations outside the german embassy in tehran over the weekend . ahmadinejad on sunday demanded the united nations impose sanctions against germany and accused the west of applying double standards when it comes to human rights . the incident was proof for of the " brutality of the german government and clear evidence for corruption in the german justice system , " said ahmadinejad . ahmadinejad added that while berlin and washington had plenty to say regarding events in tehran following iran 's presidential elections , no reaction had been registered regarding al-sherbini 's murder . " we want condemnation from the united nations security council and the imposition of sanctions , " said the iranian president . government spokesman ulrich wilhelm acknowledged the iranian president 's remarks but insisted that there was no climate that promoted such actions . he said it was now a matter for the german justice system to punish those who commit these acts . on july 1 , the pregnant egyptian woman mother of a three-year-old was stabbed 18 times in a courtroom in the eastern german city of dresden by a russian-born german , who was appealing an earlier conviction for making racist slurs against the egyptian in a children 's playground in 2008 .

the hijacking has led to a debate in germany and the question what can be done about it . the situation for the hansa stavanger 's crew of 24 has become desperate .
according to germany 's spiegel magazine , the captain reported to his wife a week ago that there was a lack of drinking water , food and medication .
many crew members are supposedly ill .
negotiations between the pirates and the hamburg based ship owner leonhardt & blumberg are ongoing .
the pirates originally demanded $ 15 million ransom .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : special forces during a naval training mission three weeks after the hijacking special troops from the german federal police prepared to storm the ship and free the hostages .
two hundred german anti-terror specialists practised the operation on board of the us navy ship uss boxer less then fifty nautical miles away from the hansa stavanger .
but before german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble in berlin could give the go-ahead for the operation , us national security advisor james jones in washington called the operation off , saying it was too risky .
but without american logistical support germany 's elite troops were grounded .
jason alderwick , a maritime defense analyst with the international institute for strategic studies -lrb- iiss -rrb- in london , supports the stance taken by the us .
" the german contribution is just part of a wider international coalition .
so unilaterally deciding to storm a ship is n't necessarily the right approach . "
better funding and cooperation wolfgang bosbach , the vice-chairman of chancellor angela merkel 's christian-democratic group in parliament , argues that german police have the right to storm a hijacked german ship in any case .
" when we need the support of other states , we ca n't decide alone .
we need our own capacities as far as helicopter air transport is concerned .
we need better air supported reconnaissance and we need better communication between the authorities in charge . "
bosbach wants better funding , so germany can carry out operations without international help . and he also urges better cooperation between the defense and interior ministries .
there was speculation in the media , that defense minister franz-josef jung asked washington to stop interior minister schaeuble .
jung is in charge of the military , schaeuble is responsible for the police , which includes the unit that was supposed to carry out the anti-terror operation .
wolfgang bosbach does n't want to address the media speculation , but emphasizes that the german military has a special mandate for fighting piracy at the horn of africa , but that it is the general responsibility of germany 's federal police to free hostages when necessary .
bosbach adds that for germany , given its recent century history , every international military operation remains a balancing act between modesty and responsibility .
" we have good reasons to say ' never first , never alone , never without an international mandate ' .
but when we say a , we also must say b. when we decide to send troops , we must make sure that they are equipped appropriately . "
fighting the root problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : capturing and trying somali pirates is difficult still , the larger question remains whether soldiers and policemen can stop pirates .
for more than six months now , the navies of nine european nations have been patrolling the somali coastline .
and yet piracy has continued .
wolfgang bosbach admits that the military alone ca n't stop piracy .
" we are talking here about organized crime .
we have to look at the causes .
that 's why besides the defense and interior ministries , foreign affairs and development ministries must be involved as well . "
still , he says , the european military patrols around the somali coast - operation atalanta - has had an impact : " the shipping companies must decide to join a convoy , which gets navy protection .
none of the convoys we accompanied got into trouble . "
jason alderwick agrees in principle that piracy is a matter of international crime and therefore rather a police than a military issue : " it would be great to hand over the operation to coast guard assets .
but europeans do n't have a huge coast guard , which is able to deploy in a counter piracy role .
so you have to go with the forces and capabilities you have .
the military instrument is a blunt instrument , but it 's adapting as best as it can with the situation down there . "
overall , says alderwick , europe 's atalanta operation at the horn of africa makes sense .
" there has arguably been an escalation in the number of piracy attacks , but that is n't a direct consequence of the operation .
it 's just a consequence of the overall situation .
without atalanta , piracy in the region would definitely have been worse . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 13.07.2009 african solar power for europe could promote security , experts say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : capturing sunshine could lead to energy development and security hurdles remain , but mediterranean countries should cooperate on economic development and environmental protection including a new solar power project , according to guest commentators matthias ruchser and stefan gaenzle . last year , on july 13 , the " union for the mediterranean " was launched amid much diplomatic fanfare .
heads of state and government from 43 european union and the mediterranean-rim countries had accepted an invitation to paris extended by french president nicolas sarkozy to give new impetus to mediterranean cooperation .
the union for the mediterranean follows up on the barcelona process , initiated in 1995 , which also had a pronounced security dimension . ultimately , the union for the mediterranean set itself a six-point agenda , among others the " mediterranean solar plan . "
the recent gaza war has upset these plans .
no high-ranking ministerial meetings have taken place since december 2008 , and some important issues dealing with the institutional design of the union have been shelved . similar to the constraints imposed on the baltic sea co-operation of the 1970s -lrb- due to the east-west conflict -rrb- , it would be recommendable for the union for the mediterranean to put high politics as well as security issues aside and focus on economic matters and the protection of the environment and the climate .
against this backdrop , can it be mere coincidence that it was precisely for july 13 that the munich re group issued invitations for the inaugural meeting of the so-called " desertec initiative " in munich ? energy security based on solar thermal power plants ? bildunterschrift : the desertec project aims to feed solar power from africa and the middle east to the eu while the idea behind the desertec project is nothing new , it is still fascinating : solar thermal power plants in northern africa would contribute to supplying europe with the clean energy it needs .
a total of roughly 400 billion euros in investments would be needed by the year 2050 to cover 15 percent of europe 's electricity needs .
so is the - privately financed - desertec consortium set to get the better of the european mediterranean solar plan , or indeed to replace it ? to start with the good news : the technology needed to generate solar thermal power , known as concentrated solar power -lrb- csp -rrb- , is already available , as are the high-voltage , direct current -lrb- hvdc -rrb- electric power transmission lines required to transport it .
in kramer junction , california , the first parabolic trough power plants have been connected to the grid since the mid-1980s .
more advanced csp power plants have been built in the united states and spain and are already several years old .
another csp plant , an integrated solar combined cycle plant -lrb- iscc -rrb- , is currently under construction in kuraymat , egypt .
parabolic trough power plants are already in the planning stages in some other countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german companies lead the field in concentrated solar power technology another piece of good news - at least from the german perspective - is that german companies lead the field when it comes to csp technology .
the parabolic mirrors are built by flabeg , the receivers by schott solar , the turbines , generators and control technology are available from siemens , and solar millennium and man ferrostaal operate as general contractors . looking for safe locations for solar plants is the only task remaining to secure the financing for the desertec initiative and to integrate it politically into the union for the mediterranean ?
not quite .
it will not prove so easy to enlist the southern mediterranean-rim countries as potential locations for power plants .
many of these countries are ruled by authoritarian regimes of different stripes , and there is an ever-present danger in the region of terrorist attacks .
population growth and unemployment are also very high in this part of the world , and such social problems are aggravated by migration pressure from sub-saharan africa .
all in all , an explosive mix , with important implications for our security as well . most of the non-eu mediterranean-rim countries have major development needs .
one prerequisite for development is energy .
however , most of the power plants currently in operation there are conventional , carbon-based plants .
in times of an accelerated climate change that has the gravest of implications for developing and transition countries , the latter need to switch their energy supply , as early as possible , to a non-conventional energy path , and that means , in effect , to renewable energy sources . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. stefan gaenzle is an expert on multilateral development cooperation with die large-scale solar thermal power plants may offer one solution to the problem .
even though energy production costs - 15 euros to 23 euro cents per kilowatt hour - are still higher than those for conventional power plants .
it would be possible -based , for example , on the model of the german renewable energy law - to close the viability gap either by raising the feed-in tariff for renewable electricity -lrb- to be paid by the end user -rrb- or by having government set ambitious quotas for the share of renewably generated electricity as a means of attracting investments in csp plants .
the important thing is to set clear-cut framework conditions for electricity sales in countries with the potential to operate csp plants , in this way ensuring that the billions that need to be invested will pay off in the long term for private investors . grid development as a pan-european task some successes in economic transformation have already been observed in the context of the euro-mediterranean partnership , in tunisia for instance , although there has been less movement when it comes to political change .
be that as it may , though , the union for the mediterranean does offer a dynamic normative frame of reference for the southern mediterranean-rim countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias ruchser is an energy consultant and head of media and public relations at die however , the eu 's tasks in the framework of the union for the mediterranean should not be to offset the financial risk for private-sector projects like the desertec initiative .
this , though , may be a different matter when it comes to support for the development and expansion of the power grid in the overall mediterranean region .
grid development must be viewed under the aspect of public welfare , and here the eu could provide an important contribution to collective energy security in the mediterranean region , one that would entail a security dividend over the longer term . to put it in a nutshell : renewable energy sources promote development , and development promotes security .
looked at in this way , the evolving desertec consortium should provide a new and innovative boost for the union for the mediterranean . authors : matthias ruchser , dr. stefan gaenzle -lrb- ar -rrb- editor : sean sinico matthias ruchser is a consultant in the energy industry and head of media and public relations at the german development institute / deutsches institut für entwicklungspolitik -lrb- die -rrb- .

"
during a speech in london on saturday , solana said it was up to the mediator to set a timetable for peace .
" after a fixed deadline , a un security council resolution should proclaim the adoption of the two-state solution . "
solana said , adding that such a resolution should include all the parameters of borders , refugees , jerusalem and security arrangements .
" it would accept the palestinian state as a full member of the un and set a calendar for implementation . "
speaking on israeli radio on monday , lieberman said " with all due respect to solana , he is about to retire ... and we should not overstate the importance of his statement .
' artificial ' road to peace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief javier solana wants a deadline while israel , which is under pressure from washington to move the middle east peace process forward , is deeply opposed to any " artificial " attempt to reach agreement over the future of the region , the palestinian reaction has been quite different .
a spokesman for palestinian president mahmud abbas said the proposed un resolution would be " one option " were israel to block its vision of a two-state solution .
" europe , as a member of the international quartet must continue in its efforts to apply pressure to israel to freeze the settlements and stop wasting time , " nabil abu rudeina told the afp news agency .

she is a lawyer , who gained entrance to the faculty of law at tehran university in 1965 . in 1975 she became the first woman in the history of iran 's justice system , to be made the president of bench 24 of the tehran city court .
she then set up her own practice after receiving her lawyer 's license in 1992 .
ebadi has written several books and many of her articles have been published in iranian journals .
one of the most talked about topics in the world right now is the disputed iranian presidential election .
do you believe the vote was fair ?
with their street protests , iranians have shown that they do not accept the announced results of the election which they believe was rigged .
you have also said that a new election will take place .
do you believe this will make any difference ?
the iranian people have called for a new election . and it is also my belief that these new elections should take place under the supervision of the united nations .
otherwise these disputes will continue and the people will again protest against election manipulation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2003 nobel peace prize winner 's visit generated a lot of media attention the scale of protests in iran and the reaction of the police indicate that the government was guilty .
if the elections were fair , as the government claims , why was there such a strong presence of security forces in the streets ?
that is a good question .
what happened in iran is an obvious human rights violation .
when the iranian people demonstrated peacefully , there were no problems – not even a window was broken .
but towards the end of the demonstrations shots were fired from office buildings .
some died and many more were injured .
that was the beginning of the state 's crackdown .
that night at 3 a.m. , a student residence was attacked , five students were shot dead and several were injured . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ebadi meets deutsche welle 's director-general , erik bettermann can other countries or institutions such as the united nations make a difference , or is it up to the iranian people now ?
first and foremost it is iranians who are fighting for their rights .
this movement , which has in the meantime turned into a national movement , was created by the iranian people .
president mahmoud ahmadinejad and the iranian government have said that the west is to blame for the protests in iran . what ahmadinejad has said is a major insult .
it is not true and in no way reflects the truth .
this is a pure national protest movement formed by the iranian people .
have these protests had any impact on the human rights situation ?
the movement started completely peacefully which shows the political maturity of the iranian people .
sadly , the people got a violent response to their peaceful movement .
when you give interviews like today , does it cause problems for you in iran ?
that 's not that important to me .
i consider this a task that has to be done .

the new rules are intended to prevent future financial collapse . analysts say the meltdown of the financial system , which has led to the worst recession in over 60 years , was due in part to banks ' inability to assess the risk level of some of their investments .
if the proposal becomes law - which requires the approval from the eu parliament and the 27 eu governments - banks would have to demonstrate that they fully understood the risks involved when making an investment , especially in the case of highly-complex " re-securitization " investments .
banks that encouraged staff to take too much risk by offering bonuses could face sanctions .
in addition , the proposal calls for banks to keep more money and assets on hand to cover any potential losses if the value of an investment were to significantly deflate . " the proposal aims to ensure that banks hold enough capital to reflect the true risks they are taking , " european commission chief jose manuel barroso said in a statement .
he added that the plan would " legally oblige banks and investment firms to have remuneration policies consistent with effective risk management . "
the european banking federation said that the banks had anticipated the changes and were not surprised by monday 's announcement .
" what we do n't want is a supervisory authority to determine the level or form of remuneration , " an ebf spokeswoman said .
" we also insist that the new rules in terms of remuneration are international .
we want a level playing field . "
the new rules are not likely to take effect until the end of 2011 , and therefore , are not meant to address the current financial crisis .
however , the eu said the proposal could " strengthen market confidence and banks ' financial health . " vj / dpa / ap / reuters / afp editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the new rules are intended to prevent future financial collapse . analysts say the meltdown of the financial system , which has led to the worst recession in over 60 years , was due in part to banks ' inability to assess the risk level of some of their investments .
if the proposal becomes law - which requires the approval from the eu parliament and the 27 eu governments - banks would have to demonstrate that they fully understood the risks involved when making an investment , especially in the case of highly-complex " re-securitization " investments .
banks that encouraged staff to take too much risk by offering bonuses could face sanctions .
in addition , the proposal calls for banks to keep more money and assets on hand to cover any potential losses if the value of an investment were to significantly deflate . " the proposal aims to ensure that banks hold enough capital to reflect the true risks they are taking , " european commission chief jose manuel barroso said in a statement .
he added that the plan would " legally oblige banks and investment firms to have remuneration policies consistent with effective risk management . "
the european banking federation said that the banks had anticipated the changes and were not surprised by monday 's announcement .
" what we do n't want is a supervisory authority to determine the level or form of remuneration , " an ebf spokeswoman said .
" we also insist that the new rules in terms of remuneration are international .
we want a level playing field . "
the new rules are not likely to take effect until the end of 2011 , and therefore , are not meant to address the current financial crisis .
however , the eu said the proposal could " strengthen market confidence and banks ' financial health . " vj / dpa / ap / reuters / afp editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" today we have taken a step forward -lrb- towards the project 's realization -rrb- , " said nikolaus von bomhard , head of munich re , which hosted the signing .
the firms grouped under the desertec industrial initiative -lrb- dii -rrb- plan to build solar power generators in north africa and the middle east .
the massive project will see investments of up to 400 billion euros over a period of 40 years .
" of course it is still a long way off , but the enormous interest in the scheme shows we are on the right path , " a spokesman for munich re said .
a study suggests that with the use of thermal power plants and high voltage direct current transmission lines , desertec 's pioneering foray into the desert could meet 15 percent of europe 's electricity needs by the year 2050 .
bildunterschrift : the project could meet 15 percent of europe 's electricity needs by 2050 gerhard knies , chairman of the desertec supervisory board said the desert is an obvious source of clean power .
" within six hours deserts receive more energy from the sun than humankind consumes within a year , " he said adding that the " time appears right for a truly comprehensive maneuver to combat climate change . "
firms hope project will help combat climate change other companies involved in the venture are the spanish firm abengoa solar and the algerian conglomerate cevital as well as several german banks and engineering companies .
under the agreement , a desertec study office to be established by october will have three years to detail investment plans to create the network of solar farms .
representatives of the arab league and the egyptian energy ministry were also present at the signing of the protocol .
munich re board member torsten jeworrek said the european companies involved had pledged to work " as equals in a sincere and fair " manner with the producer countries .
" if we 're successful , we 'll make a huge contribution to the fight against climate change , " jeworrek said .

the original eau de cologne , survived wars and imitations and still sells well in a market saturated with modern scents . the first bottle of eau de cologne was created by giovanni maria farina , an italian expatriate living in the eastern german city of cologne .
on july 13 , 1709 , farina opened a luxury goods shop where the fragrance was sold . in a letter to his brother dated in 1709 , farina wrote , " i have discovered a scent that reminds me of an italian spring morning , of daffodils and orange blossoms after the rain . "
he named it after the city he lived in . over the course of the last three centuries , only 30 people have been privy to the secret recipe - including johann maria farina , a descendant of the perfumer and the company 's current managing director . " it 's crucial that the original eau de cologne always smells the same , " said farina .
" like champagne that 's made from many different wines and has a specific taste or aroma . " an eau de cologne differs from a so-called eau de toilette in that it has a smaller concentration of essential oils , which give the solution its scent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the original eau de cologne was a top seller in giovanni maria farina 's luxury shop napoleon allegedly used one vial of the valuable liquid each day .
a vial cost a week 's wages for a master craftsman - or well over 1,000 euros -lrb- $ 1,400 -rrb- in today 's money - making the perfume only accessible to the extremely wealthy . but the hefty price tag did n't always mean big earnings for farina 's company . " there were many crises , " said the firm 's current managing director .
" the french revolution and the first and second world wars were the biggest crises for us - not because our customers could n't pay but because we were cut off from the raw materials and could n't produce . " a respected imitation in addition to political conflicts , the original eau de cologne has also had to deal with stiff competition from a popular imitation : 4711 . in the 18th century , the muehlens , a merchant family from cologne , produced a citrus-based scent similar to the original eau de cologne , calling it by the house number of the factory on glockengasse in downtown cologne .
while 4711 is known around the world - and boasts an over 200-year history - it 's not the original . in 1994 , the muehlens family sold its company to the german wella corporation .
it was then acquired by procter and gamble in 2003 and returned to german hands in 2007 , when the company was bought by maeurer und wirtz , best known for its perfume brand tabac original . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 4711 has a large following of its own while farina 's eau de cologne may be the true original , 4711 has always been the more commercially successful scent . it is marketed in 75 countries today and is especially popular with the older generation of germans .
the fragrance also sells well in japan , where men perfume their hair with it . farina , however , said there are no bad feelings between his family and the muehlens , the founders of 4711 . " i once had a dance class with a daughter of ferdinand muehlens and know the others as well , " said farina .
" there have never been any problems between the two families . " today , the farina house in cologne 's old town has its very own museum , where visitors can learn more about the art of perfume making and the original koelnisch wasser - eau de cologne . author : catrin moederler -lrb- kjb / ab -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
during a speech in london on saturday , solana said it was up to the mediator to set a timetable for peace .
" after a fixed deadline , a un security council resolution should proclaim the adoption of the two-state solution . "
solana said , adding that such a resolution should include all the parameters of borders , refugees , jerusalem and security arrangements .
" it would accept the palestinian state as a full member of the un and set a calendar for implementation . "
speaking on israeli radio on monday , lieberman said " with all due respect to solana , he is about to retire ... and we should not overstate the importance of his statement .

a spokesman for palestinian president mahmud abbas said the proposed un resolution would be " one option " were israel to block its vision of a two-state solution .
" europe , as a member of the international quartet must continue in its efforts to apply pressure to israel to freeze the settlements and stop wasting time , " nabil abu rudeina told the afp news agency .

" today we have taken a step forward -lrb- towards the project 's realization -rrb- , " said nikolaus von bomhard , head of munich re , which hosted the signing .
the firms grouped under the desertec industrial initiative -lrb- dii -rrb- plan to build solar power generators in north africa and the middle east .
the massive project will see investments of up to 400 billion euros over a period of 40 years .
" of course it is still a long way off , but the enormous interest in the scheme shows we are on the right path , " a spokesman for munich re said .
a study suggests that with the use of thermal power plants and high voltage direct current transmission lines , desertec 's pioneering foray into the desert could meet 15 percent of europe 's electricity needs by the year 2050 .
bildunterschrift : the project could meet 15 percent of europe 's electricity needs by 2050 gerhard knies , chairman of the desertec supervisory board said the desert is an obvious source of clean power .
" within six hours deserts receive more energy from the sun than humankind consumes within a year , " he said adding that the " time appears right for a truly comprehensive maneuver to combat climate change . "
firms hope project will help combat climate change other companies involved in the venture are the spanish firm abengoa solar and the algerian conglomerate cevital as well as several german banks and engineering companies .
under the agreement , a desertec study office to be established by october will have three years to detail investment plans to create the network of solar farms .
representatives of the arab league and the egyptian energy ministry were also present at the signing of the protocol .
munich re board member torsten jeworrek said the european companies involved had pledged to work " as equals in a sincere and fair " manner with the producer countries .

the new rules are intended to prevent future financial collapse . analysts say the meltdown of the financial system , which has led to the worst recession in over 60 years , was due in part to banks ' inability to assess the risk level of some of their investments .
if the proposal becomes law - which requires the approval from the eu parliament and the 27 eu governments - banks would have to demonstrate that they fully understood the risks involved when making an investment , especially in the case of highly-complex " re-securitization " investments .
banks that encouraged staff to take too much risk by offering bonuses could face sanctions .
in addition , the proposal calls for banks to keep more money and assets on hand to cover any potential losses if the value of an investment were to significantly deflate . " the proposal aims to ensure that banks hold enough capital to reflect the true risks they are taking , " european commission chief jose manuel barroso said in a statement .
he added that the plan would " legally oblige banks and investment firms to have remuneration policies consistent with effective risk management . "
the european banking federation said that the banks had anticipated the changes and were not surprised by monday 's announcement .
" what we do n't want is a supervisory authority to determine the level or form of remuneration , " an ebf spokeswoman said .
" we also insist that the new rules in terms of remuneration are international .
we want a level playing field . "
the new rules are not likely to take effect until the end of 2011 , and therefore , are not meant to address the current financial crisis .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 13.07.2009 african solar power for europe could promote security , experts say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : capturing sunshine could lead to energy development and security hurdles remain , but mediterranean countries should cooperate on economic development and environmental protection including a new solar power project , according to guest commentators matthias ruchser and stefan gaenzle . last year , on july 13 , the " union for the mediterranean " was launched amid much diplomatic fanfare .
heads of state and government from 43 european union and the mediterranean-rim countries had accepted an invitation to paris extended by french president nicolas sarkozy to give new impetus to mediterranean cooperation .
the union for the mediterranean follows up on the barcelona process , initiated in 1995 , which also had a pronounced security dimension . ultimately , the union for the mediterranean set itself a six-point agenda , among others the " mediterranean solar plan . "
the recent gaza war has upset these plans .
no high-ranking ministerial meetings have taken place since december 2008 , and some important issues dealing with the institutional design of the union have been shelved . similar to the constraints imposed on the baltic sea co-operation of the 1970s -lrb- due to the east-west conflict -rrb- , it would be recommendable for the union for the mediterranean to put high politics as well as security issues aside and focus on economic matters and the protection of the environment and the climate .
against this backdrop , can it be mere coincidence that it was precisely for july 13 that the munich re group issued invitations for the inaugural meeting of the so-called " desertec initiative " in munich ? energy security based on solar thermal power plants ? bildunterschrift : the desertec project aims to feed solar power from africa and the middle east to the eu while the idea behind the desertec project is nothing new , it is still fascinating : solar thermal power plants in northern africa would contribute to supplying europe with the clean energy it needs .
a total of roughly 400 billion euros in investments would be needed by the year 2050 to cover 15 percent of europe 's electricity needs .
so is the - privately financed - desertec consortium set to get the better of the european mediterranean solar plan , or indeed to replace it ? to start with the good news : the technology needed to generate solar thermal power , known as concentrated solar power -lrb- csp -rrb- , is already available , as are the high-voltage , direct current -lrb- hvdc -rrb- electric power transmission lines required to transport it .
in kramer junction , california , the first parabolic trough power plants have been connected to the grid since the mid-1980s .
more advanced csp power plants have been built in the united states and spain and are already several years old .
another csp plant , an integrated solar combined cycle plant -lrb- iscc -rrb- , is currently under construction in kuraymat , egypt .
parabolic trough power plants are already in the planning stages in some other countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german companies lead the field in concentrated solar power technology another piece of good news - at least from the german perspective - is that german companies lead the field when it comes to csp technology .
the parabolic mirrors are built by flabeg , the receivers by schott solar , the turbines , generators and control technology are available from siemens , and solar millennium and man ferrostaal operate as general contractors . looking for safe locations for solar plants is the only task remaining to secure the financing for the desertec initiative and to integrate it politically into the union for the mediterranean ?
not quite .
it will not prove so easy to enlist the southern mediterranean-rim countries as potential locations for power plants .
many of these countries are ruled by authoritarian regimes of different stripes , and there is an ever-present danger in the region of terrorist attacks .
population growth and unemployment are also very high in this part of the world , and such social problems are aggravated by migration pressure from sub-saharan africa .
all in all , an explosive mix , with important implications for our security as well . most of the non-eu mediterranean-rim countries have major development needs .
one prerequisite for development is energy .
however , most of the power plants currently in operation there are conventional , carbon-based plants .
in times of an accelerated climate change that has the gravest of implications for developing and transition countries , the latter need to switch their energy supply , as early as possible , to a non-conventional energy path , and that means , in effect , to renewable energy sources . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. stefan gaenzle is an expert on multilateral development cooperation with die large-scale solar thermal power plants may offer one solution to the problem .
even though energy production costs - 15 euros to 23 euro cents per kilowatt hour - are still higher than those for conventional power plants .
it would be possible -based , for example , on the model of the german renewable energy law - to close the viability gap either by raising the feed-in tariff for renewable electricity -lrb- to be paid by the end user -rrb- or by having government set ambitious quotas for the share of renewably generated electricity as a means of attracting investments in csp plants .
the important thing is to set clear-cut framework conditions for electricity sales in countries with the potential to operate csp plants , in this way ensuring that the billions that need to be invested will pay off in the long term for private investors . grid development as a pan-european task some successes in economic transformation have already been observed in the context of the euro-mediterranean partnership , in tunisia for instance , although there has been less movement when it comes to political change .
be that as it may , though , the union for the mediterranean does offer a dynamic normative frame of reference for the southern mediterranean-rim countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias ruchser is an energy consultant and head of media and public relations at die however , the eu 's tasks in the framework of the union for the mediterranean should not be to offset the financial risk for private-sector projects like the desertec initiative .
this , though , may be a different matter when it comes to support for the development and expansion of the power grid in the overall mediterranean region .
grid development must be viewed under the aspect of public welfare , and here the eu could provide an important contribution to collective energy security in the mediterranean region , one that would entail a security dividend over the longer term . to put it in a nutshell : renewable energy sources promote development , and development promotes security .
looked at in this way , the evolving desertec consortium should provide a new and innovative boost for the union for the mediterranean . authors : matthias ruchser , dr. stefan gaenzle -lrb- ar -rrb- editor : sean sinico matthias ruchser is a consultant in the energy industry and head of media and public relations at the german development institute / deutsches institut für entwicklungspolitik -lrb- die -rrb- .

two hundred german anti-terror specialists practised the operation on board of the us navy ship uss boxer less then fifty nautical miles away from the hansa stavanger .
but before german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble in berlin could give the go-ahead for the operation , us national security advisor james jones in washington called the operation off , saying it was too risky .
but without american logistical support germany 's elite troops were grounded .
jason alderwick , a maritime defense analyst with the international institute for strategic studies -lrb- iiss -rrb- in london , supports the stance taken by the us .
" the german contribution is just part of a wider international coalition .
so unilaterally deciding to storm a ship is n't necessarily the right approach . "
better funding and cooperation wolfgang bosbach , the vice-chairman of chancellor angela merkel 's christian-democratic group in parliament , argues that german police have the right to storm a hijacked german ship in any case .
" when we need the support of other states , we ca n't decide alone .
we need our own capacities as far as helicopter air transport is concerned .
we need better air supported reconnaissance and we need better communication between the authorities in charge . "
bosbach wants better funding , so germany can carry out operations without international help . and he also urges better cooperation between the defense and interior ministries .
there was speculation in the media , that defense minister franz-josef jung asked washington to stop interior minister schaeuble .
jung is in charge of the military , schaeuble is responsible for the police , which includes the unit that was supposed to carry out the anti-terror operation .
wolfgang bosbach does n't want to address the media speculation , but emphasizes that the german military has a special mandate for fighting piracy at the horn of africa , but that it is the general responsibility of germany 's federal police to free hostages when necessary .
bosbach adds that for germany , given its recent century history , every international military operation remains a balancing act between modesty and responsibility .
" we have good reasons to say ' never first , never alone , never without an international mandate ' .
but when we say a , we also must say b. when we decide to send troops , we must make sure that they are equipped appropriately . "
fighting the root problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : capturing and trying somali pirates is difficult still , the larger question remains whether soldiers and policemen can stop pirates .
for more than six months now , the navies of nine european nations have been patrolling the somali coastline .
and yet piracy has continued .
wolfgang bosbach admits that the military alone ca n't stop piracy .
" we are talking here about organized crime .
we have to look at the causes .
that 's why besides the defense and interior ministries , foreign affairs and development ministries must be involved as well . "
still , he says , the european military patrols around the somali coast - operation atalanta - has had an impact : " the shipping companies must decide to join a convoy , which gets navy protection .
none of the convoys we accompanied got into trouble . "
jason alderwick agrees in principle that piracy is a matter of international crime and therefore rather a police than a military issue : " it would be great to hand over the operation to coast guard assets .
but europeans do n't have a huge coast guard , which is able to deploy in a counter piracy role .
so you have to go with the forces and capabilities you have .
the military instrument is a blunt instrument , but it 's adapting as best as it can with the situation down there . "
overall , says alderwick , europe 's atalanta operation at the horn of africa makes sense .
" there has arguably been an escalation in the number of piracy attacks , but that is n't a direct consequence of the operation .
it 's just a consequence of the overall situation .
without atalanta , piracy in the region would definitely have been worse . "

the new rules are intended to prevent future financial collapse . analysts say the meltdown of the financial system , which has led to the worst recession in over 60 years , was due in part to banks ' inability to assess the risk level of some of their investments .
if the proposal becomes law - which requires the approval from the eu parliament and the 27 eu governments - banks would have to demonstrate that they fully understood the risks involved when making an investment , especially in the case of highly-complex " re-securitization " investments .
banks that encouraged staff to take too much risk by offering bonuses could face sanctions .
in addition , the proposal calls for banks to keep more money and assets on hand to cover any potential losses if the value of an investment were to significantly deflate . " the proposal aims to ensure that banks hold enough capital to reflect the true risks they are taking , " european commission chief jose manuel barroso said in a statement .
he added that the plan would " legally oblige banks and investment firms to have remuneration policies consistent with effective risk management . "
the european banking federation said that the banks had anticipated the changes and were not surprised by monday 's announcement .
" what we do n't want is a supervisory authority to determine the level or form of remuneration , " an ebf spokeswoman said .
" we also insist that the new rules in terms of remuneration are international .
we want a level playing field . "
the new rules are not likely to take effect until the end of 2011 , and therefore , are not meant to address the current financial crisis .
however , the eu said the proposal could " strengthen market confidence and banks ' financial health . " vj / dpa / ap / reuters / afp editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she added that iranians are dependent upon support from outside the country in their current “ and very sensitive state of emergency . ”
the government ’ s actions “ aren ’ t compatible with the iranian constitution , nor with islam , nor with human rights . ”
she claimed that the protests would continue in new ways and that criticism from iranian religious leaders will weaken the new government even more .
the nobel prize winner appealed to germany and europe to put more political pressure on the iranian government .
“ i am against economic sanctions and military interventions , ” declared ebadi , explaining that both are introduced at the cost of the iranian people .
she added that this , in turn , creates new battle fronts and leads people to establish solidarity with their government .
instead , she affirmed , political sanctions must be imposed .
in negotiations and contractual relationships with iran , the west must “ constantly insist upon the preservation of human rights . ” this stands for western political as well as economic delegates to iran , according to ebadi .
for example , she suggests that countries could remove their embassies from iran without completely breaking off diplomatic relations .
ebadi noted that for the last two years , the west has engaged with iran exclusively on the issue of atomic conflict .
“ one wonders whether europeans are concerned only with their own security instead of with that of iranians , ” she said .
regarding economic relations with iran , ebadi said that “ weapons and software supporting the suppression or control of iranian citizens ” should be blocked .
“ ask siemens and nokia why they have released these types of technologies in iran . ”
ebadi , who is currently staying in bonn as a guest of deutsche welle , revealed that her negotiations with high-level un officials have prompted the un to send a delegation to tehran to contribute to reporting on the situation there .
“ if the government does not permit the delegation to enter , it will prove that protestors ’ grievances are representative of the truth , ” according to ebadi .
the human-rights advocate also pointed out that the number of victims during the most recent protests is much higher than officially reported .
she said the brutality and violence on behalf of the government continues as the militias stand under supervision from the revolutionary guard .
ebadi noted that the number of people arrested is also very high and includes some of her colleagues .
recently , for example , the attorneys abdolfatah sultani and mohammad ali dadkhah , two prominent figures in the coalition for the defense of human rights , were arrested . the organization is headed by ebadi .
the nobel prize winner further explained that the head of the iranian judiciary had , “ under political pressure , ” issued a regulation whereby attorneys can lose their licenses to practice at any time .
“ this regulation discouraged lawyers from defending political prisoners and others whose opinions conflict with the government ’ s position . ”
according to ebadi , many prisoners have been isolated and prevented from contacting their families or attorneys .
ebadi , who emphasized that she has no close personal relationship with any of the presidential candidates , commented on further developments in iran as follows : “ increasing criticism from influential spiritual leaders will lead the government to become weaker and lose its legitimacy . ”
she noted that the protests will continue and that the populace is creative and has found new forms of protest .
for example , calling “ god is great ” from one ’ s windows or roof in the evening has established itself as a new form of protest , while mourning mothers meet regularly to engage in sit-ins .
ebadi herself will remain in europe for the time being in order to campaign for human rights in iran .
thereafter , she will “ most certainly ” return to her homeland .

low rainfall , deforestation , soil erosion and desertification all contribute to the hard life of mauritania 's farmers . ' drought is not simply our inevitable destiny , ' says cheikh abdellahai , vice president of the environmental protection agency , ampemn .
' like any other people in the world , mauritanians have always adapted themselves to their environment .
so if drought is not a prerequisite then we can do something about it .
we could improve our quality of life – we could for example construct artificial oases in the desert . ' cheikh abdellahib knows what he is talking about .
since the 1970s he and his colleagues have been leading a campaign to combat the effects of drought in mauritania .
they plant trees in sandy areas to stop the desert from spreading .
they cultivate arable land to be able to plant fruit and vegetables .
and they support local communities in building facilities to catch and store water to enable them to saturate parts of the dry earth . forced migration because of water scarcity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fleeing to the cities after bad droughts : nomads mauritania has a hot , dry climate and although it is three times the size of germany it has a population of only three million .
the sahara stretches deep into the country and a large percentage of the population has since moved to the cities - a result of the infertile land and inhospitable rural conditions .
in 1970 and 1984 two particularly bad droughts caused a massive migratory movement .
the nomadic population fled to the cities in desperation - and then stayed .
the state support system at the time was almost non-existent , says cheikh abdellahi .
' politicians gave fiery speeches .
but in the end nothing was done .
lately , politicians do seem to be developing a consciousness of environmental problems ; there is even a state secretary for the environment .
i hope that actual environmental strategies emerge from this . ' every drop counts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : destroys arable land : desertification is a big problem despite the emerging change in government mentality towards environmental protection , initiatives against soil erosion and desertification are still rare .
water shortage continues to be the biggest challenge facing the population .
in some areas rainfall is less than 50mm a year .
against overwhelming odds , mauritanians have not given up in their quest for water .
for the mauritanians this battle is not just about environmentalism , they are fighting for survival .
recent initiatives are starting to show signs of success , proving that drought is not an inevitable cycle .
there is a chance that it can be beaten . pk send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she added that iranians are dependent upon support from outside the country in their current “ and very sensitive state of emergency . ”
the government ’ s actions “ aren ’ t compatible with the iranian constitution , nor with islam , nor with human rights . ”
she claimed that the protests would continue in new ways and that criticism from iranian religious leaders will weaken the new government even more .
the nobel prize winner appealed to germany and europe to put more political pressure on the iranian government .
“ i am against economic sanctions and military interventions , ” declared ebadi , explaining that both are introduced at the cost of the iranian people .
she added that this , in turn , creates new battle fronts and leads people to establish solidarity with their government .
instead , she affirmed , political sanctions must be imposed .
in negotiations and contractual relationships with iran , the west must “ constantly insist upon the preservation of human rights . ” this stands for western political as well as economic delegates to iran , according to ebadi .
for example , she suggests that countries could remove their embassies from iran without completely breaking off diplomatic relations .
ebadi noted that for the last two years , the west has engaged with iran exclusively on the issue of atomic conflict .
“ one wonders whether europeans are concerned only with their own security instead of with that of iranians , ” she said .
regarding economic relations with iran , ebadi said that “ weapons and software supporting the suppression or control of iranian citizens ” should be blocked .
“ ask siemens and nokia why they have released these types of technologies in iran . ”
ebadi , who is currently staying in bonn as a guest of deutsche welle , revealed that her negotiations with high-level un officials have prompted the un to send a delegation to tehran to contribute to reporting on the situation there .
“ if the government does not permit the delegation to enter , it will prove that protestors ’ grievances are representative of the truth , ” according to ebadi .
the human-rights advocate also pointed out that the number of victims during the most recent protests is much higher than officially reported .
she said the brutality and violence on behalf of the government continues as the militias stand under supervision from the revolutionary guard .
ebadi noted that the number of people arrested is also very high and includes some of her colleagues .
recently , for example , the attorneys abdolfatah sultani and mohammad ali dadkhah , two prominent figures in the coalition for the defense of human rights , were arrested . the organization is headed by ebadi .
the nobel prize winner further explained that the head of the iranian judiciary had , “ under political pressure , ” issued a regulation whereby attorneys can lose their licenses to practice at any time .
“ this regulation discouraged lawyers from defending political prisoners and others whose opinions conflict with the government ’ s position . ”
according to ebadi , many prisoners have been isolated and prevented from contacting their families or attorneys .
ebadi , who emphasized that she has no close personal relationship with any of the presidential candidates , commented on further developments in iran as follows : “ increasing criticism from influential spiritual leaders will lead the government to become weaker and lose its legitimacy . ”
she noted that the protests will continue and that the populace is creative and has found new forms of protest .
for example , calling “ god is great ” from one ’ s windows or roof in the evening has established itself as a new form of protest , while mourning mothers meet regularly to engage in sit-ins .
ebadi herself will remain in europe for the time being in order to campaign for human rights in iran .
thereafter , she will “ most certainly ” return to her homeland .

according to the indian home ministry , at least 450 people were killed by the maoists in the first six months of this year , with chhattisgarh alone accounting for about a third .
during the general elections in may , trains were hijacked and 17 people were murdered , including election officials .
“ there are incidents taking place in chhattisgarh , in jharkhand , orissa , some incidents in bihar , maharashtra and andhra pradesh .
but the two states that are worst affected are chhattisgarh and jharkhand , ” explained former home minister shivraj patil .
decade-long conflict claiming to be fighting for the rights of landless peasants and labourers in rural areas left behind by india 's rapid economic growth , the maoists , who don ’ t number more than 10,000 , have waged their war for over a decade now .
on monday , chhattisgarh chief minister raman singh put on a brave face .
“ the time has now come to take the fight to the maoists ' camp , ” he said .
“ our fight is carrying on and we have also suffered a lot .
but this will not bring down our confidence .
we will take the fight in a decisive direction . ”
in recent years , the government has tried hard to follow an integrated approach of dovetailing policing with development work .
it has implemented a range of schemes through different ministries .
threat to democracy and economic progress but the approach does not appear to have worked .
despite the setting up of counter insurgency and anti-terrorism -lrb- ciat -rrb- schools , the sharing of intelligence between affected states and the improvement of inter-state coordination by the union government , the rebels still seem to have an upper hand .
the maoist insurgency threatens to disrupt the democratic process in several states , as well as hinder economic progress .
m r narayana swami , a close watcher of the maoists ’ activities , thinks they have achieved moderate success in their aims : “ they have caused immense financial losses to the industry and government by disrupting rail traffic in states , which are economically very active and in fact the losses amount to billions of rupees and that is a point to be noted . ”
disturbing pattern senior intelligence officials have found a disturbing pattern to attacks against the police , especially in chhattisgarh and jharkhand .
while rushing in reinforcements to thickly forested areas , police personnel seem to ignore the fact that vast tracts of terrain are heavily booby-trapped with improvised explosive devices -lrb- ieds -rrb- .
having a distinct advantage of the topography of these tracts , the rebels lie quietly in wait and trigger these devices , which often results in huge casualties of security personnel .
last month , the indian security forces captured a key maoist stronghold in west bengal after battling through landmines and gunfire with the rebels .
new delhi then formally banned the maoists , designating them officially as a terrorist organisation .
the government is now expected to call another meeting of the chief ministers of the maoist affected states to review their approach before mounting a serious offensive against the insurgent group .

the hijacking has led to a debate in germany and the question what can be done about it . the situation for the hansa stavanger 's crew of 24 has become desperate .
according to germany 's spiegel magazine , the captain reported to his wife a week ago that there was a lack of drinking water , food and medication .
many crew members are supposedly ill .
negotiations between the pirates and the hamburg based ship owner leonhardt & blumberg are ongoing .
the pirates originally demanded $ 15 million ransom .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : special forces during a naval training mission three weeks after the hijacking special troops from the german federal police prepared to storm the ship and free the hostages .
two hundred german anti-terror specialists practised the operation on board of the us navy ship uss boxer less then fifty nautical miles away from the hansa stavanger .
but before german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble in berlin could give the go-ahead for the operation , us national security advisor james jones in washington called the operation off , saying it was too risky .
but without american logistical support germany 's elite troops were grounded .
jason alderwick , a maritime defense analyst with the international institute for strategic studies -lrb- iiss -rrb- in london , supports the stance taken by the us .
" the german contribution is just part of a wider international coalition .
so unilaterally deciding to storm a ship is n't necessarily the right approach . "
better funding and cooperation wolfgang bosbach , the vice-chairman of chancellor angela merkel 's christian-democratic group in parliament , argues that german police have the right to storm a hijacked german ship in any case .
" when we need the support of other states , we ca n't decide alone .
we need our own capacities as far as helicopter air transport is concerned .
we need better air supported reconnaissance and we need better communication between the authorities in charge . "
bosbach wants better funding , so germany can carry out operations without international help . and he also urges better cooperation between the defense and interior ministries .
there was speculation in the media , that defense minister franz-josef jung asked washington to stop interior minister schaeuble .
jung is in charge of the military , schaeuble is responsible for the police , which includes the unit that was supposed to carry out the anti-terror operation .
wolfgang bosbach does n't want to address the media speculation , but emphasizes that the german military has a special mandate for fighting piracy at the horn of africa , but that it is the general responsibility of germany 's federal police to free hostages when necessary .
bosbach adds that for germany , given its recent century history , every international military operation remains a balancing act between modesty and responsibility .
" we have good reasons to say ' never first , never alone , never without an international mandate ' .
but when we say a , we also must say b. when we decide to send troops , we must make sure that they are equipped appropriately . "
fighting the root problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : capturing and trying somali pirates is difficult still , the larger question remains whether soldiers and policemen can stop pirates .
for more than six months now , the navies of nine european nations have been patrolling the somali coastline .
and yet piracy has continued .
wolfgang bosbach admits that the military alone ca n't stop piracy .
" we are talking here about organized crime .
we have to look at the causes .
that 's why besides the defense and interior ministries , foreign affairs and development ministries must be involved as well . "
still , he says , the european military patrols around the somali coast - operation atalanta - has had an impact : " the shipping companies must decide to join a convoy , which gets navy protection .
none of the convoys we accompanied got into trouble . "
jason alderwick agrees in principle that piracy is a matter of international crime and therefore rather a police than a military issue : " it would be great to hand over the operation to coast guard assets .
but europeans do n't have a huge coast guard , which is able to deploy in a counter piracy role .
so you have to go with the forces and capabilities you have .
the military instrument is a blunt instrument , but it 's adapting as best as it can with the situation down there . "
overall , says alderwick , europe 's atalanta operation at the horn of africa makes sense .
" there has arguably been an escalation in the number of piracy attacks , but that is n't a direct consequence of the operation .
it 's just a consequence of the overall situation .
without atalanta , piracy in the region would definitely have been worse . "

low rainfall , deforestation , soil erosion and desertification all contribute to the hard life of mauritania 's farmers . ' drought is not simply our inevitable destiny , ' says cheikh abdellahai , vice president of the environmental protection agency , ampemn .
' like any other people in the world , mauritanians have always adapted themselves to their environment .
so if drought is not a prerequisite then we can do something about it .
we could improve our quality of life – we could for example construct artificial oases in the desert . ' cheikh abdellahib knows what he is talking about .
since the 1970s he and his colleagues have been leading a campaign to combat the effects of drought in mauritania .
they plant trees in sandy areas to stop the desert from spreading .
they cultivate arable land to be able to plant fruit and vegetables .
and they support local communities in building facilities to catch and store water to enable them to saturate parts of the dry earth . forced migration because of water scarcity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fleeing to the cities after bad droughts : nomads mauritania has a hot , dry climate and although it is three times the size of germany it has a population of only three million .
the sahara stretches deep into the country and a large percentage of the population has since moved to the cities - a result of the infertile land and inhospitable rural conditions .
in 1970 and 1984 two particularly bad droughts caused a massive migratory movement .
the nomadic population fled to the cities in desperation - and then stayed .
the state support system at the time was almost non-existent , says cheikh abdellahi .
' politicians gave fiery speeches .
but in the end nothing was done .
lately , politicians do seem to be developing a consciousness of environmental problems ; there is even a state secretary for the environment .
i hope that actual environmental strategies emerge from this . ' every drop counts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : destroys arable land : desertification is a big problem despite the emerging change in government mentality towards environmental protection , initiatives against soil erosion and desertification are still rare .
water shortage continues to be the biggest challenge facing the population .
in some areas rainfall is less than 50mm a year .
against overwhelming odds , mauritanians have not given up in their quest for water .
for the mauritanians this battle is not just about environmentalism , they are fighting for survival .
recent initiatives are starting to show signs of success , proving that drought is not an inevitable cycle .
there is a chance that it can be beaten . pk send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : piracy hansa stavanger arrives at kenyan port after piracy ordeal in gulf of aden , piracy scourge continues unabated fighting piracy requires better international cooperation crime -pipe- 13.07.2009 fighting piracy militarily has mixed success so far großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conditions are bad for the crew aboard the hijacked vessel for over three months now the german container ship ms hansa stavanger and its crew are in the hands of somali pirates .
the hijacking has led to a debate in germany and the question what can be done about it . the situation for the hansa stavanger 's crew of 24 has become desperate .
according to germany 's spiegel magazine , the captain reported to his wife a week ago that there was a lack of drinking water , food and medication .
many crew members are supposedly ill .
negotiations between the pirates and the hamburg based ship owner leonhardt & blumberg are ongoing .
the pirates originally demanded $ 15 million ransom .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : special forces during a naval training mission three weeks after the hijacking special troops from the german federal police prepared to storm the ship and free the hostages .
two hundred german anti-terror specialists practised the operation on board of the us navy ship uss boxer less then fifty nautical miles away from the hansa stavanger .
but before german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble in berlin could give the go-ahead for the operation , us national security advisor james jones in washington called the operation off , saying it was too risky .
but without american logistical support germany 's elite troops were grounded .
jason alderwick , a maritime defense analyst with the international institute for strategic studies -lrb- iiss -rrb- in london , supports the stance taken by the us .
" the german contribution is just part of a wider international coalition .
so unilaterally deciding to storm a ship is n't necessarily the right approach . "
better funding and cooperation wolfgang bosbach , the vice-chairman of chancellor angela merkel 's christian-democratic group in parliament , argues that german police have the right to storm a hijacked german ship in any case .
" when we need the support of other states , we ca n't decide alone .
we need our own capacities as far as helicopter air transport is concerned .
we need better air supported reconnaissance and we need better communication between the authorities in charge . "
bosbach wants better funding , so germany can carry out operations without international help . and he also urges better cooperation between the defense and interior ministries .
there was speculation in the media , that defense minister franz-josef jung asked washington to stop interior minister schaeuble .
jung is in charge of the military , schaeuble is responsible for the police , which includes the unit that was supposed to carry out the anti-terror operation .
wolfgang bosbach does n't want to address the media speculation , but emphasizes that the german military has a special mandate for fighting piracy at the horn of africa , but that it is the general responsibility of germany 's federal police to free hostages when necessary .
bosbach adds that for germany , given its recent century history , every international military operation remains a balancing act between modesty and responsibility .
" we have good reasons to say ' never first , never alone , never without an international mandate ' .
but when we say a , we also must say b. when we decide to send troops , we must make sure that they are equipped appropriately . "
fighting the root problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : capturing and trying somali pirates is difficult still , the larger question remains whether soldiers and policemen can stop pirates .
for more than six months now , the navies of nine european nations have been patrolling the somali coastline .
and yet piracy has continued .
wolfgang bosbach admits that the military alone ca n't stop piracy .
" we are talking here about organized crime .
we have to look at the causes .
that 's why besides the defense and interior ministries , foreign affairs and development ministries must be involved as well . "
still , he says , the european military patrols around the somali coast - operation atalanta - has had an impact : " the shipping companies must decide to join a convoy , which gets navy protection .
none of the convoys we accompanied got into trouble . "
jason alderwick agrees in principle that piracy is a matter of international crime and therefore rather a police than a military issue : " it would be great to hand over the operation to coast guard assets .
but europeans do n't have a huge coast guard , which is able to deploy in a counter piracy role .
so you have to go with the forces and capabilities you have .
the military instrument is a blunt instrument , but it 's adapting as best as it can with the situation down there . "
overall , says alderwick , europe 's atalanta operation at the horn of africa makes sense .
" there has arguably been an escalation in the number of piracy attacks , but that is n't a direct consequence of the operation .
it 's just a consequence of the overall situation .
without atalanta , piracy in the region would definitely have been worse . "

the hijacking has led to a debate in germany and the question what can be done about it . the situation for the hansa stavanger 's crew of 24 has become desperate .
according to germany 's spiegel magazine , the captain reported to his wife a week ago that there was a lack of drinking water , food and medication .
many crew members are supposedly ill .
negotiations between the pirates and the hamburg based ship owner leonhardt & blumberg are ongoing .
the pirates originally demanded $ 15 million ransom .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : special forces during a naval training mission three weeks after the hijacking special troops from the german federal police prepared to storm the ship and free the hostages .
two hundred german anti-terror specialists practised the operation on board of the us navy ship uss boxer less then fifty nautical miles away from the hansa stavanger .
but before german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble in berlin could give the go-ahead for the operation , us national security advisor james jones in washington called the operation off , saying it was too risky .
but without american logistical support germany 's elite troops were grounded .
jason alderwick , a maritime defense analyst with the international institute for strategic studies -lrb- iiss -rrb- in london , supports the stance taken by the us .
" the german contribution is just part of a wider international coalition .
so unilaterally deciding to storm a ship is n't necessarily the right approach . "
better funding and cooperation wolfgang bosbach , the vice-chairman of chancellor angela merkel 's christian-democratic group in parliament , argues that german police have the right to storm a hijacked german ship in any case .
" when we need the support of other states , we ca n't decide alone .
we need our own capacities as far as helicopter air transport is concerned .
we need better air supported reconnaissance and we need better communication between the authorities in charge . "
bosbach wants better funding , so germany can carry out operations without international help . and he also urges better cooperation between the defense and interior ministries .
there was speculation in the media , that defense minister franz-josef jung asked washington to stop interior minister schaeuble .
jung is in charge of the military , schaeuble is responsible for the police , which includes the unit that was supposed to carry out the anti-terror operation .
wolfgang bosbach does n't want to address the media speculation , but emphasizes that the german military has a special mandate for fighting piracy at the horn of africa , but that it is the general responsibility of germany 's federal police to free hostages when necessary .
bosbach adds that for germany , given its recent century history , every international military operation remains a balancing act between modesty and responsibility .
" we have good reasons to say ' never first , never alone , never without an international mandate ' .
but when we say a , we also must say b. when we decide to send troops , we must make sure that they are equipped appropriately . "
fighting the root problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : capturing and trying somali pirates is difficult still , the larger question remains whether soldiers and policemen can stop pirates .
for more than six months now , the navies of nine european nations have been patrolling the somali coastline .
and yet piracy has continued .
wolfgang bosbach admits that the military alone ca n't stop piracy .
" we are talking here about organized crime .
we have to look at the causes .
that 's why besides the defense and interior ministries , foreign affairs and development ministries must be involved as well . "
still , he says , the european military patrols around the somali coast - operation atalanta - has had an impact : " the shipping companies must decide to join a convoy , which gets navy protection .
none of the convoys we accompanied got into trouble . "
jason alderwick agrees in principle that piracy is a matter of international crime and therefore rather a police than a military issue : " it would be great to hand over the operation to coast guard assets .
but europeans do n't have a huge coast guard , which is able to deploy in a counter piracy role .
so you have to go with the forces and capabilities you have .
the military instrument is a blunt instrument , but it 's adapting as best as it can with the situation down there . "
overall , says alderwick , europe 's atalanta operation at the horn of africa makes sense .
" there has arguably been an escalation in the number of piracy attacks , but that is n't a direct consequence of the operation .
it 's just a consequence of the overall situation .
without atalanta , piracy in the region would definitely have been worse . "

it demonstrates how they have expanded their grip in vast swathes of the state and beyond .
the security establishment in new delhi is shaken by the assault and is re-examining the government 's approach to left-wing extremism . sunday saw the biggest single casualty inflicted by the maoists so far in 2009 but there have already been over a thousand such attacks in india ’ s nine maoist-hit states this year .
according to the indian home ministry , at least 450 people were killed by the maoists in the first six months of this year , with chhattisgarh alone accounting for about a third .
during the general elections in may , trains were hijacked and 17 people were murdered , including election officials .
“ there are incidents taking place in chhattisgarh , in jharkhand , orissa , some incidents in bihar , maharashtra and andhra pradesh .
but the two states that are worst affected are chhattisgarh and jharkhand , ” explained former home minister shivraj patil .
decade-long conflict claiming to be fighting for the rights of landless peasants and labourers in rural areas left behind by india 's rapid economic growth , the maoists , who don ’ t number more than 10,000 , have waged their war for over a decade now .

“ our fight is carrying on and we have also suffered a lot .

the maoist insurgency threatens to disrupt the democratic process in several states , as well as hinder economic progress .
m r narayana swami , a close watcher of the maoists ’ activities , thinks they have achieved moderate success in their aims : “ they have caused immense financial losses to the industry and government by disrupting rail traffic in states , which are economically very active and in fact the losses amount to billions of rupees and that is a point to be noted . ”
disturbing pattern senior intelligence officials have found a disturbing pattern to attacks against the police , especially in chhattisgarh and jharkhand .
while rushing in reinforcements to thickly forested areas , police personnel seem to ignore the fact that vast tracts of terrain are heavily booby-trapped with improvised explosive devices -lrb- ieds -rrb- .

last month , the indian security forces captured a key maoist stronghold in west bengal after battling through landmines and gunfire with the rebels .
new delhi then formally banned the maoists , designating them officially as a terrorist organisation .

the security establishment in new delhi is shaken by the assault and is re-examining the government 's approach to left-wing extremism . sunday saw the biggest single casualty inflicted by the maoists so far in 2009 but there have already been over a thousand such attacks in india ’ s nine maoist-hit states this year .
according to the indian home ministry , at least 450 people were killed by the maoists in the first six months of this year , with chhattisgarh alone accounting for about a third .
during the general elections in may , trains were hijacked and 17 people were murdered , including election officials .
“ there are incidents taking place in chhattisgarh , in jharkhand , orissa , some incidents in bihar , maharashtra and andhra pradesh .

“ our fight is carrying on and we have also suffered a lot .

the maoist insurgency threatens to disrupt the democratic process in several states , as well as hinder economic progress .
m r narayana swami , a close watcher of the maoists ’ activities , thinks they have achieved moderate success in their aims : “ they have caused immense financial losses to the industry and government by disrupting rail traffic in states , which are economically very active and in fact the losses amount to billions of rupees and that is a point to be noted . ”
disturbing pattern senior intelligence officials have found a disturbing pattern to attacks against the police , especially in chhattisgarh and jharkhand .
while rushing in reinforcements to thickly forested areas , police personnel seem to ignore the fact that vast tracts of terrain are heavily booby-trapped with improvised explosive devices -lrb- ieds -rrb- .

there are no details on when the trial would begin .
the filing of charges comes 10 days after medical experts at munich 's stadelheim prison said demjanjuk was fit to stand trial as long as court sessions do not exceed two 90-minute sessions per day .
demjanjuk 's family had said the octogenarian was too frail to withstand the proceedings because he suffers from kidney disease , cancer and arthritis .
most-wanted nazi war criminal demjanjuk has denied accusations that he was a guard at the sobibor death camp in nazi-occupied poland in 1943 and helped murder jews .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a monument in sobibor in eastern poland remembers the victims at the nazi death camp he has said he was captured by the germans in ukraine while fighting for the red army and held as a prisoner of war .
until being deported to germany in may , the ukrainian-born demjanjuk had headed the list of the simon wiesenthal center 's 10 most-wanted suspected war criminals .
efraim zuroff from the simon wiesenthal centre welcomed monday 's move by german prosecutors .
" this is obviously an important step forward , " zufroff told the associated press .
" we hope that the trial itself will be expedited so that justice will be achieved and he can be given the appropriate punishment . "
" the effort to bring demjanjuk to justice sends a very powerful message that the passage of time in no way diminishes the guilt of the perpetrator . "
possibly last holocaust trial demjanjuk was deported by us authorities from his home in ohio on may 12 .
he had appealed against the deportation in a last ditch attempt to avoid facing charges but had his request rejected by a german court last week . demjanjuk 's trial is the last expected time a german court will prosecute for holocaust crimes in the country .
demjanjuk has lived in the us since 1952 .
he arrived there as a refugee and worked in the car industry in cleveland , ohio .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a former id card of demjanjuk 's with the word " sobibor " printed on it in 1988 , he was sentenced to death in israel for crimes against humanity after holocaust survivors identified him as the notorious " ivan the terrible , " a guard at the treblinka death camp .
but israel 's highest court later overturned his sentence , after documents from the former soviet union indicated that " ivan the terrible " had probably been a different man .
demjanjuk returned to the us , but in 2002 had his us citizenship revoked because of his failure to disclose his work at nazi camps when he first arrived . sp / reuters / dpa editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" today we have taken a step forward -lrb- towards the project 's realization -rrb- , " said nikolaus von bomhard , head of munich re , which hosted the signing .
the firms grouped under the desertec industrial initiative -lrb- dii -rrb- plan to build solar power generators in north africa and the middle east .
the massive project will see investments of up to 400 billion euros over a period of 40 years .
" of course it is still a long way off , but the enormous interest in the scheme shows we are on the right path , " a spokesman for munich re said .
a study suggests that with the use of thermal power plants and high voltage direct current transmission lines , desertec 's pioneering foray into the desert could meet 15 percent of europe 's electricity needs by the year 2050 .
bildunterschrift : the project could meet 15 percent of europe 's electricity needs by 2050 gerhard knies , chairman of the desertec supervisory board said the desert is an obvious source of clean power .
" within six hours deserts receive more energy from the sun than humankind consumes within a year , " he said adding that the " time appears right for a truly comprehensive maneuver to combat climate change . "
firms hope project will help combat climate change other companies involved in the venture are the spanish firm abengoa solar and the algerian conglomerate cevital as well as several german banks and engineering companies .
under the agreement , a desertec study office to be established by october will have three years to detail investment plans to create the network of solar farms .
representatives of the arab league and the egyptian energy ministry were also present at the signing of the protocol .
munich re board member torsten jeworrek said the european companies involved had pledged to work " as equals in a sincere and fair " manner with the producer countries .
" if we 're successful , we 'll make a huge contribution to the fight against climate change , " jeworrek said .
environmental organization greenpeace has welcomed the initiative and urged the german government to support it by channelling research funds earmarked for nuclear energy to the solar energy project .
critics slam huge costs but critics of the desertec project have warned that the political situation in many of the producer countries in north africa is unstable .
the european association for renewable energy , eurosolar , has said the desertec initiative is completely unviable .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the desertec initiative envisages solar power plants in africa and the middle east herman scheer , head of eurosolar and social democratic lawmaker in the german parliament said it was not necessary to go to north africa to collect the sun 's rays .
" we could invest the 400 billion euros here " scheer said , referring to the recession-hit eurozone .
he also said he preferred a network of decentralized operators that produced renewable energy from many sources rather than having one key project in the hands of major corporations .
" nothing will ever come of it -lrb- the project -rrb- , " scheer said .
he added that the astronomical costs of the gigantic project had been played down while the technical possibilities promised by it had been exaggerated. sp / afp / reuters / dpa editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" today we have taken a step forward -lrb- towards the project 's realization -rrb- , " said nikolaus von bomhard , head of munich re , which hosted the signing .
the firms grouped under the desertec industrial initiative -lrb- dii -rrb- plan to build solar power generators in north africa and the middle east .
the massive project will see investments of up to 400 billion euros over a period of 40 years .
" of course it is still a long way off , but the enormous interest in the scheme shows we are on the right path , " a spokesman for munich re said .
a study suggests that with the use of thermal power plants and high voltage direct current transmission lines , desertec 's pioneering foray into the desert could meet 15 percent of europe 's electricity needs by the year 2050 .
bildunterschrift : the project could meet 15 percent of europe 's electricity needs by 2050 gerhard knies , chairman of the desertec supervisory board said the desert is an obvious source of clean power .
" within six hours deserts receive more energy from the sun than humankind consumes within a year , " he said adding that the " time appears right for a truly comprehensive maneuver to combat climate change . "
firms hope project will help combat climate change other companies involved in the venture are the spanish firm abengoa solar and the algerian conglomerate cevital as well as several german banks and engineering companies .
under the agreement , a desertec study office to be established by october will have three years to detail investment plans to create the network of solar farms .
representatives of the arab league and the egyptian energy ministry were also present at the signing of the protocol .
munich re board member torsten jeworrek said the european companies involved had pledged to work " as equals in a sincere and fair " manner with the producer countries .
" if we 're successful , we 'll make a huge contribution to the fight against climate change , " jeworrek said .
environmental organization greenpeace has welcomed the initiative and urged the german government to support it by channelling research funds earmarked for nuclear energy to the solar energy project .
critics slam huge costs but critics of the desertec project have warned that the political situation in many of the producer countries in north africa is unstable .
the european association for renewable energy , eurosolar , has said the desertec initiative is completely unviable .

he also said he preferred a network of decentralized operators that produced renewable energy from many sources rather than having one key project in the hands of major corporations .

the new rules are intended to prevent future financial collapse . analysts say the meltdown of the financial system , which has led to the worst recession in over 60 years , was due in part to banks ' inability to assess the risk level of some of their investments .
if the proposal becomes law - which requires the approval from the eu parliament and the 27 eu governments - banks would have to demonstrate that they fully understood the risks involved when making an investment , especially in the case of highly-complex " re-securitization " investments .
banks that encouraged staff to take too much risk by offering bonuses could face sanctions .
in addition , the proposal calls for banks to keep more money and assets on hand to cover any potential losses if the value of an investment were to significantly deflate . " the proposal aims to ensure that banks hold enough capital to reflect the true risks they are taking , " european commission chief jose manuel barroso said in a statement .
he added that the plan would " legally oblige banks and investment firms to have remuneration policies consistent with effective risk management . "
the european banking federation said that the banks had anticipated the changes and were not surprised by monday 's announcement .
" what we do n't want is a supervisory authority to determine the level or form of remuneration , " an ebf spokeswoman said .
" we also insist that the new rules in terms of remuneration are international .
we want a level playing field . "
the new rules are not likely to take effect until the end of 2011 , and therefore , are not meant to address the current financial crisis .

she added that iranians are dependent upon support from outside the country in their current “ and very sensitive state of emergency . ”
the government ’ s actions “ aren ’ t compatible with the iranian constitution , nor with islam , nor with human rights . ”
she claimed that the protests would continue in new ways and that criticism from iranian religious leaders will weaken the new government even more .
the nobel prize winner appealed to germany and europe to put more political pressure on the iranian government .
“ i am against economic sanctions and military interventions , ” declared ebadi , explaining that both are introduced at the cost of the iranian people .
she added that this , in turn , creates new battle fronts and leads people to establish solidarity with their government .
instead , she affirmed , political sanctions must be imposed .
in negotiations and contractual relationships with iran , the west must “ constantly insist upon the preservation of human rights . ” this stands for western political as well as economic delegates to iran , according to ebadi .
for example , she suggests that countries could remove their embassies from iran without completely breaking off diplomatic relations .
ebadi noted that for the last two years , the west has engaged with iran exclusively on the issue of atomic conflict .
“ one wonders whether europeans are concerned only with their own security instead of with that of iranians , ” she said .
regarding economic relations with iran , ebadi said that “ weapons and software supporting the suppression or control of iranian citizens ” should be blocked .
“ ask siemens and nokia why they have released these types of technologies in iran . ”
ebadi , who is currently staying in bonn as a guest of deutsche welle , revealed that her negotiations with high-level un officials have prompted the un to send a delegation to tehran to contribute to reporting on the situation there .
“ if the government does not permit the delegation to enter , it will prove that protestors ’ grievances are representative of the truth , ” according to ebadi .
the human-rights advocate also pointed out that the number of victims during the most recent protests is much higher than officially reported .
she said the brutality and violence on behalf of the government continues as the militias stand under supervision from the revolutionary guard .
ebadi noted that the number of people arrested is also very high and includes some of her colleagues .
recently , for example , the attorneys abdolfatah sultani and mohammad ali dadkhah , two prominent figures in the coalition for the defense of human rights , were arrested . the organization is headed by ebadi .
the nobel prize winner further explained that the head of the iranian judiciary had , “ under political pressure , ” issued a regulation whereby attorneys can lose their licenses to practice at any time .
“ this regulation discouraged lawyers from defending political prisoners and others whose opinions conflict with the government ’ s position . ”
according to ebadi , many prisoners have been isolated and prevented from contacting their families or attorneys .
ebadi , who emphasized that she has no close personal relationship with any of the presidential candidates , commented on further developments in iran as follows : “ increasing criticism from influential spiritual leaders will lead the government to become weaker and lose its legitimacy . ”
she noted that the protests will continue and that the populace is creative and has found new forms of protest .
for example , calling “ god is great ” from one ’ s windows or roof in the evening has established itself as a new form of protest , while mourning mothers meet regularly to engage in sit-ins .
ebadi herself will remain in europe for the time being in order to campaign for human rights in iran .
thereafter , she will “ most certainly ” return to her homeland .

ebadi , who is currently staying in bonn as a guest of deutsche welle , revealed that her negotiations with high-level un officials have prompted the un to send a delegation to tehran to contribute to reporting on the situation there .
“ if the government does not permit the delegation to enter , it will prove that protestors ’ grievances are representative of the truth , ” according to ebadi .
the human-rights advocate also pointed out that the number of victims during the most recent protests is much higher than officially reported .
she said the brutality and violence on behalf of the government continues as the militias stand under supervision from the revolutionary guard .
ebadi noted that the number of people arrested is also very high and includes some of her colleagues .
recently , for example , the attorneys abdolfatah sultani and mohammad ali dadkhah , two prominent figures in the coalition for the defense of human rights , were arrested . the organization is headed by ebadi .
the nobel prize winner further explained that the head of the iranian judiciary had , “ under political pressure , ” issued a regulation whereby attorneys can lose their licenses to practice at any time .
“ this regulation discouraged lawyers from defending political prisoners and others whose opinions conflict with the government ’ s position . ”
according to ebadi , many prisoners have been isolated and prevented from contacting their families or attorneys .
ebadi , who emphasized that she has no close personal relationship with any of the presidential candidates , commented on further developments in iran as follows : “ increasing criticism from influential spiritual leaders will lead the government to become weaker and lose its legitimacy . ”
she noted that the protests will continue and that the populace is creative and has found new forms of protest .
for example , calling “ god is great ” from one ’ s windows or roof in the evening has established itself as a new form of protest , while mourning mothers meet regularly to engage in sit-ins .
ebadi herself will remain in europe for the time being in order to campaign for human rights in iran .
thereafter , she will “ most certainly ” return to her homeland .

there are no details on when the trial would begin .
the filing of charges comes 10 days after medical experts at munich 's stadelheim prison said demjanjuk was fit to stand trial as long as court sessions do not exceed two 90-minute sessions per day .
demjanjuk 's family had said the octogenarian was too frail to withstand the proceedings because he suffers from kidney disease , cancer and arthritis .
most-wanted nazi war criminal demjanjuk has denied accusations that he was a guard at the sobibor death camp in nazi-occupied poland in 1943 and helped murder jews .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a monument in sobibor in eastern poland remembers the victims at the nazi death camp he has said he was captured by the germans in ukraine while fighting for the red army and held as a prisoner of war .
until being deported to germany in may , the ukrainian-born demjanjuk had headed the list of the simon wiesenthal center 's 10 most-wanted suspected war criminals .
efraim zuroff from the simon wiesenthal centre welcomed monday 's move by german prosecutors .
" this is obviously an important step forward , " zufroff told the associated press .
" we hope that the trial itself will be expedited so that justice will be achieved and he can be given the appropriate punishment . "
" the effort to bring demjanjuk to justice sends a very powerful message that the passage of time in no way diminishes the guilt of the perpetrator . "
possibly last holocaust trial demjanjuk was deported by us authorities from his home in ohio on may 12 .
he had appealed against the deportation in a last ditch attempt to avoid facing charges but had his request rejected by a german court last week . demjanjuk 's trial is the last expected time a german court will prosecute for holocaust crimes in the country .
demjanjuk has lived in the us since 1952 .
he arrived there as a refugee and worked in the car industry in cleveland , ohio .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a former id card of demjanjuk 's with the word " sobibor " printed on it in 1988 , he was sentenced to death in israel for crimes against humanity after holocaust survivors identified him as the notorious " ivan the terrible , " a guard at the treblinka death camp .
but israel 's highest court later overturned his sentence , after documents from the former soviet union indicated that " ivan the terrible " had probably been a different man .
demjanjuk returned to the us , but in 2002 had his us citizenship revoked because of his failure to disclose his work at nazi camps when he first arrived . sp / reuters / dpa editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

low rainfall , deforestation , soil erosion and desertification all contribute to the hard life of mauritania 's farmers . ' drought is not simply our inevitable destiny , ' says cheikh abdellahai , vice president of the environmental protection agency , ampemn .
' like any other people in the world , mauritanians have always adapted themselves to their environment .
so if drought is not a prerequisite then we can do something about it .
we could improve our quality of life – we could for example construct artificial oases in the desert . ' cheikh abdellahib knows what he is talking about .
since the 1970s he and his colleagues have been leading a campaign to combat the effects of drought in mauritania .
they plant trees in sandy areas to stop the desert from spreading .
they cultivate arable land to be able to plant fruit and vegetables .
and they support local communities in building facilities to catch and store water to enable them to saturate parts of the dry earth . forced migration because of water scarcity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fleeing to the cities after bad droughts : nomads mauritania has a hot , dry climate and although it is three times the size of germany it has a population of only three million .
the sahara stretches deep into the country and a large percentage of the population has since moved to the cities - a result of the infertile land and inhospitable rural conditions .
in 1970 and 1984 two particularly bad droughts caused a massive migratory movement .
the nomadic population fled to the cities in desperation - and then stayed .
the state support system at the time was almost non-existent , says cheikh abdellahi .
' politicians gave fiery speeches .
but in the end nothing was done .
lately , politicians do seem to be developing a consciousness of environmental problems ; there is even a state secretary for the environment .
i hope that actual environmental strategies emerge from this . ' every drop counts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : destroys arable land : desertification is a big problem despite the emerging change in government mentality towards environmental protection , initiatives against soil erosion and desertification are still rare .
water shortage continues to be the biggest challenge facing the population .
in some areas rainfall is less than 50mm a year .
against overwhelming odds , mauritanians have not given up in their quest for water .
for the mauritanians this battle is not just about environmentalism , they are fighting for survival .
recent initiatives are starting to show signs of success , proving that drought is not an inevitable cycle .
there is a chance that it can be beaten . pk send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she added that iranians are dependent upon support from outside the country in their current “ and very sensitive state of emergency . ”
the government ’ s actions “ aren ’ t compatible with the iranian constitution , nor with islam , nor with human rights . ”
she claimed that the protests would continue in new ways and that criticism from iranian religious leaders will weaken the new government even more .
the nobel prize winner appealed to germany and europe to put more political pressure on the iranian government .
“ i am against economic sanctions and military interventions , ” declared ebadi , explaining that both are introduced at the cost of the iranian people .
she added that this , in turn , creates new battle fronts and leads people to establish solidarity with their government .
instead , she affirmed , political sanctions must be imposed .
in negotiations and contractual relationships with iran , the west must “ constantly insist upon the preservation of human rights . ” this stands for western political as well as economic delegates to iran , according to ebadi .
for example , she suggests that countries could remove their embassies from iran without completely breaking off diplomatic relations .
ebadi noted that for the last two years , the west has engaged with iran exclusively on the issue of atomic conflict .
“ one wonders whether europeans are concerned only with their own security instead of with that of iranians , ” she said .
regarding economic relations with iran , ebadi said that “ weapons and software supporting the suppression or control of iranian citizens ” should be blocked .
“ ask siemens and nokia why they have released these types of technologies in iran . ”
ebadi , who is currently staying in bonn as a guest of deutsche welle , revealed that her negotiations with high-level un officials have prompted the un to send a delegation to tehran to contribute to reporting on the situation there .
“ if the government does not permit the delegation to enter , it will prove that protestors ’ grievances are representative of the truth , ” according to ebadi .
the human-rights advocate also pointed out that the number of victims during the most recent protests is much higher than officially reported .
she said the brutality and violence on behalf of the government continues as the militias stand under supervision from the revolutionary guard .
ebadi noted that the number of people arrested is also very high and includes some of her colleagues .
recently , for example , the attorneys abdolfatah sultani and mohammad ali dadkhah , two prominent figures in the coalition for the defense of human rights , were arrested . the organization is headed by ebadi .
the nobel prize winner further explained that the head of the iranian judiciary had , “ under political pressure , ” issued a regulation whereby attorneys can lose their licenses to practice at any time .
“ this regulation discouraged lawyers from defending political prisoners and others whose opinions conflict with the government ’ s position . ”
according to ebadi , many prisoners have been isolated and prevented from contacting their families or attorneys .
ebadi , who emphasized that she has no close personal relationship with any of the presidential candidates , commented on further developments in iran as follows : “ increasing criticism from influential spiritual leaders will lead the government to become weaker and lose its legitimacy . ”
she noted that the protests will continue and that the populace is creative and has found new forms of protest .
for example , calling “ god is great ” from one ’ s windows or roof in the evening has established itself as a new form of protest , while mourning mothers meet regularly to engage in sit-ins .
ebadi herself will remain in europe for the time being in order to campaign for human rights in iran .
thereafter , she will “ most certainly ” return to her homeland .

the hijacking has led to a debate in germany and the question what can be done about it . the situation for the hansa stavanger 's crew of 24 has become desperate .
according to germany 's spiegel magazine , the captain reported to his wife a week ago that there was a lack of drinking water , food and medication .
many crew members are supposedly ill .
negotiations between the pirates and the hamburg based ship owner leonhardt & blumberg are ongoing .
the pirates originally demanded $ 15 million ransom .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : special forces during a naval training mission three weeks after the hijacking special troops from the german federal police prepared to storm the ship and free the hostages .
two hundred german anti-terror specialists practised the operation on board of the us navy ship uss boxer less then fifty nautical miles away from the hansa stavanger .
but before german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble in berlin could give the go-ahead for the operation , us national security advisor james jones in washington called the operation off , saying it was too risky .
but without american logistical support germany 's elite troops were grounded .
jason alderwick , a maritime defense analyst with the international institute for strategic studies -lrb- iiss -rrb- in london , supports the stance taken by the us .
" the german contribution is just part of a wider international coalition .
so unilaterally deciding to storm a ship is n't necessarily the right approach . "
better funding and cooperation wolfgang bosbach , the vice-chairman of chancellor angela merkel 's christian-democratic group in parliament , argues that german police have the right to storm a hijacked german ship in any case .
" when we need the support of other states , we ca n't decide alone .
we need our own capacities as far as helicopter air transport is concerned .
we need better air supported reconnaissance and we need better communication between the authorities in charge . "
bosbach wants better funding , so germany can carry out operations without international help . and he also urges better cooperation between the defense and interior ministries .
there was speculation in the media , that defense minister franz-josef jung asked washington to stop interior minister schaeuble .
jung is in charge of the military , schaeuble is responsible for the police , which includes the unit that was supposed to carry out the anti-terror operation .
wolfgang bosbach does n't want to address the media speculation , but emphasizes that the german military has a special mandate for fighting piracy at the horn of africa , but that it is the general responsibility of germany 's federal police to free hostages when necessary .
bosbach adds that for germany , given its recent century history , every international military operation remains a balancing act between modesty and responsibility .
" we have good reasons to say ' never first , never alone , never without an international mandate ' .
but when we say a , we also must say b. when we decide to send troops , we must make sure that they are equipped appropriately . "
fighting the root problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : capturing and trying somali pirates is difficult still , the larger question remains whether soldiers and policemen can stop pirates .
for more than six months now , the navies of nine european nations have been patrolling the somali coastline .
and yet piracy has continued .
wolfgang bosbach admits that the military alone ca n't stop piracy .
" we are talking here about organized crime .
we have to look at the causes .
that 's why besides the defense and interior ministries , foreign affairs and development ministries must be involved as well . "
still , he says , the european military patrols around the somali coast - operation atalanta - has had an impact : " the shipping companies must decide to join a convoy , which gets navy protection .
none of the convoys we accompanied got into trouble . "
jason alderwick agrees in principle that piracy is a matter of international crime and therefore rather a police than a military issue : " it would be great to hand over the operation to coast guard assets .
but europeans do n't have a huge coast guard , which is able to deploy in a counter piracy role .
so you have to go with the forces and capabilities you have .
the military instrument is a blunt instrument , but it 's adapting as best as it can with the situation down there . "
overall , says alderwick , europe 's atalanta operation at the horn of africa makes sense .
" there has arguably been an escalation in the number of piracy attacks , but that is n't a direct consequence of the operation .
it 's just a consequence of the overall situation .
without atalanta , piracy in the region would definitely have been worse . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 13.07.2009 african solar power for europe could promote security , experts say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : capturing sunshine could lead to energy development and security hurdles remain , but mediterranean countries should cooperate on economic development and environmental protection including a new solar power project , according to guest commentators matthias ruchser and stefan gaenzle . last year , on july 13 , the " union for the mediterranean " was launched amid much diplomatic fanfare .
heads of state and government from 43 european union and the mediterranean-rim countries had accepted an invitation to paris extended by french president nicolas sarkozy to give new impetus to mediterranean cooperation .
the union for the mediterranean follows up on the barcelona process , initiated in 1995 , which also had a pronounced security dimension . ultimately , the union for the mediterranean set itself a six-point agenda , among others the " mediterranean solar plan . "
the recent gaza war has upset these plans .
no high-ranking ministerial meetings have taken place since december 2008 , and some important issues dealing with the institutional design of the union have been shelved . similar to the constraints imposed on the baltic sea co-operation of the 1970s -lrb- due to the east-west conflict -rrb- , it would be recommendable for the union for the mediterranean to put high politics as well as security issues aside and focus on economic matters and the protection of the environment and the climate .
against this backdrop , can it be mere coincidence that it was precisely for july 13 that the munich re group issued invitations for the inaugural meeting of the so-called " desertec initiative " in munich ? energy security based on solar thermal power plants ? bildunterschrift : the desertec project aims to feed solar power from africa and the middle east to the eu while the idea behind the desertec project is nothing new , it is still fascinating : solar thermal power plants in northern africa would contribute to supplying europe with the clean energy it needs .
a total of roughly 400 billion euros in investments would be needed by the year 2050 to cover 15 percent of europe 's electricity needs .
so is the - privately financed - desertec consortium set to get the better of the european mediterranean solar plan , or indeed to replace it ? to start with the good news : the technology needed to generate solar thermal power , known as concentrated solar power -lrb- csp -rrb- , is already available , as are the high-voltage , direct current -lrb- hvdc -rrb- electric power transmission lines required to transport it .
in kramer junction , california , the first parabolic trough power plants have been connected to the grid since the mid-1980s .
more advanced csp power plants have been built in the united states and spain and are already several years old .
another csp plant , an integrated solar combined cycle plant -lrb- iscc -rrb- , is currently under construction in kuraymat , egypt .
parabolic trough power plants are already in the planning stages in some other countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german companies lead the field in concentrated solar power technology another piece of good news - at least from the german perspective - is that german companies lead the field when it comes to csp technology .
the parabolic mirrors are built by flabeg , the receivers by schott solar , the turbines , generators and control technology are available from siemens , and solar millennium and man ferrostaal operate as general contractors . looking for safe locations for solar plants is the only task remaining to secure the financing for the desertec initiative and to integrate it politically into the union for the mediterranean ?
not quite .
it will not prove so easy to enlist the southern mediterranean-rim countries as potential locations for power plants .
many of these countries are ruled by authoritarian regimes of different stripes , and there is an ever-present danger in the region of terrorist attacks .
population growth and unemployment are also very high in this part of the world , and such social problems are aggravated by migration pressure from sub-saharan africa .
all in all , an explosive mix , with important implications for our security as well . most of the non-eu mediterranean-rim countries have major development needs .
one prerequisite for development is energy .
however , most of the power plants currently in operation there are conventional , carbon-based plants .
in times of an accelerated climate change that has the gravest of implications for developing and transition countries , the latter need to switch their energy supply , as early as possible , to a non-conventional energy path , and that means , in effect , to renewable energy sources . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. stefan gaenzle is an expert on multilateral development cooperation with die large-scale solar thermal power plants may offer one solution to the problem .
even though energy production costs - 15 euros to 23 euro cents per kilowatt hour - are still higher than those for conventional power plants .
it would be possible -based , for example , on the model of the german renewable energy law - to close the viability gap either by raising the feed-in tariff for renewable electricity -lrb- to be paid by the end user -rrb- or by having government set ambitious quotas for the share of renewably generated electricity as a means of attracting investments in csp plants .
the important thing is to set clear-cut framework conditions for electricity sales in countries with the potential to operate csp plants , in this way ensuring that the billions that need to be invested will pay off in the long term for private investors . grid development as a pan-european task some successes in economic transformation have already been observed in the context of the euro-mediterranean partnership , in tunisia for instance , although there has been less movement when it comes to political change .
be that as it may , though , the union for the mediterranean does offer a dynamic normative frame of reference for the southern mediterranean-rim countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias ruchser is an energy consultant and head of media and public relations at die however , the eu 's tasks in the framework of the union for the mediterranean should not be to offset the financial risk for private-sector projects like the desertec initiative .
this , though , may be a different matter when it comes to support for the development and expansion of the power grid in the overall mediterranean region .
grid development must be viewed under the aspect of public welfare , and here the eu could provide an important contribution to collective energy security in the mediterranean region , one that would entail a security dividend over the longer term . to put it in a nutshell : renewable energy sources promote development , and development promotes security .
looked at in this way , the evolving desertec consortium should provide a new and innovative boost for the union for the mediterranean . authors : matthias ruchser , dr. stefan gaenzle -lrb- ar -rrb- editor : sean sinico matthias ruchser is a consultant in the energy industry and head of media and public relations at the german development institute / deutsches institut für entwicklungspolitik -lrb- die -rrb- .

heads of state and government from 43 european union and the mediterranean-rim countries had accepted an invitation to paris extended by french president nicolas sarkozy to give new impetus to mediterranean cooperation .
the union for the mediterranean follows up on the barcelona process , initiated in 1995 , which also had a pronounced security dimension . ultimately , the union for the mediterranean set itself a six-point agenda , among others the " mediterranean solar plan . "
the recent gaza war has upset these plans .
no high-ranking ministerial meetings have taken place since december 2008 , and some important issues dealing with the institutional design of the union have been shelved . similar to the constraints imposed on the baltic sea co-operation of the 1970s -lrb- due to the east-west conflict -rrb- , it would be recommendable for the union for the mediterranean to put high politics as well as security issues aside and focus on economic matters and the protection of the environment and the climate .
against this backdrop , can it be mere coincidence that it was precisely for july 13 that the munich re group issued invitations for the inaugural meeting of the so-called " desertec initiative " in munich ? energy security based on solar thermal power plants ? bildunterschrift : the desertec project aims to feed solar power from africa and the middle east to the eu while the idea behind the desertec project is nothing new , it is still fascinating : solar thermal power plants in northern africa would contribute to supplying europe with the clean energy it needs .
a total of roughly 400 billion euros in investments would be needed by the year 2050 to cover 15 percent of europe 's electricity needs .
so is the - privately financed - desertec consortium set to get the better of the european mediterranean solar plan , or indeed to replace it ? to start with the good news : the technology needed to generate solar thermal power , known as concentrated solar power -lrb- csp -rrb- , is already available , as are the high-voltage , direct current -lrb- hvdc -rrb- electric power transmission lines required to transport it .
in kramer junction , california , the first parabolic trough power plants have been connected to the grid since the mid-1980s .
more advanced csp power plants have been built in the united states and spain and are already several years old .
another csp plant , an integrated solar combined cycle plant -lrb- iscc -rrb- , is currently under construction in kuraymat , egypt .
parabolic trough power plants are already in the planning stages in some other countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german companies lead the field in concentrated solar power technology another piece of good news - at least from the german perspective - is that german companies lead the field when it comes to csp technology .
the parabolic mirrors are built by flabeg , the receivers by schott solar , the turbines , generators and control technology are available from siemens , and solar millennium and man ferrostaal operate as general contractors . looking for safe locations for solar plants is the only task remaining to secure the financing for the desertec initiative and to integrate it politically into the union for the mediterranean ?
not quite .
it will not prove so easy to enlist the southern mediterranean-rim countries as potential locations for power plants .
many of these countries are ruled by authoritarian regimes of different stripes , and there is an ever-present danger in the region of terrorist attacks .
population growth and unemployment are also very high in this part of the world , and such social problems are aggravated by migration pressure from sub-saharan africa .
all in all , an explosive mix , with important implications for our security as well . most of the non-eu mediterranean-rim countries have major development needs .
one prerequisite for development is energy .
however , most of the power plants currently in operation there are conventional , carbon-based plants .
in times of an accelerated climate change that has the gravest of implications for developing and transition countries , the latter need to switch their energy supply , as early as possible , to a non-conventional energy path , and that means , in effect , to renewable energy sources . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. stefan gaenzle is an expert on multilateral development cooperation with die large-scale solar thermal power plants may offer one solution to the problem .
even though energy production costs - 15 euros to 23 euro cents per kilowatt hour - are still higher than those for conventional power plants .
it would be possible -based , for example , on the model of the german renewable energy law - to close the viability gap either by raising the feed-in tariff for renewable electricity -lrb- to be paid by the end user -rrb- or by having government set ambitious quotas for the share of renewably generated electricity as a means of attracting investments in csp plants .
the important thing is to set clear-cut framework conditions for electricity sales in countries with the potential to operate csp plants , in this way ensuring that the billions that need to be invested will pay off in the long term for private investors . grid development as a pan-european task some successes in economic transformation have already been observed in the context of the euro-mediterranean partnership , in tunisia for instance , although there has been less movement when it comes to political change .
be that as it may , though , the union for the mediterranean does offer a dynamic normative frame of reference for the southern mediterranean-rim countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias ruchser is an energy consultant and head of media and public relations at die however , the eu 's tasks in the framework of the union for the mediterranean should not be to offset the financial risk for private-sector projects like the desertec initiative .
this , though , may be a different matter when it comes to support for the development and expansion of the power grid in the overall mediterranean region .
grid development must be viewed under the aspect of public welfare , and here the eu could provide an important contribution to collective energy security in the mediterranean region , one that would entail a security dividend over the longer term . to put it in a nutshell : renewable energy sources promote development , and development promotes security .
looked at in this way , the evolving desertec consortium should provide a new and innovative boost for the union for the mediterranean . authors : matthias ruchser , dr. stefan gaenzle -lrb- ar -rrb- editor : sean sinico matthias ruchser is a consultant in the energy industry and head of media and public relations at the german development institute / deutsches institut für entwicklungspolitik -lrb- die -rrb- .

heads of state and government from 43 european union and the mediterranean-rim countries had accepted an invitation to paris extended by french president nicolas sarkozy to give new impetus to mediterranean cooperation .
the union for the mediterranean follows up on the barcelona process , initiated in 1995 , which also had a pronounced security dimension . ultimately , the union for the mediterranean set itself a six-point agenda , among others the " mediterranean solar plan . "
the recent gaza war has upset these plans .
no high-ranking ministerial meetings have taken place since december 2008 , and some important issues dealing with the institutional design of the union have been shelved . similar to the constraints imposed on the baltic sea co-operation of the 1970s -lrb- due to the east-west conflict -rrb- , it would be recommendable for the union for the mediterranean to put high politics as well as security issues aside and focus on economic matters and the protection of the environment and the climate .
against this backdrop , can it be mere coincidence that it was precisely for july 13 that the munich re group issued invitations for the inaugural meeting of the so-called " desertec initiative " in munich ? energy security based on solar thermal power plants ? bildunterschrift : the desertec project aims to feed solar power from africa and the middle east to the eu while the idea behind the desertec project is nothing new , it is still fascinating : solar thermal power plants in northern africa would contribute to supplying europe with the clean energy it needs .
a total of roughly 400 billion euros in investments would be needed by the year 2050 to cover 15 percent of europe 's electricity needs .
so is the - privately financed - desertec consortium set to get the better of the european mediterranean solar plan , or indeed to replace it ? to start with the good news : the technology needed to generate solar thermal power , known as concentrated solar power -lrb- csp -rrb- , is already available , as are the high-voltage , direct current -lrb- hvdc -rrb- electric power transmission lines required to transport it .
in kramer junction , california , the first parabolic trough power plants have been connected to the grid since the mid-1980s .
more advanced csp power plants have been built in the united states and spain and are already several years old .
another csp plant , an integrated solar combined cycle plant -lrb- iscc -rrb- , is currently under construction in kuraymat , egypt .
parabolic trough power plants are already in the planning stages in some other countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german companies lead the field in concentrated solar power technology another piece of good news - at least from the german perspective - is that german companies lead the field when it comes to csp technology .
the parabolic mirrors are built by flabeg , the receivers by schott solar , the turbines , generators and control technology are available from siemens , and solar millennium and man ferrostaal operate as general contractors . looking for safe locations for solar plants is the only task remaining to secure the financing for the desertec initiative and to integrate it politically into the union for the mediterranean ?
not quite .
it will not prove so easy to enlist the southern mediterranean-rim countries as potential locations for power plants .
many of these countries are ruled by authoritarian regimes of different stripes , and there is an ever-present danger in the region of terrorist attacks .
population growth and unemployment are also very high in this part of the world , and such social problems are aggravated by migration pressure from sub-saharan africa .
all in all , an explosive mix , with important implications for our security as well . most of the non-eu mediterranean-rim countries have major development needs .
one prerequisite for development is energy .
however , most of the power plants currently in operation there are conventional , carbon-based plants .
in times of an accelerated climate change that has the gravest of implications for developing and transition countries , the latter need to switch their energy supply , as early as possible , to a non-conventional energy path , and that means , in effect , to renewable energy sources . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. stefan gaenzle is an expert on multilateral development cooperation with die large-scale solar thermal power plants may offer one solution to the problem .
even though energy production costs - 15 euros to 23 euro cents per kilowatt hour - are still higher than those for conventional power plants .
it would be possible -based , for example , on the model of the german renewable energy law - to close the viability gap either by raising the feed-in tariff for renewable electricity -lrb- to be paid by the end user -rrb- or by having government set ambitious quotas for the share of renewably generated electricity as a means of attracting investments in csp plants .
the important thing is to set clear-cut framework conditions for electricity sales in countries with the potential to operate csp plants , in this way ensuring that the billions that need to be invested will pay off in the long term for private investors . grid development as a pan-european task some successes in economic transformation have already been observed in the context of the euro-mediterranean partnership , in tunisia for instance , although there has been less movement when it comes to political change .
be that as it may , though , the union for the mediterranean does offer a dynamic normative frame of reference for the southern mediterranean-rim countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias ruchser is an energy consultant and head of media and public relations at die however , the eu 's tasks in the framework of the union for the mediterranean should not be to offset the financial risk for private-sector projects like the desertec initiative .
this , though , may be a different matter when it comes to support for the development and expansion of the power grid in the overall mediterranean region .
grid development must be viewed under the aspect of public welfare , and here the eu could provide an important contribution to collective energy security in the mediterranean region , one that would entail a security dividend over the longer term . to put it in a nutshell : renewable energy sources promote development , and development promotes security .
looked at in this way , the evolving desertec consortium should provide a new and innovative boost for the union for the mediterranean . authors : matthias ruchser , dr. stefan gaenzle -lrb- ar -rrb- editor : sean sinico matthias ruchser is a consultant in the energy industry and head of media and public relations at the german development institute / deutsches institut für entwicklungspolitik -lrb- die -rrb- .

she is a lawyer , who gained entrance to the faculty of law at tehran university in 1965 . in 1975 she became the first woman in the history of iran 's justice system , to be made the president of bench 24 of the tehran city court .
she then set up her own practice after receiving her lawyer 's license in 1992 .
ebadi has written several books and many of her articles have been published in iranian journals .
one of the most talked about topics in the world right now is the disputed iranian presidential election .
do you believe the vote was fair ?
with their street protests , iranians have shown that they do not accept the announced results of the election which they believe was rigged .
you have also said that a new election will take place .
do you believe this will make any difference ?
the iranian people have called for a new election . and it is also my belief that these new elections should take place under the supervision of the united nations .
otherwise these disputes will continue and the people will again protest against election manipulation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2003 nobel peace prize winner 's visit generated a lot of media attention the scale of protests in iran and the reaction of the police indicate that the government was guilty .
if the elections were fair , as the government claims , why was there such a strong presence of security forces in the streets ?
that is a good question .
what happened in iran is an obvious human rights violation .
when the iranian people demonstrated peacefully , there were no problems – not even a window was broken .
but towards the end of the demonstrations shots were fired from office buildings .
some died and many more were injured .
that was the beginning of the state 's crackdown .
that night at 3 a.m. , a student residence was attacked , five students were shot dead and several were injured . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ebadi meets deutsche welle 's director-general , erik bettermann can other countries or institutions such as the united nations make a difference , or is it up to the iranian people now ?
first and foremost it is iranians who are fighting for their rights .
this movement , which has in the meantime turned into a national movement , was created by the iranian people .
president mahmoud ahmadinejad and the iranian government have said that the west is to blame for the protests in iran . what ahmadinejad has said is a major insult .
it is not true and in no way reflects the truth .
this is a pure national protest movement formed by the iranian people .
have these protests had any impact on the human rights situation ?
the movement started completely peacefully which shows the political maturity of the iranian people .
sadly , the people got a violent response to their peaceful movement .
when you give interviews like today , does it cause problems for you in iran ?
that 's not that important to me .
i consider this a task that has to be done .
will you go back to iran ?
of course i will return .
i have my husband , family and my house in iran .
and after i have finished my job here , i will go back .

she is a lawyer , who gained entrance to the faculty of law at tehran university in 1965 . in 1975 she became the first woman in the history of iran 's justice system , to be made the president of bench 24 of the tehran city court .
she then set up her own practice after receiving her lawyer 's license in 1992 .
ebadi has written several books and many of her articles have been published in iranian journals .
one of the most talked about topics in the world right now is the disputed iranian presidential election .
do you believe the vote was fair ?
with their street protests , iranians have shown that they do not accept the announced results of the election which they believe was rigged .
you have also said that a new election will take place .
do you believe this will make any difference ?
the iranian people have called for a new election . and it is also my belief that these new elections should take place under the supervision of the united nations .
otherwise these disputes will continue and the people will again protest against election manipulation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2003 nobel peace prize winner 's visit generated a lot of media attention the scale of protests in iran and the reaction of the police indicate that the government was guilty .
if the elections were fair , as the government claims , why was there such a strong presence of security forces in the streets ?
that is a good question .
what happened in iran is an obvious human rights violation .
when the iranian people demonstrated peacefully , there were no problems – not even a window was broken .
but towards the end of the demonstrations shots were fired from office buildings .
some died and many more were injured .
that was the beginning of the state 's crackdown .
that night at 3 a.m. , a student residence was attacked , five students were shot dead and several were injured . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ebadi meets deutsche welle 's director-general , erik bettermann can other countries or institutions such as the united nations make a difference , or is it up to the iranian people now ?
first and foremost it is iranians who are fighting for their rights .
this movement , which has in the meantime turned into a national movement , was created by the iranian people .
president mahmoud ahmadinejad and the iranian government have said that the west is to blame for the protests in iran . what ahmadinejad has said is a major insult .
it is not true and in no way reflects the truth .
this is a pure national protest movement formed by the iranian people .
have these protests had any impact on the human rights situation ?
the movement started completely peacefully which shows the political maturity of the iranian people .
sadly , the people got a violent response to their peaceful movement .
when you give interviews like today , does it cause problems for you in iran ?
that 's not that important to me .
i consider this a task that has to be done .
will you go back to iran ?
of course i will return .
i have my husband , family and my house in iran .

"
during a speech in london on saturday , solana said it was up to the mediator to set a timetable for peace .
" after a fixed deadline , a un security council resolution should proclaim the adoption of the two-state solution . "
solana said , adding that such a resolution should include all the parameters of borders , refugees , jerusalem and security arrangements .
" it would accept the palestinian state as a full member of the un and set a calendar for implementation . "
speaking on israeli radio on monday , lieberman said " with all due respect to solana , he is about to retire ... and we should not overstate the importance of his statement .

" europe , as a member of the international quartet must continue in its efforts to apply pressure to israel to freeze the settlements and stop wasting time , " nabil abu rudeina told the afp news agency .

it marks the highest rate since the eu currency was introduced in 2002 . a statement released by the ecb said " a total of 413,000 counterfeit euro banknotes were withdrawn from circulation , " in the first half of 2009 .
it added that in the main , those bills originated from the same places as previously seized forgeries , meaning no new counterfeit sources had been found .
although the increase is high , the european central bank also said it was important to consider the number of genuine banknotes - some 12.5 billion - in circulation during the same timeframe .
in germany , the number of fakes rose in keeping with the overall figure , costing the economy 1.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.23 billion -rrb- .
but the federal bank said that was an improvement of some 100,000 euros over the last six months of 2008 .
it attributed the drop to the fact that the majority of notes seized between january and june of 2009 were of relatively small denominations .
twenty and fifty euro notes made up almost fifty percent of the total number largely recovered from across the 16 nations which use the common currency .

but the federal bank said that was an improvement of some 100,000 euros over the last six months of 2008 .
it attributed the drop to the fact that the majority of notes seized between january and june of 2009 were of relatively small denominations .
twenty and fifty euro notes made up almost fifty percent of the total number largely recovered from across the 16 nations which use the common currency .
earlier this month , police in bulgaria and poland made several arrests in connection with the production of conterfeit cash. tkw / afp / dpa / ap editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the hijacking has led to a debate in germany and the question what can be done about it . the situation for the hansa stavanger 's crew of 24 has become desperate .
according to germany 's spiegel magazine , the captain reported to his wife a week ago that there was a lack of drinking water , food and medication .
many crew members are supposedly ill .
negotiations between the pirates and the hamburg based ship owner leonhardt & blumberg are ongoing .
the pirates originally demanded $ 15 million ransom .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : special forces during a naval training mission three weeks after the hijacking special troops from the german federal police prepared to storm the ship and free the hostages .
two hundred german anti-terror specialists practised the operation on board of the us navy ship uss boxer less then fifty nautical miles away from the hansa stavanger .
but before german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble in berlin could give the go-ahead for the operation , us national security advisor james jones in washington called the operation off , saying it was too risky .
but without american logistical support germany 's elite troops were grounded .
jason alderwick , a maritime defense analyst with the international institute for strategic studies -lrb- iiss -rrb- in london , supports the stance taken by the us .
" the german contribution is just part of a wider international coalition .
so unilaterally deciding to storm a ship is n't necessarily the right approach . "
better funding and cooperation wolfgang bosbach , the vice-chairman of chancellor angela merkel 's christian-democratic group in parliament , argues that german police have the right to storm a hijacked german ship in any case .
" when we need the support of other states , we ca n't decide alone .
we need our own capacities as far as helicopter air transport is concerned .
we need better air supported reconnaissance and we need better communication between the authorities in charge . "
bosbach wants better funding , so germany can carry out operations without international help . and he also urges better cooperation between the defense and interior ministries .
there was speculation in the media , that defense minister franz-josef jung asked washington to stop interior minister schaeuble .
jung is in charge of the military , schaeuble is responsible for the police , which includes the unit that was supposed to carry out the anti-terror operation .
wolfgang bosbach does n't want to address the media speculation , but emphasizes that the german military has a special mandate for fighting piracy at the horn of africa , but that it is the general responsibility of germany 's federal police to free hostages when necessary .
bosbach adds that for germany , given its recent century history , every international military operation remains a balancing act between modesty and responsibility .
" we have good reasons to say ' never first , never alone , never without an international mandate ' .
but when we say a , we also must say b. when we decide to send troops , we must make sure that they are equipped appropriately . "
fighting the root problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : capturing and trying somali pirates is difficult still , the larger question remains whether soldiers and policemen can stop pirates .
for more than six months now , the navies of nine european nations have been patrolling the somali coastline .
and yet piracy has continued .
wolfgang bosbach admits that the military alone ca n't stop piracy .
" we are talking here about organized crime .
we have to look at the causes .
that 's why besides the defense and interior ministries , foreign affairs and development ministries must be involved as well . "
still , he says , the european military patrols around the somali coast - operation atalanta - has had an impact : " the shipping companies must decide to join a convoy , which gets navy protection .
none of the convoys we accompanied got into trouble . "
jason alderwick agrees in principle that piracy is a matter of international crime and therefore rather a police than a military issue : " it would be great to hand over the operation to coast guard assets .
but europeans do n't have a huge coast guard , which is able to deploy in a counter piracy role .
so you have to go with the forces and capabilities you have .
the military instrument is a blunt instrument , but it 's adapting as best as it can with the situation down there . "
overall , says alderwick , europe 's atalanta operation at the horn of africa makes sense .
" there has arguably been an escalation in the number of piracy attacks , but that is n't a direct consequence of the operation .
it 's just a consequence of the overall situation .
without atalanta , piracy in the region would definitely have been worse . "

the original eau de cologne , survived wars and imitations and still sells well in a market saturated with modern scents . the first bottle of eau de cologne was created by giovanni maria farina , an italian expatriate living in the eastern german city of cologne .
on july 13 , 1709 , farina opened a luxury goods shop where the fragrance was sold . in a letter to his brother dated in 1709 , farina wrote , " i have discovered a scent that reminds me of an italian spring morning , of daffodils and orange blossoms after the rain . "
he named it after the city he lived in . over the course of the last three centuries , only 30 people have been privy to the secret recipe - including johann maria farina , a descendant of the perfumer and the company 's current managing director . " it 's crucial that the original eau de cologne always smells the same , " said farina .
" like champagne that 's made from many different wines and has a specific taste or aroma . " an eau de cologne differs from a so-called eau de toilette in that it has a smaller concentration of essential oils , which give the solution its scent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the original eau de cologne was a top seller in giovanni maria farina 's luxury shop napoleon allegedly used one vial of the valuable liquid each day .
a vial cost a week 's wages for a master craftsman - or well over 1,000 euros -lrb- $ 1,400 -rrb- in today 's money - making the perfume only accessible to the extremely wealthy . but the hefty price tag did n't always mean big earnings for farina 's company . " there were many crises , " said the firm 's current managing director .
" the french revolution and the first and second world wars were the biggest crises for us - not because our customers could n't pay but because we were cut off from the raw materials and could n't produce . " a respected imitation in addition to political conflicts , the original eau de cologne has also had to deal with stiff competition from a popular imitation : 4711 . in the 18th century , the muehlens , a merchant family from cologne , produced a citrus-based scent similar to the original eau de cologne , calling it by the house number of the factory on glockengasse in downtown cologne .
while 4711 is known around the world - and boasts an over 200-year history - it 's not the original . in 1994 , the muehlens family sold its company to the german wella corporation .
it was then acquired by procter and gamble in 2003 and returned to german hands in 2007 , when the company was bought by maeurer und wirtz , best known for its perfume brand tabac original . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 4711 has a large following of its own while farina 's eau de cologne may be the true original , 4711 has always been the more commercially successful scent . it is marketed in 75 countries today and is especially popular with the older generation of germans .
the fragrance also sells well in japan , where men perfume their hair with it . farina , however , said there are no bad feelings between his family and the muehlens , the founders of 4711 . " i once had a dance class with a daughter of ferdinand muehlens and know the others as well , " said farina .
" there have never been any problems between the two families .

the original eau de cologne , survived wars and imitations and still sells well in a market saturated with modern scents . the first bottle of eau de cologne was created by giovanni maria farina , an italian expatriate living in the eastern german city of cologne .
on july 13 , 1709 , farina opened a luxury goods shop where the fragrance was sold . in a letter to his brother dated in 1709 , farina wrote , " i have discovered a scent that reminds me of an italian spring morning , of daffodils and orange blossoms after the rain . "
he named it after the city he lived in . over the course of the last three centuries , only 30 people have been privy to the secret recipe - including johann maria farina , a descendant of the perfumer and the company 's current managing director . " it 's crucial that the original eau de cologne always smells the same , " said farina .
" like champagne that 's made from many different wines and has a specific taste or aroma .

a vial cost a week 's wages for a master craftsman - or well over 1,000 euros -lrb- $ 1,400 -rrb- in today 's money - making the perfume only accessible to the extremely wealthy . but the hefty price tag did n't always mean big earnings for farina 's company . " there were many crises , " said the firm 's current managing director .
" the french revolution and the first and second world wars were the biggest crises for us - not because our customers could n't pay but because we were cut off from the raw materials and could n't produce . " a respected imitation in addition to political conflicts , the original eau de cologne has also had to deal with stiff competition from a popular imitation : 4711 . in the 18th century , the muehlens , a merchant family from cologne , produced a citrus-based scent similar to the original eau de cologne , calling it by the house number of the factory on glockengasse in downtown cologne .
while 4711 is known around the world - and boasts an over 200-year history - it 's not the original . in 1994 , the muehlens family sold its company to the german wella corporation .
it was then acquired by procter and gamble in 2003 and returned to german hands in 2007 , when the company was bought by maeurer und wirtz , best known for its perfume brand tabac original . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 4711 has a large following of its own while farina 's eau de cologne may be the true original , 4711 has always been the more commercially successful scent . it is marketed in 75 countries today and is especially popular with the older generation of germans .
the fragrance also sells well in japan , where men perfume their hair with it . farina , however , said there are no bad feelings between his family and the muehlens , the founders of 4711 .

the 47-year-old diamond trader was sentenced to eight years in jail for actively supporting the terrorist group . prosecutors said aleem n. supported al-qaeda for years , raising money , distributing propaganda material and recruiting new members .
he is thought to be a key figure for the organization 's german operations .
the german man of pakistani descent was arrested in february of last year on allegations that he belonged to the terrorist group .
investigators say that in the summer of 2004 , he became part of the inner sanctum of the organization and received orders to recruit new members and supporters in germany .
investigators believe that by 2007 , aleem n. had sent four young fighters - together with letters of recommendation - to be trained in terror camps .
one of them is believed to be a bonn-based man , who appeared in an anti-german terrorist video earlier this year .
the defence had called for aleem n. to be acquitted. tkw / dpa / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we condemn such acts , wherever they take place , " said wilhelm .
the 31-year-old muslim woman , marwa al-sherbini , was killed by a russian-born german during his appeal hearing for insulting her with racist slurs , in a case that sparked anti-german demonstrations outside the german embassy in tehran over the weekend . ahmadinejad on sunday demanded the united nations impose sanctions against germany and accused the west of applying double standards when it comes to human rights . the incident was proof for of the " brutality of the german government and clear evidence for corruption in the german justice system , " said ahmadinejad . ahmadinejad added that while berlin and washington had plenty to say regarding events in tehran following iran 's presidential elections , no reaction had been registered regarding al-sherbini 's murder . " we want condemnation from the united nations security council and the imposition of sanctions , " said the iranian president . government spokesman ulrich wilhelm acknowledged the iranian president 's remarks but insisted that there was no climate that promoted such actions . he said it was now a matter for the german justice system to punish those who commit these acts . on july 1 , the pregnant egyptian woman mother of a three-year-old was stabbed 18 times in a courtroom in the eastern german city of dresden by a russian-born german , who was appealing an earlier conviction for making racist slurs against the egyptian in a children 's playground in 2008 .

she added that iranians are dependent upon support from outside the country in their current “ and very sensitive state of emergency . ”
the government ’ s actions “ aren ’ t compatible with the iranian constitution , nor with islam , nor with human rights . ”
she claimed that the protests would continue in new ways and that criticism from iranian religious leaders will weaken the new government even more .
the nobel prize winner appealed to germany and europe to put more political pressure on the iranian government .
“ i am against economic sanctions and military interventions , ” declared ebadi , explaining that both are introduced at the cost of the iranian people .
she added that this , in turn , creates new battle fronts and leads people to establish solidarity with their government .
instead , she affirmed , political sanctions must be imposed .
in negotiations and contractual relationships with iran , the west must “ constantly insist upon the preservation of human rights . ” this stands for western political as well as economic delegates to iran , according to ebadi .
for example , she suggests that countries could remove their embassies from iran without completely breaking off diplomatic relations .
ebadi noted that for the last two years , the west has engaged with iran exclusively on the issue of atomic conflict .
“ one wonders whether europeans are concerned only with their own security instead of with that of iranians , ” she said .
regarding economic relations with iran , ebadi said that “ weapons and software supporting the suppression or control of iranian citizens ” should be blocked .
“ ask siemens and nokia why they have released these types of technologies in iran . ”
ebadi , who is currently staying in bonn as a guest of deutsche welle , revealed that her negotiations with high-level un officials have prompted the un to send a delegation to tehran to contribute to reporting on the situation there .
“ if the government does not permit the delegation to enter , it will prove that protestors ’ grievances are representative of the truth , ” according to ebadi .
the human-rights advocate also pointed out that the number of victims during the most recent protests is much higher than officially reported .
she said the brutality and violence on behalf of the government continues as the militias stand under supervision from the revolutionary guard .
ebadi noted that the number of people arrested is also very high and includes some of her colleagues .
recently , for example , the attorneys abdolfatah sultani and mohammad ali dadkhah , two prominent figures in the coalition for the defense of human rights , were arrested . the organization is headed by ebadi .
the nobel prize winner further explained that the head of the iranian judiciary had , “ under political pressure , ” issued a regulation whereby attorneys can lose their licenses to practice at any time .
“ this regulation discouraged lawyers from defending political prisoners and others whose opinions conflict with the government ’ s position . ”
according to ebadi , many prisoners have been isolated and prevented from contacting their families or attorneys .
ebadi , who emphasized that she has no close personal relationship with any of the presidential candidates , commented on further developments in iran as follows : “ increasing criticism from influential spiritual leaders will lead the government to become weaker and lose its legitimacy . ”
she noted that the protests will continue and that the populace is creative and has found new forms of protest .
for example , calling “ god is great ” from one ’ s windows or roof in the evening has established itself as a new form of protest , while mourning mothers meet regularly to engage in sit-ins .
ebadi herself will remain in europe for the time being in order to campaign for human rights in iran .
thereafter , she will “ most certainly ” return to her homeland .

she added that iranians are dependent upon support from outside the country in their current “ and very sensitive state of emergency . ”
the government ’ s actions “ aren ’ t compatible with the iranian constitution , nor with islam , nor with human rights . ”
she claimed that the protests would continue in new ways and that criticism from iranian religious leaders will weaken the new government even more .
the nobel prize winner appealed to germany and europe to put more political pressure on the iranian government .
“ i am against economic sanctions and military interventions , ” declared ebadi , explaining that both are introduced at the cost of the iranian people .
she added that this , in turn , creates new battle fronts and leads people to establish solidarity with their government .
instead , she affirmed , political sanctions must be imposed .
in negotiations and contractual relationships with iran , the west must “ constantly insist upon the preservation of human rights . ” this stands for western political as well as economic delegates to iran , according to ebadi .
for example , she suggests that countries could remove their embassies from iran without completely breaking off diplomatic relations .
ebadi noted that for the last two years , the west has engaged with iran exclusively on the issue of atomic conflict .
“ one wonders whether europeans are concerned only with their own security instead of with that of iranians , ” she said .
regarding economic relations with iran , ebadi said that “ weapons and software supporting the suppression or control of iranian citizens ” should be blocked .
“ ask siemens and nokia why they have released these types of technologies in iran . ”
ebadi , who is currently staying in bonn as a guest of deutsche welle , revealed that her negotiations with high-level un officials have prompted the un to send a delegation to tehran to contribute to reporting on the situation there .
“ if the government does not permit the delegation to enter , it will prove that protestors ’ grievances are representative of the truth , ” according to ebadi .
the human-rights advocate also pointed out that the number of victims during the most recent protests is much higher than officially reported .
she said the brutality and violence on behalf of the government continues as the militias stand under supervision from the revolutionary guard .
ebadi noted that the number of people arrested is also very high and includes some of her colleagues .
recently , for example , the attorneys abdolfatah sultani and mohammad ali dadkhah , two prominent figures in the coalition for the defense of human rights , were arrested . the organization is headed by ebadi .
the nobel prize winner further explained that the head of the iranian judiciary had , “ under political pressure , ” issued a regulation whereby attorneys can lose their licenses to practice at any time .
“ this regulation discouraged lawyers from defending political prisoners and others whose opinions conflict with the government ’ s position . ”
according to ebadi , many prisoners have been isolated and prevented from contacting their families or attorneys .
ebadi , who emphasized that she has no close personal relationship with any of the presidential candidates , commented on further developments in iran as follows : “ increasing criticism from influential spiritual leaders will lead the government to become weaker and lose its legitimacy . ”
she noted that the protests will continue and that the populace is creative and has found new forms of protest .
for example , calling “ god is great ” from one ’ s windows or roof in the evening has established itself as a new form of protest , while mourning mothers meet regularly to engage in sit-ins .
ebadi herself will remain in europe for the time being in order to campaign for human rights in iran .
thereafter , she will “ most certainly ” return to her homeland .

the new rules are intended to prevent future financial collapse . analysts say the meltdown of the financial system , which has led to the worst recession in over 60 years , was due in part to banks ' inability to assess the risk level of some of their investments .
if the proposal becomes law - which requires the approval from the eu parliament and the 27 eu governments - banks would have to demonstrate that they fully understood the risks involved when making an investment , especially in the case of highly-complex " re-securitization " investments .
banks that encouraged staff to take too much risk by offering bonuses could face sanctions .
in addition , the proposal calls for banks to keep more money and assets on hand to cover any potential losses if the value of an investment were to significantly deflate . " the proposal aims to ensure that banks hold enough capital to reflect the true risks they are taking , " european commission chief jose manuel barroso said in a statement .
he added that the plan would " legally oblige banks and investment firms to have remuneration policies consistent with effective risk management . "
the european banking federation said that the banks had anticipated the changes and were not surprised by monday 's announcement .
" what we do n't want is a supervisory authority to determine the level or form of remuneration , " an ebf spokeswoman said .
" we also insist that the new rules in terms of remuneration are international .
we want a level playing field . "
the new rules are not likely to take effect until the end of 2011 , and therefore , are not meant to address the current financial crisis .

the new rules are intended to prevent future financial collapse . analysts say the meltdown of the financial system , which has led to the worst recession in over 60 years , was due in part to banks ' inability to assess the risk level of some of their investments .
if the proposal becomes law - which requires the approval from the eu parliament and the 27 eu governments - banks would have to demonstrate that they fully understood the risks involved when making an investment , especially in the case of highly-complex " re-securitization " investments .
banks that encouraged staff to take too much risk by offering bonuses could face sanctions .
in addition , the proposal calls for banks to keep more money and assets on hand to cover any potential losses if the value of an investment were to significantly deflate . " the proposal aims to ensure that banks hold enough capital to reflect the true risks they are taking , " european commission chief jose manuel barroso said in a statement .
he added that the plan would " legally oblige banks and investment firms to have remuneration policies consistent with effective risk management . "
the european banking federation said that the banks had anticipated the changes and were not surprised by monday 's announcement .
" what we do n't want is a supervisory authority to determine the level or form of remuneration , " an ebf spokeswoman said .
" we also insist that the new rules in terms of remuneration are international .
we want a level playing field . "
the new rules are not likely to take effect until the end of 2011 , and therefore , are not meant to address the current financial crisis .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 13.07.2009 eu , turkey sign europe gas pipeline deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new pipeline is to bypass russia on its way to austria turkey and four european union countries have signed an agreement to construct a long-planned 3,300-kilometer -lrb- 2,000 miles -rrb- nabucco pipeline to reduce europe 's reliance on russian gas . the prime ministers of turkey , austria , bulgaria , romania and hungary signed the deal in ankara on monday to allow the nabucco pipeline to cross their countries .
turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan said the deal was a " historic moment . "
the pipeline is expected to pump as much as 31 billion cubic meters from the caspian sea to austria via turkey and the balkans , bypassing russia , in what is seen as a bid by the eu to wean itself off its dependency on moscow 's supplies .
europe has suffered from almost annual spats between russia and its transit countries , specifically ukraine , which have left some eu countries with drastically reduced oil and gas supplies , sometimes in the depths of winter .
the nabucco line is expected to be the first move away from the russian supply line and is seen as a rival to russia 's south stream project .
that project has been developed by russian gas giant gazprom and italy 's eni , which will channel russian gas through bulgaria to western europe under the black sea .
the nabucco pipeline is meant to become operational in 2014 and estimated to cost 7.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 10.9 billion -rrb- .
two european banks have expressed readiness to support the project financially , but analysts say securing the funds could be difficult amid the global economic slowdown , and point out that there 's uncertainty as to who the main suppliers will be .
" even if the necessary financing is found after some delay , there is still the big question of procurement " of gas , said necdet pamir , a turkish energy expert .
but the project appeared to get a boost friday when turkmenistan 's president gurbanguly berdymukhamedov said his country was prepared to supply nabucco with gas .
turkmenistan steps in as potential supplier bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe looks for alternatives to unreliable sources geologists have determined that the central asian country has enough natural gas to become involved in the supply of gas to europe , president berdymukhamedov told parliament , according to a report by the ria novosti news agency .
according to berdymukhamedov , turkmenistan has " a surplus of natural gas " that can be sold abroad .
local geologists had confirmed " colossal " natural gas reserves , he said .
official reports said turkmenistan 's caspian sea region had around 6 trillion cubic meters of gas .
in april , the government in ashgabat and german energy giant rwe signed an agreement for the exploration of the gas fields .
in may , turkmenistan and two other potential suppliers , kazakhstan and uzbekistan , held off their support to the pipeline at a meeting in prague .
" without these three countries , azerbaijan will be the main provider , but it does not have sufficient gas for this project , " turkish energy expert necdet pamir explained .
he estimated that baku could provide only about 4.0 billion cubic meters of gas a year to nabucco after fulfilling its existing export commitments .
" this amount will not satisfy anyone , " pamir said .
azerbaijan claims it has the capacity to supply nabucco , but last month it signed an agreement to export gas to russia starting in 2010 , raising concerns among nabucco proponents .
iraq , iran and egypt are also seen as potential providers , although pamir described their participation as " not credible . "
turkey sees boost to pipeline credibility and eu hopes bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister erdogan hosted the meeting to sign the pipeline agreement a turkish foreign ministry official argued that the signing of the intergovernmental agreement would " serve to boost credibility in the nabucco project and will lead gas suppliers to think seriously about the pipeline . "
the signing of the agreement has been delayed several times by turkey 's demands to use 15 percent of the gas flowing through nabucco for domestic use or even for re-export .
" it is normal for turkey to protect its interests in such a project , " a turkish diplomat told afp on condition of anonymity , without specifying whether ankara 's demand had been accepted or not .
" further negotiations will be held in the future with the interested parties , " he added .
the turkish foreign ministry said this week that the nabucco project was a top priority which it hoped would strengthen ankara 's ties with the eu .

turkmenistan steps in as potential supplier bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe looks for alternatives to unreliable sources geologists have determined that the central asian country has enough natural gas to become involved in the supply of gas to europe , president berdymukhamedov told parliament , according to a report by the ria novosti news agency .
according to berdymukhamedov , turkmenistan has " a surplus of natural gas " that can be sold abroad .
local geologists had confirmed " colossal " natural gas reserves , he said .
official reports said turkmenistan 's caspian sea region had around 6 trillion cubic meters of gas .
in april , the government in ashgabat and german energy giant rwe signed an agreement for the exploration of the gas fields .
in may , turkmenistan and two other potential suppliers , kazakhstan and uzbekistan , held off their support to the pipeline at a meeting in prague .
" without these three countries , azerbaijan will be the main provider , but it does not have sufficient gas for this project , " turkish energy expert necdet pamir explained .
he estimated that baku could provide only about 4.0 billion cubic meters of gas a year to nabucco after fulfilling its existing export commitments .
" this amount will not satisfy anyone , " pamir said .
azerbaijan claims it has the capacity to supply nabucco , but last month it signed an agreement to export gas to russia starting in 2010 , raising concerns among nabucco proponents .
iraq , iran and egypt are also seen as potential providers , although pamir described their participation as " not credible . "
turkey sees boost to pipeline credibility and eu hopes bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister erdogan hosted the meeting to sign the pipeline agreement a turkish foreign ministry official argued that the signing of the intergovernmental agreement would " serve to boost credibility in the nabucco project and will lead gas suppliers to think seriously about the pipeline . "
the signing of the agreement has been delayed several times by turkey 's demands to use 15 percent of the gas flowing through nabucco for domestic use or even for re-export .
" it is normal for turkey to protect its interests in such a project , " a turkish diplomat told afp on condition of anonymity , without specifying whether ankara 's demand had been accepted or not .

turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan said the deal was a " historic moment . "
the pipeline is expected to pump as much as 31 billion cubic meters from the caspian sea to austria via turkey and the balkans , bypassing russia , in what is seen as a bid by the eu to wean itself off its dependency on moscow 's supplies .
europe has suffered from almost annual spats between russia and its transit countries , specifically ukraine , which have left some eu countries with drastically reduced oil and gas supplies , sometimes in the depths of winter .
the nabucco line is expected to be the first move away from the russian supply line and is seen as a rival to russia 's south stream project .
that project has been developed by russian gas giant gazprom and italy 's eni , which will channel russian gas through bulgaria to western europe under the black sea .
the nabucco pipeline is meant to become operational in 2014 and estimated to cost 7.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 10.9 billion -rrb- .
two european banks have expressed readiness to support the project financially , but analysts say securing the funds could be difficult amid the global economic slowdown , and point out that there 's uncertainty as to who the main suppliers will be .

the 47-year-old diamond trader was sentenced to eight years in jail for actively supporting the terrorist group . prosecutors said aleem n. supported al-qaeda for years , raising money , distributing propaganda material and recruiting new members .
he is thought to be a key figure for the organization 's german operations .
the german man of pakistani descent was arrested in february of last year on allegations that he belonged to the terrorist group .
investigators say that in the summer of 2004 , he became part of the inner sanctum of the organization and received orders to recruit new members and supporters in germany .
investigators believe that by 2007 , aleem n. had sent four young fighters - together with letters of recommendation - to be trained in terror camps .
one of them is believed to be a bonn-based man , who appeared in an anti-german terrorist video earlier this year .
the defence had called for aleem n. to be acquitted. tkw / dpa / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she is a lawyer , who gained entrance to the faculty of law at tehran university in 1965 . in 1975 she became the first woman in the history of iran 's justice system , to be made the president of bench 24 of the tehran city court .
she then set up her own practice after receiving her lawyer 's license in 1992 .
ebadi has written several books and many of her articles have been published in iranian journals .
one of the most talked about topics in the world right now is the disputed iranian presidential election .
do you believe the vote was fair ?
with their street protests , iranians have shown that they do not accept the announced results of the election which they believe was rigged .
you have also said that a new election will take place .
do you believe this will make any difference ?
the iranian people have called for a new election . and it is also my belief that these new elections should take place under the supervision of the united nations .
otherwise these disputes will continue and the people will again protest against election manipulation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2003 nobel peace prize winner 's visit generated a lot of media attention the scale of protests in iran and the reaction of the police indicate that the government was guilty .
if the elections were fair , as the government claims , why was there such a strong presence of security forces in the streets ?
that is a good question .
what happened in iran is an obvious human rights violation .
when the iranian people demonstrated peacefully , there were no problems – not even a window was broken .
but towards the end of the demonstrations shots were fired from office buildings .
some died and many more were injured .
that was the beginning of the state 's crackdown .
that night at 3 a.m. , a student residence was attacked , five students were shot dead and several were injured . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ebadi meets deutsche welle 's director-general , erik bettermann can other countries or institutions such as the united nations make a difference , or is it up to the iranian people now ?
first and foremost it is iranians who are fighting for their rights .
this movement , which has in the meantime turned into a national movement , was created by the iranian people .
president mahmoud ahmadinejad and the iranian government have said that the west is to blame for the protests in iran . what ahmadinejad has said is a major insult .
it is not true and in no way reflects the truth .
this is a pure national protest movement formed by the iranian people .
have these protests had any impact on the human rights situation ?
the movement started completely peacefully which shows the political maturity of the iranian people .
sadly , the people got a violent response to their peaceful movement .
when you give interviews like today , does it cause problems for you in iran ?
that 's not that important to me .
i consider this a task that has to be done .
will you go back to iran ?
of course i will return .
i have my husband , family and my house in iran .
and after i have finished my job here , i will go back .

she is a lawyer , who gained entrance to the faculty of law at tehran university in 1965 . in 1975 she became the first woman in the history of iran 's justice system , to be made the president of bench 24 of the tehran city court .
she then set up her own practice after receiving her lawyer 's license in 1992 .
ebadi has written several books and many of her articles have been published in iranian journals .
one of the most talked about topics in the world right now is the disputed iranian presidential election .
do you believe the vote was fair ?
with their street protests , iranians have shown that they do not accept the announced results of the election which they believe was rigged .
you have also said that a new election will take place .
do you believe this will make any difference ?
the iranian people have called for a new election . and it is also my belief that these new elections should take place under the supervision of the united nations .
otherwise these disputes will continue and the people will again protest against election manipulation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2003 nobel peace prize winner 's visit generated a lot of media attention the scale of protests in iran and the reaction of the police indicate that the government was guilty .
if the elections were fair , as the government claims , why was there such a strong presence of security forces in the streets ?
that is a good question .
what happened in iran is an obvious human rights violation .
when the iranian people demonstrated peacefully , there were no problems – not even a window was broken .
but towards the end of the demonstrations shots were fired from office buildings .
some died and many more were injured .
that was the beginning of the state 's crackdown .
that night at 3 a.m. , a student residence was attacked , five students were shot dead and several were injured . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ebadi meets deutsche welle 's director-general , erik bettermann can other countries or institutions such as the united nations make a difference , or is it up to the iranian people now ?
first and foremost it is iranians who are fighting for their rights .
this movement , which has in the meantime turned into a national movement , was created by the iranian people .
president mahmoud ahmadinejad and the iranian government have said that the west is to blame for the protests in iran . what ahmadinejad has said is a major insult .
it is not true and in no way reflects the truth .
this is a pure national protest movement formed by the iranian people .
have these protests had any impact on the human rights situation ?
the movement started completely peacefully which shows the political maturity of the iranian people .
sadly , the people got a violent response to their peaceful movement .
when you give interviews like today , does it cause problems for you in iran ?
that 's not that important to me .
i consider this a task that has to be done .
will you go back to iran ?
of course i will return .
i have my husband , family and my house in iran .
and after i have finished my job here , i will go back .

it marks the highest rate since the eu currency was introduced in 2002 . a statement released by the ecb said " a total of 413,000 counterfeit euro banknotes were withdrawn from circulation , " in the first half of 2009 .
it added that in the main , those bills originated from the same places as previously seized forgeries , meaning no new counterfeit sources had been found .
although the increase is high , the european central bank also said it was important to consider the number of genuine banknotes - some 12.5 billion - in circulation during the same timeframe .
in germany , the number of fakes rose in keeping with the overall figure , costing the economy 1.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.23 billion -rrb- .
but the federal bank said that was an improvement of some 100,000 euros over the last six months of 2008 .
it attributed the drop to the fact that the majority of notes seized between january and june of 2009 were of relatively small denominations .
twenty and fifty euro notes made up almost fifty percent of the total number largely recovered from across the 16 nations which use the common currency .

it marks the highest rate since the eu currency was introduced in 2002 . a statement released by the ecb said " a total of 413,000 counterfeit euro banknotes were withdrawn from circulation , " in the first half of 2009 .
it added that in the main , those bills originated from the same places as previously seized forgeries , meaning no new counterfeit sources had been found .
although the increase is high , the european central bank also said it was important to consider the number of genuine banknotes - some 12.5 billion - in circulation during the same timeframe .
in germany , the number of fakes rose in keeping with the overall figure , costing the economy 1.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.23 billion -rrb- .
but the federal bank said that was an improvement of some 100,000 euros over the last six months of 2008 .
it attributed the drop to the fact that the majority of notes seized between january and june of 2009 were of relatively small denominations .
twenty and fifty euro notes made up almost fifty percent of the total number largely recovered from across the 16 nations which use the common currency .

" today we have taken a step forward -lrb- towards the project 's realization -rrb- , " said nikolaus von bomhard , head of munich re , which hosted the signing .
the firms grouped under the desertec industrial initiative -lrb- dii -rrb- plan to build solar power generators in north africa and the middle east .
the massive project will see investments of up to 400 billion euros over a period of 40 years .
" of course it is still a long way off , but the enormous interest in the scheme shows we are on the right path , " a spokesman for munich re said .
a study suggests that with the use of thermal power plants and high voltage direct current transmission lines , desertec 's pioneering foray into the desert could meet 15 percent of europe 's electricity needs by the year 2050 .

" within six hours deserts receive more energy from the sun than humankind consumes within a year , " he said adding that the " time appears right for a truly comprehensive maneuver to combat climate change . "
firms hope project will help combat climate change other companies involved in the venture are the spanish firm abengoa solar and the algerian conglomerate cevital as well as several german banks and engineering companies .
under the agreement , a desertec study office to be established by october will have three years to detail investment plans to create the network of solar farms .

munich re board member torsten jeworrek said the european companies involved had pledged to work " as equals in a sincere and fair " manner with the producer countries .
" if we 're successful , we 'll make a huge contribution to the fight against climate change , " jeworrek said .
environmental organization greenpeace has welcomed the initiative and urged the german government to support it by channelling research funds earmarked for nuclear energy to the solar energy project .
critics slam huge costs but critics of the desertec project have warned that the political situation in many of the producer countries in north africa is unstable .

he also said he preferred a network of decentralized operators that produced renewable energy from many sources rather than having one key project in the hands of major corporations .

heads of state and government from 43 european union and the mediterranean-rim countries had accepted an invitation to paris extended by french president nicolas sarkozy to give new impetus to mediterranean cooperation .
the union for the mediterranean follows up on the barcelona process , initiated in 1995 , which also had a pronounced security dimension . ultimately , the union for the mediterranean set itself a six-point agenda , among others the " mediterranean solar plan . "
the recent gaza war has upset these plans .
no high-ranking ministerial meetings have taken place since december 2008 , and some important issues dealing with the institutional design of the union have been shelved . similar to the constraints imposed on the baltic sea co-operation of the 1970s -lrb- due to the east-west conflict -rrb- , it would be recommendable for the union for the mediterranean to put high politics as well as security issues aside and focus on economic matters and the protection of the environment and the climate .
against this backdrop , can it be mere coincidence that it was precisely for july 13 that the munich re group issued invitations for the inaugural meeting of the so-called " desertec initiative " in munich ? energy security based on solar thermal power plants ? bildunterschrift : the desertec project aims to feed solar power from africa and the middle east to the eu while the idea behind the desertec project is nothing new , it is still fascinating : solar thermal power plants in northern africa would contribute to supplying europe with the clean energy it needs .
a total of roughly 400 billion euros in investments would be needed by the year 2050 to cover 15 percent of europe 's electricity needs .
so is the - privately financed - desertec consortium set to get the better of the european mediterranean solar plan , or indeed to replace it ? to start with the good news : the technology needed to generate solar thermal power , known as concentrated solar power -lrb- csp -rrb- , is already available , as are the high-voltage , direct current -lrb- hvdc -rrb- electric power transmission lines required to transport it .
in kramer junction , california , the first parabolic trough power plants have been connected to the grid since the mid-1980s .
more advanced csp power plants have been built in the united states and spain and are already several years old .
another csp plant , an integrated solar combined cycle plant -lrb- iscc -rrb- , is currently under construction in kuraymat , egypt .
parabolic trough power plants are already in the planning stages in some other countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german companies lead the field in concentrated solar power technology another piece of good news - at least from the german perspective - is that german companies lead the field when it comes to csp technology .
the parabolic mirrors are built by flabeg , the receivers by schott solar , the turbines , generators and control technology are available from siemens , and solar millennium and man ferrostaal operate as general contractors . looking for safe locations for solar plants is the only task remaining to secure the financing for the desertec initiative and to integrate it politically into the union for the mediterranean ?
not quite .
it will not prove so easy to enlist the southern mediterranean-rim countries as potential locations for power plants .
many of these countries are ruled by authoritarian regimes of different stripes , and there is an ever-present danger in the region of terrorist attacks .
population growth and unemployment are also very high in this part of the world , and such social problems are aggravated by migration pressure from sub-saharan africa .
all in all , an explosive mix , with important implications for our security as well . most of the non-eu mediterranean-rim countries have major development needs .
one prerequisite for development is energy .
however , most of the power plants currently in operation there are conventional , carbon-based plants .
in times of an accelerated climate change that has the gravest of implications for developing and transition countries , the latter need to switch their energy supply , as early as possible , to a non-conventional energy path , and that means , in effect , to renewable energy sources . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. stefan gaenzle is an expert on multilateral development cooperation with die large-scale solar thermal power plants may offer one solution to the problem .
even though energy production costs - 15 euros to 23 euro cents per kilowatt hour - are still higher than those for conventional power plants .
it would be possible -based , for example , on the model of the german renewable energy law - to close the viability gap either by raising the feed-in tariff for renewable electricity -lrb- to be paid by the end user -rrb- or by having government set ambitious quotas for the share of renewably generated electricity as a means of attracting investments in csp plants .
the important thing is to set clear-cut framework conditions for electricity sales in countries with the potential to operate csp plants , in this way ensuring that the billions that need to be invested will pay off in the long term for private investors . grid development as a pan-european task some successes in economic transformation have already been observed in the context of the euro-mediterranean partnership , in tunisia for instance , although there has been less movement when it comes to political change .
be that as it may , though , the union for the mediterranean does offer a dynamic normative frame of reference for the southern mediterranean-rim countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias ruchser is an energy consultant and head of media and public relations at die however , the eu 's tasks in the framework of the union for the mediterranean should not be to offset the financial risk for private-sector projects like the desertec initiative .
this , though , may be a different matter when it comes to support for the development and expansion of the power grid in the overall mediterranean region .
grid development must be viewed under the aspect of public welfare , and here the eu could provide an important contribution to collective energy security in the mediterranean region , one that would entail a security dividend over the longer term . to put it in a nutshell : renewable energy sources promote development , and development promotes security .

even though energy production costs - 15 euros to 23 euro cents per kilowatt hour - are still higher than those for conventional power plants .
it would be possible -based , for example , on the model of the german renewable energy law - to close the viability gap either by raising the feed-in tariff for renewable electricity -lrb- to be paid by the end user -rrb- or by having government set ambitious quotas for the share of renewably generated electricity as a means of attracting investments in csp plants .

heads of state and government from 43 european union and the mediterranean-rim countries had accepted an invitation to paris extended by french president nicolas sarkozy to give new impetus to mediterranean cooperation .
the union for the mediterranean follows up on the barcelona process , initiated in 1995 , which also had a pronounced security dimension . ultimately , the union for the mediterranean set itself a six-point agenda , among others the " mediterranean solar plan . "
the recent gaza war has upset these plans .
no high-ranking ministerial meetings have taken place since december 2008 , and some important issues dealing with the institutional design of the union have been shelved . similar to the constraints imposed on the baltic sea co-operation of the 1970s -lrb- due to the east-west conflict -rrb- , it would be recommendable for the union for the mediterranean to put high politics as well as security issues aside and focus on economic matters and the protection of the environment and the climate .
against this backdrop , can it be mere coincidence that it was precisely for july 13 that the munich re group issued invitations for the inaugural meeting of the so-called " desertec initiative " in munich ? energy security based on solar thermal power plants ? bildunterschrift : the desertec project aims to feed solar power from africa and the middle east to the eu while the idea behind the desertec project is nothing new , it is still fascinating : solar thermal power plants in northern africa would contribute to supplying europe with the clean energy it needs .
a total of roughly 400 billion euros in investments would be needed by the year 2050 to cover 15 percent of europe 's electricity needs .
so is the - privately financed - desertec consortium set to get the better of the european mediterranean solar plan , or indeed to replace it ? to start with the good news : the technology needed to generate solar thermal power , known as concentrated solar power -lrb- csp -rrb- , is already available , as are the high-voltage , direct current -lrb- hvdc -rrb- electric power transmission lines required to transport it .
in kramer junction , california , the first parabolic trough power plants have been connected to the grid since the mid-1980s .

the original eau de cologne , survived wars and imitations and still sells well in a market saturated with modern scents . the first bottle of eau de cologne was created by giovanni maria farina , an italian expatriate living in the eastern german city of cologne .
on july 13 , 1709 , farina opened a luxury goods shop where the fragrance was sold . in a letter to his brother dated in 1709 , farina wrote , " i have discovered a scent that reminds me of an italian spring morning , of daffodils and orange blossoms after the rain . "
he named it after the city he lived in . over the course of the last three centuries , only 30 people have been privy to the secret recipe - including johann maria farina , a descendant of the perfumer and the company 's current managing director . " it 's crucial that the original eau de cologne always smells the same , " said farina .
" like champagne that 's made from many different wines and has a specific taste or aroma . " an eau de cologne differs from a so-called eau de toilette in that it has a smaller concentration of essential oils , which give the solution its scent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the original eau de cologne was a top seller in giovanni maria farina 's luxury shop napoleon allegedly used one vial of the valuable liquid each day .
a vial cost a week 's wages for a master craftsman - or well over 1,000 euros -lrb- $ 1,400 -rrb- in today 's money - making the perfume only accessible to the extremely wealthy . but the hefty price tag did n't always mean big earnings for farina 's company . " there were many crises , " said the firm 's current managing director .
" the french revolution and the first and second world wars were the biggest crises for us - not because our customers could n't pay but because we were cut off from the raw materials and could n't produce . " a respected imitation in addition to political conflicts , the original eau de cologne has also had to deal with stiff competition from a popular imitation : 4711 . in the 18th century , the muehlens , a merchant family from cologne , produced a citrus-based scent similar to the original eau de cologne , calling it by the house number of the factory on glockengasse in downtown cologne .
while 4711 is known around the world - and boasts an over 200-year history - it 's not the original . in 1994 , the muehlens family sold its company to the german wella corporation .
it was then acquired by procter and gamble in 2003 and returned to german hands in 2007 , when the company was bought by maeurer und wirtz , best known for its perfume brand tabac original . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 4711 has a large following of its own while farina 's eau de cologne may be the true original , 4711 has always been the more commercially successful scent . it is marketed in 75 countries today and is especially popular with the older generation of germans .
the fragrance also sells well in japan , where men perfume their hair with it . farina , however , said there are no bad feelings between his family and the muehlens , the founders of 4711 . " i once had a dance class with a daughter of ferdinand muehlens and know the others as well , " said farina .
" there have never been any problems between the two families .

on july 13 , 1709 , farina opened a luxury goods shop where the fragrance was sold . in a letter to his brother dated in 1709 , farina wrote , " i have discovered a scent that reminds me of an italian spring morning , of daffodils and orange blossoms after the rain . "
he named it after the city he lived in . over the course of the last three centuries , only 30 people have been privy to the secret recipe - including johann maria farina , a descendant of the perfumer and the company 's current managing director . " it 's crucial that the original eau de cologne always smells the same , " said farina .
" like champagne that 's made from many different wines and has a specific taste or aroma . " an eau de cologne differs from a so-called eau de toilette in that it has a smaller concentration of essential oils , which give the solution its scent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the original eau de cologne was a top seller in giovanni maria farina 's luxury shop napoleon allegedly used one vial of the valuable liquid each day .
a vial cost a week 's wages for a master craftsman - or well over 1,000 euros -lrb- $ 1,400 -rrb- in today 's money - making the perfume only accessible to the extremely wealthy . but the hefty price tag did n't always mean big earnings for farina 's company . " there were many crises , " said the firm 's current managing director .
" the french revolution and the first and second world wars were the biggest crises for us - not because our customers could n't pay but because we were cut off from the raw materials and could n't produce . " a respected imitation in addition to political conflicts , the original eau de cologne has also had to deal with stiff competition from a popular imitation : 4711 . in the 18th century , the muehlens , a merchant family from cologne , produced a citrus-based scent similar to the original eau de cologne , calling it by the house number of the factory on glockengasse in downtown cologne .
while 4711 is known around the world - and boasts an over 200-year history - it 's not the original . in 1994 , the muehlens family sold its company to the german wella corporation .
it was then acquired by procter and gamble in 2003 and returned to german hands in 2007 , when the company was bought by maeurer und wirtz , best known for its perfume brand tabac original . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 4711 has a large following of its own while farina 's eau de cologne may be the true original , 4711 has always been the more commercially successful scent . it is marketed in 75 countries today and is especially popular with the older generation of germans .
the fragrance also sells well in japan , where men perfume their hair with it . farina , however , said there are no bad feelings between his family and the muehlens , the founders of 4711 . " i once had a dance class with a daughter of ferdinand muehlens and know the others as well , " said farina .
" there have never been any problems between the two families .

it demonstrates how they have expanded their grip in vast swathes of the state and beyond .
the security establishment in new delhi is shaken by the assault and is re-examining the government 's approach to left-wing extremism . sunday saw the biggest single casualty inflicted by the maoists so far in 2009 but there have already been over a thousand such attacks in india ’ s nine maoist-hit states this year .
according to the indian home ministry , at least 450 people were killed by the maoists in the first six months of this year , with chhattisgarh alone accounting for about a third .
during the general elections in may , trains were hijacked and 17 people were murdered , including election officials .
“ there are incidents taking place in chhattisgarh , in jharkhand , orissa , some incidents in bihar , maharashtra and andhra pradesh .
but the two states that are worst affected are chhattisgarh and jharkhand , ” explained former home minister shivraj patil .
decade-long conflict claiming to be fighting for the rights of landless peasants and labourers in rural areas left behind by india 's rapid economic growth , the maoists , who don ’ t number more than 10,000 , have waged their war for over a decade now .
on monday , chhattisgarh chief minister raman singh put on a brave face .
“ the time has now come to take the fight to the maoists ' camp , ” he said .
“ our fight is carrying on and we have also suffered a lot .
but this will not bring down our confidence .
we will take the fight in a decisive direction . ”
in recent years , the government has tried hard to follow an integrated approach of dovetailing policing with development work .
it has implemented a range of schemes through different ministries .
threat to democracy and economic progress but the approach does not appear to have worked .
despite the setting up of counter insurgency and anti-terrorism -lrb- ciat -rrb- schools , the sharing of intelligence between affected states and the improvement of inter-state coordination by the union government , the rebels still seem to have an upper hand .
the maoist insurgency threatens to disrupt the democratic process in several states , as well as hinder economic progress .
m r narayana swami , a close watcher of the maoists ’ activities , thinks they have achieved moderate success in their aims : “ they have caused immense financial losses to the industry and government by disrupting rail traffic in states , which are economically very active and in fact the losses amount to billions of rupees and that is a point to be noted . ”
disturbing pattern senior intelligence officials have found a disturbing pattern to attacks against the police , especially in chhattisgarh and jharkhand .
while rushing in reinforcements to thickly forested areas , police personnel seem to ignore the fact that vast tracts of terrain are heavily booby-trapped with improvised explosive devices -lrb- ieds -rrb- .
having a distinct advantage of the topography of these tracts , the rebels lie quietly in wait and trigger these devices , which often results in huge casualties of security personnel .
last month , the indian security forces captured a key maoist stronghold in west bengal after battling through landmines and gunfire with the rebels .
new delhi then formally banned the maoists , designating them officially as a terrorist organisation .
the government is now expected to call another meeting of the chief ministers of the maoist affected states to review their approach before mounting a serious offensive against the insurgent group .

she added that iranians are dependent upon support from outside the country in their current “ and very sensitive state of emergency . ”
the government ’ s actions “ aren ’ t compatible with the iranian constitution , nor with islam , nor with human rights . ”
she claimed that the protests would continue in new ways and that criticism from iranian religious leaders will weaken the new government even more .
the nobel prize winner appealed to germany and europe to put more political pressure on the iranian government .
“ i am against economic sanctions and military interventions , ” declared ebadi , explaining that both are introduced at the cost of the iranian people .
she added that this , in turn , creates new battle fronts and leads people to establish solidarity with their government .
instead , she affirmed , political sanctions must be imposed .
in negotiations and contractual relationships with iran , the west must “ constantly insist upon the preservation of human rights . ” this stands for western political as well as economic delegates to iran , according to ebadi .
for example , she suggests that countries could remove their embassies from iran without completely breaking off diplomatic relations .
ebadi noted that for the last two years , the west has engaged with iran exclusively on the issue of atomic conflict .
“ one wonders whether europeans are concerned only with their own security instead of with that of iranians , ” she said .
regarding economic relations with iran , ebadi said that “ weapons and software supporting the suppression or control of iranian citizens ” should be blocked .
“ ask siemens and nokia why they have released these types of technologies in iran . ”
ebadi , who is currently staying in bonn as a guest of deutsche welle , revealed that her negotiations with high-level un officials have prompted the un to send a delegation to tehran to contribute to reporting on the situation there .
“ if the government does not permit the delegation to enter , it will prove that protestors ’ grievances are representative of the truth , ” according to ebadi .
the human-rights advocate also pointed out that the number of victims during the most recent protests is much higher than officially reported .
she said the brutality and violence on behalf of the government continues as the militias stand under supervision from the revolutionary guard .
ebadi noted that the number of people arrested is also very high and includes some of her colleagues .
recently , for example , the attorneys abdolfatah sultani and mohammad ali dadkhah , two prominent figures in the coalition for the defense of human rights , were arrested . the organization is headed by ebadi .
the nobel prize winner further explained that the head of the iranian judiciary had , “ under political pressure , ” issued a regulation whereby attorneys can lose their licenses to practice at any time .
“ this regulation discouraged lawyers from defending political prisoners and others whose opinions conflict with the government ’ s position . ”
according to ebadi , many prisoners have been isolated and prevented from contacting their families or attorneys .
ebadi , who emphasized that she has no close personal relationship with any of the presidential candidates , commented on further developments in iran as follows : “ increasing criticism from influential spiritual leaders will lead the government to become weaker and lose its legitimacy . ”
she noted that the protests will continue and that the populace is creative and has found new forms of protest .
for example , calling “ god is great ” from one ’ s windows or roof in the evening has established itself as a new form of protest , while mourning mothers meet regularly to engage in sit-ins .
ebadi herself will remain in europe for the time being in order to campaign for human rights in iran .
thereafter , she will “ most certainly ” return to her homeland .

the original eau de cologne , survived wars and imitations and still sells well in a market saturated with modern scents . the first bottle of eau de cologne was created by giovanni maria farina , an italian expatriate living in the eastern german city of cologne .
on july 13 , 1709 , farina opened a luxury goods shop where the fragrance was sold . in a letter to his brother dated in 1709 , farina wrote , " i have discovered a scent that reminds me of an italian spring morning , of daffodils and orange blossoms after the rain . "
he named it after the city he lived in . over the course of the last three centuries , only 30 people have been privy to the secret recipe - including johann maria farina , a descendant of the perfumer and the company 's current managing director . " it 's crucial that the original eau de cologne always smells the same , " said farina .
" like champagne that 's made from many different wines and has a specific taste or aroma . " an eau de cologne differs from a so-called eau de toilette in that it has a smaller concentration of essential oils , which give the solution its scent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the original eau de cologne was a top seller in giovanni maria farina 's luxury shop napoleon allegedly used one vial of the valuable liquid each day .
a vial cost a week 's wages for a master craftsman - or well over 1,000 euros -lrb- $ 1,400 -rrb- in today 's money - making the perfume only accessible to the extremely wealthy . but the hefty price tag did n't always mean big earnings for farina 's company . " there were many crises , " said the firm 's current managing director .
" the french revolution and the first and second world wars were the biggest crises for us - not because our customers could n't pay but because we were cut off from the raw materials and could n't produce . " a respected imitation in addition to political conflicts , the original eau de cologne has also had to deal with stiff competition from a popular imitation : 4711 . in the 18th century , the muehlens , a merchant family from cologne , produced a citrus-based scent similar to the original eau de cologne , calling it by the house number of the factory on glockengasse in downtown cologne .
while 4711 is known around the world - and boasts an over 200-year history - it 's not the original . in 1994 , the muehlens family sold its company to the german wella corporation .
it was then acquired by procter and gamble in 2003 and returned to german hands in 2007 , when the company was bought by maeurer und wirtz , best known for its perfume brand tabac original . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 4711 has a large following of its own while farina 's eau de cologne may be the true original , 4711 has always been the more commercially successful scent . it is marketed in 75 countries today and is especially popular with the older generation of germans .
the fragrance also sells well in japan , where men perfume their hair with it . farina , however , said there are no bad feelings between his family and the muehlens , the founders of 4711 . " i once had a dance class with a daughter of ferdinand muehlens and know the others as well , " said farina .
" there have never been any problems between the two families . " today , the farina house in cologne 's old town has its very own museum , where visitors can learn more about the art of perfume making and the original koelnisch wasser - eau de cologne . author : catrin moederler -lrb- kjb / ab -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

there are no details on when the trial would begin .
the filing of charges comes 10 days after medical experts at munich 's stadelheim prison said demjanjuk was fit to stand trial as long as court sessions do not exceed two 90-minute sessions per day .
demjanjuk 's family had said the octogenarian was too frail to withstand the proceedings because he suffers from kidney disease , cancer and arthritis .
most-wanted nazi war criminal demjanjuk has denied accusations that he was a guard at the sobibor death camp in nazi-occupied poland in 1943 and helped murder jews .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a monument in sobibor in eastern poland remembers the victims at the nazi death camp he has said he was captured by the germans in ukraine while fighting for the red army and held as a prisoner of war .
until being deported to germany in may , the ukrainian-born demjanjuk had headed the list of the simon wiesenthal center 's 10 most-wanted suspected war criminals .
efraim zuroff from the simon wiesenthal centre welcomed monday 's move by german prosecutors .
" this is obviously an important step forward , " zufroff told the associated press .
" we hope that the trial itself will be expedited so that justice will be achieved and he can be given the appropriate punishment . "
" the effort to bring demjanjuk to justice sends a very powerful message that the passage of time in no way diminishes the guilt of the perpetrator . "
possibly last holocaust trial demjanjuk was deported by us authorities from his home in ohio on may 12 .
he had appealed against the deportation in a last ditch attempt to avoid facing charges but had his request rejected by a german court last week . demjanjuk 's trial is the last expected time a german court will prosecute for holocaust crimes in the country .
demjanjuk has lived in the us since 1952 .
he arrived there as a refugee and worked in the car industry in cleveland , ohio .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a former id card of demjanjuk 's with the word " sobibor " printed on it in 1988 , he was sentenced to death in israel for crimes against humanity after holocaust survivors identified him as the notorious " ivan the terrible , " a guard at the treblinka death camp .
but israel 's highest court later overturned his sentence , after documents from the former soviet union indicated that " ivan the terrible " had probably been a different man .
demjanjuk returned to the us , but in 2002 had his us citizenship revoked because of his failure to disclose his work at nazi camps when he first arrived . sp / reuters / dpa editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it marks the highest rate since the eu currency was introduced in 2002 . a statement released by the ecb said " a total of 413,000 counterfeit euro banknotes were withdrawn from circulation , " in the first half of 2009 .
it added that in the main , those bills originated from the same places as previously seized forgeries , meaning no new counterfeit sources had been found .
although the increase is high , the european central bank also said it was important to consider the number of genuine banknotes - some 12.5 billion - in circulation during the same timeframe .
in germany , the number of fakes rose in keeping with the overall figure , costing the economy 1.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.23 billion -rrb- .
but the federal bank said that was an improvement of some 100,000 euros over the last six months of 2008 .
it attributed the drop to the fact that the majority of notes seized between january and june of 2009 were of relatively small denominations .
twenty and fifty euro notes made up almost fifty percent of the total number largely recovered from across the 16 nations which use the common currency .
earlier this month , police in bulgaria and poland made several arrests in connection with the production of conterfeit cash. tkw / afp / dpa / ap editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she is a lawyer , who gained entrance to the faculty of law at tehran university in 1965 . in 1975 she became the first woman in the history of iran 's justice system , to be made the president of bench 24 of the tehran city court .
she then set up her own practice after receiving her lawyer 's license in 1992 .
ebadi has written several books and many of her articles have been published in iranian journals .
one of the most talked about topics in the world right now is the disputed iranian presidential election .
do you believe the vote was fair ?
with their street protests , iranians have shown that they do not accept the announced results of the election which they believe was rigged .
you have also said that a new election will take place .
do you believe this will make any difference ?
the iranian people have called for a new election . and it is also my belief that these new elections should take place under the supervision of the united nations .
otherwise these disputes will continue and the people will again protest against election manipulation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2003 nobel peace prize winner 's visit generated a lot of media attention the scale of protests in iran and the reaction of the police indicate that the government was guilty .
if the elections were fair , as the government claims , why was there such a strong presence of security forces in the streets ?
that is a good question .
what happened in iran is an obvious human rights violation .
when the iranian people demonstrated peacefully , there were no problems – not even a window was broken .
but towards the end of the demonstrations shots were fired from office buildings .
some died and many more were injured .
that was the beginning of the state 's crackdown .
that night at 3 a.m. , a student residence was attacked , five students were shot dead and several were injured . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ebadi meets deutsche welle 's director-general , erik bettermann can other countries or institutions such as the united nations make a difference , or is it up to the iranian people now ?
first and foremost it is iranians who are fighting for their rights .
this movement , which has in the meantime turned into a national movement , was created by the iranian people .
president mahmoud ahmadinejad and the iranian government have said that the west is to blame for the protests in iran . what ahmadinejad has said is a major insult .
it is not true and in no way reflects the truth .
this is a pure national protest movement formed by the iranian people .
have these protests had any impact on the human rights situation ?
the movement started completely peacefully which shows the political maturity of the iranian people .
sadly , the people got a violent response to their peaceful movement .
when you give interviews like today , does it cause problems for you in iran ?
that 's not that important to me .
i consider this a task that has to be done .
will you go back to iran ?
of course i will return .
i have my husband , family and my house in iran .
and after i have finished my job here , i will go back .

" we condemn such acts , wherever they take place , " said wilhelm .
the 31-year-old muslim woman , marwa al-sherbini , was killed by a russian-born german during his appeal hearing for insulting her with racist slurs , in a case that sparked anti-german demonstrations outside the german embassy in tehran over the weekend . ahmadinejad on sunday demanded the united nations impose sanctions against germany and accused the west of applying double standards when it comes to human rights . the incident was proof for of the " brutality of the german government and clear evidence for corruption in the german justice system , " said ahmadinejad . ahmadinejad added that while berlin and washington had plenty to say regarding events in tehran following iran 's presidential elections , no reaction had been registered regarding al-sherbini 's murder . " we want condemnation from the united nations security council and the imposition of sanctions , " said the iranian president . government spokesman ulrich wilhelm acknowledged the iranian president 's remarks but insisted that there was no climate that promoted such actions . he said it was now a matter for the german justice system to punish those who commit these acts . on july 1 , the pregnant egyptian woman mother of a three-year-old was stabbed 18 times in a courtroom in the eastern german city of dresden by a russian-born german , who was appealing an earlier conviction for making racist slurs against the egyptian in a children 's playground in 2008 .

norton cast products manufactured the memorial of 52 stainless steel pillars which was unveiled in london 's hyde park last week .
the company said it was proud of the work , but it and other foundries were seeing a sharp downturn in business .
some staff had been made redundant and others were working fewer hours .
managing director simon alexander said he did not know what the steel pillars were going to be used for when his firm won the commission for the project .
' worrying ' time he said some new orders had come in after the unveiling , but the next two years were still " going to be tough " .
he told bbc news : " it 's been incredibly difficult , not least because we are a family business and we feel like all the workers at norton are part of our extended family and unfortunately with the downturn in business we have had to make a number of people redundant .
" it 's a fairly familiar picture but it 's painful when it happens in your own business and furthermore we have seen further declines in business and we have had to instigate some shorter working time practices .
" we have had to put the guys on to three days and i have got to say credit to them they have been very supportive of our efforts . "
mr alexander said the company was " going great guns " and working at full capacity until the early part of the year , when orders " effectively dried up " .
dave sunderland , who has worked at the firm for three years , said the past few months had been " awful " .
he said : " it 's not just this foundry , we are all getting devastated .
it 's worrying for everybody . "
he said foundries were " all fighting for a small pot and basically that 's the problem " .

norton cast products manufactured the memorial of 52 stainless steel pillars which was unveiled in london 's hyde park last week .
the company said it was proud of the work , but it and other foundries were seeing a sharp downturn in business .
some staff had been made redundant and others were working fewer hours .
managing director simon alexander said he did not know what the steel pillars were going to be used for when his firm won the commission for the project .
' worrying ' time he said some new orders had come in after the unveiling , but the next two years were still " going to be tough " .
he told bbc news : " it 's been incredibly difficult , not least because we are a family business and we feel like all the workers at norton are part of our extended family and unfortunately with the downturn in business we have had to make a number of people redundant .
" it 's a fairly familiar picture but it 's painful when it happens in your own business and furthermore we have seen further declines in business and we have had to instigate some shorter working time practices .
saba mozakka said the memorial was " truly incredible " " we have had to put the guys on to three days and i have got to say credit to them they have been very supportive of our efforts . "
mr alexander said the company was " going great guns " and working at full capacity until the early part of the year , when orders " effectively dried up " .
dave sunderland , who has worked at the firm for three years , said the past few months had been " awful " .
he said : " it 's not just this foundry , we are all getting devastated .
it 's worrying for everybody . "
he said foundries were " all fighting for a small pot and basically that 's the problem " .
at the unveiling saba mozakka , whose mother behnaz died in the attacks , described the memorial as " truly incredible " .
members of the bereaved families group said it was a " fitting tribute " .
