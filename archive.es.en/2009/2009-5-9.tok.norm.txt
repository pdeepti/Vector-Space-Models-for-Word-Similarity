the pope met with muslim religious leaders , and members of the diplomatic corps in jordan in front of the al-hussein bin talal mosque in amman .
" often it is ideological manipulation of religion , sometimes with political goals , that is the catalyst for tensions and schisms , " the 82-year-old pontiff said .
" today muslims and christians - because of the burden of their mutual history full of misunderstandings - have to strive to be seen and recognized as believers truly loyal to the commandments . "
pope benedict failed to use the opportunity to apologise over the so-called regensburg lecture , which he gave in 2006 .

" the ancient tradition of pilgrimage to the holy places also reminds us of the inseparable bond between the church and the jewish people , " he said .
" his example reminds us that we too are part of the ageless pilgrimage of god 's people through history . "
after descending from the mountain , hundreds of people waving jordanian and vatican flags greeted benedict in the town of madaba , where he visited the greek orthodox basilica of st george , famous for its sixth century mosaic map of biblical palestine .
while in madaba , benedict blessed the cornerstone of a new catholic university being built there with help from jordan , a muslim country keen to maintain interfaith harmony .
" belief in god does not suppress the truth ; to the contrary , it encourages it , " said the former german theology professor .
" religion is disfigured when it is pressed into the service of ignorance or prejudice , contempt , violence and abuse . "

defending champions bayern munich won 3-1 against energie cottbus . gomez proved unstoppable after his first goal just 29 seconds into the game - the fastest goal of the season - when he headed in a cross from roberto hilbert .
the germany striker added his second from close range in the 20th minute , with wolfsburg 's defense in disarray .
wolfsburg hit back before halftime with edin dzeko netting his 20th goal of the season .
but gomez gave wolfsburg no chance to come back when he fired in a left-foot shot from 14 meters out in the 63rd minute on a sami khedira pass before ending his spectacular performance with another header after 77 minutes .
" i suppose the whole week everybody will be talking about me , so i am glad our next game is on wednesday -lrb- at schalke -rrb- , " gomez said .
" we now have to win our games and see if we can achieve the maximum .
but , we should n't think that just because we have now beaten the leaders , the rest will now come automatically . "
it was a second successive away defeat for wolfsburg , who lost 2-0 in cottbus two weeks ago , and comes three days after coach felix magath confirmed he would be leaving for schalke at the end of the season .
" we have lost our advantage , but we are still first , " magath said .
" i think we can still be champions .
from three games , we have two at home , and it 's important that on tuesday we find our home rhythm against dortmund . " bayern wins against cottbus defending champions bayern drew level on points with wolfsburg after a 3-1 win against relegation-threatened energie cottbus .

defending champions bayern munich won 3-1 against energie cottbus . gomez proved unstoppable after his first goal just 29 seconds into the game - the fastest goal of the season - when he headed in a cross from roberto hilbert .
the germany striker added his second from close range in the 20th minute , with wolfsburg 's defense in disarray .
wolfsburg hit back before halftime with edin dzeko netting his 20th goal of the season .
but gomez gave wolfsburg no chance to come back when he fired in a left-foot shot from 14 meters out in the 63rd minute on a sami khedira pass before ending his spectacular performance with another header after 77 minutes .
" i suppose the whole week everybody will be talking about me , so i am glad our next game is on wednesday -lrb- at schalke -rrb- , " gomez said .
" we now have to win our games and see if we can achieve the maximum .
but , we should n't think that just because we have now beaten the leaders , the rest will now come automatically . "
it was a second successive away defeat for wolfsburg , who lost 2-0 in cottbus two weeks ago , and comes three days after coach felix magath confirmed he would be leaving for schalke at the end of the season .
" we have lost our advantage , but we are still first , " magath said .
" i think we can still be champions .

the economic downturn is definitely taking its toll , but not everybody believes the german state is short of money . the german finance ministry is expecting tax revenues to drop by 48 billion euros -lrb- 64 billion us dollars -rrb- this year , according to the german daily handelsblatt .
official november estimates put tax revenues at 572 billion euros , but the handelsblatt on saturday quoted government sources as saying that only 524 billion euros are expected to reach the treasury in 2009 .
the finance ministry declined to confirm the figures on saturday , pointing to a three-day meeting in bad kreuznach where experts will gather on tuesday to draw up an official tax estimate .
" estimates are not revenues " although the terms billion , and even trillion , have been used rather inflationary in the wake of the global credit crunch , a potential 48-billion-euro shortfall is no trifling matter .
especially as forecasts expect the german economy to shrink by an estimated six percent this year .
however , such figures still have to be taken with a pinch of salt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister peer steinbrueck is against tax cuts michael jaeger , the general secretary of the taxpayers association of europe , said people should not confuse estimates with real revenues .
he pointed out that tax revenues had actually increased by about 100 billion euros over the past four years .
" the state has n't got a problem with its tax revenue .
its got a problem with expenditure , " jaeger said .
" the basic problem is that the budget is constantly blown up , while public debt increases , and in the end the taxpayer has to foot the bill . "
german finance minister peer steinbrueck has warned that estimated tax revenues could drop by up to 350 billion euros over the next four years , and in view of the economic situation , he has so far refrained from promising tax cuts ahead of september 's federal election .
" something 's wrong with the system " jaeger not only believes that lower taxes are still possible in times of economic crisis , he is also a staunch advocate of cuts to reduce the burden on the struggling taxpayer , especially since actual tax revenues for 2008 were higher than in previous years .
" it is no contradiction to save and to invest in the proper areas , and also implement tax cuts , especially for the middle class which not only creates the jobs but also bears the brunt in times of crisis , " jaeger said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german public debt is increasing at 4,439 euros per second jaeger suggested the state could cut value added tax and do away with a special tax that was introduced after german reunification to bolster the battered east , the so-called " solidaritaetszuschlag " .
" we should have decreased public debt in the days when we had a fantastic economic upturn with abundant tax revenue .
if we create new net debt despite increasing tax revenues , then something 's wrong with the system , " he said .
according to the german taxpayers ' federation -lrb- bdst -rrb- , public debt amounted to more than 1.5 trillion euros on saturday evening , that 's more than 19,000 euros per head - it is important to give the date because germany 's debts are growing at an estimated 4,439 euros per second . nk , cg ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the economic downturn is definitely taking its toll , but not everybody believes the german state is short of money . the german finance ministry is expecting tax revenues to drop by 48 billion euros -lrb- 64 billion us dollars -rrb- this year , according to the german daily handelsblatt .
official november estimates put tax revenues at 572 billion euros , but the handelsblatt on saturday quoted government sources as saying that only 524 billion euros are expected to reach the treasury in 2009 .
the finance ministry declined to confirm the figures on saturday , pointing to a three-day meeting in bad kreuznach where experts will gather on tuesday to draw up an official tax estimate .
" estimates are not revenues " although the terms billion , and even trillion , have been used rather inflationary in the wake of the global credit crunch , a potential 48-billion-euro shortfall is no trifling matter .
especially as forecasts expect the german economy to shrink by an estimated six percent this year .
however , such figures still have to be taken with a pinch of salt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister peer steinbrueck is against tax cuts michael jaeger , the general secretary of the taxpayers association of europe , said people should not confuse estimates with real revenues .
he pointed out that tax revenues had actually increased by about 100 billion euros over the past four years .
" the state has n't got a problem with its tax revenue .
its got a problem with expenditure , " jaeger said .
" the basic problem is that the budget is constantly blown up , while public debt increases , and in the end the taxpayer has to foot the bill . "
german finance minister peer steinbrueck has warned that estimated tax revenues could drop by up to 350 billion euros over the next four years , and in view of the economic situation , he has so far refrained from promising tax cuts ahead of september 's federal election .
" something 's wrong with the system " jaeger not only believes that lower taxes are still possible in times of economic crisis , he is also a staunch advocate of cuts to reduce the burden on the struggling taxpayer , especially since actual tax revenues for 2008 were higher than in previous years .
" it is no contradiction to save and to invest in the proper areas , and also implement tax cuts , especially for the middle class which not only creates the jobs but also bears the brunt in times of crisis , " jaeger said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german public debt is increasing at 4,439 euros per second jaeger suggested the state could cut value added tax and do away with a special tax that was introduced after german reunification to bolster the battered east , the so-called " solidaritaetszuschlag " .
" we should have decreased public debt in the days when we had a fantastic economic upturn with abundant tax revenue .
if we create new net debt despite increasing tax revenues , then something 's wrong with the system , " he said .
according to the german taxpayers ' federation -lrb- bdst -rrb- , public debt amounted to more than 1.5 trillion euros on saturday evening , that 's more than 19,000 euros per head - it is important to give the date because germany 's debts are growing at an estimated 4,439 euros per second . nk , cg ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the environmentalist party 's platform calls for millions of new jobs by 2013 .
the party , whose seven-year government coalition with the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- ended in 2005 , said the majority of jobs would emerge in the climate-protection sector , in particular by investing in insulation technologies for buildings and in renewable energy .
expanding childcare centers and all-day schools would create further jobs , the party said in its election manifesto .
emphasis on green issues the party , which is angling to be a junior partner in the next government , said it wants to enshrine climate change prevention as a fundamental principle in germany 's constitution .
to this end , it would seek to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to levels 40 per cent below those from 1990 .
by 2040 , all energy sources should be renewable , according to the party 's platform .
the greens are also calling for subsidies for energy efficient homes and a 120-kilometer-per-hour speed limit on german highways .

" from -lrb- us president barack -rrb- obama to un secretary general ban ki-moon , green issues are seen as the issues of the future , " party leader cem oezdemir said .
the environmentalist party 's platform calls for millions of new jobs by 2013 .
the party , whose seven-year government coalition with the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- ended in 2005 , said the majority of jobs would emerge in the climate-protection sector , in particular by investing in insulation technologies for buildings and in renewable energy .
expanding childcare centers and all-day schools would create further jobs , the party said in its election manifesto .
emphasis on green issues the party , which is angling to be a junior partner in the next government , said it wants to enshrine climate change prevention as a fundamental principle in germany 's constitution .
to this end , it would seek to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to levels 40 per cent below those from 1990 .
by 2040 , all energy sources should be renewable , according to the party 's platform .
the greens are also calling for subsidies for energy efficient homes and a 120-kilometer-per-hour speed limit on german highways .

" only green policies can help to overcome the crisis .
that 's why this country needs to be ruled by the green party again , " trittin said in his speech .
" we need a coalition of ecological modernization , social justice and civil rights that can meet global challenges . "
the party also voted to back a minimum wage of 7.5 euros -lrb- $ 10 -rrb- per hour .
party members called for higher taxes for the wealthy , including an increase in the top tax bracket and higher capital gains taxes , coupled with lower welfare contributions for people on low incomes .

demjanjuk 's son said his family did not intend to appeal that decision because " it does not make sense to appeal to other supreme court judges once the judge responsible for the relevant circuit has rejected the stay . "
the family continues to attempt to block the extradition through court filings in berlin and munich .
a us immigration and customs enforcement -lrb- ice -rrb- spokesman would not confirm that the letter was delivered , or provide details as to when the deportation would take place .
" following an order by a us immigration judge to remove john demjanjuk , the us government has been working closely with the government of germany to effectuate demjanjuk 's removal from the united states , " khaalid walls said in a statement .
" us immigration and customs enforcement will have no further comment until that has occurred . "
the decision is the latest development in a decades-long saga over demjanjuk 's wartime actions .
in a dramatic twist last month , the octogenarian won an 11th-hour reprieve when a us federal appeals court stayed his deportation shortly after he was carried out of his suburban cleveland , ohio home in a wheelchair to be placed on a flight to munich .
that respite was lifted last week when the court threw out an attempt to block deportation on health grounds .
his family quickly submitted an appeal to the supreme court , which was rejected thursday .
looking to german courts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no legal options left they also filed motions in germany to block the extradition , but a berlin court said germany is not obliged to prevent the deportation , is not in a position to stop it and can not send him back because of the pending charges in a munich court .
demjanjuk 's family has appealed that decision and on friday filed a motion in munich to rescind the arrest warrant .
born in ukraine in 1920 , demjanjuk was a soldier in the red army when he was captured by the nazis in the spring of 1942 .
he was trained at treblinka in nazi-occupied poland and served two years in the sobibor and majdanek camps , also in occupied poland , and in flossenburg in bavaria , southern germany , court filings showed .
demjanjuk has always insisted that he was forced to work for the nazis and had been mistaken by survivors for other cruel guards .
he immigrated to the united states in 1952 with his family , settling in ohio , where he found work in the auto industry and changed his name from ivan to john .
condemned to death in israel in 1988 after he was convicted of being the sadistic nazi guard nicknamed " ivan the terrible , " the verdict was overturned by the israeli supreme court because of doubts about his identity .
he was returned to the united states over strenuous objections from holocaust survivors and jewish groups , who argued there was sufficient evidence that he served as a death camp guard to warrant another trial .
demjanjuk regained his us citizenship , which was first stripped in 1981 , after an appeals court ruled in 1998 that the us government recklessly withheld exculpatory evidence .
the us government filed new charges a year later using fresh evidence that surfaced following the collapse of the soviet union , and he was again stripped of his us citizenship in 2002 .
germany issued a warrant for demjanjuk 's arrest on march 11 on charges of assisting in the murder of 29,000 jews at sobibor . nrt / mh , afp / ap / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

demjanjuk 's son said his family did not intend to appeal that decision because " it does not make sense to appeal to other supreme court judges once the judge responsible for the relevant circuit has rejected the stay . "
the family continues to attempt to block the extradition through court filings in berlin and munich .
a us immigration and customs enforcement -lrb- ice -rrb- spokesman would not confirm that the letter was delivered , or provide details as to when the deportation would take place .
" following an order by a us immigration judge to remove john demjanjuk , the us government has been working closely with the government of germany to effectuate demjanjuk 's removal from the united states , " khaalid walls said in a statement .
" us immigration and customs enforcement will have no further comment until that has occurred . "
the decision is the latest development in a decades-long saga over demjanjuk 's wartime actions .
in a dramatic twist last month , the octogenarian won an 11th-hour reprieve when a us federal appeals court stayed his deportation shortly after he was carried out of his suburban cleveland , ohio home in a wheelchair to be placed on a flight to munich .
that respite was lifted last week when the court threw out an attempt to block deportation on health grounds .
his family quickly submitted an appeal to the supreme court , which was rejected thursday .
looking to german courts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no legal options left they also filed motions in germany to block the extradition , but a berlin court said germany is not obliged to prevent the deportation , is not in a position to stop it and can not send him back because of the pending charges in a munich court .
demjanjuk 's family has appealed that decision and on friday filed a motion in munich to rescind the arrest warrant .
born in ukraine in 1920 , demjanjuk was a soldier in the red army when he was captured by the nazis in the spring of 1942 .
he was trained at treblinka in nazi-occupied poland and served two years in the sobibor and majdanek camps , also in occupied poland , and in flossenburg in bavaria , southern germany , court filings showed .
demjanjuk has always insisted that he was forced to work for the nazis and had been mistaken by survivors for other cruel guards .
he immigrated to the united states in 1952 with his family , settling in ohio , where he found work in the auto industry and changed his name from ivan to john .
condemned to death in israel in 1988 after he was convicted of being the sadistic nazi guard nicknamed " ivan the terrible , " the verdict was overturned by the israeli supreme court because of doubts about his identity .
he was returned to the united states over strenuous objections from holocaust survivors and jewish groups , who argued there was sufficient evidence that he served as a death camp guard to warrant another trial .

latest case in point : the us now says it wants a seat on the un human rights council , a body george w. bush had shunned . back in 2008 , the bush administration decided to " disengage " from the un rights organization , saying it went too far in its tolerance of repressive states . but the new us administration , already more active in the council 's deliberations , now says it is ready to take on a leadership role . as one of three countries running for three vacant spots on the north america / europe slate , the us is virtually assured to win a seat on the regionally organized , 47-member council . un , rights groups greet change of heart " human rights are an essential element of american global foreign policy … with others , we will engage in the work of improving the un human rights system , " us secretary of state hillary clinton said in a statement . un officials and human rights groups applauded the announcement . the rotating un human rights council presidency is currently held by nigeria 's ambassador to the un , martin uhomoibhi . " we are very delighted to hear that united states wants to come back , " uhomoibhi said .
" we believe they will be a force for good in the council . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : council president uhomoibhi welcomed the move juliette de rivero , the spokeswoman for human-rights watchdog human rights watch in geneva , said they were " particularly happy about the decision , which we had long been advocating for . " but opponents say the un body is so deeply flawed that the us would be better served by continuing its boycott . the current human rights council is a reformed version of its predecessor , the un commission on human rights .
that organization was discredited for allowing countries with abominable rights records - such as sudan and zimbabwe , to join and to form powerful voting blocs that critics say stood in the way of change . critic : council ignores abuses , allows bias the new human rights council , which was formed in 2006 , has greater transparency , but critics say it is still sorely lacking .
they complain that its structures shield countries that continue to flaunt human rights - like china , cuba and saudi arabia - while israel and other democracies are disproportionately targeted . and they argue recent council condemnations of free speech are anti-democratic . the revamped council " has continued to focus biased attention on israel to the detriment of a balanced approach to the palestinian-israeli situation , " said brett schaefer , a public policy analyst at conservative us think tank the heritage foundation . " and it has ignored rampant human-rights abuses in a number of different countries around the world - such as china , cuba and zimbabwe - that , in their extent , scope and history actually dwarf those human rights abuses that are going on in the israeli-palestinian conflict . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights watch said the body is not perfect , but it is better than nothing schaefer and other critics recommend the un set criteria that member countries would have to meet before they are given decision-making power on human rights . that would fix the " main flaw , " he said .
" right now , the inmates run the asylum . the countries that you want most to scrutinize are those that are driving the agenda . … and just having the us on the council is not going to overcome that fact . " but juliette de rivero of human rights watch - who had found the bush administration 's decision to officially disengage from council business " a counterproductive and short sighted victory for abusive states " - believes the us will do more good than harm on the council . the guantanamo example she acknowledged that " a lot can be done to improve the work of the council , particularly in specific country situations . " still , she noted that the us 's decision to close the illegal prison in guantanamo bay , cuba " can be an example for other countries that you do need to acknowledge the mistakes you have committed , and to address human rights violations . " in other words , the us could be a good example . " all countries have human rights issues and the council 's mandate is to examine them , " she said . human rights council president uhomoibhi also admitted that the council is " not a perfect institution . "
but he believes it has the potential to make a contribution to the promotion of human rights - and that countries have a responsibility to contribute to that potential . ' foxes are guarding the chickens ' many critics take a less optimistic view of the situation , however .
un watchdog groups un watch and freedom watch published a study saying seven of the 18 countries that are expected to take seats on the council next week were completely unqualified to sit on the body , based on an annual human-rights score issued by freedom watch . electing these countries to the council is like " choosing the foxes to guard the chickens , " wrote un watch head hillel neuer . in fact , critics say , the us presence on the council will not change the dynamics of the council or help bring about an end to human-rights violations - it simply means the us will lose any leverage it has to protest change , the heritage foundation 's schaefer argues . the us will be one of 47 votes , and " one of 11 or 12 that actually are willing to step forward and champion human rights .
the rest of those countries are either indifferent , or hostile to human rights , " schaefer said . " in this case , being there is not part of the solution .

latest case in point : the us now says it wants a seat on the un human rights council , a body george w. bush had shunned . back in 2008 , the bush administration decided to " disengage " from the un rights organization , saying it went too far in its tolerance of repressive states . but the new us administration , already more active in the council 's deliberations , now says it is ready to take on a leadership role . as one of three countries running for three vacant spots on the north america / europe slate , the us is virtually assured to win a seat on the regionally organized , 47-member council . un , rights groups greet change of heart " human rights are an essential element of american global foreign policy … with others , we will engage in the work of improving the un human rights system , " us secretary of state hillary clinton said in a statement . un officials and human rights groups applauded the announcement . the rotating un human rights council presidency is currently held by nigeria 's ambassador to the un , martin uhomoibhi . " we are very delighted to hear that united states wants to come back , " uhomoibhi said .
" we believe they will be a force for good in the council . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : council president uhomoibhi welcomed the move juliette de rivero , the spokeswoman for human-rights watchdog human rights watch in geneva , said they were " particularly happy about the decision , which we had long been advocating for . " but opponents say the un body is so deeply flawed that the us would be better served by continuing its boycott . the current human rights council is a reformed version of its predecessor , the un commission on human rights .
that organization was discredited for allowing countries with abominable rights records - such as sudan and zimbabwe , to join and to form powerful voting blocs that critics say stood in the way of change . critic : council ignores abuses , allows bias the new human rights council , which was formed in 2006 , has greater transparency , but critics say it is still sorely lacking .
they complain that its structures shield countries that continue to flaunt human rights - like china , cuba and saudi arabia - while israel and other democracies are disproportionately targeted . and they argue recent council condemnations of free speech are anti-democratic . the revamped council " has continued to focus biased attention on israel to the detriment of a balanced approach to the palestinian-israeli situation , " said brett schaefer , a public policy analyst at conservative us think tank the heritage foundation . " and it has ignored rampant human-rights abuses in a number of different countries around the world - such as china , cuba and zimbabwe - that , in their extent , scope and history actually dwarf those human rights abuses that are going on in the israeli-palestinian conflict . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights watch said the body is not perfect , but it is better than nothing schaefer and other critics recommend the un set criteria that member countries would have to meet before they are given decision-making power on human rights . that would fix the " main flaw , " he said .
" right now , the inmates run the asylum . the countries that you want most to scrutinize are those that are driving the agenda . … and just having the us on the council is not going to overcome that fact . " but juliette de rivero of human rights watch - who had found the bush administration 's decision to officially disengage from council business " a counterproductive and short sighted victory for abusive states " - believes the us will do more good than harm on the council . the guantanamo example she acknowledged that " a lot can be done to improve the work of the council , particularly in specific country situations . " still , she noted that the us 's decision to close the illegal prison in guantanamo bay , cuba " can be an example for other countries that you do need to acknowledge the mistakes you have committed , and to address human rights violations . " in other words , the us could be a good example . " all countries have human rights issues and the council 's mandate is to examine them , " she said . human rights council president uhomoibhi also admitted that the council is " not a perfect institution . "
but he believes it has the potential to make a contribution to the promotion of human rights - and that countries have a responsibility to contribute to that potential . ' foxes are guarding the chickens ' many critics take a less optimistic view of the situation , however .
un watchdog groups un watch and freedom watch published a study saying seven of the 18 countries that are expected to take seats on the council next week were completely unqualified to sit on the body , based on an annual human-rights score issued by freedom watch . electing these countries to the council is like " choosing the foxes to guard the chickens , " wrote un watch head hillel neuer . in fact , critics say , the us presence on the council will not change the dynamics of the council or help bring about an end to human-rights violations - it simply means the us will lose any leverage it has to protest change , the heritage foundation 's schaefer argues . the us will be one of 47 votes , and " one of 11 or 12 that actually are willing to step forward and champion human rights .
the rest of those countries are either indifferent , or hostile to human rights , " schaefer said . " in this case , being there is not part of the solution .

" today we 're sending a signal that democrats stand united against right-wing radicalism , racism and agitation , " said reinhard buetikofer , former head of the green party , who took part in the rally in downtown cologne .
cologne mayor fritz schramma said the peaceful protests by residents on saturday showed that the city is " open and tolerant . "
he also said cologne was " committed when it comes to defending these values . "
security was tight as more than 5,000 police officers , outfitted with water cannons and riot gear , cordoned off the square where the " anti-islam " demonstration took place .
the authorities were concerned that there could be clashes between the two sides , as has frequently been the case in the past . cologne police had banned the right-wing groups from holding a high-profile demonstration in front of the cologne cathedral in the city center and instead allowed them to assemble at another , more obscure , square in the deutz district .
police say there were about 300 people at the right-wing " pro koeln " and " pro nrw " rally .
the groups , which are campaigning against the building of a large new mosque in the city , held a larger rally last september which was joined by members of nationalist parties elsewhere in europe .
that protest sparked violent clashes and rioting by far-left demonstrators .
the two anti-islam groups are opposed to the building of mosques and what they see as an influx of moslem immigration into germany .
mayor schramma vowed that the forthcoming national elections in september would not be used to exploit ethnic or religious tensions .
there will be no " sordid election campaign on the back of our foreign fellow citizens , " he said . sp , gb / dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she also challenged the opposition left party , made up of reformed communists to clearly define their relationship to the gdr past .
the speech by merkel , who grew up in the communist state , was part of this year 's anniversary commemorations marking the opening of the cold war barrier on november 9 , 1989 in a peaceful revolution .
it also coincded with the 20th anniversary of the east german local elections of may 7 , 1989 .
merkel said the civil rights activists who protested against those rigged elections ushered in the end of the dictatorship .
" may 7 was the beginning of the end of the gdr , " merkel said earlier this week .
" in this year of the peaceful revolution we should think of those who showed courage , by revealing the local elections to be a sham , or by escaping the gdr in protest . "

on tuesday , chancellor merkel became the first german leader to tour the main berlin prison run by the feared east german stasi secret police .
merkel said the hohenschoenhausen jail , named for the northeastern district where it is located , was a symbol of a " sad chapter in the history " of the communist state .
" this drives home the brutality with which people 's dignity was abused , " she said , after meeting with former prisoners of the facility .
" it is crucial that this chapter of the history of the east german dictatorship is not covered up or forgotten . "
she also met with a group of pupils and underlined the importance of instruction in schools about east german history as today 's graduates would have no personal memory of the country 's four-decade-long division . nrt / msh , epd / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

amid economic challenges , zuma faces a difficult time bringing different factions together . heavy rains drenched the south african capital pretoria as crowds gathered saturday morning to watch jacob zuma 's inauguration .
however , when it was time to take the oath of office , the sun broke through the clouds and jacob zuma became the fourth democratically elected president of south africa .
he began his inaugural address by thanking nelson mandela .
" he made reconciliation the central theme of his term of office .

it has been a long journey for the 67-year old zuma who herded cows as a child and left school as a teenager to support his impoverished family .
his political life began in the trade unionist movement and he joined the african national congress in 1959 .
in 1963 he was arrested as he was leaving the country and spent 10 years imprisoned on robben island with fellow anc member and former president nelson mandela .
nearly 30 heads of state were in attendance including african union chairman libyan leader muammar al-qadhafi , zimbabwe 's president robert mugabe and king mswati iii of swaziland , africa 's last absolute monarch .
there were no heads of state of western powers in attendance .
all of them sent lower ranking ministers as representatives .
many challenges ahead zuma takes office at a time of slowing growth in south africa which is enduring its first recession in 17 years .
investors are keenly watching the makeup of his economic team , and are paying close attention to the fate of finance minister trevor manuel , a man who has been praised for his fiscal management .
analysts are also watching to see how zuma will reward the communists and unionists who stood by him throughout his career and foreign investors fear he may move the economy left .

amid economic challenges , zuma faces a difficult time bringing different factions together . heavy rains drenched the south african capital pretoria as crowds gathered saturday morning to watch jacob zuma 's inauguration .
however , when it was time to take the oath of office , the sun broke through the clouds and jacob zuma became the fourth democratically elected president of south africa .
he began his inaugural address by thanking nelson mandela .
" he made reconciliation the central theme of his term of office .
we will not deviate from that nation building task .
thank you madiba for showing us the way , " said zuma , referring to mandela by his clan name .
it has been a long journey for the 67-year old zuma who herded cows as a child and left school as a teenager to support his impoverished family .
his political life began in the trade unionist movement and he joined the african national congress in 1959 .
in 1963 he was arrested as he was leaving the country and spent 10 years imprisoned on robben island with fellow anc member and former president nelson mandela .
nearly 30 heads of state were in attendance including african union chairman libyan leader muammar al-qadhafi , zimbabwe 's president robert mugabe and king mswati iii of swaziland , africa 's last absolute monarch .
there were no heads of state of western powers in attendance .
all of them sent lower ranking ministers as representatives .
many challenges ahead zuma takes office at a time of slowing growth in south africa which is enduring its first recession in 17 years .
investors are keenly watching the makeup of his economic team , and are paying close attention to the fate of finance minister trevor manuel , a man who has been praised for his fiscal management .
analysts are also watching to see how zuma will reward the communists and unionists who stood by him throughout his career and foreign investors fear he may move the economy left .

the pope met with muslim religious leaders , and members of the diplomatic corps in jordan in front of the al-hussein bin talal mosque in amman .
" often it is ideological manipulation of religion , sometimes with political goals , that is the catalyst for tensions and schisms , " the 82-year-old pontiff said .
" today muslims and christians - because of the burden of their mutual history full of misunderstandings - have to strive to be seen and recognized as believers truly loyal to the commandments . "
pope benedict failed to use the opportunity to apologise over the so-called regensburg lecture , which he gave in 2006 .
in that speech the pontiff quoted a medieval christian emperor who criticised teachings of the prophet muhammad as " evil and inhuman . "
jordanian islamist leaders , still sensitive about the pontiff 's comments , had demanded his visit be cancelled .

" belief in god does not suppress the truth ; to the contrary , it encourages it , " said the former german theology professor .
" religion is disfigured when it is pressed into the service of ignorance or prejudice , contempt , violence and abuse . "

demjanjuk 's son said his family did not intend to appeal that decision because " it does not make sense to appeal to other supreme court judges once the judge responsible for the relevant circuit has rejected the stay . "
the family continues to attempt to block the extradition through court filings in berlin and munich .
a us immigration and customs enforcement -lrb- ice -rrb- spokesman would not confirm that the letter was delivered , or provide details as to when the deportation would take place .
" following an order by a us immigration judge to remove john demjanjuk , the us government has been working closely with the government of germany to effectuate demjanjuk 's removal from the united states , " khaalid walls said in a statement .
" us immigration and customs enforcement will have no further comment until that has occurred . "
the decision is the latest development in a decades-long saga over demjanjuk 's wartime actions .
in a dramatic twist last month , the octogenarian won an 11th-hour reprieve when a us federal appeals court stayed his deportation shortly after he was carried out of his suburban cleveland , ohio home in a wheelchair to be placed on a flight to munich .
that respite was lifted last week when the court threw out an attempt to block deportation on health grounds .
his family quickly submitted an appeal to the supreme court , which was rejected thursday .
looking to german courts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no legal options left they also filed motions in germany to block the extradition , but a berlin court said germany is not obliged to prevent the deportation , is not in a position to stop it and can not send him back because of the pending charges in a munich court .
demjanjuk 's family has appealed that decision and on friday filed a motion in munich to rescind the arrest warrant .
born in ukraine in 1920 , demjanjuk was a soldier in the red army when he was captured by the nazis in the spring of 1942 .
he was trained at treblinka in nazi-occupied poland and served two years in the sobibor and majdanek camps , also in occupied poland , and in flossenburg in bavaria , southern germany , court filings showed .
demjanjuk has always insisted that he was forced to work for the nazis and had been mistaken by survivors for other cruel guards .
he immigrated to the united states in 1952 with his family , settling in ohio , where he found work in the auto industry and changed his name from ivan to john .
condemned to death in israel in 1988 after he was convicted of being the sadistic nazi guard nicknamed " ivan the terrible , " the verdict was overturned by the israeli supreme court because of doubts about his identity .
he was returned to the united states over strenuous objections from holocaust survivors and jewish groups , who argued there was sufficient evidence that he served as a death camp guard to warrant another trial .
demjanjuk regained his us citizenship , which was first stripped in 1981 , after an appeals court ruled in 1998 that the us government recklessly withheld exculpatory evidence .
the us government filed new charges a year later using fresh evidence that surfaced following the collapse of the soviet union , and he was again stripped of his us citizenship in 2002 .
germany issued a warrant for demjanjuk 's arrest on march 11 on charges of assisting in the murder of 29,000 jews at sobibor . nrt / mh , afp / ap / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

latest case in point : the us now says it wants a seat on the un human rights council , a body george w. bush had shunned . back in 2008 , the bush administration decided to " disengage " from the un rights organization , saying it went too far in its tolerance of repressive states . but the new us administration , already more active in the council 's deliberations , now says it is ready to take on a leadership role . as one of three countries running for three vacant spots on the north america / europe slate , the us is virtually assured to win a seat on the regionally organized , 47-member council . un , rights groups greet change of heart " human rights are an essential element of american global foreign policy … with others , we will engage in the work of improving the un human rights system , " us secretary of state hillary clinton said in a statement . un officials and human rights groups applauded the announcement . the rotating un human rights council presidency is currently held by nigeria 's ambassador to the un , martin uhomoibhi . " we are very delighted to hear that united states wants to come back , " uhomoibhi said .
" we believe they will be a force for good in the council . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : council president uhomoibhi welcomed the move juliette de rivero , the spokeswoman for human-rights watchdog human rights watch in geneva , said they were " particularly happy about the decision , which we had long been advocating for . " but opponents say the un body is so deeply flawed that the us would be better served by continuing its boycott . the current human rights council is a reformed version of its predecessor , the un commission on human rights .
that organization was discredited for allowing countries with abominable rights records - such as sudan and zimbabwe , to join and to form powerful voting blocs that critics say stood in the way of change . critic : council ignores abuses , allows bias the new human rights council , which was formed in 2006 , has greater transparency , but critics say it is still sorely lacking .
they complain that its structures shield countries that continue to flaunt human rights - like china , cuba and saudi arabia - while israel and other democracies are disproportionately targeted . and they argue recent council condemnations of free speech are anti-democratic . the revamped council " has continued to focus biased attention on israel to the detriment of a balanced approach to the palestinian-israeli situation , " said brett schaefer , a public policy analyst at conservative us think tank the heritage foundation . " and it has ignored rampant human-rights abuses in a number of different countries around the world - such as china , cuba and zimbabwe - that , in their extent , scope and history actually dwarf those human rights abuses that are going on in the israeli-palestinian conflict . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights watch said the body is not perfect , but it is better than nothing schaefer and other critics recommend the un set criteria that member countries would have to meet before they are given decision-making power on human rights . that would fix the " main flaw , " he said .
" right now , the inmates run the asylum . the countries that you want most to scrutinize are those that are driving the agenda . … and just having the us on the council is not going to overcome that fact . " but juliette de rivero of human rights watch - who had found the bush administration 's decision to officially disengage from council business " a counterproductive and short sighted victory for abusive states " - believes the us will do more good than harm on the council . the guantanamo example she acknowledged that " a lot can be done to improve the work of the council , particularly in specific country situations . " still , she noted that the us 's decision to close the illegal prison in guantanamo bay , cuba " can be an example for other countries that you do need to acknowledge the mistakes you have committed , and to address human rights violations . " in other words , the us could be a good example . " all countries have human rights issues and the council 's mandate is to examine them , " she said . human rights council president uhomoibhi also admitted that the council is " not a perfect institution . "
but he believes it has the potential to make a contribution to the promotion of human rights - and that countries have a responsibility to contribute to that potential . ' foxes are guarding the chickens ' many critics take a less optimistic view of the situation , however .
un watchdog groups un watch and freedom watch published a study saying seven of the 18 countries that are expected to take seats on the council next week were completely unqualified to sit on the body , based on an annual human-rights score issued by freedom watch . electing these countries to the council is like " choosing the foxes to guard the chickens , " wrote un watch head hillel neuer . in fact , critics say , the us presence on the council will not change the dynamics of the council or help bring about an end to human-rights violations - it simply means the us will lose any leverage it has to protest change , the heritage foundation 's schaefer argues . the us will be one of 47 votes , and " one of 11 or 12 that actually are willing to step forward and champion human rights .
the rest of those countries are either indifferent , or hostile to human rights , " schaefer said . " in this case , being there is not part of the solution .

latest case in point : the us now says it wants a seat on the un human rights council , a body george w. bush had shunned . back in 2008 , the bush administration decided to " disengage " from the un rights organization , saying it went too far in its tolerance of repressive states . but the new us administration , already more active in the council 's deliberations , now says it is ready to take on a leadership role . as one of three countries running for three vacant spots on the north america / europe slate , the us is virtually assured to win a seat on the regionally organized , 47-member council . un , rights groups greet change of heart " human rights are an essential element of american global foreign policy … with others , we will engage in the work of improving the un human rights system , " us secretary of state hillary clinton said in a statement . un officials and human rights groups applauded the announcement . the rotating un human rights council presidency is currently held by nigeria 's ambassador to the un , martin uhomoibhi . " we are very delighted to hear that united states wants to come back , " uhomoibhi said .
" we believe they will be a force for good in the council . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : council president uhomoibhi welcomed the move juliette de rivero , the spokeswoman for human-rights watchdog human rights watch in geneva , said they were " particularly happy about the decision , which we had long been advocating for . " but opponents say the un body is so deeply flawed that the us would be better served by continuing its boycott . the current human rights council is a reformed version of its predecessor , the un commission on human rights .
that organization was discredited for allowing countries with abominable rights records - such as sudan and zimbabwe , to join and to form powerful voting blocs that critics say stood in the way of change . critic : council ignores abuses , allows bias the new human rights council , which was formed in 2006 , has greater transparency , but critics say it is still sorely lacking .
they complain that its structures shield countries that continue to flaunt human rights - like china , cuba and saudi arabia - while israel and other democracies are disproportionately targeted . and they argue recent council condemnations of free speech are anti-democratic . the revamped council " has continued to focus biased attention on israel to the detriment of a balanced approach to the palestinian-israeli situation , " said brett schaefer , a public policy analyst at conservative us think tank the heritage foundation . " and it has ignored rampant human-rights abuses in a number of different countries around the world - such as china , cuba and zimbabwe - that , in their extent , scope and history actually dwarf those human rights abuses that are going on in the israeli-palestinian conflict . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights watch said the body is not perfect , but it is better than nothing schaefer and other critics recommend the un set criteria that member countries would have to meet before they are given decision-making power on human rights . that would fix the " main flaw , " he said .
" right now , the inmates run the asylum . the countries that you want most to scrutinize are those that are driving the agenda . … and just having the us on the council is not going to overcome that fact . " but juliette de rivero of human rights watch - who had found the bush administration 's decision to officially disengage from council business " a counterproductive and short sighted victory for abusive states " - believes the us will do more good than harm on the council . the guantanamo example she acknowledged that " a lot can be done to improve the work of the council , particularly in specific country situations . " still , she noted that the us 's decision to close the illegal prison in guantanamo bay , cuba " can be an example for other countries that you do need to acknowledge the mistakes you have committed , and to address human rights violations . " in other words , the us could be a good example . " all countries have human rights issues and the council 's mandate is to examine them , " she said . human rights council president uhomoibhi also admitted that the council is " not a perfect institution . "
but he believes it has the potential to make a contribution to the promotion of human rights - and that countries have a responsibility to contribute to that potential . ' foxes are guarding the chickens ' many critics take a less optimistic view of the situation , however .
un watchdog groups un watch and freedom watch published a study saying seven of the 18 countries that are expected to take seats on the council next week were completely unqualified to sit on the body , based on an annual human-rights score issued by freedom watch . electing these countries to the council is like " choosing the foxes to guard the chickens , " wrote un watch head hillel neuer . in fact , critics say , the us presence on the council will not change the dynamics of the council or help bring about an end to human-rights violations - it simply means the us will lose any leverage it has to protest change , the heritage foundation 's schaefer argues . the us will be one of 47 votes , and " one of 11 or 12 that actually are willing to step forward and champion human rights .
the rest of those countries are either indifferent , or hostile to human rights , " schaefer said . " in this case , being there is not part of the solution .

latest case in point : the us now says it wants a seat on the un human rights council , a body george w. bush had shunned . back in 2008 , the bush administration decided to " disengage " from the un rights organization , saying it went too far in its tolerance of repressive states . but the new us administration , already more active in the council 's deliberations , now says it is ready to take on a leadership role . as one of three countries running for three vacant spots on the north america / europe slate , the us is virtually assured to win a seat on the regionally organized , 47-member council . un , rights groups greet change of heart " human rights are an essential element of american global foreign policy … with others , we will engage in the work of improving the un human rights system , " us secretary of state hillary clinton said in a statement . un officials and human rights groups applauded the announcement . the rotating un human rights council presidency is currently held by nigeria 's ambassador to the un , martin uhomoibhi . " we are very delighted to hear that united states wants to come back , " uhomoibhi said .
" we believe they will be a force for good in the council . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : council president uhomoibhi welcomed the move juliette de rivero , the spokeswoman for human-rights watchdog human rights watch in geneva , said they were " particularly happy about the decision , which we had long been advocating for . " but opponents say the un body is so deeply flawed that the us would be better served by continuing its boycott . the current human rights council is a reformed version of its predecessor , the un commission on human rights .
that organization was discredited for allowing countries with abominable rights records - such as sudan and zimbabwe , to join and to form powerful voting blocs that critics say stood in the way of change . critic : council ignores abuses , allows bias the new human rights council , which was formed in 2006 , has greater transparency , but critics say it is still sorely lacking .
they complain that its structures shield countries that continue to flaunt human rights - like china , cuba and saudi arabia - while israel and other democracies are disproportionately targeted . and they argue recent council condemnations of free speech are anti-democratic . the revamped council " has continued to focus biased attention on israel to the detriment of a balanced approach to the palestinian-israeli situation , " said brett schaefer , a public policy analyst at conservative us think tank the heritage foundation . " and it has ignored rampant human-rights abuses in a number of different countries around the world - such as china , cuba and zimbabwe - that , in their extent , scope and history actually dwarf those human rights abuses that are going on in the israeli-palestinian conflict . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights watch said the body is not perfect , but it is better than nothing schaefer and other critics recommend the un set criteria that member countries would have to meet before they are given decision-making power on human rights . that would fix the " main flaw , " he said .
" right now , the inmates run the asylum . the countries that you want most to scrutinize are those that are driving the agenda . … and just having the us on the council is not going to overcome that fact . " but juliette de rivero of human rights watch - who had found the bush administration 's decision to officially disengage from council business " a counterproductive and short sighted victory for abusive states " - believes the us will do more good than harm on the council . the guantanamo example she acknowledged that " a lot can be done to improve the work of the council , particularly in specific country situations . " still , she noted that the us 's decision to close the illegal prison in guantanamo bay , cuba " can be an example for other countries that you do need to acknowledge the mistakes you have committed , and to address human rights violations . " in other words , the us could be a good example . " all countries have human rights issues and the council 's mandate is to examine them , " she said . human rights council president uhomoibhi also admitted that the council is " not a perfect institution . "
but he believes it has the potential to make a contribution to the promotion of human rights - and that countries have a responsibility to contribute to that potential . ' foxes are guarding the chickens ' many critics take a less optimistic view of the situation , however .
un watchdog groups un watch and freedom watch published a study saying seven of the 18 countries that are expected to take seats on the council next week were completely unqualified to sit on the body , based on an annual human-rights score issued by freedom watch . electing these countries to the council is like " choosing the foxes to guard the chickens , " wrote un watch head hillel neuer . in fact , critics say , the us presence on the council will not change the dynamics of the council or help bring about an end to human-rights violations - it simply means the us will lose any leverage it has to protest change , the heritage foundation 's schaefer argues . the us will be one of 47 votes , and " one of 11 or 12 that actually are willing to step forward and champion human rights .
the rest of those countries are either indifferent , or hostile to human rights , " schaefer said . " in this case , being there is not part of the solution .

amid economic challenges , zuma faces a difficult time bringing different factions together . heavy rains drenched the south african capital pretoria as crowds gathered saturday morning to watch jacob zuma 's inauguration .
however , when it was time to take the oath of office , the sun broke through the clouds and jacob zuma became the fourth democratically elected president of south africa .
he began his inaugural address by thanking nelson mandela .
" he made reconciliation the central theme of his term of office .
we will not deviate from that nation building task .
thank you madiba for showing us the way , " said zuma , referring to mandela by his clan name .
it has been a long journey for the 67-year old zuma who herded cows as a child and left school as a teenager to support his impoverished family .
his political life began in the trade unionist movement and he joined the african national congress in 1959 .
in 1963 he was arrested as he was leaving the country and spent 10 years imprisoned on robben island with fellow anc member and former president nelson mandela .
nearly 30 heads of state were in attendance including african union chairman libyan leader muammar al-qadhafi , zimbabwe 's president robert mugabe and king mswati iii of swaziland , africa 's last absolute monarch .
there were no heads of state of western powers in attendance .
all of them sent lower ranking ministers as representatives .
many challenges ahead zuma takes office at a time of slowing growth in south africa which is enduring its first recession in 17 years .
investors are keenly watching the makeup of his economic team , and are paying close attention to the fate of finance minister trevor manuel , a man who has been praised for his fiscal management .
analysts are also watching to see how zuma will reward the communists and unionists who stood by him throughout his career and foreign investors fear he may move the economy left .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anc supporters worked the election zuma acknowledged the tough economic climate in his speech saying , " we must acknowledge that we find ourselves in difficult economic times .
jobs are being lost in every economy across the world .

amid economic challenges , zuma faces a difficult time bringing different factions together . heavy rains drenched the south african capital pretoria as crowds gathered saturday morning to watch jacob zuma 's inauguration .
however , when it was time to take the oath of office , the sun broke through the clouds and jacob zuma became the fourth democratically elected president of south africa .
he began his inaugural address by thanking nelson mandela .
" he made reconciliation the central theme of his term of office .
we will not deviate from that nation building task .
thank you madiba for showing us the way , " said zuma , referring to mandela by his clan name .
it has been a long journey for the 67-year old zuma who herded cows as a child and left school as a teenager to support his impoverished family .
his political life began in the trade unionist movement and he joined the african national congress in 1959 .
in 1963 he was arrested as he was leaving the country and spent 10 years imprisoned on robben island with fellow anc member and former president nelson mandela .
nearly 30 heads of state were in attendance including african union chairman libyan leader muammar al-qadhafi , zimbabwe 's president robert mugabe and king mswati iii of swaziland , africa 's last absolute monarch .
there were no heads of state of western powers in attendance .
all of them sent lower ranking ministers as representatives .
many challenges ahead zuma takes office at a time of slowing growth in south africa which is enduring its first recession in 17 years .
investors are keenly watching the makeup of his economic team , and are paying close attention to the fate of finance minister trevor manuel , a man who has been praised for his fiscal management .
analysts are also watching to see how zuma will reward the communists and unionists who stood by him throughout his career and foreign investors fear he may move the economy left .

the 840-metre summit of mount nebo , some 40 kilometres southwest of the capital amman , is holy to jews , christians and muslims alike .

" his example reminds us that we too are part of the ageless pilgrimage of god 's people through history . "
after descending from the mountain , hundreds of people waving jordanian and vatican flags greeted benedict in the town of madaba , where he visited the greek orthodox basilica of st george , famous for its sixth century mosaic map of biblical palestine .
while in madaba , benedict blessed the cornerstone of a new catholic university being built there with help from jordan , a muslim country keen to maintain interfaith harmony .
" belief in god does not suppress the truth ; to the contrary , it encourages it , " said the former german theology professor .
" religion is disfigured when it is pressed into the service of ignorance or prejudice , contempt , violence and abuse . "

" today we 're sending a signal that democrats stand united against right-wing radicalism , racism and agitation , " said reinhard buetikofer , former head of the green party , who took part in the rally in downtown cologne .
cologne mayor fritz schramma said the peaceful protests by residents on saturday showed that the city is " open and tolerant . "
he also said cologne was " committed when it comes to defending these values . "
security was tight as more than 5,000 police officers , outfitted with water cannons and riot gear , cordoned off the square where the " anti-islam " demonstration took place .
the authorities were concerned that there could be clashes between the two sides , as has frequently been the case in the past . cologne police had banned the right-wing groups from holding a high-profile demonstration in front of the cologne cathedral in the city center and instead allowed them to assemble at another , more obscure , square in the deutz district .
police say there were about 300 people at the right-wing " pro koeln " and " pro nrw " rally .
the groups , which are campaigning against the building of a large new mosque in the city , held a larger rally last september which was joined by members of nationalist parties elsewhere in europe .
that protest sparked violent clashes and rioting by far-left demonstrators .
the two anti-islam groups are opposed to the building of mosques and what they see as an influx of moslem immigration into germany .
mayor schramma vowed that the forthcoming national elections in september would not be used to exploit ethnic or religious tensions .
there will be no " sordid election campaign on the back of our foreign fellow citizens , " he said . sp , gb / dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" today we 're sending a signal that democrats stand united against right-wing radicalism , racism and agitation , " said reinhard buetikofer , former head of the green party , who took part in the rally in downtown cologne .
cologne mayor fritz schramma said the peaceful protests by residents on saturday showed that the city is " open and tolerant . "
he also said cologne was " committed when it comes to defending these values . "
security was tight as more than 5,000 police officers , outfitted with water cannons and riot gear , cordoned off the square where the " anti-islam " demonstration took place .
the authorities were concerned that there could be clashes between the two sides , as has frequently been the case in the past . cologne police had banned the right-wing groups from holding a high-profile demonstration in front of the cologne cathedral in the city center and instead allowed them to assemble at another , more obscure , square in the deutz district .
police say there were about 300 people at the right-wing " pro koeln " and " pro nrw " rally .
the groups , which are campaigning against the building of a large new mosque in the city , held a larger rally last september which was joined by members of nationalist parties elsewhere in europe .
that protest sparked violent clashes and rioting by far-left demonstrators .
the two anti-islam groups are opposed to the building of mosques and what they see as an influx of moslem immigration into germany .
mayor schramma vowed that the forthcoming national elections in september would not be used to exploit ethnic or religious tensions .

her comments come a day before karzai is to meet german chancellor angela merkel in berlin .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 09.05.2009 report : germany facing 48-billion-euro tax shortfall großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's estimated tax revenues are to drop , while public debt continues to soar germany is reportedly facing a severe slump in tax revenues .
the economic downturn is definitely taking its toll , but not everybody believes the german state is short of money . the german finance ministry is expecting tax revenues to drop by 48 billion euros -lrb- 64 billion us dollars -rrb- this year , according to the german daily handelsblatt .
official november estimates put tax revenues at 572 billion euros , but the handelsblatt on saturday quoted government sources as saying that only 524 billion euros are expected to reach the treasury in 2009 .
the finance ministry declined to confirm the figures on saturday , pointing to a three-day meeting in bad kreuznach where experts will gather on tuesday to draw up an official tax estimate .
" estimates are not revenues " although the terms billion , and even trillion , have been used rather inflationary in the wake of the global credit crunch , a potential 48-billion-euro shortfall is no trifling matter .
especially as forecasts expect the german economy to shrink by an estimated six percent this year .
however , such figures still have to be taken with a pinch of salt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister peer steinbrueck is against tax cuts michael jaeger , the general secretary of the taxpayers association of europe , said people should not confuse estimates with real revenues .
he pointed out that tax revenues had actually increased by about 100 billion euros over the past four years .
" the state has n't got a problem with its tax revenue .
its got a problem with expenditure , " jaeger said .
" the basic problem is that the budget is constantly blown up , while public debt increases , and in the end the taxpayer has to foot the bill . "

the economic downturn is definitely taking its toll , but not everybody believes the german state is short of money . the german finance ministry is expecting tax revenues to drop by 48 billion euros -lrb- 64 billion us dollars -rrb- this year , according to the german daily handelsblatt .

the finance ministry declined to confirm the figures on saturday , pointing to a three-day meeting in bad kreuznach where experts will gather on tuesday to draw up an official tax estimate .
" estimates are not revenues " although the terms billion , and even trillion , have been used rather inflationary in the wake of the global credit crunch , a potential 48-billion-euro shortfall is no trifling matter .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 09.05.2009 report : germany facing 48-billion-euro tax shortfall großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's estimated tax revenues are to drop , while public debt continues to soar germany is reportedly facing a severe slump in tax revenues .
the economic downturn is definitely taking its toll , but not everybody believes the german state is short of money . the german finance ministry is expecting tax revenues to drop by 48 billion euros -lrb- 64 billion us dollars -rrb- this year , according to the german daily handelsblatt .
official november estimates put tax revenues at 572 billion euros , but the handelsblatt on saturday quoted government sources as saying that only 524 billion euros are expected to reach the treasury in 2009 .
the finance ministry declined to confirm the figures on saturday , pointing to a three-day meeting in bad kreuznach where experts will gather on tuesday to draw up an official tax estimate .
" estimates are not revenues " although the terms billion , and even trillion , have been used rather inflationary in the wake of the global credit crunch , a potential 48-billion-euro shortfall is no trifling matter .
especially as forecasts expect the german economy to shrink by an estimated six percent this year .
however , such figures still have to be taken with a pinch of salt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister peer steinbrueck is against tax cuts michael jaeger , the general secretary of the taxpayers association of europe , said people should not confuse estimates with real revenues .
he pointed out that tax revenues had actually increased by about 100 billion euros over the past four years .
" the state has n't got a problem with its tax revenue .
its got a problem with expenditure , " jaeger said .
" the basic problem is that the budget is constantly blown up , while public debt increases , and in the end the taxpayer has to foot the bill . "
german finance minister peer steinbrueck has warned that estimated tax revenues could drop by up to 350 billion euros over the next four years , and in view of the economic situation , he has so far refrained from promising tax cuts ahead of september 's federal election .
" something 's wrong with the system " jaeger not only believes that lower taxes are still possible in times of economic crisis , he is also a staunch advocate of cuts to reduce the burden on the struggling taxpayer , especially since actual tax revenues for 2008 were higher than in previous years .
" it is no contradiction to save and to invest in the proper areas , and also implement tax cuts , especially for the middle class which not only creates the jobs but also bears the brunt in times of crisis , " jaeger said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german public debt is increasing at 4,439 euros per second jaeger suggested the state could cut value added tax and do away with a special tax that was introduced after german reunification to bolster the battered east , the so-called " solidaritaetszuschlag " .
" we should have decreased public debt in the days when we had a fantastic economic upturn with abundant tax revenue .
if we create new net debt despite increasing tax revenues , then something 's wrong with the system , " he said .
according to the german taxpayers ' federation -lrb- bdst -rrb- , public debt amounted to more than 1.5 trillion euros on saturday evening , that 's more than 19,000 euros per head - it is important to give the date because germany 's debts are growing at an estimated 4,439 euros per second . nk , cg ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the environmentalist party 's platform calls for millions of new jobs by 2013 .
the party , whose seven-year government coalition with the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- ended in 2005 , said the majority of jobs would emerge in the climate-protection sector , in particular by investing in insulation technologies for buildings and in renewable energy .
expanding childcare centers and all-day schools would create further jobs , the party said in its election manifesto .
emphasis on green issues the party , which is angling to be a junior partner in the next government , said it wants to enshrine climate change prevention as a fundamental principle in germany 's constitution .
to this end , it would seek to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to levels 40 per cent below those from 1990 .
by 2040 , all energy sources should be renewable , according to the party 's platform .
the greens are also calling for subsidies for energy efficient homes and a 120-kilometer-per-hour speed limit on german highways .

" we need a coalition of ecological modernization , social justice and civil rights that can meet global challenges . "
the party also voted to back a minimum wage of 7.5 euros -lrb- $ 10 -rrb- per hour .
party members called for higher taxes for the wealthy , including an increase in the top tax bracket and higher capital gains taxes , coupled with lower welfare contributions for people on low incomes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world war ii -pipe- 09.05.2009 suspected nazi guard told to surrender to us immigration officials großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demjanjuk 's ss identity card us immigration officials have asked former nazi guard john demjanjuk to surrender for deportation to germany to face charges of aiding the wartime murder of thousands of jews , his son said friday . the move comes a day after a us supreme court justice denied the 89-year-old former autoworker 's request to block the deportation .
demjanjuk 's son said his family did not intend to appeal that decision because " it does not make sense to appeal to other supreme court judges once the judge responsible for the relevant circuit has rejected the stay . "
the family continues to attempt to block the extradition through court filings in berlin and munich .
a us immigration and customs enforcement -lrb- ice -rrb- spokesman would not confirm that the letter was delivered , or provide details as to when the deportation would take place .
" following an order by a us immigration judge to remove john demjanjuk , the us government has been working closely with the government of germany to effectuate demjanjuk 's removal from the united states , " khaalid walls said in a statement .
" us immigration and customs enforcement will have no further comment until that has occurred . "
the decision is the latest development in a decades-long saga over demjanjuk 's wartime actions .
in a dramatic twist last month , the octogenarian won an 11th-hour reprieve when a us federal appeals court stayed his deportation shortly after he was carried out of his suburban cleveland , ohio home in a wheelchair to be placed on a flight to munich .
that respite was lifted last week when the court threw out an attempt to block deportation on health grounds .
his family quickly submitted an appeal to the supreme court , which was rejected thursday .
looking to german courts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no legal options left they also filed motions in germany to block the extradition , but a berlin court said germany is not obliged to prevent the deportation , is not in a position to stop it and can not send him back because of the pending charges in a munich court .
demjanjuk 's family has appealed that decision and on friday filed a motion in munich to rescind the arrest warrant .
born in ukraine in 1920 , demjanjuk was a soldier in the red army when he was captured by the nazis in the spring of 1942 .
he was trained at treblinka in nazi-occupied poland and served two years in the sobibor and majdanek camps , also in occupied poland , and in flossenburg in bavaria , southern germany , court filings showed .
demjanjuk has always insisted that he was forced to work for the nazis and had been mistaken by survivors for other cruel guards .
he immigrated to the united states in 1952 with his family , settling in ohio , where he found work in the auto industry and changed his name from ivan to john .
condemned to death in israel in 1988 after he was convicted of being the sadistic nazi guard nicknamed " ivan the terrible , " the verdict was overturned by the israeli supreme court because of doubts about his identity .
he was returned to the united states over strenuous objections from holocaust survivors and jewish groups , who argued there was sufficient evidence that he served as a death camp guard to warrant another trial .
demjanjuk regained his us citizenship , which was first stripped in 1981 , after an appeals court ruled in 1998 that the us government recklessly withheld exculpatory evidence .
the us government filed new charges a year later using fresh evidence that surfaced following the collapse of the soviet union , and he was again stripped of his us citizenship in 2002 .
germany issued a warrant for demjanjuk 's arrest on march 11 on charges of assisting in the murder of 29,000 jews at sobibor . nrt / mh , afp / ap / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

demjanjuk 's son said his family did not intend to appeal that decision because " it does not make sense to appeal to other supreme court judges once the judge responsible for the relevant circuit has rejected the stay . "
the family continues to attempt to block the extradition through court filings in berlin and munich .
a us immigration and customs enforcement -lrb- ice -rrb- spokesman would not confirm that the letter was delivered , or provide details as to when the deportation would take place .
" following an order by a us immigration judge to remove john demjanjuk , the us government has been working closely with the government of germany to effectuate demjanjuk 's removal from the united states , " khaalid walls said in a statement .
" us immigration and customs enforcement will have no further comment until that has occurred . "
the decision is the latest development in a decades-long saga over demjanjuk 's wartime actions .
in a dramatic twist last month , the octogenarian won an 11th-hour reprieve when a us federal appeals court stayed his deportation shortly after he was carried out of his suburban cleveland , ohio home in a wheelchair to be placed on a flight to munich .
that respite was lifted last week when the court threw out an attempt to block deportation on health grounds .
his family quickly submitted an appeal to the supreme court , which was rejected thursday .
looking to german courts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no legal options left they also filed motions in germany to block the extradition , but a berlin court said germany is not obliged to prevent the deportation , is not in a position to stop it and can not send him back because of the pending charges in a munich court .
demjanjuk 's family has appealed that decision and on friday filed a motion in munich to rescind the arrest warrant .
born in ukraine in 1920 , demjanjuk was a soldier in the red army when he was captured by the nazis in the spring of 1942 .
he was trained at treblinka in nazi-occupied poland and served two years in the sobibor and majdanek camps , also in occupied poland , and in flossenburg in bavaria , southern germany , court filings showed .
demjanjuk has always insisted that he was forced to work for the nazis and had been mistaken by survivors for other cruel guards .
he immigrated to the united states in 1952 with his family , settling in ohio , where he found work in the auto industry and changed his name from ivan to john .
condemned to death in israel in 1988 after he was convicted of being the sadistic nazi guard nicknamed " ivan the terrible , " the verdict was overturned by the israeli supreme court because of doubts about his identity .
he was returned to the united states over strenuous objections from holocaust survivors and jewish groups , who argued there was sufficient evidence that he served as a death camp guard to warrant another trial .
demjanjuk regained his us citizenship , which was first stripped in 1981 , after an appeals court ruled in 1998 that the us government recklessly withheld exculpatory evidence .
the us government filed new charges a year later using fresh evidence that surfaced following the collapse of the soviet union , and he was again stripped of his us citizenship in 2002 .
germany issued a warrant for demjanjuk 's arrest on march 11 on charges of assisting in the murder of 29,000 jews at sobibor . nrt / mh , afp / ap / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 09.05.2009 report : germany facing 48-billion-euro tax shortfall großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's estimated tax revenues are to drop , while public debt continues to soar germany is reportedly facing a severe slump in tax revenues .
the economic downturn is definitely taking its toll , but not everybody believes the german state is short of money . the german finance ministry is expecting tax revenues to drop by 48 billion euros -lrb- 64 billion us dollars -rrb- this year , according to the german daily handelsblatt .
official november estimates put tax revenues at 572 billion euros , but the handelsblatt on saturday quoted government sources as saying that only 524 billion euros are expected to reach the treasury in 2009 .
the finance ministry declined to confirm the figures on saturday , pointing to a three-day meeting in bad kreuznach where experts will gather on tuesday to draw up an official tax estimate .
" estimates are not revenues " although the terms billion , and even trillion , have been used rather inflationary in the wake of the global credit crunch , a potential 48-billion-euro shortfall is no trifling matter .
especially as forecasts expect the german economy to shrink by an estimated six percent this year .
however , such figures still have to be taken with a pinch of salt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister peer steinbrueck is against tax cuts michael jaeger , the general secretary of the taxpayers association of europe , said people should not confuse estimates with real revenues .
he pointed out that tax revenues had actually increased by about 100 billion euros over the past four years .
" the state has n't got a problem with its tax revenue .
its got a problem with expenditure , " jaeger said .
" the basic problem is that the budget is constantly blown up , while public debt increases , and in the end the taxpayer has to foot the bill . "
german finance minister peer steinbrueck has warned that estimated tax revenues could drop by up to 350 billion euros over the next four years , and in view of the economic situation , he has so far refrained from promising tax cuts ahead of september 's federal election .
" something 's wrong with the system " jaeger not only believes that lower taxes are still possible in times of economic crisis , he is also a staunch advocate of cuts to reduce the burden on the struggling taxpayer , especially since actual tax revenues for 2008 were higher than in previous years .
" it is no contradiction to save and to invest in the proper areas , and also implement tax cuts , especially for the middle class which not only creates the jobs but also bears the brunt in times of crisis , " jaeger said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german public debt is increasing at 4,439 euros per second jaeger suggested the state could cut value added tax and do away with a special tax that was introduced after german reunification to bolster the battered east , the so-called " solidaritaetszuschlag " .
" we should have decreased public debt in the days when we had a fantastic economic upturn with abundant tax revenue .
if we create new net debt despite increasing tax revenues , then something 's wrong with the system , " he said .
according to the german taxpayers ' federation -lrb- bdst -rrb- , public debt amounted to more than 1.5 trillion euros on saturday evening , that 's more than 19,000 euros per head - it is important to give the date because germany 's debts are growing at an estimated 4,439 euros per second . nk , cg ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the economic downturn is definitely taking its toll , but not everybody believes the german state is short of money . the german finance ministry is expecting tax revenues to drop by 48 billion euros -lrb- 64 billion us dollars -rrb- this year , according to the german daily handelsblatt .
official november estimates put tax revenues at 572 billion euros , but the handelsblatt on saturday quoted government sources as saying that only 524 billion euros are expected to reach the treasury in 2009 .
the finance ministry declined to confirm the figures on saturday , pointing to a three-day meeting in bad kreuznach where experts will gather on tuesday to draw up an official tax estimate .
" estimates are not revenues " although the terms billion , and even trillion , have been used rather inflationary in the wake of the global credit crunch , a potential 48-billion-euro shortfall is no trifling matter .
especially as forecasts expect the german economy to shrink by an estimated six percent this year .
however , such figures still have to be taken with a pinch of salt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister peer steinbrueck is against tax cuts michael jaeger , the general secretary of the taxpayers association of europe , said people should not confuse estimates with real revenues .
he pointed out that tax revenues had actually increased by about 100 billion euros over the past four years .
" the state has n't got a problem with its tax revenue .
its got a problem with expenditure , " jaeger said .
" the basic problem is that the budget is constantly blown up , while public debt increases , and in the end the taxpayer has to foot the bill . "
german finance minister peer steinbrueck has warned that estimated tax revenues could drop by up to 350 billion euros over the next four years , and in view of the economic situation , he has so far refrained from promising tax cuts ahead of september 's federal election .
" something 's wrong with the system " jaeger not only believes that lower taxes are still possible in times of economic crisis , he is also a staunch advocate of cuts to reduce the burden on the struggling taxpayer , especially since actual tax revenues for 2008 were higher than in previous years .
" it is no contradiction to save and to invest in the proper areas , and also implement tax cuts , especially for the middle class which not only creates the jobs but also bears the brunt in times of crisis , " jaeger said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german public debt is increasing at 4,439 euros per second jaeger suggested the state could cut value added tax and do away with a special tax that was introduced after german reunification to bolster the battered east , the so-called " solidaritaetszuschlag " .
" we should have decreased public debt in the days when we had a fantastic economic upturn with abundant tax revenue .
if we create new net debt despite increasing tax revenues , then something 's wrong with the system , " he said .
according to the german taxpayers ' federation -lrb- bdst -rrb- , public debt amounted to more than 1.5 trillion euros on saturday evening , that 's more than 19,000 euros per head - it is important to give the date because germany 's debts are growing at an estimated 4,439 euros per second . nk , cg ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" from -lrb- us president barack -rrb- obama to un secretary general ban ki-moon , green issues are seen as the issues of the future , " party leader cem oezdemir said .
the environmentalist party 's platform calls for millions of new jobs by 2013 .
the party , whose seven-year government coalition with the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- ended in 2005 , said the majority of jobs would emerge in the climate-protection sector , in particular by investing in insulation technologies for buildings and in renewable energy .
expanding childcare centers and all-day schools would create further jobs , the party said in its election manifesto .
emphasis on green issues the party , which is angling to be a junior partner in the next government , said it wants to enshrine climate change prevention as a fundamental principle in germany 's constitution .
to this end , it would seek to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to levels 40 per cent below those from 1990 .
by 2040 , all energy sources should be renewable , according to the party 's platform .
the greens are also calling for subsidies for energy efficient homes and a 120-kilometer-per-hour speed limit on german highways .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " room for content " : cloth tote bags with the green party logo juergen trittin , the green party 's top candidate for the parliamentary polls , urged members to work hard to return the party to power at the federal level .
" only green policies can help to overcome the crisis .
that 's why this country needs to be ruled by the green party again , " trittin said in his speech .
" we need a coalition of ecological modernization , social justice and civil rights that can meet global challenges . "
the party also voted to back a minimum wage of 7.5 euros -lrb- $ 10 -rrb- per hour .
party members called for higher taxes for the wealthy , including an increase in the top tax bracket and higher capital gains taxes , coupled with lower welfare contributions for people on low incomes .
those measures would help soften the fiscal blow of the economic crisis , the party said .
at other party conferences , chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- formally chose her to lead their party into the september national election .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier 's left-leaning social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- chose him as their leading candidate for the upcoming vote .
liberal fdp leader , guido westerwelle , whose party could end up being the kingmakers , said he would prefer a coalition with merkel 's conservatives . sp / gb , afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the environmentalist party 's platform calls for millions of new jobs by 2013 .
the party , whose seven-year government coalition with the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- ended in 2005 , said the majority of jobs would emerge in the climate-protection sector , in particular by investing in insulation technologies for buildings and in renewable energy .

to this end , it would seek to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to levels 40 per cent below those from 1990 .

the economic downturn is definitely taking its toll , but not everybody believes the german state is short of money . the german finance ministry is expecting tax revenues to drop by 48 billion euros -lrb- 64 billion us dollars -rrb- this year , according to the german daily handelsblatt .
official november estimates put tax revenues at 572 billion euros , but the handelsblatt on saturday quoted government sources as saying that only 524 billion euros are expected to reach the treasury in 2009 .
the finance ministry declined to confirm the figures on saturday , pointing to a three-day meeting in bad kreuznach where experts will gather on tuesday to draw up an official tax estimate .
" estimates are not revenues " although the terms billion , and even trillion , have been used rather inflationary in the wake of the global credit crunch , a potential 48-billion-euro shortfall is no trifling matter .
especially as forecasts expect the german economy to shrink by an estimated six percent this year .
however , such figures still have to be taken with a pinch of salt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister peer steinbrueck is against tax cuts michael jaeger , the general secretary of the taxpayers association of europe , said people should not confuse estimates with real revenues .
he pointed out that tax revenues had actually increased by about 100 billion euros over the past four years .
" the state has n't got a problem with its tax revenue .
its got a problem with expenditure , " jaeger said .
" the basic problem is that the budget is constantly blown up , while public debt increases , and in the end the taxpayer has to foot the bill . "
german finance minister peer steinbrueck has warned that estimated tax revenues could drop by up to 350 billion euros over the next four years , and in view of the economic situation , he has so far refrained from promising tax cuts ahead of september 's federal election .
" something 's wrong with the system " jaeger not only believes that lower taxes are still possible in times of economic crisis , he is also a staunch advocate of cuts to reduce the burden on the struggling taxpayer , especially since actual tax revenues for 2008 were higher than in previous years .
" it is no contradiction to save and to invest in the proper areas , and also implement tax cuts , especially for the middle class which not only creates the jobs but also bears the brunt in times of crisis , " jaeger said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german public debt is increasing at 4,439 euros per second jaeger suggested the state could cut value added tax and do away with a special tax that was introduced after german reunification to bolster the battered east , the so-called " solidaritaetszuschlag " .
" we should have decreased public debt in the days when we had a fantastic economic upturn with abundant tax revenue .
if we create new net debt despite increasing tax revenues , then something 's wrong with the system , " he said .
according to the german taxpayers ' federation -lrb- bdst -rrb- , public debt amounted to more than 1.5 trillion euros on saturday evening , that 's more than 19,000 euros per head - it is important to give the date because germany 's debts are growing at an estimated 4,439 euros per second . nk , cg ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

demjanjuk 's son said his family did not intend to appeal that decision because " it does not make sense to appeal to other supreme court judges once the judge responsible for the relevant circuit has rejected the stay . "
the family continues to attempt to block the extradition through court filings in berlin and munich .
a us immigration and customs enforcement -lrb- ice -rrb- spokesman would not confirm that the letter was delivered , or provide details as to when the deportation would take place .
" following an order by a us immigration judge to remove john demjanjuk , the us government has been working closely with the government of germany to effectuate demjanjuk 's removal from the united states , " khaalid walls said in a statement .
" us immigration and customs enforcement will have no further comment until that has occurred . "
the decision is the latest development in a decades-long saga over demjanjuk 's wartime actions .
in a dramatic twist last month , the octogenarian won an 11th-hour reprieve when a us federal appeals court stayed his deportation shortly after he was carried out of his suburban cleveland , ohio home in a wheelchair to be placed on a flight to munich .
that respite was lifted last week when the court threw out an attempt to block deportation on health grounds .
his family quickly submitted an appeal to the supreme court , which was rejected thursday .
looking to german courts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no legal options left they also filed motions in germany to block the extradition , but a berlin court said germany is not obliged to prevent the deportation , is not in a position to stop it and can not send him back because of the pending charges in a munich court .
demjanjuk 's family has appealed that decision and on friday filed a motion in munich to rescind the arrest warrant .
born in ukraine in 1920 , demjanjuk was a soldier in the red army when he was captured by the nazis in the spring of 1942 .
he was trained at treblinka in nazi-occupied poland and served two years in the sobibor and majdanek camps , also in occupied poland , and in flossenburg in bavaria , southern germany , court filings showed .
demjanjuk has always insisted that he was forced to work for the nazis and had been mistaken by survivors for other cruel guards .
he immigrated to the united states in 1952 with his family , settling in ohio , where he found work in the auto industry and changed his name from ivan to john .
condemned to death in israel in 1988 after he was convicted of being the sadistic nazi guard nicknamed " ivan the terrible , " the verdict was overturned by the israeli supreme court because of doubts about his identity .
he was returned to the united states over strenuous objections from holocaust survivors and jewish groups , who argued there was sufficient evidence that he served as a death camp guard to warrant another trial .
demjanjuk regained his us citizenship , which was first stripped in 1981 , after an appeals court ruled in 1998 that the us government recklessly withheld exculpatory evidence .
the us government filed new charges a year later using fresh evidence that surfaced following the collapse of the soviet union , and he was again stripped of his us citizenship in 2002 .
germany issued a warrant for demjanjuk 's arrest on march 11 on charges of assisting in the murder of 29,000 jews at sobibor . nrt / mh , afp / ap / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he was trained at treblinka in nazi-occupied poland and served two years in the sobibor and majdanek camps , also in occupied poland , and in flossenburg in bavaria , southern germany , court filings showed .
demjanjuk has always insisted that he was forced to work for the nazis and had been mistaken by survivors for other cruel guards .
he immigrated to the united states in 1952 with his family , settling in ohio , where he found work in the auto industry and changed his name from ivan to john .
condemned to death in israel in 1988 after he was convicted of being the sadistic nazi guard nicknamed " ivan the terrible , " the verdict was overturned by the israeli supreme court because of doubts about his identity .
he was returned to the united states over strenuous objections from holocaust survivors and jewish groups , who argued there was sufficient evidence that he served as a death camp guard to warrant another trial .
demjanjuk regained his us citizenship , which was first stripped in 1981 , after an appeals court ruled in 1998 that the us government recklessly withheld exculpatory evidence .
the us government filed new charges a year later using fresh evidence that surfaced following the collapse of the soviet union , and he was again stripped of his us citizenship in 2002 .
germany issued a warrant for demjanjuk 's arrest on march 11 on charges of assisting in the murder of 29,000 jews at sobibor . nrt / mh , afp / ap / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

demjanjuk 's son said his family did not intend to appeal that decision because " it does not make sense to appeal to other supreme court judges once the judge responsible for the relevant circuit has rejected the stay . "
the family continues to attempt to block the extradition through court filings in berlin and munich .
a us immigration and customs enforcement -lrb- ice -rrb- spokesman would not confirm that the letter was delivered , or provide details as to when the deportation would take place .
" following an order by a us immigration judge to remove john demjanjuk , the us government has been working closely with the government of germany to effectuate demjanjuk 's removal from the united states , " khaalid walls said in a statement .
" us immigration and customs enforcement will have no further comment until that has occurred . "
the decision is the latest development in a decades-long saga over demjanjuk 's wartime actions .
in a dramatic twist last month , the octogenarian won an 11th-hour reprieve when a us federal appeals court stayed his deportation shortly after he was carried out of his suburban cleveland , ohio home in a wheelchair to be placed on a flight to munich .
that respite was lifted last week when the court threw out an attempt to block deportation on health grounds .
his family quickly submitted an appeal to the supreme court , which was rejected thursday .
looking to german courts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no legal options left they also filed motions in germany to block the extradition , but a berlin court said germany is not obliged to prevent the deportation , is not in a position to stop it and can not send him back because of the pending charges in a munich court .

she also challenged the opposition left party , made up of reformed communists to clearly define their relationship to the gdr past .
the speech by merkel , who grew up in the communist state , was part of this year 's anniversary commemorations marking the opening of the cold war barrier on november 9 , 1989 in a peaceful revolution .
it also coincded with the 20th anniversary of the east german local elections of may 7 , 1989 .
merkel said the civil rights activists who protested against those rigged elections ushered in the end of the dictatorship .

amid economic challenges , zuma faces a difficult time bringing different factions together . heavy rains drenched the south african capital pretoria as crowds gathered saturday morning to watch jacob zuma 's inauguration .
however , when it was time to take the oath of office , the sun broke through the clouds and jacob zuma became the fourth democratically elected president of south africa .
he began his inaugural address by thanking nelson mandela .
" he made reconciliation the central theme of his term of office .
we will not deviate from that nation building task .
thank you madiba for showing us the way , " said zuma , referring to mandela by his clan name .
it has been a long journey for the 67-year old zuma who herded cows as a child and left school as a teenager to support his impoverished family .
his political life began in the trade unionist movement and he joined the african national congress in 1959 .
in 1963 he was arrested as he was leaving the country and spent 10 years imprisoned on robben island with fellow anc member and former president nelson mandela .
nearly 30 heads of state were in attendance including african union chairman libyan leader muammar al-qadhafi , zimbabwe 's president robert mugabe and king mswati iii of swaziland , africa 's last absolute monarch .
there were no heads of state of western powers in attendance .
all of them sent lower ranking ministers as representatives .
many challenges ahead zuma takes office at a time of slowing growth in south africa which is enduring its first recession in 17 years .
investors are keenly watching the makeup of his economic team , and are paying close attention to the fate of finance minister trevor manuel , a man who has been praised for his fiscal management .
analysts are also watching to see how zuma will reward the communists and unionists who stood by him throughout his career and foreign investors fear he may move the economy left .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anc supporters worked the election zuma acknowledged the tough economic climate in his speech saying , " we must acknowledge that we find ourselves in difficult economic times .
jobs are being lost in every economy across the world .
we will not be spared the negative impact , and are beginning to feel the pinch . "
given the global economic downturn , zuma may be hard pressed to make good on his generous promises of more jobs and improved services . av / ai , reuters / afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

amid economic challenges , zuma faces a difficult time bringing different factions together . heavy rains drenched the south african capital pretoria as crowds gathered saturday morning to watch jacob zuma 's inauguration .

the pope met with muslim religious leaders , and members of the diplomatic corps in jordan in front of the al-hussein bin talal mosque in amman .
" often it is ideological manipulation of religion , sometimes with political goals , that is the catalyst for tensions and schisms , " the 82-year-old pontiff said .
" today muslims and christians - because of the burden of their mutual history full of misunderstandings - have to strive to be seen and recognized as believers truly loyal to the commandments . "
pope benedict failed to use the opportunity to apologise over the so-called regensburg lecture , which he gave in 2006 .
in that speech the pontiff quoted a medieval christian emperor who criticised teachings of the prophet muhammad as " evil and inhuman . "
jordanian islamist leaders , still sensitive about the pontiff 's comments , had demanded his visit be cancelled .
pope urges mutual respect and cooperation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi prays close to the antique basilica and moses memorial on monte nebo in an address at the moses memorial church on mount nebo on saturday morning , the pope called for reconciliation between christians and jews and reminded the two faiths of their shared heritage .
" may our encounter today inspire in us a renewed love for the canon of sacred scripture , " he said , " and a desire to overcome all obstacles to the reconciliation of christians and jews in mutual respect and cooperation . "
the 840-metre summit of mount nebo , some 40 kilometres southwest of the capital amman , is holy to jews , christians and muslims alike .
the site is where the bible says god showed moses the promised land .
" the ancient tradition of pilgrimage to the holy places also reminds us of the inseparable bond between the church and the jewish people , " he said .
" his example reminds us that we too are part of the ageless pilgrimage of god 's people through history . "
after descending from the mountain , hundreds of people waving jordanian and vatican flags greeted benedict in the town of madaba , where he visited the greek orthodox basilica of st george , famous for its sixth century mosaic map of biblical palestine .
while in madaba , benedict blessed the cornerstone of a new catholic university being built there with help from jordan , a muslim country keen to maintain interfaith harmony .
" belief in god does not suppress the truth ; to the contrary , it encourages it , " said the former german theology professor .
" religion is disfigured when it is pressed into the service of ignorance or prejudice , contempt , violence and abuse . "
he said the new university , which will teach in english , would produce " generations of qualified men and women of christian , muslim and of other religions ... educated in the values of wisdom , integrity , tolerance and peace .

“ large number of militants were killed , including hardcore elements , and many militants injured , ” a senior military official said .
“ the operation is in full swing . ”
on friday , the military said it had killed more than 140 militants in air and ground attacks .
the figures could not be independently confirmed .
the pakistan military has deployed 15,000 security forces in an effort to eliminate the estimated 5,000 extremist militants in northwest pakistan .
the operations began late last month when the insurgents advanced to within 100 kilometers -lrb- 60 miles -rrb- of the capital , islamabad .
on a state visit to the united states , pakistani president asif ali zardari described the escalating conflict as war .
“ this is an offensive – this is war .
if they kill our soldiers , then we do the same , ” zardari told pbs public television on friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : local residents in mingora , the capital of swat valley , have been trying to flee the fighting on saturday prime minister yousef raza gilani confirmed pakistan 's resolve .

" today we 're sending a signal that democrats stand united against right-wing radicalism , racism and agitation , " said reinhard buetikofer , former head of the green party , who took part in the rally in downtown cologne .
cologne mayor fritz schramma said the peaceful protests by residents on saturday showed that the city is " open and tolerant . "
he also said cologne was " committed when it comes to defending these values . "
security was tight as more than 5,000 police officers , outfitted with water cannons and riot gear , cordoned off the square where the " anti-islam " demonstration took place .
the authorities were concerned that there could be clashes between the two sides , as has frequently been the case in the past . cologne police had banned the right-wing groups from holding a high-profile demonstration in front of the cologne cathedral in the city center and instead allowed them to assemble at another , more obscure , square in the deutz district .
police say there were about 300 people at the right-wing " pro koeln " and " pro nrw " rally .
the groups , which are campaigning against the building of a large new mosque in the city , held a larger rally last september which was joined by members of nationalist parties elsewhere in europe .
that protest sparked violent clashes and rioting by far-left demonstrators .
the two anti-islam groups are opposed to the building of mosques and what they see as an influx of moslem immigration into germany .
mayor schramma vowed that the forthcoming national elections in september would not be used to exploit ethnic or religious tensions .

" today we 're sending a signal that democrats stand united against right-wing radicalism , racism and agitation , " said reinhard buetikofer , former head of the green party , who took part in the rally in downtown cologne .
cologne mayor fritz schramma said the peaceful protests by residents on saturday showed that the city is " open and tolerant . "
he also said cologne was " committed when it comes to defending these values . "
security was tight as more than 5,000 police officers , outfitted with water cannons and riot gear , cordoned off the square where the " anti-islam " demonstration took place .
the authorities were concerned that there could be clashes between the two sides , as has frequently been the case in the past . cologne police had banned the right-wing groups from holding a high-profile demonstration in front of the cologne cathedral in the city center and instead allowed them to assemble at another , more obscure , square in the deutz district .
police say there were about 300 people at the right-wing " pro koeln " and " pro nrw " rally .
the groups , which are campaigning against the building of a large new mosque in the city , held a larger rally last september which was joined by members of nationalist parties elsewhere in europe .

defending champions bayern munich won 3-1 against energie cottbus . gomez proved unstoppable after his first goal just 29 seconds into the game - the fastest goal of the season - when he headed in a cross from roberto hilbert .
the germany striker added his second from close range in the 20th minute , with wolfsburg 's defense in disarray .
wolfsburg hit back before halftime with edin dzeko netting his 20th goal of the season .
but gomez gave wolfsburg no chance to come back when he fired in a left-foot shot from 14 meters out in the 63rd minute on a sami khedira pass before ending his spectacular performance with another header after 77 minutes .
" i suppose the whole week everybody will be talking about me , so i am glad our next game is on wednesday -lrb- at schalke -rrb- , " gomez said .
" we now have to win our games and see if we can achieve the maximum .
but , we should n't think that just because we have now beaten the leaders , the rest will now come automatically . "
it was a second successive away defeat for wolfsburg , who lost 2-0 in cottbus two weeks ago , and comes three days after coach felix magath confirmed he would be leaving for schalke at the end of the season .
" we have lost our advantage , but we are still first , " magath said .
" i think we can still be champions .
from three games , we have two at home , and it 's important that on tuesday we find our home rhythm against dortmund . " bayern wins against cottbus defending champions bayern drew level on points with wolfsburg after a 3-1 win against relegation-threatened energie cottbus .
jose ernesto , martin demichelis and lukas podolski scored for bayern .
hertha berlin , meanwhile , kept alive their hopes of a first bundesliga title with a 2-0 win over visiting bochum .
with three matches remaining , wolfsburg and bayern have 60 points , hertha is on 59 and stuttgart has 58 .

" from -lrb- us president barack -rrb- obama to un secretary general ban ki-moon , green issues are seen as the issues of the future , " party leader cem oezdemir said .
the environmentalist party 's platform calls for millions of new jobs by 2013 .
the party , whose seven-year government coalition with the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- ended in 2005 , said the majority of jobs would emerge in the climate-protection sector , in particular by investing in insulation technologies for buildings and in renewable energy .
expanding childcare centers and all-day schools would create further jobs , the party said in its election manifesto .
emphasis on green issues the party , which is angling to be a junior partner in the next government , said it wants to enshrine climate change prevention as a fundamental principle in germany 's constitution .
to this end , it would seek to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to levels 40 per cent below those from 1990 .
by 2040 , all energy sources should be renewable , according to the party 's platform .
the greens are also calling for subsidies for energy efficient homes and a 120-kilometer-per-hour speed limit on german highways .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " room for content " : cloth tote bags with the green party logo juergen trittin , the green party 's top candidate for the parliamentary polls , urged members to work hard to return the party to power at the federal level .
" only green policies can help to overcome the crisis .
that 's why this country needs to be ruled by the green party again , " trittin said in his speech .
" we need a coalition of ecological modernization , social justice and civil rights that can meet global challenges . "
the party also voted to back a minimum wage of 7.5 euros -lrb- $ 10 -rrb- per hour .
party members called for higher taxes for the wealthy , including an increase in the top tax bracket and higher capital gains taxes , coupled with lower welfare contributions for people on low incomes .
those measures would help soften the fiscal blow of the economic crisis , the party said .
at other party conferences , chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- formally chose her to lead their party into the september national election .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier 's left-leaning social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- chose him as their leading candidate for the upcoming vote .

emphasis on green issues the party , which is angling to be a junior partner in the next government , said it wants to enshrine climate change prevention as a fundamental principle in germany 's constitution .
to this end , it would seek to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to levels 40 per cent below those from 1990 .
by 2040 , all energy sources should be renewable , according to the party 's platform .
the greens are also calling for subsidies for energy efficient homes and a 120-kilometer-per-hour speed limit on german highways .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 09.05.2009 report : germany facing 48-billion-euro tax shortfall großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's estimated tax revenues are to drop , while public debt continues to soar germany is reportedly facing a severe slump in tax revenues .
the economic downturn is definitely taking its toll , but not everybody believes the german state is short of money . the german finance ministry is expecting tax revenues to drop by 48 billion euros -lrb- 64 billion us dollars -rrb- this year , according to the german daily handelsblatt .
official november estimates put tax revenues at 572 billion euros , but the handelsblatt on saturday quoted government sources as saying that only 524 billion euros are expected to reach the treasury in 2009 .
the finance ministry declined to confirm the figures on saturday , pointing to a three-day meeting in bad kreuznach where experts will gather on tuesday to draw up an official tax estimate .
" estimates are not revenues " although the terms billion , and even trillion , have been used rather inflationary in the wake of the global credit crunch , a potential 48-billion-euro shortfall is no trifling matter .
especially as forecasts expect the german economy to shrink by an estimated six percent this year .
however , such figures still have to be taken with a pinch of salt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister peer steinbrueck is against tax cuts michael jaeger , the general secretary of the taxpayers association of europe , said people should not confuse estimates with real revenues .
he pointed out that tax revenues had actually increased by about 100 billion euros over the past four years .
" the state has n't got a problem with its tax revenue .
its got a problem with expenditure , " jaeger said .
" the basic problem is that the budget is constantly blown up , while public debt increases , and in the end the taxpayer has to foot the bill . "
german finance minister peer steinbrueck has warned that estimated tax revenues could drop by up to 350 billion euros over the next four years , and in view of the economic situation , he has so far refrained from promising tax cuts ahead of september 's federal election .
" something 's wrong with the system " jaeger not only believes that lower taxes are still possible in times of economic crisis , he is also a staunch advocate of cuts to reduce the burden on the struggling taxpayer , especially since actual tax revenues for 2008 were higher than in previous years .
" it is no contradiction to save and to invest in the proper areas , and also implement tax cuts , especially for the middle class which not only creates the jobs but also bears the brunt in times of crisis , " jaeger said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german public debt is increasing at 4,439 euros per second jaeger suggested the state could cut value added tax and do away with a special tax that was introduced after german reunification to bolster the battered east , the so-called " solidaritaetszuschlag " .
" we should have decreased public debt in the days when we had a fantastic economic upturn with abundant tax revenue .
if we create new net debt despite increasing tax revenues , then something 's wrong with the system , " he said .
according to the german taxpayers ' federation -lrb- bdst -rrb- , public debt amounted to more than 1.5 trillion euros on saturday evening , that 's more than 19,000 euros per head - it is important to give the date because germany 's debts are growing at an estimated 4,439 euros per second . nk , cg ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

defending champions bayern munich won 3-1 against energie cottbus . gomez proved unstoppable after his first goal just 29 seconds into the game - the fastest goal of the season - when he headed in a cross from roberto hilbert .
the germany striker added his second from close range in the 20th minute , with wolfsburg 's defense in disarray .
wolfsburg hit back before halftime with edin dzeko netting his 20th goal of the season .
but gomez gave wolfsburg no chance to come back when he fired in a left-foot shot from 14 meters out in the 63rd minute on a sami khedira pass before ending his spectacular performance with another header after 77 minutes .
" i suppose the whole week everybody will be talking about me , so i am glad our next game is on wednesday -lrb- at schalke -rrb- , " gomez said .
" we now have to win our games and see if we can achieve the maximum .
but , we should n't think that just because we have now beaten the leaders , the rest will now come automatically . "
it was a second successive away defeat for wolfsburg , who lost 2-0 in cottbus two weeks ago , and comes three days after coach felix magath confirmed he would be leaving for schalke at the end of the season .
" we have lost our advantage , but we are still first , " magath said .
" i think we can still be champions .
from three games , we have two at home , and it 's important that on tuesday we find our home rhythm against dortmund . " bayern wins against cottbus defending champions bayern drew level on points with wolfsburg after a 3-1 win against relegation-threatened energie cottbus .
jose ernesto , martin demichelis and lukas podolski scored for bayern .
hertha berlin , meanwhile , kept alive their hopes of a first bundesliga title with a 2-0 win over visiting bochum .

" today we 're sending a signal that democrats stand united against right-wing radicalism , racism and agitation , " said reinhard buetikofer , former head of the green party , who took part in the rally in downtown cologne .

the pope met with muslim religious leaders , and members of the diplomatic corps in jordan in front of the al-hussein bin talal mosque in amman .
" often it is ideological manipulation of religion , sometimes with political goals , that is the catalyst for tensions and schisms , " the 82-year-old pontiff said .
" today muslims and christians - because of the burden of their mutual history full of misunderstandings - have to strive to be seen and recognized as believers truly loyal to the commandments . "
pope benedict failed to use the opportunity to apologise over the so-called regensburg lecture , which he gave in 2006 .
in that speech the pontiff quoted a medieval christian emperor who criticised teachings of the prophet muhammad as " evil and inhuman . "
jordanian islamist leaders , still sensitive about the pontiff 's comments , had demanded his visit be cancelled .
pope urges mutual respect and cooperation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi prays close to the antique basilica and moses memorial on monte nebo in an address at the moses memorial church on mount nebo on saturday morning , the pope called for reconciliation between christians and jews and reminded the two faiths of their shared heritage .
" may our encounter today inspire in us a renewed love for the canon of sacred scripture , " he said , " and a desire to overcome all obstacles to the reconciliation of christians and jews in mutual respect and cooperation . "
the 840-metre summit of mount nebo , some 40 kilometres southwest of the capital amman , is holy to jews , christians and muslims alike .
the site is where the bible says god showed moses the promised land .
" the ancient tradition of pilgrimage to the holy places also reminds us of the inseparable bond between the church and the jewish people , " he said .
" his example reminds us that we too are part of the ageless pilgrimage of god 's people through history . "
after descending from the mountain , hundreds of people waving jordanian and vatican flags greeted benedict in the town of madaba , where he visited the greek orthodox basilica of st george , famous for its sixth century mosaic map of biblical palestine .
while in madaba , benedict blessed the cornerstone of a new catholic university being built there with help from jordan , a muslim country keen to maintain interfaith harmony .
" belief in god does not suppress the truth ; to the contrary , it encourages it , " said the former german theology professor .
" religion is disfigured when it is pressed into the service of ignorance or prejudice , contempt , violence and abuse . "
he said the new university , which will teach in english , would produce " generations of qualified men and women of christian , muslim and of other religions ... educated in the values of wisdom , integrity , tolerance and peace .

she also challenged the opposition left party , made up of reformed communists to clearly define their relationship to the gdr past .
the speech by merkel , who grew up in the communist state , was part of this year 's anniversary commemorations marking the opening of the cold war barrier on november 9 , 1989 in a peaceful revolution .
it also coincded with the 20th anniversary of the east german local elections of may 7 , 1989 .
merkel said the civil rights activists who protested against those rigged elections ushered in the end of the dictatorship .
" may 7 was the beginning of the end of the gdr , " merkel said earlier this week .
" in this year of the peaceful revolution we should think of those who showed courage , by revealing the local elections to be a sham , or by escaping the gdr in protest . "
the beginning of the end merkel described may 7 1989 as the day the " system had its mask torn from its face . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlin wall came down for good in 1989 speaking at a forum discussion in berlin , merkel paid tribute to the role of the church in the former gdr .
they gave a voice to calls for " freedom and change " , said merkel . the german chancellor spoke of the special strength of the peaceful revolution and the luck that made dreams become reality . despite positive memories of the gdr for some germans , merkel said that its was an " unjust state " where surveillance and spying were party of everyday life , where there was no place for an independent justice or free press .
on tuesday , chancellor merkel became the first german leader to tour the main berlin prison run by the feared east german stasi secret police .
merkel said the hohenschoenhausen jail , named for the northeastern district where it is located , was a symbol of a " sad chapter in the history " of the communist state .
" this drives home the brutality with which people 's dignity was abused , " she said , after meeting with former prisoners of the facility .
" it is crucial that this chapter of the history of the east german dictatorship is not covered up or forgotten . "
she also met with a group of pupils and underlined the importance of instruction in schools about east german history as today 's graduates would have no personal memory of the country 's four-decade-long division . nrt / msh , epd / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

demjanjuk 's son said his family did not intend to appeal that decision because " it does not make sense to appeal to other supreme court judges once the judge responsible for the relevant circuit has rejected the stay . "
the family continues to attempt to block the extradition through court filings in berlin and munich .
a us immigration and customs enforcement -lrb- ice -rrb- spokesman would not confirm that the letter was delivered , or provide details as to when the deportation would take place .
" following an order by a us immigration judge to remove john demjanjuk , the us government has been working closely with the government of germany to effectuate demjanjuk 's removal from the united states , " khaalid walls said in a statement .
" us immigration and customs enforcement will have no further comment until that has occurred . "
the decision is the latest development in a decades-long saga over demjanjuk 's wartime actions .
in a dramatic twist last month , the octogenarian won an 11th-hour reprieve when a us federal appeals court stayed his deportation shortly after he was carried out of his suburban cleveland , ohio home in a wheelchair to be placed on a flight to munich .
that respite was lifted last week when the court threw out an attempt to block deportation on health grounds .
his family quickly submitted an appeal to the supreme court , which was rejected thursday .
looking to german courts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no legal options left they also filed motions in germany to block the extradition , but a berlin court said germany is not obliged to prevent the deportation , is not in a position to stop it and can not send him back because of the pending charges in a munich court .
demjanjuk 's family has appealed that decision and on friday filed a motion in munich to rescind the arrest warrant .
born in ukraine in 1920 , demjanjuk was a soldier in the red army when he was captured by the nazis in the spring of 1942 .
he was trained at treblinka in nazi-occupied poland and served two years in the sobibor and majdanek camps , also in occupied poland , and in flossenburg in bavaria , southern germany , court filings showed .
demjanjuk has always insisted that he was forced to work for the nazis and had been mistaken by survivors for other cruel guards .
he immigrated to the united states in 1952 with his family , settling in ohio , where he found work in the auto industry and changed his name from ivan to john .
condemned to death in israel in 1988 after he was convicted of being the sadistic nazi guard nicknamed " ivan the terrible , " the verdict was overturned by the israeli supreme court because of doubts about his identity .
he was returned to the united states over strenuous objections from holocaust survivors and jewish groups , who argued there was sufficient evidence that he served as a death camp guard to warrant another trial .
demjanjuk regained his us citizenship , which was first stripped in 1981 , after an appeals court ruled in 1998 that the us government recklessly withheld exculpatory evidence .
the us government filed new charges a year later using fresh evidence that surfaced following the collapse of the soviet union , and he was again stripped of his us citizenship in 2002 .
germany issued a warrant for demjanjuk 's arrest on march 11 on charges of assisting in the murder of 29,000 jews at sobibor . nrt / mh , afp / ap / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

latest case in point : the us now says it wants a seat on the un human rights council , a body george w. bush had shunned . back in 2008 , the bush administration decided to " disengage " from the un rights organization , saying it went too far in its tolerance of repressive states . but the new us administration , already more active in the council 's deliberations , now says it is ready to take on a leadership role . as one of three countries running for three vacant spots on the north america / europe slate , the us is virtually assured to win a seat on the regionally organized , 47-member council . un , rights groups greet change of heart " human rights are an essential element of american global foreign policy … with others , we will engage in the work of improving the un human rights system , " us secretary of state hillary clinton said in a statement . un officials and human rights groups applauded the announcement . the rotating un human rights council presidency is currently held by nigeria 's ambassador to the un , martin uhomoibhi . " we are very delighted to hear that united states wants to come back , " uhomoibhi said .
" we believe they will be a force for good in the council . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : council president uhomoibhi welcomed the move juliette de rivero , the spokeswoman for human-rights watchdog human rights watch in geneva , said they were " particularly happy about the decision , which we had long been advocating for . " but opponents say the un body is so deeply flawed that the us would be better served by continuing its boycott . the current human rights council is a reformed version of its predecessor , the un commission on human rights .
that organization was discredited for allowing countries with abominable rights records - such as sudan and zimbabwe , to join and to form powerful voting blocs that critics say stood in the way of change . critic : council ignores abuses , allows bias the new human rights council , which was formed in 2006 , has greater transparency , but critics say it is still sorely lacking .
they complain that its structures shield countries that continue to flaunt human rights - like china , cuba and saudi arabia - while israel and other democracies are disproportionately targeted . and they argue recent council condemnations of free speech are anti-democratic . the revamped council " has continued to focus biased attention on israel to the detriment of a balanced approach to the palestinian-israeli situation , " said brett schaefer , a public policy analyst at conservative us think tank the heritage foundation . " and it has ignored rampant human-rights abuses in a number of different countries around the world - such as china , cuba and zimbabwe - that , in their extent , scope and history actually dwarf those human rights abuses that are going on in the israeli-palestinian conflict . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights watch said the body is not perfect , but it is better than nothing schaefer and other critics recommend the un set criteria that member countries would have to meet before they are given decision-making power on human rights . that would fix the " main flaw , " he said .
" right now , the inmates run the asylum . the countries that you want most to scrutinize are those that are driving the agenda . … and just having the us on the council is not going to overcome that fact . " but juliette de rivero of human rights watch - who had found the bush administration 's decision to officially disengage from council business " a counterproductive and short sighted victory for abusive states " - believes the us will do more good than harm on the council . the guantanamo example she acknowledged that " a lot can be done to improve the work of the council , particularly in specific country situations . " still , she noted that the us 's decision to close the illegal prison in guantanamo bay , cuba " can be an example for other countries that you do need to acknowledge the mistakes you have committed , and to address human rights violations . " in other words , the us could be a good example . " all countries have human rights issues and the council 's mandate is to examine them , " she said . human rights council president uhomoibhi also admitted that the council is " not a perfect institution . "
but he believes it has the potential to make a contribution to the promotion of human rights - and that countries have a responsibility to contribute to that potential . ' foxes are guarding the chickens ' many critics take a less optimistic view of the situation , however .
un watchdog groups un watch and freedom watch published a study saying seven of the 18 countries that are expected to take seats on the council next week were completely unqualified to sit on the body , based on an annual human-rights score issued by freedom watch . electing these countries to the council is like " choosing the foxes to guard the chickens , " wrote un watch head hillel neuer . in fact , critics say , the us presence on the council will not change the dynamics of the council or help bring about an end to human-rights violations - it simply means the us will lose any leverage it has to protest change , the heritage foundation 's schaefer argues . the us will be one of 47 votes , and " one of 11 or 12 that actually are willing to step forward and champion human rights .
the rest of those countries are either indifferent , or hostile to human rights , " schaefer said . " in this case , being there is not part of the solution .

" today we 're sending a signal that democrats stand united against right-wing radicalism , racism and agitation , " said reinhard buetikofer , former head of the green party , who took part in the rally in downtown cologne .
cologne mayor fritz schramma said the peaceful protests by residents on saturday showed that the city is " open and tolerant . "
he also said cologne was " committed when it comes to defending these values . "
security was tight as more than 5,000 police officers , outfitted with water cannons and riot gear , cordoned off the square where the " anti-islam " demonstration took place .
the authorities were concerned that there could be clashes between the two sides , as has frequently been the case in the past . cologne police had banned the right-wing groups from holding a high-profile demonstration in front of the cologne cathedral in the city center and instead allowed them to assemble at another , more obscure , square in the deutz district .
police say there were about 300 people at the right-wing " pro koeln " and " pro nrw " rally .
the groups , which are campaigning against the building of a large new mosque in the city , held a larger rally last september which was joined by members of nationalist parties elsewhere in europe .
that protest sparked violent clashes and rioting by far-left demonstrators .
the two anti-islam groups are opposed to the building of mosques and what they see as an influx of moslem immigration into germany .
mayor schramma vowed that the forthcoming national elections in september would not be used to exploit ethnic or religious tensions .

" today we 're sending a signal that democrats stand united against right-wing radicalism , racism and agitation , " said reinhard buetikofer , former head of the green party , who took part in the rally in downtown cologne .
cologne mayor fritz schramma said the peaceful protests by residents on saturday showed that the city is " open and tolerant . "
he also said cologne was " committed when it comes to defending these values . "
security was tight as more than 5,000 police officers , outfitted with water cannons and riot gear , cordoned off the square where the " anti-islam " demonstration took place .
the authorities were concerned that there could be clashes between the two sides , as has frequently been the case in the past . cologne police had banned the right-wing groups from holding a high-profile demonstration in front of the cologne cathedral in the city center and instead allowed them to assemble at another , more obscure , square in the deutz district .
police say there were about 300 people at the right-wing " pro koeln " and " pro nrw " rally .
the groups , which are campaigning against the building of a large new mosque in the city , held a larger rally last september which was joined by members of nationalist parties elsewhere in europe .
that protest sparked violent clashes and rioting by far-left demonstrators .
the two anti-islam groups are opposed to the building of mosques and what they see as an influx of moslem immigration into germany .
mayor schramma vowed that the forthcoming national elections in september would not be used to exploit ethnic or religious tensions .
there will be no " sordid election campaign on the back of our foreign fellow citizens , " he said . sp , gb / dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the pope met with muslim religious leaders , and members of the diplomatic corps in jordan in front of the al-hussein bin talal mosque in amman .
" often it is ideological manipulation of religion , sometimes with political goals , that is the catalyst for tensions and schisms , " the 82-year-old pontiff said .
" today muslims and christians - because of the burden of their mutual history full of misunderstandings - have to strive to be seen and recognized as believers truly loyal to the commandments . "
pope benedict failed to use the opportunity to apologise over the so-called regensburg lecture , which he gave in 2006 .

the 840-metre summit of mount nebo , some 40 kilometres southwest of the capital amman , is holy to jews , christians and muslims alike .
the site is where the bible says god showed moses the promised land .
" the ancient tradition of pilgrimage to the holy places also reminds us of the inseparable bond between the church and the jewish people , " he said .
" his example reminds us that we too are part of the ageless pilgrimage of god 's people through history . "
after descending from the mountain , hundreds of people waving jordanian and vatican flags greeted benedict in the town of madaba , where he visited the greek orthodox basilica of st george , famous for its sixth century mosaic map of biblical palestine .
while in madaba , benedict blessed the cornerstone of a new catholic university being built there with help from jordan , a muslim country keen to maintain interfaith harmony .
" belief in god does not suppress the truth ; to the contrary , it encourages it , " said the former german theology professor .
" religion is disfigured when it is pressed into the service of ignorance or prejudice , contempt , violence and abuse . "
he said the new university , which will teach in english , would produce " generations of qualified men and women of christian , muslim and of other religions ... educated in the values of wisdom , integrity , tolerance and peace .

latest case in point : the us now says it wants a seat on the un human rights council , a body george w. bush had shunned . back in 2008 , the bush administration decided to " disengage " from the un rights organization , saying it went too far in its tolerance of repressive states . but the new us administration , already more active in the council 's deliberations , now says it is ready to take on a leadership role . as one of three countries running for three vacant spots on the north america / europe slate , the us is virtually assured to win a seat on the regionally organized , 47-member council . un , rights groups greet change of heart " human rights are an essential element of american global foreign policy … with others , we will engage in the work of improving the un human rights system , " us secretary of state hillary clinton said in a statement . un officials and human rights groups applauded the announcement . the rotating un human rights council presidency is currently held by nigeria 's ambassador to the un , martin uhomoibhi . " we are very delighted to hear that united states wants to come back , " uhomoibhi said .
" we believe they will be a force for good in the council . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : council president uhomoibhi welcomed the move juliette de rivero , the spokeswoman for human-rights watchdog human rights watch in geneva , said they were " particularly happy about the decision , which we had long been advocating for . " but opponents say the un body is so deeply flawed that the us would be better served by continuing its boycott . the current human rights council is a reformed version of its predecessor , the un commission on human rights .
that organization was discredited for allowing countries with abominable rights records - such as sudan and zimbabwe , to join and to form powerful voting blocs that critics say stood in the way of change . critic : council ignores abuses , allows bias the new human rights council , which was formed in 2006 , has greater transparency , but critics say it is still sorely lacking .
they complain that its structures shield countries that continue to flaunt human rights - like china , cuba and saudi arabia - while israel and other democracies are disproportionately targeted . and they argue recent council condemnations of free speech are anti-democratic . the revamped council " has continued to focus biased attention on israel to the detriment of a balanced approach to the palestinian-israeli situation , " said brett schaefer , a public policy analyst at conservative us think tank the heritage foundation . " and it has ignored rampant human-rights abuses in a number of different countries around the world - such as china , cuba and zimbabwe - that , in their extent , scope and history actually dwarf those human rights abuses that are going on in the israeli-palestinian conflict . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights watch said the body is not perfect , but it is better than nothing schaefer and other critics recommend the un set criteria that member countries would have to meet before they are given decision-making power on human rights . that would fix the " main flaw , " he said .
" right now , the inmates run the asylum . the countries that you want most to scrutinize are those that are driving the agenda . … and just having the us on the council is not going to overcome that fact . " but juliette de rivero of human rights watch - who had found the bush administration 's decision to officially disengage from council business " a counterproductive and short sighted victory for abusive states " - believes the us will do more good than harm on the council . the guantanamo example she acknowledged that " a lot can be done to improve the work of the council , particularly in specific country situations . " still , she noted that the us 's decision to close the illegal prison in guantanamo bay , cuba " can be an example for other countries that you do need to acknowledge the mistakes you have committed , and to address human rights violations . " in other words , the us could be a good example . " all countries have human rights issues and the council 's mandate is to examine them , " she said . human rights council president uhomoibhi also admitted that the council is " not a perfect institution . "
but he believes it has the potential to make a contribution to the promotion of human rights - and that countries have a responsibility to contribute to that potential . ' foxes are guarding the chickens ' many critics take a less optimistic view of the situation , however .
un watchdog groups un watch and freedom watch published a study saying seven of the 18 countries that are expected to take seats on the council next week were completely unqualified to sit on the body , based on an annual human-rights score issued by freedom watch . electing these countries to the council is like " choosing the foxes to guard the chickens , " wrote un watch head hillel neuer . in fact , critics say , the us presence on the council will not change the dynamics of the council or help bring about an end to human-rights violations - it simply means the us will lose any leverage it has to protest change , the heritage foundation 's schaefer argues . the us will be one of 47 votes , and " one of 11 or 12 that actually are willing to step forward and champion human rights .
the rest of those countries are either indifferent , or hostile to human rights , " schaefer said . " in this case , being there is not part of the solution .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : council president uhomoibhi welcomed the move juliette de rivero , the spokeswoman for human-rights watchdog human rights watch in geneva , said they were " particularly happy about the decision , which we had long been advocating for . " but opponents say the un body is so deeply flawed that the us would be better served by continuing its boycott . the current human rights council is a reformed version of its predecessor , the un commission on human rights .
that organization was discredited for allowing countries with abominable rights records - such as sudan and zimbabwe , to join and to form powerful voting blocs that critics say stood in the way of change . critic : council ignores abuses , allows bias the new human rights council , which was formed in 2006 , has greater transparency , but critics say it is still sorely lacking .
they complain that its structures shield countries that continue to flaunt human rights - like china , cuba and saudi arabia - while israel and other democracies are disproportionately targeted . and they argue recent council condemnations of free speech are anti-democratic . the revamped council " has continued to focus biased attention on israel to the detriment of a balanced approach to the palestinian-israeli situation , " said brett schaefer , a public policy analyst at conservative us think tank the heritage foundation . " and it has ignored rampant human-rights abuses in a number of different countries around the world - such as china , cuba and zimbabwe - that , in their extent , scope and history actually dwarf those human rights abuses that are going on in the israeli-palestinian conflict . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights watch said the body is not perfect , but it is better than nothing schaefer and other critics recommend the un set criteria that member countries would have to meet before they are given decision-making power on human rights . that would fix the " main flaw , " he said .
" right now , the inmates run the asylum . the countries that you want most to scrutinize are those that are driving the agenda . … and just having the us on the council is not going to overcome that fact . " but juliette de rivero of human rights watch - who had found the bush administration 's decision to officially disengage from council business " a counterproductive and short sighted victory for abusive states " - believes the us will do more good than harm on the council . the guantanamo example she acknowledged that " a lot can be done to improve the work of the council , particularly in specific country situations . " still , she noted that the us 's decision to close the illegal prison in guantanamo bay , cuba " can be an example for other countries that you do need to acknowledge the mistakes you have committed , and to address human rights violations . " in other words , the us could be a good example . " all countries have human rights issues and the council 's mandate is to examine them , " she said . human rights council president uhomoibhi also admitted that the council is " not a perfect institution . "
but he believes it has the potential to make a contribution to the promotion of human rights - and that countries have a responsibility to contribute to that potential . ' foxes are guarding the chickens ' many critics take a less optimistic view of the situation , however .
un watchdog groups un watch and freedom watch published a study saying seven of the 18 countries that are expected to take seats on the council next week were completely unqualified to sit on the body , based on an annual human-rights score issued by freedom watch . electing these countries to the council is like " choosing the foxes to guard the chickens , " wrote un watch head hillel neuer . in fact , critics say , the us presence on the council will not change the dynamics of the council or help bring about an end to human-rights violations - it simply means the us will lose any leverage it has to protest change , the heritage foundation 's schaefer argues . the us will be one of 47 votes , and " one of 11 or 12 that actually are willing to step forward and champion human rights .
the rest of those countries are either indifferent , or hostile to human rights , " schaefer said . " in this case , being there is not part of the solution .

the economic downturn is definitely taking its toll , but not everybody believes the german state is short of money . the german finance ministry is expecting tax revenues to drop by 48 billion euros -lrb- 64 billion us dollars -rrb- this year , according to the german daily handelsblatt .
official november estimates put tax revenues at 572 billion euros , but the handelsblatt on saturday quoted government sources as saying that only 524 billion euros are expected to reach the treasury in 2009 .
the finance ministry declined to confirm the figures on saturday , pointing to a three-day meeting in bad kreuznach where experts will gather on tuesday to draw up an official tax estimate .
" estimates are not revenues " although the terms billion , and even trillion , have been used rather inflationary in the wake of the global credit crunch , a potential 48-billion-euro shortfall is no trifling matter .
especially as forecasts expect the german economy to shrink by an estimated six percent this year .
however , such figures still have to be taken with a pinch of salt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister peer steinbrueck is against tax cuts michael jaeger , the general secretary of the taxpayers association of europe , said people should not confuse estimates with real revenues .
he pointed out that tax revenues had actually increased by about 100 billion euros over the past four years .
" the state has n't got a problem with its tax revenue .
its got a problem with expenditure , " jaeger said .
" the basic problem is that the budget is constantly blown up , while public debt increases , and in the end the taxpayer has to foot the bill . "
german finance minister peer steinbrueck has warned that estimated tax revenues could drop by up to 350 billion euros over the next four years , and in view of the economic situation , he has so far refrained from promising tax cuts ahead of september 's federal election .
" something 's wrong with the system " jaeger not only believes that lower taxes are still possible in times of economic crisis , he is also a staunch advocate of cuts to reduce the burden on the struggling taxpayer , especially since actual tax revenues for 2008 were higher than in previous years .
" it is no contradiction to save and to invest in the proper areas , and also implement tax cuts , especially for the middle class which not only creates the jobs but also bears the brunt in times of crisis , " jaeger said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german public debt is increasing at 4,439 euros per second jaeger suggested the state could cut value added tax and do away with a special tax that was introduced after german reunification to bolster the battered east , the so-called " solidaritaetszuschlag " .
" we should have decreased public debt in the days when we had a fantastic economic upturn with abundant tax revenue .
if we create new net debt despite increasing tax revenues , then something 's wrong with the system , " he said .
according to the german taxpayers ' federation -lrb- bdst -rrb- , public debt amounted to more than 1.5 trillion euros on saturday evening , that 's more than 19,000 euros per head - it is important to give the date because germany 's debts are growing at an estimated 4,439 euros per second . nk , cg ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

official november estimates put tax revenues at 572 billion euros , but the handelsblatt on saturday quoted government sources as saying that only 524 billion euros are expected to reach the treasury in 2009 .
the finance ministry declined to confirm the figures on saturday , pointing to a three-day meeting in bad kreuznach where experts will gather on tuesday to draw up an official tax estimate .
" estimates are not revenues " although the terms billion , and even trillion , have been used rather inflationary in the wake of the global credit crunch , a potential 48-billion-euro shortfall is no trifling matter .
especially as forecasts expect the german economy to shrink by an estimated six percent this year .
however , such figures still have to be taken with a pinch of salt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister peer steinbrueck is against tax cuts michael jaeger , the general secretary of the taxpayers association of europe , said people should not confuse estimates with real revenues .
he pointed out that tax revenues had actually increased by about 100 billion euros over the past four years .
" the state has n't got a problem with its tax revenue .
its got a problem with expenditure , " jaeger said .
" the basic problem is that the budget is constantly blown up , while public debt increases , and in the end the taxpayer has to foot the bill . "
german finance minister peer steinbrueck has warned that estimated tax revenues could drop by up to 350 billion euros over the next four years , and in view of the economic situation , he has so far refrained from promising tax cuts ahead of september 's federal election .
" something 's wrong with the system " jaeger not only believes that lower taxes are still possible in times of economic crisis , he is also a staunch advocate of cuts to reduce the burden on the struggling taxpayer , especially since actual tax revenues for 2008 were higher than in previous years .
" it is no contradiction to save and to invest in the proper areas , and also implement tax cuts , especially for the middle class which not only creates the jobs but also bears the brunt in times of crisis , " jaeger said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german public debt is increasing at 4,439 euros per second jaeger suggested the state could cut value added tax and do away with a special tax that was introduced after german reunification to bolster the battered east , the so-called " solidaritaetszuschlag " .
" we should have decreased public debt in the days when we had a fantastic economic upturn with abundant tax revenue .
if we create new net debt despite increasing tax revenues , then something 's wrong with the system , " he said .
according to the german taxpayers ' federation -lrb- bdst -rrb- , public debt amounted to more than 1.5 trillion euros on saturday evening , that 's more than 19,000 euros per head - it is important to give the date because germany 's debts are growing at an estimated 4,439 euros per second . nk , cg ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" from -lrb- us president barack -rrb- obama to un secretary general ban ki-moon , green issues are seen as the issues of the future , " party leader cem oezdemir said .
the environmentalist party 's platform calls for millions of new jobs by 2013 .
the party , whose seven-year government coalition with the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- ended in 2005 , said the majority of jobs would emerge in the climate-protection sector , in particular by investing in insulation technologies for buildings and in renewable energy .
expanding childcare centers and all-day schools would create further jobs , the party said in its election manifesto .
emphasis on green issues the party , which is angling to be a junior partner in the next government , said it wants to enshrine climate change prevention as a fundamental principle in germany 's constitution .

amid economic challenges , zuma faces a difficult time bringing different factions together . heavy rains drenched the south african capital pretoria as crowds gathered saturday morning to watch jacob zuma 's inauguration .
however , when it was time to take the oath of office , the sun broke through the clouds and jacob zuma became the fourth democratically elected president of south africa .
he began his inaugural address by thanking nelson mandela .
" he made reconciliation the central theme of his term of office .
we will not deviate from that nation building task .
thank you madiba for showing us the way , " said zuma , referring to mandela by his clan name .
it has been a long journey for the 67-year old zuma who herded cows as a child and left school as a teenager to support his impoverished family .
his political life began in the trade unionist movement and he joined the african national congress in 1959 .
in 1963 he was arrested as he was leaving the country and spent 10 years imprisoned on robben island with fellow anc member and former president nelson mandela .
nearly 30 heads of state were in attendance including african union chairman libyan leader muammar al-qadhafi , zimbabwe 's president robert mugabe and king mswati iii of swaziland , africa 's last absolute monarch .
there were no heads of state of western powers in attendance .
all of them sent lower ranking ministers as representatives .
many challenges ahead zuma takes office at a time of slowing growth in south africa which is enduring its first recession in 17 years .
investors are keenly watching the makeup of his economic team , and are paying close attention to the fate of finance minister trevor manuel , a man who has been praised for his fiscal management .
analysts are also watching to see how zuma will reward the communists and unionists who stood by him throughout his career and foreign investors fear he may move the economy left .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anc supporters worked the election zuma acknowledged the tough economic climate in his speech saying , " we must acknowledge that we find ourselves in difficult economic times .
jobs are being lost in every economy across the world .
we will not be spared the negative impact , and are beginning to feel the pinch . "
given the global economic downturn , zuma may be hard pressed to make good on his generous promises of more jobs and improved services . av / ai , reuters / afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

amid economic challenges , zuma faces a difficult time bringing different factions together . heavy rains drenched the south african capital pretoria as crowds gathered saturday morning to watch jacob zuma 's inauguration .
however , when it was time to take the oath of office , the sun broke through the clouds and jacob zuma became the fourth democratically elected president of south africa .
he began his inaugural address by thanking nelson mandela .
" he made reconciliation the central theme of his term of office .
we will not deviate from that nation building task .
thank you madiba for showing us the way , " said zuma , referring to mandela by his clan name .
it has been a long journey for the 67-year old zuma who herded cows as a child and left school as a teenager to support his impoverished family .
his political life began in the trade unionist movement and he joined the african national congress in 1959 .
in 1963 he was arrested as he was leaving the country and spent 10 years imprisoned on robben island with fellow anc member and former president nelson mandela .

all of them sent lower ranking ministers as representatives .
many challenges ahead zuma takes office at a time of slowing growth in south africa which is enduring its first recession in 17 years .
investors are keenly watching the makeup of his economic team , and are paying close attention to the fate of finance minister trevor manuel , a man who has been praised for his fiscal management .
analysts are also watching to see how zuma will reward the communists and unionists who stood by him throughout his career and foreign investors fear he may move the economy left .

she also challenged the opposition left party , made up of reformed communists to clearly define their relationship to the gdr past .
the speech by merkel , who grew up in the communist state , was part of this year 's anniversary commemorations marking the opening of the cold war barrier on november 9 , 1989 in a peaceful revolution .
it also coincded with the 20th anniversary of the east german local elections of may 7 , 1989 .
merkel said the civil rights activists who protested against those rigged elections ushered in the end of the dictatorship .
" may 7 was the beginning of the end of the gdr , " merkel said earlier this week .
" in this year of the peaceful revolution we should think of those who showed courage , by revealing the local elections to be a sham , or by escaping the gdr in protest . "
the beginning of the end merkel described may 7 1989 as the day the " system had its mask torn from its face . "

demjanjuk 's son said his family did not intend to appeal that decision because " it does not make sense to appeal to other supreme court judges once the judge responsible for the relevant circuit has rejected the stay . "
the family continues to attempt to block the extradition through court filings in berlin and munich .
a us immigration and customs enforcement -lrb- ice -rrb- spokesman would not confirm that the letter was delivered , or provide details as to when the deportation would take place .
" following an order by a us immigration judge to remove john demjanjuk , the us government has been working closely with the government of germany to effectuate demjanjuk 's removal from the united states , " khaalid walls said in a statement .
" us immigration and customs enforcement will have no further comment until that has occurred . "
the decision is the latest development in a decades-long saga over demjanjuk 's wartime actions .
in a dramatic twist last month , the octogenarian won an 11th-hour reprieve when a us federal appeals court stayed his deportation shortly after he was carried out of his suburban cleveland , ohio home in a wheelchair to be placed on a flight to munich .
that respite was lifted last week when the court threw out an attempt to block deportation on health grounds .
his family quickly submitted an appeal to the supreme court , which was rejected thursday .
looking to german courts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no legal options left they also filed motions in germany to block the extradition , but a berlin court said germany is not obliged to prevent the deportation , is not in a position to stop it and can not send him back because of the pending charges in a munich court .
demjanjuk 's family has appealed that decision and on friday filed a motion in munich to rescind the arrest warrant .
born in ukraine in 1920 , demjanjuk was a soldier in the red army when he was captured by the nazis in the spring of 1942 .
he was trained at treblinka in nazi-occupied poland and served two years in the sobibor and majdanek camps , also in occupied poland , and in flossenburg in bavaria , southern germany , court filings showed .
demjanjuk has always insisted that he was forced to work for the nazis and had been mistaken by survivors for other cruel guards .
he immigrated to the united states in 1952 with his family , settling in ohio , where he found work in the auto industry and changed his name from ivan to john .
condemned to death in israel in 1988 after he was convicted of being the sadistic nazi guard nicknamed " ivan the terrible , " the verdict was overturned by the israeli supreme court because of doubts about his identity .
he was returned to the united states over strenuous objections from holocaust survivors and jewish groups , who argued there was sufficient evidence that he served as a death camp guard to warrant another trial .
demjanjuk regained his us citizenship , which was first stripped in 1981 , after an appeals court ruled in 1998 that the us government recklessly withheld exculpatory evidence .
the us government filed new charges a year later using fresh evidence that surfaced following the collapse of the soviet union , and he was again stripped of his us citizenship in 2002 .
germany issued a warrant for demjanjuk 's arrest on march 11 on charges of assisting in the murder of 29,000 jews at sobibor . nrt / mh , afp / ap / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

demjanjuk 's son said his family did not intend to appeal that decision because " it does not make sense to appeal to other supreme court judges once the judge responsible for the relevant circuit has rejected the stay . "
the family continues to attempt to block the extradition through court filings in berlin and munich .
a us immigration and customs enforcement -lrb- ice -rrb- spokesman would not confirm that the letter was delivered , or provide details as to when the deportation would take place .
" following an order by a us immigration judge to remove john demjanjuk , the us government has been working closely with the government of germany to effectuate demjanjuk 's removal from the united states , " khaalid walls said in a statement .
" us immigration and customs enforcement will have no further comment until that has occurred . "
the decision is the latest development in a decades-long saga over demjanjuk 's wartime actions .
in a dramatic twist last month , the octogenarian won an 11th-hour reprieve when a us federal appeals court stayed his deportation shortly after he was carried out of his suburban cleveland , ohio home in a wheelchair to be placed on a flight to munich .
that respite was lifted last week when the court threw out an attempt to block deportation on health grounds .
his family quickly submitted an appeal to the supreme court , which was rejected thursday .
looking to german courts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no legal options left they also filed motions in germany to block the extradition , but a berlin court said germany is not obliged to prevent the deportation , is not in a position to stop it and can not send him back because of the pending charges in a munich court .
demjanjuk 's family has appealed that decision and on friday filed a motion in munich to rescind the arrest warrant .
born in ukraine in 1920 , demjanjuk was a soldier in the red army when he was captured by the nazis in the spring of 1942 .
he was trained at treblinka in nazi-occupied poland and served two years in the sobibor and majdanek camps , also in occupied poland , and in flossenburg in bavaria , southern germany , court filings showed .
demjanjuk has always insisted that he was forced to work for the nazis and had been mistaken by survivors for other cruel guards .
he immigrated to the united states in 1952 with his family , settling in ohio , where he found work in the auto industry and changed his name from ivan to john .
condemned to death in israel in 1988 after he was convicted of being the sadistic nazi guard nicknamed " ivan the terrible , " the verdict was overturned by the israeli supreme court because of doubts about his identity .
he was returned to the united states over strenuous objections from holocaust survivors and jewish groups , who argued there was sufficient evidence that he served as a death camp guard to warrant another trial .

latest case in point : the us now says it wants a seat on the un human rights council , a body george w. bush had shunned . back in 2008 , the bush administration decided to " disengage " from the un rights organization , saying it went too far in its tolerance of repressive states . but the new us administration , already more active in the council 's deliberations , now says it is ready to take on a leadership role . as one of three countries running for three vacant spots on the north america / europe slate , the us is virtually assured to win a seat on the regionally organized , 47-member council . un , rights groups greet change of heart " human rights are an essential element of american global foreign policy … with others , we will engage in the work of improving the un human rights system , " us secretary of state hillary clinton said in a statement . un officials and human rights groups applauded the announcement . the rotating un human rights council presidency is currently held by nigeria 's ambassador to the un , martin uhomoibhi . " we are very delighted to hear that united states wants to come back , " uhomoibhi said .
" we believe they will be a force for good in the council . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : council president uhomoibhi welcomed the move juliette de rivero , the spokeswoman for human-rights watchdog human rights watch in geneva , said they were " particularly happy about the decision , which we had long been advocating for . " but opponents say the un body is so deeply flawed that the us would be better served by continuing its boycott . the current human rights council is a reformed version of its predecessor , the un commission on human rights .
that organization was discredited for allowing countries with abominable rights records - such as sudan and zimbabwe , to join and to form powerful voting blocs that critics say stood in the way of change . critic : council ignores abuses , allows bias the new human rights council , which was formed in 2006 , has greater transparency , but critics say it is still sorely lacking .
they complain that its structures shield countries that continue to flaunt human rights - like china , cuba and saudi arabia - while israel and other democracies are disproportionately targeted . and they argue recent council condemnations of free speech are anti-democratic . the revamped council " has continued to focus biased attention on israel to the detriment of a balanced approach to the palestinian-israeli situation , " said brett schaefer , a public policy analyst at conservative us think tank the heritage foundation . " and it has ignored rampant human-rights abuses in a number of different countries around the world - such as china , cuba and zimbabwe - that , in their extent , scope and history actually dwarf those human rights abuses that are going on in the israeli-palestinian conflict . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights watch said the body is not perfect , but it is better than nothing schaefer and other critics recommend the un set criteria that member countries would have to meet before they are given decision-making power on human rights . that would fix the " main flaw , " he said .
" right now , the inmates run the asylum . the countries that you want most to scrutinize are those that are driving the agenda . … and just having the us on the council is not going to overcome that fact . " but juliette de rivero of human rights watch - who had found the bush administration 's decision to officially disengage from council business " a counterproductive and short sighted victory for abusive states " - believes the us will do more good than harm on the council . the guantanamo example she acknowledged that " a lot can be done to improve the work of the council , particularly in specific country situations . " still , she noted that the us 's decision to close the illegal prison in guantanamo bay , cuba " can be an example for other countries that you do need to acknowledge the mistakes you have committed , and to address human rights violations . " in other words , the us could be a good example . " all countries have human rights issues and the council 's mandate is to examine them , " she said . human rights council president uhomoibhi also admitted that the council is " not a perfect institution . "
but he believes it has the potential to make a contribution to the promotion of human rights - and that countries have a responsibility to contribute to that potential . ' foxes are guarding the chickens ' many critics take a less optimistic view of the situation , however .
un watchdog groups un watch and freedom watch published a study saying seven of the 18 countries that are expected to take seats on the council next week were completely unqualified to sit on the body , based on an annual human-rights score issued by freedom watch . electing these countries to the council is like " choosing the foxes to guard the chickens , " wrote un watch head hillel neuer . in fact , critics say , the us presence on the council will not change the dynamics of the council or help bring about an end to human-rights violations - it simply means the us will lose any leverage it has to protest change , the heritage foundation 's schaefer argues . the us will be one of 47 votes , and " one of 11 or 12 that actually are willing to step forward and champion human rights .
the rest of those countries are either indifferent , or hostile to human rights , " schaefer said . " in this case , being there is not part of the solution .

latest case in point : the us now says it wants a seat on the un human rights council , a body george w. bush had shunned . back in 2008 , the bush administration decided to " disengage " from the un rights organization , saying it went too far in its tolerance of repressive states . but the new us administration , already more active in the council 's deliberations , now says it is ready to take on a leadership role . as one of three countries running for three vacant spots on the north america / europe slate , the us is virtually assured to win a seat on the regionally organized , 47-member council . un , rights groups greet change of heart " human rights are an essential element of american global foreign policy … with others , we will engage in the work of improving the un human rights system , " us secretary of state hillary clinton said in a statement . un officials and human rights groups applauded the announcement . the rotating un human rights council presidency is currently held by nigeria 's ambassador to the un , martin uhomoibhi . " we are very delighted to hear that united states wants to come back , " uhomoibhi said .
" we believe they will be a force for good in the council . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : council president uhomoibhi welcomed the move juliette de rivero , the spokeswoman for human-rights watchdog human rights watch in geneva , said they were " particularly happy about the decision , which we had long been advocating for . " but opponents say the un body is so deeply flawed that the us would be better served by continuing its boycott . the current human rights council is a reformed version of its predecessor , the un commission on human rights .
that organization was discredited for allowing countries with abominable rights records - such as sudan and zimbabwe , to join and to form powerful voting blocs that critics say stood in the way of change . critic : council ignores abuses , allows bias the new human rights council , which was formed in 2006 , has greater transparency , but critics say it is still sorely lacking .

" from -lrb- us president barack -rrb- obama to un secretary general ban ki-moon , green issues are seen as the issues of the future , " party leader cem oezdemir said .
the environmentalist party 's platform calls for millions of new jobs by 2013 .
the party , whose seven-year government coalition with the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- ended in 2005 , said the majority of jobs would emerge in the climate-protection sector , in particular by investing in insulation technologies for buildings and in renewable energy .
expanding childcare centers and all-day schools would create further jobs , the party said in its election manifesto .
emphasis on green issues the party , which is angling to be a junior partner in the next government , said it wants to enshrine climate change prevention as a fundamental principle in germany 's constitution .
to this end , it would seek to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to levels 40 per cent below those from 1990 .
by 2040 , all energy sources should be renewable , according to the party 's platform .
the greens are also calling for subsidies for energy efficient homes and a 120-kilometer-per-hour speed limit on german highways .

" only green policies can help to overcome the crisis .
that 's why this country needs to be ruled by the green party again , " trittin said in his speech .
" we need a coalition of ecological modernization , social justice and civil rights that can meet global challenges . "
the party also voted to back a minimum wage of 7.5 euros -lrb- $ 10 -rrb- per hour .
party members called for higher taxes for the wealthy , including an increase in the top tax bracket and higher capital gains taxes , coupled with lower welfare contributions for people on low incomes .
those measures would help soften the fiscal blow of the economic crisis , the party said .
at other party conferences , chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- formally chose her to lead their party into the september national election .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 09.05.2009 report : germany facing 48-billion-euro tax shortfall großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's estimated tax revenues are to drop , while public debt continues to soar germany is reportedly facing a severe slump in tax revenues .
the economic downturn is definitely taking its toll , but not everybody believes the german state is short of money . the german finance ministry is expecting tax revenues to drop by 48 billion euros -lrb- 64 billion us dollars -rrb- this year , according to the german daily handelsblatt .
official november estimates put tax revenues at 572 billion euros , but the handelsblatt on saturday quoted government sources as saying that only 524 billion euros are expected to reach the treasury in 2009 .
the finance ministry declined to confirm the figures on saturday , pointing to a three-day meeting in bad kreuznach where experts will gather on tuesday to draw up an official tax estimate .
" estimates are not revenues " although the terms billion , and even trillion , have been used rather inflationary in the wake of the global credit crunch , a potential 48-billion-euro shortfall is no trifling matter .
especially as forecasts expect the german economy to shrink by an estimated six percent this year .
however , such figures still have to be taken with a pinch of salt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister peer steinbrueck is against tax cuts michael jaeger , the general secretary of the taxpayers association of europe , said people should not confuse estimates with real revenues .
he pointed out that tax revenues had actually increased by about 100 billion euros over the past four years .
" the state has n't got a problem with its tax revenue .
its got a problem with expenditure , " jaeger said .
" the basic problem is that the budget is constantly blown up , while public debt increases , and in the end the taxpayer has to foot the bill . "
german finance minister peer steinbrueck has warned that estimated tax revenues could drop by up to 350 billion euros over the next four years , and in view of the economic situation , he has so far refrained from promising tax cuts ahead of september 's federal election .
" something 's wrong with the system " jaeger not only believes that lower taxes are still possible in times of economic crisis , he is also a staunch advocate of cuts to reduce the burden on the struggling taxpayer , especially since actual tax revenues for 2008 were higher than in previous years .
" it is no contradiction to save and to invest in the proper areas , and also implement tax cuts , especially for the middle class which not only creates the jobs but also bears the brunt in times of crisis , " jaeger said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german public debt is increasing at 4,439 euros per second jaeger suggested the state could cut value added tax and do away with a special tax that was introduced after german reunification to bolster the battered east , the so-called " solidaritaetszuschlag " .
" we should have decreased public debt in the days when we had a fantastic economic upturn with abundant tax revenue .
if we create new net debt despite increasing tax revenues , then something 's wrong with the system , " he said .
according to the german taxpayers ' federation -lrb- bdst -rrb- , public debt amounted to more than 1.5 trillion euros on saturday evening , that 's more than 19,000 euros per head - it is important to give the date because germany 's debts are growing at an estimated 4,439 euros per second . nk , cg ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the economic downturn is definitely taking its toll , but not everybody believes the german state is short of money . the german finance ministry is expecting tax revenues to drop by 48 billion euros -lrb- 64 billion us dollars -rrb- this year , according to the german daily handelsblatt .
official november estimates put tax revenues at 572 billion euros , but the handelsblatt on saturday quoted government sources as saying that only 524 billion euros are expected to reach the treasury in 2009 .
the finance ministry declined to confirm the figures on saturday , pointing to a three-day meeting in bad kreuznach where experts will gather on tuesday to draw up an official tax estimate .
" estimates are not revenues " although the terms billion , and even trillion , have been used rather inflationary in the wake of the global credit crunch , a potential 48-billion-euro shortfall is no trifling matter .
especially as forecasts expect the german economy to shrink by an estimated six percent this year .
however , such figures still have to be taken with a pinch of salt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister peer steinbrueck is against tax cuts michael jaeger , the general secretary of the taxpayers association of europe , said people should not confuse estimates with real revenues .
he pointed out that tax revenues had actually increased by about 100 billion euros over the past four years .
" the state has n't got a problem with its tax revenue .
its got a problem with expenditure , " jaeger said .
" the basic problem is that the budget is constantly blown up , while public debt increases , and in the end the taxpayer has to foot the bill . "
german finance minister peer steinbrueck has warned that estimated tax revenues could drop by up to 350 billion euros over the next four years , and in view of the economic situation , he has so far refrained from promising tax cuts ahead of september 's federal election .
" something 's wrong with the system " jaeger not only believes that lower taxes are still possible in times of economic crisis , he is also a staunch advocate of cuts to reduce the burden on the struggling taxpayer , especially since actual tax revenues for 2008 were higher than in previous years .
" it is no contradiction to save and to invest in the proper areas , and also implement tax cuts , especially for the middle class which not only creates the jobs but also bears the brunt in times of crisis , " jaeger said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german public debt is increasing at 4,439 euros per second jaeger suggested the state could cut value added tax and do away with a special tax that was introduced after german reunification to bolster the battered east , the so-called " solidaritaetszuschlag " .
" we should have decreased public debt in the days when we had a fantastic economic upturn with abundant tax revenue .
if we create new net debt despite increasing tax revenues , then something 's wrong with the system , " he said .
according to the german taxpayers ' federation -lrb- bdst -rrb- , public debt amounted to more than 1.5 trillion euros on saturday evening , that 's more than 19,000 euros per head - it is important to give the date because germany 's debts are growing at an estimated 4,439 euros per second . nk , cg ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the basic problem is that the budget is constantly blown up , while public debt increases , and in the end the taxpayer has to foot the bill . "
german finance minister peer steinbrueck has warned that estimated tax revenues could drop by up to 350 billion euros over the next four years , and in view of the economic situation , he has so far refrained from promising tax cuts ahead of september 's federal election .
" something 's wrong with the system " jaeger not only believes that lower taxes are still possible in times of economic crisis , he is also a staunch advocate of cuts to reduce the burden on the struggling taxpayer , especially since actual tax revenues for 2008 were higher than in previous years .
" it is no contradiction to save and to invest in the proper areas , and also implement tax cuts , especially for the middle class which not only creates the jobs but also bears the brunt in times of crisis , " jaeger said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german public debt is increasing at 4,439 euros per second jaeger suggested the state could cut value added tax and do away with a special tax that was introduced after german reunification to bolster the battered east , the so-called " solidaritaetszuschlag " .
" we should have decreased public debt in the days when we had a fantastic economic upturn with abundant tax revenue .
if we create new net debt despite increasing tax revenues , then something 's wrong with the system , " he said .
according to the german taxpayers ' federation -lrb- bdst -rrb- , public debt amounted to more than 1.5 trillion euros on saturday evening , that 's more than 19,000 euros per head - it is important to give the date because germany 's debts are growing at an estimated 4,439 euros per second . nk , cg ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" today we 're sending a signal that democrats stand united against right-wing radicalism , racism and agitation , " said reinhard buetikofer , former head of the green party , who took part in the rally in downtown cologne .
cologne mayor fritz schramma said the peaceful protests by residents on saturday showed that the city is " open and tolerant . "
he also said cologne was " committed when it comes to defending these values . "
security was tight as more than 5,000 police officers , outfitted with water cannons and riot gear , cordoned off the square where the " anti-islam " demonstration took place .
the authorities were concerned that there could be clashes between the two sides , as has frequently been the case in the past . cologne police had banned the right-wing groups from holding a high-profile demonstration in front of the cologne cathedral in the city center and instead allowed them to assemble at another , more obscure , square in the deutz district .
police say there were about 300 people at the right-wing " pro koeln " and " pro nrw " rally .
the groups , which are campaigning against the building of a large new mosque in the city , held a larger rally last september which was joined by members of nationalist parties elsewhere in europe .
that protest sparked violent clashes and rioting by far-left demonstrators .
the two anti-islam groups are opposed to the building of mosques and what they see as an influx of moslem immigration into germany .
mayor schramma vowed that the forthcoming national elections in september would not be used to exploit ethnic or religious tensions .
there will be no " sordid election campaign on the back of our foreign fellow citizens , " he said . sp , gb / dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" today we 're sending a signal that democrats stand united against right-wing radicalism , racism and agitation , " said reinhard buetikofer , former head of the green party , who took part in the rally in downtown cologne .
cologne mayor fritz schramma said the peaceful protests by residents on saturday showed that the city is " open and tolerant . "
he also said cologne was " committed when it comes to defending these values . "
security was tight as more than 5,000 police officers , outfitted with water cannons and riot gear , cordoned off the square where the " anti-islam " demonstration took place .
the authorities were concerned that there could be clashes between the two sides , as has frequently been the case in the past . cologne police had banned the right-wing groups from holding a high-profile demonstration in front of the cologne cathedral in the city center and instead allowed them to assemble at another , more obscure , square in the deutz district .
police say there were about 300 people at the right-wing " pro koeln " and " pro nrw " rally .
the groups , which are campaigning against the building of a large new mosque in the city , held a larger rally last september which was joined by members of nationalist parties elsewhere in europe .
that protest sparked violent clashes and rioting by far-left demonstrators .
the two anti-islam groups are opposed to the building of mosques and what they see as an influx of moslem immigration into germany .
mayor schramma vowed that the forthcoming national elections in september would not be used to exploit ethnic or religious tensions .
there will be no " sordid election campaign on the back of our foreign fellow citizens , " he said . sp , gb / dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the pope met with muslim religious leaders , and members of the diplomatic corps in jordan in front of the al-hussein bin talal mosque in amman .
" often it is ideological manipulation of religion , sometimes with political goals , that is the catalyst for tensions and schisms , " the 82-year-old pontiff said .
" today muslims and christians - because of the burden of their mutual history full of misunderstandings - have to strive to be seen and recognized as believers truly loyal to the commandments . "
pope benedict failed to use the opportunity to apologise over the so-called regensburg lecture , which he gave in 2006 .
in that speech the pontiff quoted a medieval christian emperor who criticised teachings of the prophet muhammad as " evil and inhuman . "
jordanian islamist leaders , still sensitive about the pontiff 's comments , had demanded his visit be cancelled .
pope urges mutual respect and cooperation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi prays close to the antique basilica and moses memorial on monte nebo in an address at the moses memorial church on mount nebo on saturday morning , the pope called for reconciliation between christians and jews and reminded the two faiths of their shared heritage .
" may our encounter today inspire in us a renewed love for the canon of sacred scripture , " he said , " and a desire to overcome all obstacles to the reconciliation of christians and jews in mutual respect and cooperation . "
the 840-metre summit of mount nebo , some 40 kilometres southwest of the capital amman , is holy to jews , christians and muslims alike .
the site is where the bible says god showed moses the promised land .
" the ancient tradition of pilgrimage to the holy places also reminds us of the inseparable bond between the church and the jewish people , " he said .
" his example reminds us that we too are part of the ageless pilgrimage of god 's people through history . "
after descending from the mountain , hundreds of people waving jordanian and vatican flags greeted benedict in the town of madaba , where he visited the greek orthodox basilica of st george , famous for its sixth century mosaic map of biblical palestine .
while in madaba , benedict blessed the cornerstone of a new catholic university being built there with help from jordan , a muslim country keen to maintain interfaith harmony .
" belief in god does not suppress the truth ; to the contrary , it encourages it , " said the former german theology professor .
" religion is disfigured when it is pressed into the service of ignorance or prejudice , contempt , violence and abuse . "
he said the new university , which will teach in english , would produce " generations of qualified men and women of christian , muslim and of other religions ... educated in the values of wisdom , integrity , tolerance and peace .

amid economic challenges , zuma faces a difficult time bringing different factions together . heavy rains drenched the south african capital pretoria as crowds gathered saturday morning to watch jacob zuma 's inauguration .
however , when it was time to take the oath of office , the sun broke through the clouds and jacob zuma became the fourth democratically elected president of south africa .
he began his inaugural address by thanking nelson mandela .
" he made reconciliation the central theme of his term of office .
we will not deviate from that nation building task .
thank you madiba for showing us the way , " said zuma , referring to mandela by his clan name .
it has been a long journey for the 67-year old zuma who herded cows as a child and left school as a teenager to support his impoverished family .
his political life began in the trade unionist movement and he joined the african national congress in 1959 .
in 1963 he was arrested as he was leaving the country and spent 10 years imprisoned on robben island with fellow anc member and former president nelson mandela .
nearly 30 heads of state were in attendance including african union chairman libyan leader muammar al-qadhafi , zimbabwe 's president robert mugabe and king mswati iii of swaziland , africa 's last absolute monarch .
there were no heads of state of western powers in attendance .
all of them sent lower ranking ministers as representatives .
many challenges ahead zuma takes office at a time of slowing growth in south africa which is enduring its first recession in 17 years .
investors are keenly watching the makeup of his economic team , and are paying close attention to the fate of finance minister trevor manuel , a man who has been praised for his fiscal management .
analysts are also watching to see how zuma will reward the communists and unionists who stood by him throughout his career and foreign investors fear he may move the economy left .

jobs are being lost in every economy across the world .

she also challenged the opposition left party , made up of reformed communists to clearly define their relationship to the gdr past .
the speech by merkel , who grew up in the communist state , was part of this year 's anniversary commemorations marking the opening of the cold war barrier on november 9 , 1989 in a peaceful revolution .
it also coincded with the 20th anniversary of the east german local elections of may 7 , 1989 .
merkel said the civil rights activists who protested against those rigged elections ushered in the end of the dictatorship .
" may 7 was the beginning of the end of the gdr , " merkel said earlier this week .
" in this year of the peaceful revolution we should think of those who showed courage , by revealing the local elections to be a sham , or by escaping the gdr in protest . "
the beginning of the end merkel described may 7 1989 as the day the " system had its mask torn from its face . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlin wall came down for good in 1989 speaking at a forum discussion in berlin , merkel paid tribute to the role of the church in the former gdr .
they gave a voice to calls for " freedom and change " , said merkel . the german chancellor spoke of the special strength of the peaceful revolution and the luck that made dreams become reality . despite positive memories of the gdr for some germans , merkel said that its was an " unjust state " where surveillance and spying were party of everyday life , where there was no place for an independent justice or free press .
on tuesday , chancellor merkel became the first german leader to tour the main berlin prison run by the feared east german stasi secret police .
merkel said the hohenschoenhausen jail , named for the northeastern district where it is located , was a symbol of a " sad chapter in the history " of the communist state .
" this drives home the brutality with which people 's dignity was abused , " she said , after meeting with former prisoners of the facility .
" it is crucial that this chapter of the history of the east german dictatorship is not covered up or forgotten . "
she also met with a group of pupils and underlined the importance of instruction in schools about east german history as today 's graduates would have no personal memory of the country 's four-decade-long division . nrt / msh , epd / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

demjanjuk 's son said his family did not intend to appeal that decision because " it does not make sense to appeal to other supreme court judges once the judge responsible for the relevant circuit has rejected the stay . "
the family continues to attempt to block the extradition through court filings in berlin and munich .
a us immigration and customs enforcement -lrb- ice -rrb- spokesman would not confirm that the letter was delivered , or provide details as to when the deportation would take place .
" following an order by a us immigration judge to remove john demjanjuk , the us government has been working closely with the government of germany to effectuate demjanjuk 's removal from the united states , " khaalid walls said in a statement .
" us immigration and customs enforcement will have no further comment until that has occurred . "
the decision is the latest development in a decades-long saga over demjanjuk 's wartime actions .
in a dramatic twist last month , the octogenarian won an 11th-hour reprieve when a us federal appeals court stayed his deportation shortly after he was carried out of his suburban cleveland , ohio home in a wheelchair to be placed on a flight to munich .
that respite was lifted last week when the court threw out an attempt to block deportation on health grounds .
his family quickly submitted an appeal to the supreme court , which was rejected thursday .
looking to german courts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no legal options left they also filed motions in germany to block the extradition , but a berlin court said germany is not obliged to prevent the deportation , is not in a position to stop it and can not send him back because of the pending charges in a munich court .
demjanjuk 's family has appealed that decision and on friday filed a motion in munich to rescind the arrest warrant .
born in ukraine in 1920 , demjanjuk was a soldier in the red army when he was captured by the nazis in the spring of 1942 .
he was trained at treblinka in nazi-occupied poland and served two years in the sobibor and majdanek camps , also in occupied poland , and in flossenburg in bavaria , southern germany , court filings showed .
demjanjuk has always insisted that he was forced to work for the nazis and had been mistaken by survivors for other cruel guards .
he immigrated to the united states in 1952 with his family , settling in ohio , where he found work in the auto industry and changed his name from ivan to john .
condemned to death in israel in 1988 after he was convicted of being the sadistic nazi guard nicknamed " ivan the terrible , " the verdict was overturned by the israeli supreme court because of doubts about his identity .
he was returned to the united states over strenuous objections from holocaust survivors and jewish groups , who argued there was sufficient evidence that he served as a death camp guard to warrant another trial .
demjanjuk regained his us citizenship , which was first stripped in 1981 , after an appeals court ruled in 1998 that the us government recklessly withheld exculpatory evidence .
the us government filed new charges a year later using fresh evidence that surfaced following the collapse of the soviet union , and he was again stripped of his us citizenship in 2002 .

demjanjuk 's son said his family did not intend to appeal that decision because " it does not make sense to appeal to other supreme court judges once the judge responsible for the relevant circuit has rejected the stay . "
the family continues to attempt to block the extradition through court filings in berlin and munich .
a us immigration and customs enforcement -lrb- ice -rrb- spokesman would not confirm that the letter was delivered , or provide details as to when the deportation would take place .
" following an order by a us immigration judge to remove john demjanjuk , the us government has been working closely with the government of germany to effectuate demjanjuk 's removal from the united states , " khaalid walls said in a statement .
" us immigration and customs enforcement will have no further comment until that has occurred . "
the decision is the latest development in a decades-long saga over demjanjuk 's wartime actions .
in a dramatic twist last month , the octogenarian won an 11th-hour reprieve when a us federal appeals court stayed his deportation shortly after he was carried out of his suburban cleveland , ohio home in a wheelchair to be placed on a flight to munich .
that respite was lifted last week when the court threw out an attempt to block deportation on health grounds .
his family quickly submitted an appeal to the supreme court , which was rejected thursday .
looking to german courts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no legal options left they also filed motions in germany to block the extradition , but a berlin court said germany is not obliged to prevent the deportation , is not in a position to stop it and can not send him back because of the pending charges in a munich court .
demjanjuk 's family has appealed that decision and on friday filed a motion in munich to rescind the arrest warrant .
born in ukraine in 1920 , demjanjuk was a soldier in the red army when he was captured by the nazis in the spring of 1942 .
he was trained at treblinka in nazi-occupied poland and served two years in the sobibor and majdanek camps , also in occupied poland , and in flossenburg in bavaria , southern germany , court filings showed .
demjanjuk has always insisted that he was forced to work for the nazis and had been mistaken by survivors for other cruel guards .
he immigrated to the united states in 1952 with his family , settling in ohio , where he found work in the auto industry and changed his name from ivan to john .
condemned to death in israel in 1988 after he was convicted of being the sadistic nazi guard nicknamed " ivan the terrible , " the verdict was overturned by the israeli supreme court because of doubts about his identity .
he was returned to the united states over strenuous objections from holocaust survivors and jewish groups , who argued there was sufficient evidence that he served as a death camp guard to warrant another trial .
demjanjuk regained his us citizenship , which was first stripped in 1981 , after an appeals court ruled in 1998 that the us government recklessly withheld exculpatory evidence .
the us government filed new charges a year later using fresh evidence that surfaced following the collapse of the soviet union , and he was again stripped of his us citizenship in 2002 .
germany issued a warrant for demjanjuk 's arrest on march 11 on charges of assisting in the murder of 29,000 jews at sobibor . nrt / mh , afp / ap / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

latest case in point : the us now says it wants a seat on the un human rights council , a body george w. bush had shunned . back in 2008 , the bush administration decided to " disengage " from the un rights organization , saying it went too far in its tolerance of repressive states . but the new us administration , already more active in the council 's deliberations , now says it is ready to take on a leadership role . as one of three countries running for three vacant spots on the north america / europe slate , the us is virtually assured to win a seat on the regionally organized , 47-member council . un , rights groups greet change of heart " human rights are an essential element of american global foreign policy … with others , we will engage in the work of improving the un human rights system , " us secretary of state hillary clinton said in a statement . un officials and human rights groups applauded the announcement . the rotating un human rights council presidency is currently held by nigeria 's ambassador to the un , martin uhomoibhi . " we are very delighted to hear that united states wants to come back , " uhomoibhi said .
" we believe they will be a force for good in the council . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : council president uhomoibhi welcomed the move juliette de rivero , the spokeswoman for human-rights watchdog human rights watch in geneva , said they were " particularly happy about the decision , which we had long been advocating for . " but opponents say the un body is so deeply flawed that the us would be better served by continuing its boycott . the current human rights council is a reformed version of its predecessor , the un commission on human rights .
that organization was discredited for allowing countries with abominable rights records - such as sudan and zimbabwe , to join and to form powerful voting blocs that critics say stood in the way of change . critic : council ignores abuses , allows bias the new human rights council , which was formed in 2006 , has greater transparency , but critics say it is still sorely lacking .
they complain that its structures shield countries that continue to flaunt human rights - like china , cuba and saudi arabia - while israel and other democracies are disproportionately targeted . and they argue recent council condemnations of free speech are anti-democratic . the revamped council " has continued to focus biased attention on israel to the detriment of a balanced approach to the palestinian-israeli situation , " said brett schaefer , a public policy analyst at conservative us think tank the heritage foundation . " and it has ignored rampant human-rights abuses in a number of different countries around the world - such as china , cuba and zimbabwe - that , in their extent , scope and history actually dwarf those human rights abuses that are going on in the israeli-palestinian conflict . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights watch said the body is not perfect , but it is better than nothing schaefer and other critics recommend the un set criteria that member countries would have to meet before they are given decision-making power on human rights . that would fix the " main flaw , " he said .
" right now , the inmates run the asylum . the countries that you want most to scrutinize are those that are driving the agenda . … and just having the us on the council is not going to overcome that fact . " but juliette de rivero of human rights watch - who had found the bush administration 's decision to officially disengage from council business " a counterproductive and short sighted victory for abusive states " - believes the us will do more good than harm on the council . the guantanamo example she acknowledged that " a lot can be done to improve the work of the council , particularly in specific country situations . " still , she noted that the us 's decision to close the illegal prison in guantanamo bay , cuba " can be an example for other countries that you do need to acknowledge the mistakes you have committed , and to address human rights violations . " in other words , the us could be a good example . " all countries have human rights issues and the council 's mandate is to examine them , " she said . human rights council president uhomoibhi also admitted that the council is " not a perfect institution . "
but he believes it has the potential to make a contribution to the promotion of human rights - and that countries have a responsibility to contribute to that potential . ' foxes are guarding the chickens ' many critics take a less optimistic view of the situation , however .
un watchdog groups un watch and freedom watch published a study saying seven of the 18 countries that are expected to take seats on the council next week were completely unqualified to sit on the body , based on an annual human-rights score issued by freedom watch . electing these countries to the council is like " choosing the foxes to guard the chickens , " wrote un watch head hillel neuer . in fact , critics say , the us presence on the council will not change the dynamics of the council or help bring about an end to human-rights violations - it simply means the us will lose any leverage it has to protest change , the heritage foundation 's schaefer argues . the us will be one of 47 votes , and " one of 11 or 12 that actually are willing to step forward and champion human rights .
the rest of those countries are either indifferent , or hostile to human rights , " schaefer said . " in this case , being there is not part of the solution .

" today we 're sending a signal that democrats stand united against right-wing radicalism , racism and agitation , " said reinhard buetikofer , former head of the green party , who took part in the rally in downtown cologne .
cologne mayor fritz schramma said the peaceful protests by residents on saturday showed that the city is " open and tolerant . "
he also said cologne was " committed when it comes to defending these values . "
security was tight as more than 5,000 police officers , outfitted with water cannons and riot gear , cordoned off the square where the " anti-islam " demonstration took place .
the authorities were concerned that there could be clashes between the two sides , as has frequently been the case in the past . cologne police had banned the right-wing groups from holding a high-profile demonstration in front of the cologne cathedral in the city center and instead allowed them to assemble at another , more obscure , square in the deutz district .
police say there were about 300 people at the right-wing " pro koeln " and " pro nrw " rally .
the groups , which are campaigning against the building of a large new mosque in the city , held a larger rally last september which was joined by members of nationalist parties elsewhere in europe .
that protest sparked violent clashes and rioting by far-left demonstrators .
the two anti-islam groups are opposed to the building of mosques and what they see as an influx of moslem immigration into germany .
mayor schramma vowed that the forthcoming national elections in september would not be used to exploit ethnic or religious tensions .
there will be no " sordid election campaign on the back of our foreign fellow citizens , " he said . sp , gb / dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" from -lrb- us president barack -rrb- obama to un secretary general ban ki-moon , green issues are seen as the issues of the future , " party leader cem oezdemir said .
the environmentalist party 's platform calls for millions of new jobs by 2013 .
the party , whose seven-year government coalition with the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- ended in 2005 , said the majority of jobs would emerge in the climate-protection sector , in particular by investing in insulation technologies for buildings and in renewable energy .
expanding childcare centers and all-day schools would create further jobs , the party said in its election manifesto .
emphasis on green issues the party , which is angling to be a junior partner in the next government , said it wants to enshrine climate change prevention as a fundamental principle in germany 's constitution .
to this end , it would seek to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to levels 40 per cent below those from 1990 .
by 2040 , all energy sources should be renewable , according to the party 's platform .
the greens are also calling for subsidies for energy efficient homes and a 120-kilometer-per-hour speed limit on german highways .

" only green policies can help to overcome the crisis .
that 's why this country needs to be ruled by the green party again , " trittin said in his speech .
" we need a coalition of ecological modernization , social justice and civil rights that can meet global challenges . "
the party also voted to back a minimum wage of 7.5 euros -lrb- $ 10 -rrb- per hour .
party members called for higher taxes for the wealthy , including an increase in the top tax bracket and higher capital gains taxes , coupled with lower welfare contributions for people on low incomes .
those measures would help soften the fiscal blow of the economic crisis , the party said .

demjanjuk 's son said his family did not intend to appeal that decision because " it does not make sense to appeal to other supreme court judges once the judge responsible for the relevant circuit has rejected the stay . "
the family continues to attempt to block the extradition through court filings in berlin and munich .
a us immigration and customs enforcement -lrb- ice -rrb- spokesman would not confirm that the letter was delivered , or provide details as to when the deportation would take place .
" following an order by a us immigration judge to remove john demjanjuk , the us government has been working closely with the government of germany to effectuate demjanjuk 's removal from the united states , " khaalid walls said in a statement .
" us immigration and customs enforcement will have no further comment until that has occurred . "
the decision is the latest development in a decades-long saga over demjanjuk 's wartime actions .
in a dramatic twist last month , the octogenarian won an 11th-hour reprieve when a us federal appeals court stayed his deportation shortly after he was carried out of his suburban cleveland , ohio home in a wheelchair to be placed on a flight to munich .
that respite was lifted last week when the court threw out an attempt to block deportation on health grounds .
his family quickly submitted an appeal to the supreme court , which was rejected thursday .
looking to german courts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no legal options left they also filed motions in germany to block the extradition , but a berlin court said germany is not obliged to prevent the deportation , is not in a position to stop it and can not send him back because of the pending charges in a munich court .
demjanjuk 's family has appealed that decision and on friday filed a motion in munich to rescind the arrest warrant .
born in ukraine in 1920 , demjanjuk was a soldier in the red army when he was captured by the nazis in the spring of 1942 .
he was trained at treblinka in nazi-occupied poland and served two years in the sobibor and majdanek camps , also in occupied poland , and in flossenburg in bavaria , southern germany , court filings showed .
demjanjuk has always insisted that he was forced to work for the nazis and had been mistaken by survivors for other cruel guards .
he immigrated to the united states in 1952 with his family , settling in ohio , where he found work in the auto industry and changed his name from ivan to john .
condemned to death in israel in 1988 after he was convicted of being the sadistic nazi guard nicknamed " ivan the terrible , " the verdict was overturned by the israeli supreme court because of doubts about his identity .
he was returned to the united states over strenuous objections from holocaust survivors and jewish groups , who argued there was sufficient evidence that he served as a death camp guard to warrant another trial .
demjanjuk regained his us citizenship , which was first stripped in 1981 , after an appeals court ruled in 1998 that the us government recklessly withheld exculpatory evidence .
the us government filed new charges a year later using fresh evidence that surfaced following the collapse of the soviet union , and he was again stripped of his us citizenship in 2002 .

demjanjuk 's son said his family did not intend to appeal that decision because " it does not make sense to appeal to other supreme court judges once the judge responsible for the relevant circuit has rejected the stay . "
the family continues to attempt to block the extradition through court filings in berlin and munich .
a us immigration and customs enforcement -lrb- ice -rrb- spokesman would not confirm that the letter was delivered , or provide details as to when the deportation would take place .
" following an order by a us immigration judge to remove john demjanjuk , the us government has been working closely with the government of germany to effectuate demjanjuk 's removal from the united states , " khaalid walls said in a statement .
" us immigration and customs enforcement will have no further comment until that has occurred . "
the decision is the latest development in a decades-long saga over demjanjuk 's wartime actions .
in a dramatic twist last month , the octogenarian won an 11th-hour reprieve when a us federal appeals court stayed his deportation shortly after he was carried out of his suburban cleveland , ohio home in a wheelchair to be placed on a flight to munich .
that respite was lifted last week when the court threw out an attempt to block deportation on health grounds .
his family quickly submitted an appeal to the supreme court , which was rejected thursday .
looking to german courts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no legal options left they also filed motions in germany to block the extradition , but a berlin court said germany is not obliged to prevent the deportation , is not in a position to stop it and can not send him back because of the pending charges in a munich court .
demjanjuk 's family has appealed that decision and on friday filed a motion in munich to rescind the arrest warrant .
born in ukraine in 1920 , demjanjuk was a soldier in the red army when he was captured by the nazis in the spring of 1942 .
he was trained at treblinka in nazi-occupied poland and served two years in the sobibor and majdanek camps , also in occupied poland , and in flossenburg in bavaria , southern germany , court filings showed .
demjanjuk has always insisted that he was forced to work for the nazis and had been mistaken by survivors for other cruel guards .
he immigrated to the united states in 1952 with his family , settling in ohio , where he found work in the auto industry and changed his name from ivan to john .
condemned to death in israel in 1988 after he was convicted of being the sadistic nazi guard nicknamed " ivan the terrible , " the verdict was overturned by the israeli supreme court because of doubts about his identity .
he was returned to the united states over strenuous objections from holocaust survivors and jewish groups , who argued there was sufficient evidence that he served as a death camp guard to warrant another trial .

" today we 're sending a signal that democrats stand united against right-wing radicalism , racism and agitation , " said reinhard buetikofer , former head of the green party , who took part in the rally in downtown cologne .
cologne mayor fritz schramma said the peaceful protests by residents on saturday showed that the city is " open and tolerant . "
he also said cologne was " committed when it comes to defending these values . "
security was tight as more than 5,000 police officers , outfitted with water cannons and riot gear , cordoned off the square where the " anti-islam " demonstration took place .
the authorities were concerned that there could be clashes between the two sides , as has frequently been the case in the past . cologne police had banned the right-wing groups from holding a high-profile demonstration in front of the cologne cathedral in the city center and instead allowed them to assemble at another , more obscure , square in the deutz district .
police say there were about 300 people at the right-wing " pro koeln " and " pro nrw " rally .
the groups , which are campaigning against the building of a large new mosque in the city , held a larger rally last september which was joined by members of nationalist parties elsewhere in europe .
that protest sparked violent clashes and rioting by far-left demonstrators .
the two anti-islam groups are opposed to the building of mosques and what they see as an influx of moslem immigration into germany .

" today we 're sending a signal that democrats stand united against right-wing radicalism , racism and agitation , " said reinhard buetikofer , former head of the green party , who took part in the rally in downtown cologne .
cologne mayor fritz schramma said the peaceful protests by residents on saturday showed that the city is " open and tolerant . "
he also said cologne was " committed when it comes to defending these values . "
security was tight as more than 5,000 police officers , outfitted with water cannons and riot gear , cordoned off the square where the " anti-islam " demonstration took place .
the authorities were concerned that there could be clashes between the two sides , as has frequently been the case in the past . cologne police had banned the right-wing groups from holding a high-profile demonstration in front of the cologne cathedral in the city center and instead allowed them to assemble at another , more obscure , square in the deutz district .
police say there were about 300 people at the right-wing " pro koeln " and " pro nrw " rally .
the groups , which are campaigning against the building of a large new mosque in the city , held a larger rally last september which was joined by members of nationalist parties elsewhere in europe .
that protest sparked violent clashes and rioting by far-left demonstrators .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world war ii -pipe- 09.05.2009 suspected nazi guard told to surrender to us immigration officials großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demjanjuk 's ss identity card us immigration officials have asked former nazi guard john demjanjuk to surrender for deportation to germany to face charges of aiding the wartime murder of thousands of jews , his son said friday . the move comes a day after a us supreme court justice denied the 89-year-old former autoworker 's request to block the deportation .
demjanjuk 's son said his family did not intend to appeal that decision because " it does not make sense to appeal to other supreme court judges once the judge responsible for the relevant circuit has rejected the stay . "
the family continues to attempt to block the extradition through court filings in berlin and munich .
a us immigration and customs enforcement -lrb- ice -rrb- spokesman would not confirm that the letter was delivered , or provide details as to when the deportation would take place .
" following an order by a us immigration judge to remove john demjanjuk , the us government has been working closely with the government of germany to effectuate demjanjuk 's removal from the united states , " khaalid walls said in a statement .
" us immigration and customs enforcement will have no further comment until that has occurred . "
the decision is the latest development in a decades-long saga over demjanjuk 's wartime actions .
in a dramatic twist last month , the octogenarian won an 11th-hour reprieve when a us federal appeals court stayed his deportation shortly after he was carried out of his suburban cleveland , ohio home in a wheelchair to be placed on a flight to munich .
that respite was lifted last week when the court threw out an attempt to block deportation on health grounds .
his family quickly submitted an appeal to the supreme court , which was rejected thursday .
looking to german courts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no legal options left they also filed motions in germany to block the extradition , but a berlin court said germany is not obliged to prevent the deportation , is not in a position to stop it and can not send him back because of the pending charges in a munich court .
demjanjuk 's family has appealed that decision and on friday filed a motion in munich to rescind the arrest warrant .
born in ukraine in 1920 , demjanjuk was a soldier in the red army when he was captured by the nazis in the spring of 1942 .
he was trained at treblinka in nazi-occupied poland and served two years in the sobibor and majdanek camps , also in occupied poland , and in flossenburg in bavaria , southern germany , court filings showed .
demjanjuk has always insisted that he was forced to work for the nazis and had been mistaken by survivors for other cruel guards .
he immigrated to the united states in 1952 with his family , settling in ohio , where he found work in the auto industry and changed his name from ivan to john .
condemned to death in israel in 1988 after he was convicted of being the sadistic nazi guard nicknamed " ivan the terrible , " the verdict was overturned by the israeli supreme court because of doubts about his identity .
he was returned to the united states over strenuous objections from holocaust survivors and jewish groups , who argued there was sufficient evidence that he served as a death camp guard to warrant another trial .
demjanjuk regained his us citizenship , which was first stripped in 1981 , after an appeals court ruled in 1998 that the us government recklessly withheld exculpatory evidence .
the us government filed new charges a year later using fresh evidence that surfaced following the collapse of the soviet union , and he was again stripped of his us citizenship in 2002 .
germany issued a warrant for demjanjuk 's arrest on march 11 on charges of assisting in the murder of 29,000 jews at sobibor . nrt / mh , afp / ap / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" from -lrb- us president barack -rrb- obama to un secretary general ban ki-moon , green issues are seen as the issues of the future , " party leader cem oezdemir said .
the environmentalist party 's platform calls for millions of new jobs by 2013 .
the party , whose seven-year government coalition with the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- ended in 2005 , said the majority of jobs would emerge in the climate-protection sector , in particular by investing in insulation technologies for buildings and in renewable energy .
expanding childcare centers and all-day schools would create further jobs , the party said in its election manifesto .
emphasis on green issues the party , which is angling to be a junior partner in the next government , said it wants to enshrine climate change prevention as a fundamental principle in germany 's constitution .
to this end , it would seek to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to levels 40 per cent below those from 1990 .
by 2040 , all energy sources should be renewable , according to the party 's platform .
the greens are also calling for subsidies for energy efficient homes and a 120-kilometer-per-hour speed limit on german highways .

" only green policies can help to overcome the crisis .
that 's why this country needs to be ruled by the green party again , " trittin said in his speech .
" we need a coalition of ecological modernization , social justice and civil rights that can meet global challenges . "
the party also voted to back a minimum wage of 7.5 euros -lrb- $ 10 -rrb- per hour .
party members called for higher taxes for the wealthy , including an increase in the top tax bracket and higher capital gains taxes , coupled with lower welfare contributions for people on low incomes .
those measures would help soften the fiscal blow of the economic crisis , the party said .

latest case in point : the us now says it wants a seat on the un human rights council , a body george w. bush had shunned . back in 2008 , the bush administration decided to " disengage " from the un rights organization , saying it went too far in its tolerance of repressive states . but the new us administration , already more active in the council 's deliberations , now says it is ready to take on a leadership role . as one of three countries running for three vacant spots on the north america / europe slate , the us is virtually assured to win a seat on the regionally organized , 47-member council . un , rights groups greet change of heart " human rights are an essential element of american global foreign policy … with others , we will engage in the work of improving the un human rights system , " us secretary of state hillary clinton said in a statement . un officials and human rights groups applauded the announcement . the rotating un human rights council presidency is currently held by nigeria 's ambassador to the un , martin uhomoibhi . " we are very delighted to hear that united states wants to come back , " uhomoibhi said .
" we believe they will be a force for good in the council . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : council president uhomoibhi welcomed the move juliette de rivero , the spokeswoman for human-rights watchdog human rights watch in geneva , said they were " particularly happy about the decision , which we had long been advocating for . " but opponents say the un body is so deeply flawed that the us would be better served by continuing its boycott . the current human rights council is a reformed version of its predecessor , the un commission on human rights .
that organization was discredited for allowing countries with abominable rights records - such as sudan and zimbabwe , to join and to form powerful voting blocs that critics say stood in the way of change . critic : council ignores abuses , allows bias the new human rights council , which was formed in 2006 , has greater transparency , but critics say it is still sorely lacking .
they complain that its structures shield countries that continue to flaunt human rights - like china , cuba and saudi arabia - while israel and other democracies are disproportionately targeted . and they argue recent council condemnations of free speech are anti-democratic . the revamped council " has continued to focus biased attention on israel to the detriment of a balanced approach to the palestinian-israeli situation , " said brett schaefer , a public policy analyst at conservative us think tank the heritage foundation . " and it has ignored rampant human-rights abuses in a number of different countries around the world - such as china , cuba and zimbabwe - that , in their extent , scope and history actually dwarf those human rights abuses that are going on in the israeli-palestinian conflict . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights watch said the body is not perfect , but it is better than nothing schaefer and other critics recommend the un set criteria that member countries would have to meet before they are given decision-making power on human rights . that would fix the " main flaw , " he said .
" right now , the inmates run the asylum . the countries that you want most to scrutinize are those that are driving the agenda . … and just having the us on the council is not going to overcome that fact . " but juliette de rivero of human rights watch - who had found the bush administration 's decision to officially disengage from council business " a counterproductive and short sighted victory for abusive states " - believes the us will do more good than harm on the council . the guantanamo example she acknowledged that " a lot can be done to improve the work of the council , particularly in specific country situations . " still , she noted that the us 's decision to close the illegal prison in guantanamo bay , cuba " can be an example for other countries that you do need to acknowledge the mistakes you have committed , and to address human rights violations . " in other words , the us could be a good example . " all countries have human rights issues and the council 's mandate is to examine them , " she said . human rights council president uhomoibhi also admitted that the council is " not a perfect institution . "
but he believes it has the potential to make a contribution to the promotion of human rights - and that countries have a responsibility to contribute to that potential . ' foxes are guarding the chickens ' many critics take a less optimistic view of the situation , however .

defending champions bayern munich won 3-1 against energie cottbus . gomez proved unstoppable after his first goal just 29 seconds into the game - the fastest goal of the season - when he headed in a cross from roberto hilbert .
the germany striker added his second from close range in the 20th minute , with wolfsburg 's defense in disarray .
wolfsburg hit back before halftime with edin dzeko netting his 20th goal of the season .
but gomez gave wolfsburg no chance to come back when he fired in a left-foot shot from 14 meters out in the 63rd minute on a sami khedira pass before ending his spectacular performance with another header after 77 minutes .
" i suppose the whole week everybody will be talking about me , so i am glad our next game is on wednesday -lrb- at schalke -rrb- , " gomez said .
" we now have to win our games and see if we can achieve the maximum .
but , we should n't think that just because we have now beaten the leaders , the rest will now come automatically . "
it was a second successive away defeat for wolfsburg , who lost 2-0 in cottbus two weeks ago , and comes three days after coach felix magath confirmed he would be leaving for schalke at the end of the season .
" we have lost our advantage , but we are still first , " magath said .
" i think we can still be champions .
from three games , we have two at home , and it 's important that on tuesday we find our home rhythm against dortmund . " bayern wins against cottbus defending champions bayern drew level on points with wolfsburg after a 3-1 win against relegation-threatened energie cottbus .
jose ernesto , martin demichelis and lukas podolski scored for bayern .
hertha berlin , meanwhile , kept alive their hopes of a first bundesliga title with a 2-0 win over visiting bochum .
with three matches remaining , wolfsburg and bayern have 60 points , hertha is on 59 and stuttgart has 58 .
sv hamburg could move level with stuttgart , if they win in bremen on sunday .
elsewhere around the league , hoffenheim ended a 12-game losing streak by defeating cologne 2-0 thanks to goals after the break from sejad salihovic and demba ba , while hanover and eintracht frankfurt finished 1-1 . bayer leverkusen and arminia bielefeld drew 2-2 on friday .

the afghan government must show , better than they have in the past , “ that they are working to move the country forward ; that they are working to develop an administrative infrastructure , and to crack down on corruption , ” ferrero-waldner told the paper . “ mistakes were made in the past , ” she added .
her comments come a day before karzai is to meet german chancellor angela merkel in berlin .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 09.05.2009 report : germany facing 48-billion-euro tax shortfall großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's estimated tax revenues are to drop , while public debt continues to soar germany is reportedly facing a severe slump in tax revenues .
the economic downturn is definitely taking its toll , but not everybody believes the german state is short of money . the german finance ministry is expecting tax revenues to drop by 48 billion euros -lrb- 64 billion us dollars -rrb- this year , according to the german daily handelsblatt .
official november estimates put tax revenues at 572 billion euros , but the handelsblatt on saturday quoted government sources as saying that only 524 billion euros are expected to reach the treasury in 2009 .
the finance ministry declined to confirm the figures on saturday , pointing to a three-day meeting in bad kreuznach where experts will gather on tuesday to draw up an official tax estimate .
" estimates are not revenues " although the terms billion , and even trillion , have been used rather inflationary in the wake of the global credit crunch , a potential 48-billion-euro shortfall is no trifling matter .
especially as forecasts expect the german economy to shrink by an estimated six percent this year .
however , such figures still have to be taken with a pinch of salt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister peer steinbrueck is against tax cuts michael jaeger , the general secretary of the taxpayers association of europe , said people should not confuse estimates with real revenues .
he pointed out that tax revenues had actually increased by about 100 billion euros over the past four years .
" the state has n't got a problem with its tax revenue .
its got a problem with expenditure , " jaeger said .
" the basic problem is that the budget is constantly blown up , while public debt increases , and in the end the taxpayer has to foot the bill . "
german finance minister peer steinbrueck has warned that estimated tax revenues could drop by up to 350 billion euros over the next four years , and in view of the economic situation , he has so far refrained from promising tax cuts ahead of september 's federal election .
" something 's wrong with the system " jaeger not only believes that lower taxes are still possible in times of economic crisis , he is also a staunch advocate of cuts to reduce the burden on the struggling taxpayer , especially since actual tax revenues for 2008 were higher than in previous years .
" it is no contradiction to save and to invest in the proper areas , and also implement tax cuts , especially for the middle class which not only creates the jobs but also bears the brunt in times of crisis , " jaeger said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german public debt is increasing at 4,439 euros per second jaeger suggested the state could cut value added tax and do away with a special tax that was introduced after german reunification to bolster the battered east , the so-called " solidaritaetszuschlag " .
" we should have decreased public debt in the days when we had a fantastic economic upturn with abundant tax revenue .
if we create new net debt despite increasing tax revenues , then something 's wrong with the system , " he said .
according to the german taxpayers ' federation -lrb- bdst -rrb- , public debt amounted to more than 1.5 trillion euros on saturday evening , that 's more than 19,000 euros per head - it is important to give the date because germany 's debts are growing at an estimated 4,439 euros per second . nk , cg ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 09.05.2009 report : germany facing 48-billion-euro tax shortfall großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's estimated tax revenues are to drop , while public debt continues to soar germany is reportedly facing a severe slump in tax revenues .
the economic downturn is definitely taking its toll , but not everybody believes the german state is short of money . the german finance ministry is expecting tax revenues to drop by 48 billion euros -lrb- 64 billion us dollars -rrb- this year , according to the german daily handelsblatt .
official november estimates put tax revenues at 572 billion euros , but the handelsblatt on saturday quoted government sources as saying that only 524 billion euros are expected to reach the treasury in 2009 .
the finance ministry declined to confirm the figures on saturday , pointing to a three-day meeting in bad kreuznach where experts will gather on tuesday to draw up an official tax estimate .
" estimates are not revenues " although the terms billion , and even trillion , have been used rather inflationary in the wake of the global credit crunch , a potential 48-billion-euro shortfall is no trifling matter .
especially as forecasts expect the german economy to shrink by an estimated six percent this year .
however , such figures still have to be taken with a pinch of salt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister peer steinbrueck is against tax cuts michael jaeger , the general secretary of the taxpayers association of europe , said people should not confuse estimates with real revenues .
he pointed out that tax revenues had actually increased by about 100 billion euros over the past four years .
" the state has n't got a problem with its tax revenue .
its got a problem with expenditure , " jaeger said .
" the basic problem is that the budget is constantly blown up , while public debt increases , and in the end the taxpayer has to foot the bill . "
german finance minister peer steinbrueck has warned that estimated tax revenues could drop by up to 350 billion euros over the next four years , and in view of the economic situation , he has so far refrained from promising tax cuts ahead of september 's federal election .
" something 's wrong with the system " jaeger not only believes that lower taxes are still possible in times of economic crisis , he is also a staunch advocate of cuts to reduce the burden on the struggling taxpayer , especially since actual tax revenues for 2008 were higher than in previous years .
" it is no contradiction to save and to invest in the proper areas , and also implement tax cuts , especially for the middle class which not only creates the jobs but also bears the brunt in times of crisis , " jaeger said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german public debt is increasing at 4,439 euros per second jaeger suggested the state could cut value added tax and do away with a special tax that was introduced after german reunification to bolster the battered east , the so-called " solidaritaetszuschlag " .
" we should have decreased public debt in the days when we had a fantastic economic upturn with abundant tax revenue .
if we create new net debt despite increasing tax revenues , then something 's wrong with the system , " he said .
according to the german taxpayers ' federation -lrb- bdst -rrb- , public debt amounted to more than 1.5 trillion euros on saturday evening , that 's more than 19,000 euros per head - it is important to give the date because germany 's debts are growing at an estimated 4,439 euros per second . nk , cg ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

official november estimates put tax revenues at 572 billion euros , but the handelsblatt on saturday quoted government sources as saying that only 524 billion euros are expected to reach the treasury in 2009 .
the finance ministry declined to confirm the figures on saturday , pointing to a three-day meeting in bad kreuznach where experts will gather on tuesday to draw up an official tax estimate .
" estimates are not revenues " although the terms billion , and even trillion , have been used rather inflationary in the wake of the global credit crunch , a potential 48-billion-euro shortfall is no trifling matter .
especially as forecasts expect the german economy to shrink by an estimated six percent this year .
however , such figures still have to be taken with a pinch of salt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister peer steinbrueck is against tax cuts michael jaeger , the general secretary of the taxpayers association of europe , said people should not confuse estimates with real revenues .
he pointed out that tax revenues had actually increased by about 100 billion euros over the past four years .
" the state has n't got a problem with its tax revenue .
its got a problem with expenditure , " jaeger said .
" the basic problem is that the budget is constantly blown up , while public debt increases , and in the end the taxpayer has to foot the bill . "
german finance minister peer steinbrueck has warned that estimated tax revenues could drop by up to 350 billion euros over the next four years , and in view of the economic situation , he has so far refrained from promising tax cuts ahead of september 's federal election .
" something 's wrong with the system " jaeger not only believes that lower taxes are still possible in times of economic crisis , he is also a staunch advocate of cuts to reduce the burden on the struggling taxpayer , especially since actual tax revenues for 2008 were higher than in previous years .
" it is no contradiction to save and to invest in the proper areas , and also implement tax cuts , especially for the middle class which not only creates the jobs but also bears the brunt in times of crisis , " jaeger said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german public debt is increasing at 4,439 euros per second jaeger suggested the state could cut value added tax and do away with a special tax that was introduced after german reunification to bolster the battered east , the so-called " solidaritaetszuschlag " .
" we should have decreased public debt in the days when we had a fantastic economic upturn with abundant tax revenue .
if we create new net debt despite increasing tax revenues , then something 's wrong with the system , " he said .
according to the german taxpayers ' federation -lrb- bdst -rrb- , public debt amounted to more than 1.5 trillion euros on saturday evening , that 's more than 19,000 euros per head - it is important to give the date because germany 's debts are growing at an estimated 4,439 euros per second . nk , cg ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

defending champions bayern munich won 3-1 against energie cottbus . gomez proved unstoppable after his first goal just 29 seconds into the game - the fastest goal of the season - when he headed in a cross from roberto hilbert .
the germany striker added his second from close range in the 20th minute , with wolfsburg 's defense in disarray .
wolfsburg hit back before halftime with edin dzeko netting his 20th goal of the season .
but gomez gave wolfsburg no chance to come back when he fired in a left-foot shot from 14 meters out in the 63rd minute on a sami khedira pass before ending his spectacular performance with another header after 77 minutes .
" i suppose the whole week everybody will be talking about me , so i am glad our next game is on wednesday -lrb- at schalke -rrb- , " gomez said .
" we now have to win our games and see if we can achieve the maximum .
but , we should n't think that just because we have now beaten the leaders , the rest will now come automatically . "
it was a second successive away defeat for wolfsburg , who lost 2-0 in cottbus two weeks ago , and comes three days after coach felix magath confirmed he would be leaving for schalke at the end of the season .
" we have lost our advantage , but we are still first , " magath said .
" i think we can still be champions .
from three games , we have two at home , and it 's important that on tuesday we find our home rhythm against dortmund . " bayern wins against cottbus defending champions bayern drew level on points with wolfsburg after a 3-1 win against relegation-threatened energie cottbus .
jose ernesto , martin demichelis and lukas podolski scored for bayern .
hertha berlin , meanwhile , kept alive their hopes of a first bundesliga title with a 2-0 win over visiting bochum .
with three matches remaining , wolfsburg and bayern have 60 points , hertha is on 59 and stuttgart has 58 .
sv hamburg could move level with stuttgart , if they win in bremen on sunday .

the 840-metre summit of mount nebo , some 40 kilometres southwest of the capital amman , is holy to jews , christians and muslims alike .
the site is where the bible says god showed moses the promised land .
" the ancient tradition of pilgrimage to the holy places also reminds us of the inseparable bond between the church and the jewish people , " he said .
" his example reminds us that we too are part of the ageless pilgrimage of god 's people through history . "
after descending from the mountain , hundreds of people waving jordanian and vatican flags greeted benedict in the town of madaba , where he visited the greek orthodox basilica of st george , famous for its sixth century mosaic map of biblical palestine .
while in madaba , benedict blessed the cornerstone of a new catholic university being built there with help from jordan , a muslim country keen to maintain interfaith harmony .
" belief in god does not suppress the truth ; to the contrary , it encourages it , " said the former german theology professor .
" religion is disfigured when it is pressed into the service of ignorance or prejudice , contempt , violence and abuse . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 09.05.2009 report : germany facing 48-billion-euro tax shortfall großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's estimated tax revenues are to drop , while public debt continues to soar germany is reportedly facing a severe slump in tax revenues .
the economic downturn is definitely taking its toll , but not everybody believes the german state is short of money . the german finance ministry is expecting tax revenues to drop by 48 billion euros -lrb- 64 billion us dollars -rrb- this year , according to the german daily handelsblatt .
official november estimates put tax revenues at 572 billion euros , but the handelsblatt on saturday quoted government sources as saying that only 524 billion euros are expected to reach the treasury in 2009 .
the finance ministry declined to confirm the figures on saturday , pointing to a three-day meeting in bad kreuznach where experts will gather on tuesday to draw up an official tax estimate .
" estimates are not revenues " although the terms billion , and even trillion , have been used rather inflationary in the wake of the global credit crunch , a potential 48-billion-euro shortfall is no trifling matter .
especially as forecasts expect the german economy to shrink by an estimated six percent this year .
however , such figures still have to be taken with a pinch of salt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister peer steinbrueck is against tax cuts michael jaeger , the general secretary of the taxpayers association of europe , said people should not confuse estimates with real revenues .
he pointed out that tax revenues had actually increased by about 100 billion euros over the past four years .
" the state has n't got a problem with its tax revenue .
its got a problem with expenditure , " jaeger said .
" the basic problem is that the budget is constantly blown up , while public debt increases , and in the end the taxpayer has to foot the bill . "
german finance minister peer steinbrueck has warned that estimated tax revenues could drop by up to 350 billion euros over the next four years , and in view of the economic situation , he has so far refrained from promising tax cuts ahead of september 's federal election .
" something 's wrong with the system " jaeger not only believes that lower taxes are still possible in times of economic crisis , he is also a staunch advocate of cuts to reduce the burden on the struggling taxpayer , especially since actual tax revenues for 2008 were higher than in previous years .
" it is no contradiction to save and to invest in the proper areas , and also implement tax cuts , especially for the middle class which not only creates the jobs but also bears the brunt in times of crisis , " jaeger said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german public debt is increasing at 4,439 euros per second jaeger suggested the state could cut value added tax and do away with a special tax that was introduced after german reunification to bolster the battered east , the so-called " solidaritaetszuschlag " .
" we should have decreased public debt in the days when we had a fantastic economic upturn with abundant tax revenue .
if we create new net debt despite increasing tax revenues , then something 's wrong with the system , " he said .
according to the german taxpayers ' federation -lrb- bdst -rrb- , public debt amounted to more than 1.5 trillion euros on saturday evening , that 's more than 19,000 euros per head - it is important to give the date because germany 's debts are growing at an estimated 4,439 euros per second . nk , cg ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the economic downturn is definitely taking its toll , but not everybody believes the german state is short of money . the german finance ministry is expecting tax revenues to drop by 48 billion euros -lrb- 64 billion us dollars -rrb- this year , according to the german daily handelsblatt .
official november estimates put tax revenues at 572 billion euros , but the handelsblatt on saturday quoted government sources as saying that only 524 billion euros are expected to reach the treasury in 2009 .
the finance ministry declined to confirm the figures on saturday , pointing to a three-day meeting in bad kreuznach where experts will gather on tuesday to draw up an official tax estimate .
" estimates are not revenues " although the terms billion , and even trillion , have been used rather inflationary in the wake of the global credit crunch , a potential 48-billion-euro shortfall is no trifling matter .
especially as forecasts expect the german economy to shrink by an estimated six percent this year .
however , such figures still have to be taken with a pinch of salt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister peer steinbrueck is against tax cuts michael jaeger , the general secretary of the taxpayers association of europe , said people should not confuse estimates with real revenues .
he pointed out that tax revenues had actually increased by about 100 billion euros over the past four years .
" the state has n't got a problem with its tax revenue .
its got a problem with expenditure , " jaeger said .
" the basic problem is that the budget is constantly blown up , while public debt increases , and in the end the taxpayer has to foot the bill . "
german finance minister peer steinbrueck has warned that estimated tax revenues could drop by up to 350 billion euros over the next four years , and in view of the economic situation , he has so far refrained from promising tax cuts ahead of september 's federal election .
" something 's wrong with the system " jaeger not only believes that lower taxes are still possible in times of economic crisis , he is also a staunch advocate of cuts to reduce the burden on the struggling taxpayer , especially since actual tax revenues for 2008 were higher than in previous years .
" it is no contradiction to save and to invest in the proper areas , and also implement tax cuts , especially for the middle class which not only creates the jobs but also bears the brunt in times of crisis , " jaeger said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german public debt is increasing at 4,439 euros per second jaeger suggested the state could cut value added tax and do away with a special tax that was introduced after german reunification to bolster the battered east , the so-called " solidaritaetszuschlag " .
" we should have decreased public debt in the days when we had a fantastic economic upturn with abundant tax revenue .
if we create new net debt despite increasing tax revenues , then something 's wrong with the system , " he said .
according to the german taxpayers ' federation -lrb- bdst -rrb- , public debt amounted to more than 1.5 trillion euros on saturday evening , that 's more than 19,000 euros per head - it is important to give the date because germany 's debts are growing at an estimated 4,439 euros per second . nk , cg ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

amid economic challenges , zuma faces a difficult time bringing different factions together . heavy rains drenched the south african capital pretoria as crowds gathered saturday morning to watch jacob zuma 's inauguration .
however , when it was time to take the oath of office , the sun broke through the clouds and jacob zuma became the fourth democratically elected president of south africa .
he began his inaugural address by thanking nelson mandela .
" he made reconciliation the central theme of his term of office .
we will not deviate from that nation building task .
thank you madiba for showing us the way , " said zuma , referring to mandela by his clan name .
it has been a long journey for the 67-year old zuma who herded cows as a child and left school as a teenager to support his impoverished family .
his political life began in the trade unionist movement and he joined the african national congress in 1959 .
in 1963 he was arrested as he was leaving the country and spent 10 years imprisoned on robben island with fellow anc member and former president nelson mandela .
nearly 30 heads of state were in attendance including african union chairman libyan leader muammar al-qadhafi , zimbabwe 's president robert mugabe and king mswati iii of swaziland , africa 's last absolute monarch .
there were no heads of state of western powers in attendance .
all of them sent lower ranking ministers as representatives .
many challenges ahead zuma takes office at a time of slowing growth in south africa which is enduring its first recession in 17 years .
investors are keenly watching the makeup of his economic team , and are paying close attention to the fate of finance minister trevor manuel , a man who has been praised for his fiscal management .
analysts are also watching to see how zuma will reward the communists and unionists who stood by him throughout his career and foreign investors fear he may move the economy left .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anc supporters worked the election zuma acknowledged the tough economic climate in his speech saying , " we must acknowledge that we find ourselves in difficult economic times .
jobs are being lost in every economy across the world .
we will not be spared the negative impact , and are beginning to feel the pinch . "
given the global economic downturn , zuma may be hard pressed to make good on his generous promises of more jobs and improved services . av / ai , reuters / afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" from -lrb- us president barack -rrb- obama to un secretary general ban ki-moon , green issues are seen as the issues of the future , " party leader cem oezdemir said .
the environmentalist party 's platform calls for millions of new jobs by 2013 .
the party , whose seven-year government coalition with the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- ended in 2005 , said the majority of jobs would emerge in the climate-protection sector , in particular by investing in insulation technologies for buildings and in renewable energy .
expanding childcare centers and all-day schools would create further jobs , the party said in its election manifesto .
emphasis on green issues the party , which is angling to be a junior partner in the next government , said it wants to enshrine climate change prevention as a fundamental principle in germany 's constitution .
to this end , it would seek to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to levels 40 per cent below those from 1990 .
by 2040 , all energy sources should be renewable , according to the party 's platform .
the greens are also calling for subsidies for energy efficient homes and a 120-kilometer-per-hour speed limit on german highways .

" we need a coalition of ecological modernization , social justice and civil rights that can meet global challenges . "
the party also voted to back a minimum wage of 7.5 euros -lrb- $ 10 -rrb- per hour .
party members called for higher taxes for the wealthy , including an increase in the top tax bracket and higher capital gains taxes , coupled with lower welfare contributions for people on low incomes .
those measures would help soften the fiscal blow of the economic crisis , the party said .
at other party conferences , chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- formally chose her to lead their party into the september national election .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier 's left-leaning social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- chose him as their leading candidate for the upcoming vote .

the afghan government must show , better than they have in the past , “ that they are working to move the country forward ; that they are working to develop an administrative infrastructure , and to crack down on corruption , ” ferrero-waldner told the paper . “ mistakes were made in the past , ” she added .
her comments come a day before karzai is to meet german chancellor angela merkel in berlin .
german forces face worsening security the talks between merkel and karzai are expected to focus on the reconstruction of afghanistan , the ongoing fight against the islamist taliban and the increasingly dangerous situation faced by the german army in northern afghanistan .
a german soldier was killed two weeks ago in a taliban ambush near the city of kunduz , the 32nd german soldier killed while serving with the nato-led international security and assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan .
german news magazine der spiegel reported in its latest edition that the taliban was planning massive attacks on german soldiers to put pressure on politicians as the september general election draws close .
germany has 3,800 soldiers based in the relatively tranquil north of the country while us , british and canadian troops are battling the taliban in the south .
german foreign policy expert eckhart von klaeden , of merkel 's christian democratic party , told the berliner zeitung karzai needed to act " more decisively against corruption and the cultivation of drugs . "
there were signs " that this decisiveness is lacking , " he said .
green party defence spokeswoman winfried nachtwei warned the german government against complacency .
merkel should say " what germany will do against the downward spiral which we are witnessing in afghanistan 's security and political legitimacy , " nachtwei said .
both karzai and merkel are seeking re-election this year in their respective countries , and in merkel 's case , germany 's involvement in afghanistan is not popular with german voters . hf , sp / afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" today we 're sending a signal that democrats stand united against right-wing radicalism , racism and agitation , " said reinhard buetikofer , former head of the green party , who took part in the rally in downtown cologne .
cologne mayor fritz schramma said the peaceful protests by residents on saturday showed that the city is " open and tolerant . "
he also said cologne was " committed when it comes to defending these values . "
security was tight as more than 5,000 police officers , outfitted with water cannons and riot gear , cordoned off the square where the " anti-islam " demonstration took place .
the authorities were concerned that there could be clashes between the two sides , as has frequently been the case in the past . cologne police had banned the right-wing groups from holding a high-profile demonstration in front of the cologne cathedral in the city center and instead allowed them to assemble at another , more obscure , square in the deutz district .
police say there were about 300 people at the right-wing " pro koeln " and " pro nrw " rally .
the groups , which are campaigning against the building of a large new mosque in the city , held a larger rally last september which was joined by members of nationalist parties elsewhere in europe .
that protest sparked violent clashes and rioting by far-left demonstrators .
the two anti-islam groups are opposed to the building of mosques and what they see as an influx of moslem immigration into germany .
mayor schramma vowed that the forthcoming national elections in september would not be used to exploit ethnic or religious tensions .
there will be no " sordid election campaign on the back of our foreign fellow citizens , " he said . sp , gb / dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the pope met with muslim religious leaders , and members of the diplomatic corps in jordan in front of the al-hussein bin talal mosque in amman .
" often it is ideological manipulation of religion , sometimes with political goals , that is the catalyst for tensions and schisms , " the 82-year-old pontiff said .
" today muslims and christians - because of the burden of their mutual history full of misunderstandings - have to strive to be seen and recognized as believers truly loyal to the commandments . "
pope benedict failed to use the opportunity to apologise over the so-called regensburg lecture , which he gave in 2006 .
in that speech the pontiff quoted a medieval christian emperor who criticised teachings of the prophet mohammed as " evil and inhuman . "
jordanian islamist leaders , still sensitive about the pontiff 's comments , had demanded his visit be cancelled .
pope urges mutual respect and cooperation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi prays close to the antique basilica and moses memorial on monte nebo .
in an address at the moses memorial church on mount nebo on saturday morning , the pope called for reconciliation between christians and jews and reminded the two faiths of their shared heritage .
" may our encounter today inspire in us a renewed love for the canon of sacred scripture , " he said , " and a desire to overcome all obstacles to the reconciliation of christians and jews in mutual respect and cooperation . "
the 840-metre summit of mount nebo , some 40 kilometres southwest of the capital amman , is holy to jews , christians and muslims alike .
the site is where the bible says god showed moses the promised land .
" the ancient tradition of pilgrimage to the holy places also reminds us of the inseparable bond between the church and the jewish people , " he said .
" his example reminds us that we too are part of the ageless pilgrimage of god 's people through history . "
after descending from the mountain , hundreds of people waving jordanian and vatican flags greeted benedict in the town of madaba , where he visited the greek orthodox basilica of st george , famous for its sixth century mosaic map of biblical palestine .
while in madaba , benedict blessed the cornerstone of a new catholic university being built there with help from jordan , a muslim country keen to maintain interfaith harmony .
" belief in god does not suppress the truth ; to the contrary , it encourages it , " said the former german theology professor .
" religion is disfigured when it is pressed into the service of ignorance or prejudice , contempt , violence and abuse . "
he said the new university , which will teach in english , would produce " generations of qualified men and women of christian , muslim and of other religions ... educated in the values of wisdom , integrity , tolerance and peace .

latest case in point : the us now says it wants a seat on the un human rights council , a body george w. bush had shunned . back in 2008 , the bush administration decided to " disengage " from the un rights organization , saying it went too far in its tolerance of repressive states . but the new us administration , already more active in the council 's deliberations , now says it is ready to take on a leadership role . as one of three countries running for three vacant spots on the north america / europe slate , the us is virtually assured to win a seat on the regionally organized , 47-member council . un , rights groups greet change of heart " human rights are an essential element of american global foreign policy … with others , we will engage in the work of improving the un human rights system , " us secretary of state hillary clinton said in a statement . un officials and human rights groups applauded the announcement . the rotating un human rights council presidency is currently held by nigeria 's ambassador to the un , martin uhomoibhi . " we are very delighted to hear that united states wants to come back , " uhomoibhi said .
" we believe they will be a force for good in the council . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : council president uhomoibhi welcomed the move juliette de rivero , the spokeswoman for human-rights watchdog human rights watch in geneva , said they were " particularly happy about the decision , which we had long been advocating for . " but opponents say the un body is so deeply flawed that the us would be better served by continuing its boycott . the current human rights council is a reformed version of its predecessor , the un commission on human rights .
that organization was discredited for allowing countries with abominable rights records - such as sudan and zimbabwe , to join and to form powerful voting blocs that critics say stood in the way of change . critic : council ignores abuses , allows bias the new human rights council , which was formed in 2006 , has greater transparency , but critics say it is still sorely lacking .
they complain that its structures shield countries that continue to flaunt human rights - like china , cuba and saudi arabia - while israel and other democracies are disproportionately targeted . and they argue recent council condemnations of free speech are anti-democratic . the revamped council " has continued to focus biased attention on israel to the detriment of a balanced approach to the palestinian-israeli situation , " said brett schaefer , a public policy analyst at conservative us think tank the heritage foundation . " and it has ignored rampant human-rights abuses in a number of different countries around the world - such as china , cuba and zimbabwe - that , in their extent , scope and history actually dwarf those human rights abuses that are going on in the israeli-palestinian conflict . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights watch said the body is not perfect , but it is better than nothing schaefer and other critics recommend the un set criteria that member countries would have to meet before they are given decision-making power on human rights . that would fix the " main flaw , " he said .
" right now , the inmates run the asylum . the countries that you want most to scrutinize are those that are driving the agenda . … and just having the us on the council is not going to overcome that fact . " but juliette de rivero of human rights watch - who had found the bush administration 's decision to officially disengage from council business " a counterproductive and short sighted victory for abusive states " - believes the us will do more good than harm on the council . the guantanamo example she acknowledged that " a lot can be done to improve the work of the council , particularly in specific country situations . " still , she noted that the us 's decision to close the illegal prison in guantanamo bay , cuba " can be an example for other countries that you do need to acknowledge the mistakes you have committed , and to address human rights violations . " in other words , the us could be a good example . " all countries have human rights issues and the council 's mandate is to examine them , " she said . human rights council president uhomoibhi also admitted that the council is " not a perfect institution . "
but he believes it has the potential to make a contribution to the promotion of human rights - and that countries have a responsibility to contribute to that potential . ' foxes are guarding the chickens ' many critics take a less optimistic view of the situation , however .
un watchdog groups un watch and freedom watch published a study saying seven of the 18 countries that are expected to take seats on the council next week were completely unqualified to sit on the body , based on an annual human-rights score issued by freedom watch . electing these countries to the council is like " choosing the foxes to guard the chickens , " wrote un watch head hillel neuer . in fact , critics say , the us presence on the council will not change the dynamics of the council or help bring about an end to human-rights violations - it simply means the us will lose any leverage it has to protest change , the heritage foundation 's schaefer argues . the us will be one of 47 votes , and " one of 11 or 12 that actually are willing to step forward and champion human rights .
the rest of those countries are either indifferent , or hostile to human rights , " schaefer said . " in this case , being there is not part of the solution .

the economic downturn is definitely taking its toll , but not everybody believes the german state is short of money . the german finance ministry is expecting tax revenues to drop by 48 billion euros -lrb- 64 billion us dollars -rrb- this year , according to the german daily handelsblatt .
official november estimates put tax revenues at 572 billion euros , but the handelsblatt on saturday quoted government sources as saying that only 524 billion euros are expected to reach the treasury in 2009 .
the finance ministry declined to confirm the figures on saturday , pointing to a three-day meeting in bad kreuznach where experts will gather on tuesday to draw up an official tax estimate .
" estimates are not revenues " although the terms billion , and even trillion , have been used rather inflationary in the wake of the global credit crunch , a potential 48-billion-euro shortfall is no trifling matter .
especially as forecasts expect the german economy to shrink by an estimated six percent this year .
however , such figures still have to be taken with a pinch of salt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister peer steinbrueck is against tax cuts michael jaeger , the general secretary of the taxpayers association of europe , said people should not confuse estimates with real revenues .
he pointed out that tax revenues had actually increased by about 100 billion euros over the past four years .
" the state has n't got a problem with its tax revenue .
its got a problem with expenditure , " jaeger said .
" the basic problem is that the budget is constantly blown up , while public debt increases , and in the end the taxpayer has to foot the bill . "
german finance minister peer steinbrueck has warned that estimated tax revenues could drop by up to 350 billion euros over the next four years , and in view of the economic situation , he has so far refrained from promising tax cuts ahead of september 's federal election .
" something 's wrong with the system " jaeger not only believes that lower taxes are still possible in times of economic crisis , he is also a staunch advocate of cuts to reduce the burden on the struggling taxpayer , especially since actual tax revenues for 2008 were higher than in previous years .
" it is no contradiction to save and to invest in the proper areas , and also implement tax cuts , especially for the middle class which not only creates the jobs but also bears the brunt in times of crisis , " jaeger said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german public debt is increasing at 4,439 euros per second jaeger suggested the state could cut value added tax and do away with a special tax that was introduced after german reunification to bolster the battered east , the so-called " solidaritaetszuschlag " .
" we should have decreased public debt in the days when we had a fantastic economic upturn with abundant tax revenue .
if we create new net debt despite increasing tax revenues , then something 's wrong with the system , " he said .
according to the german taxpayers ' federation -lrb- bdst -rrb- , public debt amounted to more than 1.5 trillion euros on saturday evening , that 's more than 19,000 euros per head - it is important to give the date because germany 's debts are growing at an estimated 4,439 euros per second . nk , cg ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
