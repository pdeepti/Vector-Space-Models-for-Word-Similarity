the foundation is attempting to raise 120 million euros -lrb- $ 160 million -rrb- to ensure long term maintenance funding for buildings and ruins at the former nazi death camp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister donald tusk has called upon other nations to support the auschwitz foundation .
although the foundation has only been officially in existence for a week , the international response to the request for funds has been positive . jacek kastenlaniec , the managing director of the auschwitz-birkenau foundation , told deutsche welle that germany has already pledged a million euros for the foundation , and plans to contribute much more next year .
" we have an official declaration of france that they will contribute to this endowment fund , " kastenlaniec added , " and two days ago -lrb- british prime minster -rrb- gordon brown said great britain would participate in this program . "
call for eu support the fundraising efforts of the foundation have also been put on the agenda of a european union summit set to take place in june .
despite the world-wide economic crisis , kastenlaniec says other countries have recognized the importance of the foundation 's goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for many it was a one-way journey but those who did return hope their suffering will never be forgotten " for sure , the economic crisis makes our task more difficult , " he says .
but the project was prepared before the start of the economic crisis , and we can not wait until -lrb- it -rrb- ends because the objects and the buildings will not wait .
it makes this operation more difficult , but observing the reactions , the authorities of different countries understand that this is a special situation . "
kastenlaniec is confident the foundation will reach its fundraising goal because of the role auschwitz plays in teaching future generations about the lessons of the past .
" i think this goal will be reached .
it ’ s not only the countries which were in the past responsible for what was happening there or the countries where there were deportations , but this is a project for future generations . ”
" this place helps young generations understand why we make so many efforts to live on a peaceful continent without conflicts and work out the consequences of hatred and anti semitism , " kastelaniec said .
long-term maintenance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year over a million visitors came to auschwitz and its musuem the site of the auschwitz-birkenau camp and the state-run museum covers nearly two square kilometres and includes many buildings and ruins from when the camp was operational .
if the foundation reaches its goal of 120 million euros , maintenance for the site will be secured for the future . " it 's about maintaining what 's already there , " said kastelaniec .
" around 155 buildings , 300 ruins and 100,000 items , like suitcases , shoes and other proof of the crimes committed . "
the polish government will continue to fund the museum at auschwitz-birkenau , but money to maintain the historical integrity of the site has come from different sources in the past . " right now , if we have problems with the conservation , " kastelaniec says " we have to look for funds in the budget of the museum or we have to go look for funds from the polish ministry of culture or european union programs . "
that system works , he says , and prevents major problems at the site , but the foundation is attempting to take a more long term approach to preserving auschwitz . " the foundation will -lrb- ensure -rrb- that the team of very professional conservators will have no problem working on the preservation of the buildings or ruins , including the ruins of the crematories , " kastelaniec said .
" it would guarantee the security of the future of -lrb- the camp -rrb- . "
notorious nazi death camp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wladyslaw bartoszewski , auschwitz survivor and founder of the auschwitz-birkenau foundation auschwitz-birkenau was one of the nazis ' most notorious concentration camps .
it operated from 1940 until 1945 , when it was liberated by the soviet union 's red army .
after world war ii , it was estimated that more than a million people died at auschwitz . most of the victims were european jews , but also included non-jewish poles , soviet prisoners of war , gypsies and anti-nazi resistance fighters .
some prisoners died in the camp 's gas chambers , others were worked or starved to death .
it was one of six german concentration camps in poland . the museum and preservation efforts of auschwitz have always been conducted in close contact with survivors of the camp .
they include wladyslaw bartoszewski , who was imprisoned at auschwitz in 1940 .
he ’ s now the founder of the auschwitz-birkenau foundation and a former foreign minister of poland . in a statement on the auschwitz-birkenau memorial and museum website , bartoszewski spoke about the importance of preservation . " we will save from forgetting what they wanted to destroy , " he said , referring to nazis who tried to cover up what had gone on at the concentration camps . he also referred to the lasting legacy of holocaust survivors as part of the reason for creating the foundation . " we , the survivors , are in our last active years .
that is why acknowledged european authorities , whose personal experiences are connected with that time , appealed to create a constant preservation tool for this place as well as for continuing educational and museum activities , " bartoszewski said . mz / sh , afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

diplomats from the two sides met in brussels on wednesday .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
three confirmed cases of swine flu surface in eu given mexico 's status as a developing country , we are experiencing the effects of swine flu at a much greater magnitude .
many of mexico 's inhabitants may be malnourished , leading them to be more susceptible to the virus and can even be fatal .
this should be taken into account when comparing the effects of the virus among different countries . - lara arevalo , mexico i definitely think citizens from all over the world should step in to help support mexico in this situation .
we need more medications , equipment and even doctors . - jacobo alvarez , mexico i am very concerned about this new influenza , mainly because there is not much information about it .
i am 35-weeks pregnant and i can not find a site that tells me if i get this infection will my infant be harmed .
i also have a four-year-old son .
should i keep him out of daycare or school ?
i think that i am just as confused as the rest of the world . - rebecca black , us international community mulls response to piracy it is important that the international community understand the reasons why piracy and fundamentalism are spreading inside somalia and influencing the horn of africa region .
over the past three years , more than five local fishing cooperatives with more than four thousands beneficiaries suspended their fishing activities .
foreign vessels with high-tech trawlers have completely depleted the fish stocks in the areas of eyl , gara 'ad , hobyo harardher as well as the southern seashore .
until recently piracy was limited to the central regions of the country , but now more and more somalia districts are adopting the practice as a means to support themselves . - mohamed ali bile , somalia these outrageous armed attacks by the aggressive somali pirates must be stopped , no matter the age of the aggressors .
if they are armed and fire upon innocents , they must be curtailed by responsive firepower .
i realize somalia is a country without a lawful government ; it is controlled by warlords .
vessels plying the sealanes have the right to respond with adequate firepower to repel and / or eliminate the aggressors . - richard larssen , mexico everyone is focused on piracy but not asking why the piracy began in the first place : to ward off illegall fishing vessels and ships dumping toxic waste .
the accused are not always guilty . - marta kaye , us it is unbelievable that when pirates are captured , they receive a slap on their wrists and are sent on their way .
unless the european nations take decisive actions , this will be a continuing and escalating problem and the true losers will be the consumers of the goods being transported .
shame on you , holland for releasing the pirates . - karin oaks , us ot / sh send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de germany responds to swine flu as three confirmed cases surface in eu now that its eu neighbors have reported cases of swine flu , germany is taking measures at airports , but its stockpile of anti-virals is low .
baffling scientists , the new viral strain has only been deadly in mexico .
-lrb- 27.04.2009 -rrb- france and spain train their sights on somali pirates after french prime minister nicolas sarkozy 's first-ever state visit to spain , the two countries say they will extend their security cooperation .

however , in a statement read out by his lawyers , he has now admitted to the offense .
the man is accused of breaking laws preventing illicit arms exports by declaring the graphite exported from 2005 to 2007 to be low-grade .
this would have avoided the need to apply for a government clearance which would almost certainly have been refused .
german intelligence suspects the graphite was bought for iran 's missile program .
tehran is suspected of secretly developing nuclear weapons which could be delivered as the payload of the missiles .
the accused is the former chief executive of carbon-industrie-produkte gmbh , a firm that specialized in trading graphite .
in 2007 , germany imposed a ban on exports of any graphite , even the low-grade type , to iran .
plan involved transit through turkey technical books say rocket nozzles are often made of graphite , which is a form of carbon .
according to the website of the german newspaper rhein zeitung , the businessman met an iranian man in 2003 who suggested the idea of smuggling .
in 2005 , the defendant began shipping graphite , which he declared as low-grade , into turkey via truck .
from there , a contact person would bring the graphite into iran .
he sold the graphite for four times the purchase price .
the money was wired to an account in the seychelles islands .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 30.04.2009 brussels calls for curbs on executive super-bonuses großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some bank executives have received bonuses despite huge profit loses the european commission has responded to public anger over perceived managerial greed in the midst of recession by recommending curbs on bankers ’ pay and bonuses . the european union executive also issued tighter rules , on wednesday , for managing high-risk alternative investment funds , such as hedge funds .
the moves were prompted by the global financial crisis , which has in part been blamed on short-term profit-taking and lax financial regulation .
the proposals are part of a push by the eu to increase financial regulation in a bid to bring confidence back to financial markets .
" up to now , there have been far too many perverse incentives in place in the financial services industry .
it is neither sensible nor sane that pay incentives encourage excessive risk-taking for short-term gain , " said eu internal market commissioner charlie mccreevy while unveiling his proposals .
according to the commissioner , managers ' salaries should reflect " sound and effective risk management " rather than short-term gains , while the payment of bonuses should be linked to the long-term performance of the company .
moreover , a company 's remuneration policy should be " adequately disclosed to stakeholders " and properly supervised .
finally , banks should be allowed to claw back bonuses paid on the basis of data " which proved to be manifestly misstated , " officials in brussels said in a statement .
undeserved bonuses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccreevy wants to clamp down on golden parachutes " our message is very clear : directors ' remuneration must be clearly linked to performance and not rewards for failure , " mccreevy said .
data published by the commission in march showed that many of europe 's chief executive officers enjoyed ballooning salaries between 2003 and 2007 , with average bonuses surging from an equivalent of 70 percent of their base salaries to 151 percent .
in issuing his recommendations , mccreevy also urged financial firms to limit the benefits they pay to fired executives - the so-called " golden parachutes " - to no more than double their basic salary .
severance pay should be banned in case of failure .
the guidelines are non-binding , but mccreevy said at least some of them could be incorporated in the commission 's revised capital requirements directive , due to be unveiled in june .
wednesday 's proposed directive on bringing hedge funds under greater supervisory scrutiny would be binding if it were approved by both the european parliament and the finance ministers of the eu 's 27 member states .
pros and cons commission officials said alternative investment fund managers -lrb- aifm -rrb- , which include the managers of hedge funds and private equity funds , controlled around 2 trillion euros -lrb- $ 2.65 trillion -rrb- in assets in the eu at the end of 2008 .
the bulk of aifms are based in london , and wednesday 's proposal is seen as a compromise between the hard-line stance of countries such as germany and france , and that of countries such as britain , which argue that stricter regulation could drive financial firms away from europe .
the proposal disappointed advocates of tighter regulation , such as poul nyrup rasmussen , head of the party of european socialists , who described the directive as having " more holes than a swiss cheese . "
mccreevy acknowledged divisions , saying " for some , these proposals go too far , for others they do not go far enough . "
wednesday 's proposals take into account recent discussions held in london by the leaders of the world 's 20 most powerful nations .
european commission president jose manuel barroso said the eu was leading the way in the global drive to prevent further financial crises from occurring .
" -lrb- the proposals -rrb- will tackle systemic risks created by a lack of transparency and excessive risk-taking .
now we hope that others can join us , " barroso said . dfm , nw dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the moves were prompted by the global financial crisis , which has in part been blamed on short-term profit-taking and lax financial regulation .
the proposals are part of a push by the eu to increase financial regulation in a bid to bring confidence back to financial markets .
" up to now , there have been far too many perverse incentives in place in the financial services industry .
it is neither sensible nor sane that pay incentives encourage excessive risk-taking for short-term gain , " said eu internal market commissioner charlie mccreevy while unveiling his proposals .
according to the commissioner , managers ' salaries should reflect " sound and effective risk management " rather than short-term gains , while the payment of bonuses should be linked to the long-term performance of the company .
moreover , a company 's remuneration policy should be " adequately disclosed to stakeholders " and properly supervised .
finally , banks should be allowed to claw back bonuses paid on the basis of data " which proved to be manifestly misstated , " officials in brussels said in a statement .
undeserved bonuses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccreevy wants to clamp down on golden parachutes " our message is very clear : directors ' remuneration must be clearly linked to performance and not rewards for failure , " mccreevy said .
data published by the commission in march showed that many of europe 's chief executive officers enjoyed ballooning salaries between 2003 and 2007 , with average bonuses surging from an equivalent of 70 percent of their base salaries to 151 percent .
in issuing his recommendations , mccreevy also urged financial firms to limit the benefits they pay to fired executives - the so-called " golden parachutes " - to no more than double their basic salary .
severance pay should be banned in case of failure .
the guidelines are non-binding , but mccreevy said at least some of them could be incorporated in the commission 's revised capital requirements directive , due to be unveiled in june .
wednesday 's proposed directive on bringing hedge funds under greater supervisory scrutiny would be binding if it were approved by both the european parliament and the finance ministers of the eu 's 27 member states .
pros and cons commission officials said alternative investment fund managers -lrb- aifm -rrb- , which include the managers of hedge funds and private equity funds , controlled around 2 trillion euros -lrb- $ 2.65 trillion -rrb- in assets in the eu at the end of 2008 .
the bulk of aifms are based in london , and wednesday 's proposal is seen as a compromise between the hard-line stance of countries such as germany and france , and that of countries such as britain , which argue that stricter regulation could drive financial firms away from europe .
the proposal disappointed advocates of tighter regulation , such as poul nyrup rasmussen , head of the party of european socialists , who described the directive as having " more holes than a swiss cheese . "
mccreevy acknowledged divisions , saying " for some , these proposals go too far , for others they do not go far enough . "
wednesday 's proposals take into account recent discussions held in london by the leaders of the world 's 20 most powerful nations .
european commission president jose manuel barroso said the eu was leading the way in the global drive to prevent further financial crises from occurring .

the match in bremen is the second of four duels between the two northern rivals - only some 100 kilometers apart - within 19 days .
last week they clashed in the semi-finals of the germany 's dfb cup when bremen got the upper hand in a penalty shoot-out .

in the same timeframe the club has won three german league titles , four cup titles , the european cup winners ' cup and been a regular champions league qualifier .
despite the differences in long-term success , hamburg will make the short trip to bremen in good heart knowing they have done well on their travels in europe this season .

the statement was attributed to jana rihova , spokeswoman for the czech labor and social affairs ministry . the european commission confirmed that belgium and denmark would scrap remaining curbs from may 1 for job seekers from the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , poland , slovakia and slovenia , all of which joined the eu in 2004 .
all other eu countries - except germany and austria - have already lifted the labor restrictions imposed on the 2004 newcomers . meanwhile , citizens of bulgaria and romania , which joined the eu in 2007 , continue to face restrictions in the older member states except finland and sweden .
the measures were originally meant to ease the concerns of unions in older member states , which feared that cheap workers would flood their labor markets . all temporary labor restrictions are due to be phased out by the end of 2013 . ad / sh , ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 30.04.2009 poland seeks promises of funds to preserve auschwitz großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a trainload of victims destined for auschwitz concentration camp where more than a million died the polish government is calling on other countries to help support the newly-founded auschwitz-birkenau foundation , which hopes to raise 120 million euros to maintain the site of the former nazi death camp . in a letter to the leaders of 39 nations , polish prime minister donald tusk has called on other countries to support the newly established auschwitz-birkenau foundation .
the foundation is attempting to raise 120 million euros -lrb- $ 160 million -rrb- to ensure long term maintenance funding for buildings and ruins at the former nazi death camp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister donald tusk has called upon other nations to support the auschwitz foundation .
although the foundation has only been officially in existence for a week , the international response to the request for funds has been positive . jacek kastenlaniec , the managing director of the auschwitz-birkenau foundation , told deutsche welle that germany has already pledged a million euros for the foundation , and plans to contribute much more next year .
" we have an official declaration of france that they will contribute to this endowment fund , " kastenlaniec added , " and two days ago -lrb- british prime minster -rrb- gordon brown said great britain would participate in this program . "
call for eu support the fundraising efforts of the foundation have also been put on the agenda of a european union summit set to take place in june .
despite the world-wide economic crisis , kastenlaniec says other countries have recognized the importance of the foundation 's goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for many it was a one-way journey but those who did return hope their suffering will never be forgotten " for sure , the economic crisis makes our task more difficult , " he says .
but the project was prepared before the start of the economic crisis , and we can not wait until -lrb- it -rrb- ends because the objects and the buildings will not wait .
it makes this operation more difficult , but observing the reactions , the authorities of different countries understand that this is a special situation . "
kastenlaniec is confident the foundation will reach its fundraising goal because of the role auschwitz plays in teaching future generations about the lessons of the past .
" i think this goal will be reached .
it ’ s not only the countries which were in the past responsible for what was happening there or the countries where there were deportations , but this is a project for future generations . ”
" this place helps young generations understand why we make so many efforts to live on a peaceful continent without conflicts and work out the consequences of hatred and anti semitism , " kastelaniec said .
long-term maintenance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year over a million visitors came to auschwitz and its musuem the site of the auschwitz-birkenau camp and the state-run museum covers nearly two square kilometres and includes many buildings and ruins from when the camp was operational .
if the foundation reaches its goal of 120 million euros , maintenance for the site will be secured for the future . " it 's about maintaining what 's already there , " said kastelaniec .
" around 155 buildings , 300 ruins and 100,000 items , like suitcases , shoes and other proof of the crimes committed . "
the polish government will continue to fund the museum at auschwitz-birkenau , but money to maintain the historical integrity of the site has come from different sources in the past . " right now , if we have problems with the conservation , " kastelaniec says " we have to look for funds in the budget of the museum or we have to go look for funds from the polish ministry of culture or european union programs . "
that system works , he says , and prevents major problems at the site , but the foundation is attempting to take a more long term approach to preserving auschwitz . " the foundation will -lrb- ensure -rrb- that the team of very professional conservators will have no problem working on the preservation of the buildings or ruins , including the ruins of the crematories , " kastelaniec said .
" it would guarantee the security of the future of -lrb- the camp -rrb- . "
notorious nazi death camp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wladyslaw bartoszewski , auschwitz survivor and founder of the auschwitz-birkenau foundation auschwitz-birkenau was one of the nazis ' most notorious concentration camps .
it operated from 1940 until 1945 , when it was liberated by the soviet union 's red army .
after world war ii , it was estimated that more than a million people died at auschwitz . most of the victims were european jews , but also included non-jewish poles , soviet prisoners of war , gypsies and anti-nazi resistance fighters .
some prisoners died in the camp 's gas chambers , others were worked or starved to death .
it was one of six german concentration camps in poland . the museum and preservation efforts of auschwitz have always been conducted in close contact with survivors of the camp .
they include wladyslaw bartoszewski , who was imprisoned at auschwitz in 1940 .
he ’ s now the founder of the auschwitz-birkenau foundation and a former foreign minister of poland . in a statement on the auschwitz-birkenau memorial and museum website , bartoszewski spoke about the importance of preservation . " we will save from forgetting what they wanted to destroy , " he said , referring to nazis who tried to cover up what had gone on at the concentration camps . he also referred to the lasting legacy of holocaust survivors as part of the reason for creating the foundation . " we , the survivors , are in our last active years .
that is why acknowledged european authorities , whose personal experiences are connected with that time , appealed to create a constant preservation tool for this place as well as for continuing educational and museum activities , " bartoszewski said . mz / sh , afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the us is expected to make requests to european allies to accommodate detainees from the controversial detention facility at guantanamo bay within weeks , amid reports that germany could be willing to help . germany 's interior minister wolfgang schaeuble has said that germany would consider accepting former inmates from the controversial us military detention facility at guantanamo bay , according to a report in the wall street journal .
schaeuble had previously expressed reservations about the possiblity of germany taking guantanamo detainees , but in january german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in an open letter to us president barack obama that germany would be willing to do so if it would help obama close the naval base in cuba .
key meeting with us envoy schaeuble 's apparent change of heart follows a meeting in berlin on wednesday with us attorney general eric holder , who earlier in the week visited london and prague to discuss the closure of the disputed detention center .
one of obama 's first acts after taking office in january was to order the closure of the anti-terror lockup by the end of the year .
the prison , where prisoners have been held without charges or trial , had been widely criticized by the international community for its use of so-called " enhanced interrogation techniques " which included simulated drowning known as waterboarding .
the previous us administration under george w. bush claimed that the techniques used at guantanamo did not amount to torture .
willing allies ?
out of the 241 detainees at guantanamo , 30 people have so far been cleared for release .
holder said in berlin that the us would be likely to submit formal requests to allies to take in former detainees in the coming weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us is unsure where to put its prisoners once released holder added that he had been " pleasantly surprised " by the willingness of allies to help resettle guantanamo inmates .
since taking office in january , the uk has been sent one prisoner from guantanamo and france has pledged to take another .
following a meeting with schaeuble , holder told reporters : " although no specific requests were made and no specific promises were given , what i have worked to do during the course of the trip is to lay a foundation for more specific requests that i think will come in the future . "
" i know that europe did not open guantanamo and that in fact a great many on this continent opposed it , " holder said . " to close guantanamo we must all make sacrifices and we must all be willing to make unpopular choices . "
a spokesman for the interior ministry told deutsche welle that first of all , germany expected detainees to be released to their home countries , and that germany was not aware of any german nationals being held at guantanamo .
comments from interior ministry in cases where former detainees could not be returned to their home countries , germany considered the us to be primarily responsible for the accommodation of former detainees .
" if this is not possible then the us would need to explain why this is the case , " the spokesman said .
" if germany is asked to take a specific person the first thing which would have to be checked is whether there is a relationship between this person and germany . "
spain to investigate in a separate development , spanish judge balthasar garzon on wednesday formally launched a criminal investigation into whether us officials condoned the use of torture at guantanamo .
the probe has been given greater impetus following the release last week by the obama administration of classified documents which list the interrogation methods used at guantanamo .
the allegations of torture include the use of sexual abuse , beatings and the throwing of fluids into prisoners ' eyes . ml / en / rm afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the match in bremen is the second of four duels between the two northern rivals - only some 100 kilometers apart - within 19 days .
last week they clashed in the semi-finals of the germany 's dfb cup when bremen got the upper hand in a penalty shoot-out .
but hamburg wo n't mind if they repeat last wednesday 's 1-1 score after regular time as a tie would be a good result to take back home for next week 's second leg .
tale of two clubs hamburg are still in the bundesliga title race despite a 2-0 defeat to borussia dortmund on saturday as they begin to emerge from the shadow of their neighbors , who have had a poor league season .
hamburg sit fourth in the bundesliga , while bremen languish in 10th .
the northern german club 's last major title came in 1987 when it won the dfb cup .
that success came four seasons after hamburg were crowned european champions .
bremen 's track record , meanwhile , has been an image of comparative success .
in the same timeframe the club has won three german league titles , four cup titles , the european cup winners ' cup and been a regular champions league qualifier .
despite the differences in long-term success , hamburg will make the short trip to bremen in good heart knowing they have done well on their travels in europe this season .
until losing at manchester city in the previous round , they had won five of their six games .
" everyone knows that little things will be decisive against bremen , " their dutch coach martin jol said .
" we know them and they know us , so there 's nothing new there . "
ins and outs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : petric 's attacking prowess will be sorely missed on thursday jol will be without top scorer mladen petric , who required stitches to a gashed shin but hopes to be fit for the second leg , and defender marcell jansen , who has failed to recover from bruised ribs , the club said on wednesday .
forward jonathan pitroipa has , however , recovered from a hip problem and brazilian axel silva is also available for a possible defensive midfield role again after he was allowed to miss the match against dortmund for personal reasons .
bremen should also be close to full strength , with captain frank baumann on the way back following a muscle complaint .
much could depend on the form of bremen 's brazilian midfielder diego , whom bremen confirmed wednesday was being pursued by juventus .
" if we again play our game then we will win , " diego said .
first meeting the two ukrainian powerhouses have been carving up the league title between them in recent years but have never met in european competition .
no ukrainian team has ever reached the final of the uefa cup , and for donetsk , who eliminated olympique marseille in the quarters , the semi-finals of a european competition is unchartered territory .
dynamo kiev , who beat paris st germain in the previous round , do have european pedigree , having twice won the cup winners ' cups and having made the semi-finals of the european cup or champions league three times .
the ukrainian league leaders already eliminated one ukrainian side in metalist kharkiv , who they beat on away goals in the last 16 after a 1-0 home win was followed up by a 3-2 defeat away .
shakhtar 's romanian coach mircea lucescu already has one eye on the second leg with concerns over his side 's olympiysky stadium pitch .
" the pitch at olimpiysky is destroying our play , " he was reported as saying .
" as a coach , i feel ashamed to make my players perform on a pitch like this . " dfm , dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de uefa cup -pipe- 30.04.2009 german , ukrainian clubs fight for uefa cup honors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego , right , is the bright spark of bremen 's midfield domestic pride will be at stake in europe when ukrainian and german clubs battle against each other in the semi-finals of the uefa cup in first-leg matches on thursday . ukrainian powerhouses dynamo kiev and shakhtar donetsk meet for the right to play the final in istanbul on may 20 against the winner of the encounter between german rivals werder bremen and sv hamburg .
the match in bremen is the second of four duels between the two northern rivals - only some 100 kilometers apart - within 19 days .
last week they clashed in the semi-finals of the germany 's dfb cup when bremen got the upper hand in a penalty shoot-out .
but hamburg wo n't mind if they repeat last wednesday 's 1-1 score after regular time as a tie would be a good result to take back home for next week 's second leg .
tale of two clubs hamburg are still in the bundesliga title race despite a 2-0 defeat to borussia dortmund on saturday as they begin to emerge from the shadow of their neighbors , who have had a poor league season .
hamburg sit fourth in the bundesliga , while bremen languish in 10th .
the northern german club 's last major title came in 1987 when it won the dfb cup .
that success came four seasons after hamburg were crowned european champions .
bremen 's track record , meanwhile , has been an image of comparative success .
in the same timeframe the club has won three german league titles , four cup titles , the european cup winners ' cup and been a regular champions league qualifier .
despite the differences in long-term success , hamburg will make the short trip to bremen in good heart knowing they have done well on their travels in europe this season .
until losing at manchester city in the previous round , they had won five of their six games .
" everyone knows that little things will be decisive against bremen , " their dutch coach martin jol said .
" we know them and they know us , so there 's nothing new there . "
ins and outs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : petric 's attacking prowess will be sorely missed on thursday jol will be without top scorer mladen petric , who required stitches to a gashed shin but hopes to be fit for the second leg , and defender marcell jansen , who has failed to recover from bruised ribs , the club said on wednesday .
forward jonathan pitroipa has , however , recovered from a hip problem and brazilian axel silva is also available for a possible defensive midfield role again after he was allowed to miss the match against dortmund for personal reasons .
bremen should also be close to full strength , with captain frank baumann on the way back following a muscle complaint .
much could depend on the form of bremen 's brazilian midfielder diego , whom bremen confirmed wednesday was being pursued by juventus .
" if we again play our game then we will win , " diego said .
first meeting the two ukrainian powerhouses have been carving up the league title between them in recent years but have never met in european competition .
no ukrainian team has ever reached the final of the uefa cup , and for donetsk , who eliminated olympique marseille in the quarters , the semi-finals of a european competition is unchartered territory .
dynamo kiev , who beat paris st germain in the previous round , do have european pedigree , having twice won the cup winners ' cups and having made the semi-finals of the european cup or champions league three times .
the ukrainian league leaders already eliminated one ukrainian side in metalist kharkiv , who they beat on away goals in the last 16 after a 1-0 home win was followed up by a 3-2 defeat away .
shakhtar 's romanian coach mircea lucescu already has one eye on the second leg with concerns over his side 's olympiysky stadium pitch .
" the pitch at olimpiysky is destroying our play , " he was reported as saying .
" as a coach , i feel ashamed to make my players perform on a pitch like this . " dfm , dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" millions of americans are still without jobs and homes , and more will be lost before this recession is over . " obama 's remarks came after government figures showed the us economy shrank 6.1 percent in the first quarter of this year , though the federal reserve touted signs that the outlook had " improved modestly " over the past few weeks . obama asked for " patience " from the public and also reiterated his long-running theme that the country had to build a " new foundation for growth " in the coming years that was less reliant on debt and lax regulations of financial institutions .

the foundation is attempting to raise 120 million euros -lrb- $ 160 million -rrb- to ensure long term maintenance funding for buildings and ruins at the former nazi death camp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister donald tusk has called upon other nations to support the auschwitz foundation .
although the foundation has only been officially in existence for a week , the international response to the request for funds has been positive . jacek kastenlaniec , the managing director of the auschwitz-birkenau foundation , told deutsche welle that germany has already pledged a million euros for the foundation , and plans to contribute much more next year .
" we have an official declaration of france that they will contribute to this endowment fund , " kastenlaniec added , " and two days ago -lrb- british prime minster -rrb- gordon brown said great britain would participate in this program . "
call for eu support the fundraising efforts of the foundation have also been put on the agenda of a european union summit set to take place in june .
despite the world-wide economic crisis , kastenlaniec says other countries have recognized the importance of the foundation 's goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for many it was a one-way journey but those who did return hope their suffering will never be forgotten " for sure , the economic crisis makes our task more difficult , " he says .
but the project was prepared before the start of the economic crisis , and we can not wait until -lrb- it -rrb- ends because the objects and the buildings will not wait .
it makes this operation more difficult , but observing the reactions , the authorities of different countries understand that this is a special situation . "
kastenlaniec is confident the foundation will reach its fundraising goal because of the role auschwitz plays in teaching future generations about the lessons of the past .
" i think this goal will be reached .
it ’ s not only the countries which were in the past responsible for what was happening there or the countries where there were deportations , but this is a project for future generations . ”
" this place helps young generations understand why we make so many efforts to live on a peaceful continent without conflicts and work out the consequences of hatred and anti semitism , " kastelaniec said .
long-term maintenance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year over a million visitors came to auschwitz and its musuem the site of the auschwitz-birkenau camp and the state-run museum covers nearly two square kilometres and includes many buildings and ruins from when the camp was operational .
if the foundation reaches its goal of 120 million euros , maintenance for the site will be secured for the future . " it 's about maintaining what 's already there , " said kastelaniec .
" around 155 buildings , 300 ruins and 100,000 items , like suitcases , shoes and other proof of the crimes committed . "
the polish government will continue to fund the museum at auschwitz-birkenau , but money to maintain the historical integrity of the site has come from different sources in the past . " right now , if we have problems with the conservation , " kastelaniec says " we have to look for funds in the budget of the museum or we have to go look for funds from the polish ministry of culture or european union programs . "
that system works , he says , and prevents major problems at the site , but the foundation is attempting to take a more long term approach to preserving auschwitz . " the foundation will -lrb- ensure -rrb- that the team of very professional conservators will have no problem working on the preservation of the buildings or ruins , including the ruins of the crematories , " kastelaniec said .
" it would guarantee the security of the future of -lrb- the camp -rrb- . "
notorious nazi death camp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wladyslaw bartoszewski , auschwitz survivor and founder of the auschwitz-birkenau foundation auschwitz-birkenau was one of the nazis ' most notorious concentration camps .
it operated from 1940 until 1945 , when it was liberated by the soviet union 's red army .
after world war ii , it was estimated that more than a million people died at auschwitz . most of the victims were european jews , but also included non-jewish poles , soviet prisoners of war , gypsies and anti-nazi resistance fighters .
some prisoners died in the camp 's gas chambers , others were worked or starved to death .
it was one of six german concentration camps in poland . the museum and preservation efforts of auschwitz have always been conducted in close contact with survivors of the camp .
they include wladyslaw bartoszewski , who was imprisoned at auschwitz in 1940 .
he ’ s now the founder of the auschwitz-birkenau foundation and a former foreign minister of poland . in a statement on the auschwitz-birkenau memorial and museum website , bartoszewski spoke about the importance of preservation . " we will save from forgetting what they wanted to destroy , " he said , referring to nazis who tried to cover up what had gone on at the concentration camps . he also referred to the lasting legacy of holocaust survivors as part of the reason for creating the foundation . " we , the survivors , are in our last active years .
that is why acknowledged european authorities , whose personal experiences are connected with that time , appealed to create a constant preservation tool for this place as well as for continuing educational and museum activities , " bartoszewski said . mz / sh , afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the us is expected to make requests to european allies to accommodate detainees from the controversial detention facility at guantanamo bay within weeks , amid reports that germany could be willing to help . germany 's interior minister wolfgang schaeuble has said that germany would consider accepting former inmates from the controversial us military detention facility at guantanamo bay , according to a report in the wall street journal .
schaeuble had previously expressed reservations about the possiblity of germany taking guantanamo detainees , but in january german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in an open letter to us president barack obama that germany would be willing to do so if it would help obama close the naval base in cuba .
key meeting with us envoy schaeuble 's apparent change of heart follows a meeting in berlin on wednesday with us attorney general eric holder , who earlier in the week visited london and prague to discuss the closure of the disputed detention center .
one of obama 's first acts after taking office in january was to order the closure of the anti-terror lockup by the end of the year .
the prison , where prisoners have been held without charges or trial , had been widely criticized by the international community for its use of so-called " enhanced interrogation techniques " which included simulated drowning known as waterboarding .
the previous us administration under george w. bush claimed that the techniques used at guantanamo did not amount to torture .
willing allies ?
out of the 241 detainees at guantanamo , 30 people have so far been cleared for release .
holder said in berlin that the us would be likely to submit formal requests to allies to take in former detainees in the coming weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us is unsure where to put its prisoners once released holder added that he had been " pleasantly surprised " by the willingness of allies to help resettle guantanamo inmates .
since taking office in january , the uk has been sent one prisoner from guantanamo and france has pledged to take another .
following a meeting with schaeuble , holder told reporters : " although no specific requests were made and no specific promises were given , what i have worked to do during the course of the trip is to lay a foundation for more specific requests that i think will come in the future . "
" i know that europe did not open guantanamo and that in fact a great many on this continent opposed it , " holder said . " to close guantanamo we must all make sacrifices and we must all be willing to make unpopular choices . "
a spokesman for the interior ministry told deutsche welle that first of all , germany expected detainees to be released to their home countries , and that germany was not aware of any german nationals being held at guantanamo .
comments from interior ministry in cases where former detainees could not be returned to their home countries , germany considered the us to be primarily responsible for the accommodation of former detainees .
" if this is not possible then the us would need to explain why this is the case , " the spokesman said .
" if germany is asked to take a specific person the first thing which would have to be checked is whether there is a relationship between this person and germany . "
spain to investigate in a separate development , spanish judge balthasar garzon on wednesday formally launched a criminal investigation into whether us officials condoned the use of torture at guantanamo .
the probe has been given greater impetus following the release last week by the obama administration of classified documents which list the interrogation methods used at guantanamo .

the us is expected to make requests to european allies to accommodate detainees from the controversial detention facility at guantanamo bay within weeks , amid reports that germany could be willing to help . germany 's interior minister wolfgang schaeuble has said that germany would consider accepting former inmates from the controversial us military detention facility at guantanamo bay , according to a report in the wall street journal .
schaeuble had previously expressed reservations about the possiblity of germany taking guantanamo detainees , but in january german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in an open letter to us president barack obama that germany would be willing to do so if it would help obama close the naval base in cuba .
key meeting with us envoy schaeuble 's apparent change of heart follows a meeting in berlin on wednesday with us attorney general eric holder , who earlier in the week visited london and prague to discuss the closure of the disputed detention center .
one of obama 's first acts after taking office in january was to order the closure of the anti-terror lockup by the end of the year .
the prison , where prisoners have been held without charges or trial , had been widely criticized by the international community for its use of so-called " enhanced interrogation techniques " which included simulated drowning known as waterboarding .
the previous us administration under george w. bush claimed that the techniques used at guantanamo did not amount to torture .
willing allies ?
out of the 241 detainees at guantanamo , 30 people have so far been cleared for release .
holder said in berlin that the us would be likely to submit formal requests to allies to take in former detainees in the coming weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us is unsure where to put its prisoners once released holder added that he had been " pleasantly surprised " by the willingness of allies to help resettle guantanamo inmates .
since taking office in january , the uk has been sent one prisoner from guantanamo and france has pledged to take another .
following a meeting with schaeuble , holder told reporters : " although no specific requests were made and no specific promises were given , what i have worked to do during the course of the trip is to lay a foundation for more specific requests that i think will come in the future . "
" i know that europe did not open guantanamo and that in fact a great many on this continent opposed it , " holder said . " to close guantanamo we must all make sacrifices and we must all be willing to make unpopular choices . "
a spokesman for the interior ministry told deutsche welle that first of all , germany expected detainees to be released to their home countries , and that germany was not aware of any german nationals being held at guantanamo .
comments from interior ministry in cases where former detainees could not be returned to their home countries , germany considered the us to be primarily responsible for the accommodation of former detainees .
" if this is not possible then the us would need to explain why this is the case , " the spokesman said .
" if germany is asked to take a specific person the first thing which would have to be checked is whether there is a relationship between this person and germany . "
spain to investigate in a separate development , spanish judge balthasar garzon on wednesday formally launched a criminal investigation into whether us officials condoned the use of torture at guantanamo .
the probe has been given greater impetus following the release last week by the obama administration of classified documents which list the interrogation methods used at guantanamo .
the allegations of torture include the use of sexual abuse , beatings and the throwing of fluids into prisoners ' eyes . ml / en / rm afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the foundation is attempting to raise 120 million euros -lrb- $ 160 million -rrb- to ensure long term maintenance funding for buildings and ruins at the former nazi death camp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister donald tusk has called upon other nations to support the auschwitz foundation .
although the foundation has only been officially in existence for a week , the international response to the request for funds has been positive . jacek kastenlaniec , the managing director of the auschwitz-birkenau foundation , told deutsche welle that germany has already pledged a million euros for the foundation , and plans to contribute much more next year .
" we have an official declaration of france that they will contribute to this endowment fund , " kastenlaniec added , " and two days ago -lrb- british prime minster -rrb- gordon brown said great britain would participate in this program . "
call for eu support the fundraising efforts of the foundation have also been put on the agenda of a european union summit set to take place in june .
despite the world-wide economic crisis , kastenlaniec says other countries have recognized the importance of the foundation 's goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for many it was a one-way journey but those who did return hope their suffering will never be forgotten " for sure , the economic crisis makes our task more difficult , " he says .
but the project was prepared before the start of the economic crisis , and we can not wait until -lrb- it -rrb- ends because the objects and the buildings will not wait .
it makes this operation more difficult , but observing the reactions , the authorities of different countries understand that this is a special situation . "
kastenlaniec is confident the foundation will reach its fundraising goal because of the role auschwitz plays in teaching future generations about the lessons of the past .
" i think this goal will be reached .
it ’ s not only the countries which were in the past responsible for what was happening there or the countries where there were deportations , but this is a project for future generations . ”
" this place helps young generations understand why we make so many efforts to live on a peaceful continent without conflicts and work out the consequences of hatred and anti semitism , " kastelaniec said .
long-term maintenance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year over a million visitors came to auschwitz and its musuem the site of the auschwitz-birkenau camp and the state-run museum covers nearly two square kilometres and includes many buildings and ruins from when the camp was operational .
if the foundation reaches its goal of 120 million euros , maintenance for the site will be secured for the future . " it 's about maintaining what 's already there , " said kastelaniec .
" around 155 buildings , 300 ruins and 100,000 items , like suitcases , shoes and other proof of the crimes committed . "
the polish government will continue to fund the museum at auschwitz-birkenau , but money to maintain the historical integrity of the site has come from different sources in the past . " right now , if we have problems with the conservation , " kastelaniec says " we have to look for funds in the budget of the museum or we have to go look for funds from the polish ministry of culture or european union programs . "
that system works , he says , and prevents major problems at the site , but the foundation is attempting to take a more long term approach to preserving auschwitz . " the foundation will -lrb- ensure -rrb- that the team of very professional conservators will have no problem working on the preservation of the buildings or ruins , including the ruins of the crematories , " kastelaniec said .
" it would guarantee the security of the future of -lrb- the camp -rrb- . "

the foundation is attempting to raise 120 million euros -lrb- $ 160 million -rrb- to ensure long term maintenance funding for buildings and ruins at the former nazi death camp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister donald tusk has called upon other nations to support the auschwitz foundation .
although the foundation has only been officially in existence for a week , the international response to the request for funds has been positive . jacek kastenlaniec , the managing director of the auschwitz-birkenau foundation , told deutsche welle that germany has already pledged a million euros for the foundation , and plans to contribute much more next year .
" we have an official declaration of france that they will contribute to this endowment fund , " kastenlaniec added , " and two days ago -lrb- british prime minster -rrb- gordon brown said great britain would participate in this program . "
call for eu support the fundraising efforts of the foundation have also been put on the agenda of a european union summit set to take place in june .
despite the world-wide economic crisis , kastenlaniec says other countries have recognized the importance of the foundation 's goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for many it was a one-way journey but those who did return hope their suffering will never be forgotten " for sure , the economic crisis makes our task more difficult , " he says .
but the project was prepared before the start of the economic crisis , and we can not wait until -lrb- it -rrb- ends because the objects and the buildings will not wait .
it makes this operation more difficult , but observing the reactions , the authorities of different countries understand that this is a special situation . "
kastenlaniec is confident the foundation will reach its fundraising goal because of the role auschwitz plays in teaching future generations about the lessons of the past .
" i think this goal will be reached .
it ’ s not only the countries which were in the past responsible for what was happening there or the countries where there were deportations , but this is a project for future generations . ”
" this place helps young generations understand why we make so many efforts to live on a peaceful continent without conflicts and work out the consequences of hatred and anti semitism , " kastelaniec said .
long-term maintenance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year over a million visitors came to auschwitz and its musuem the site of the auschwitz-birkenau camp and the state-run museum covers nearly two square kilometres and includes many buildings and ruins from when the camp was operational .
if the foundation reaches its goal of 120 million euros , maintenance for the site will be secured for the future . " it 's about maintaining what 's already there , " said kastelaniec .
" around 155 buildings , 300 ruins and 100,000 items , like suitcases , shoes and other proof of the crimes committed . "
the polish government will continue to fund the museum at auschwitz-birkenau , but money to maintain the historical integrity of the site has come from different sources in the past . " right now , if we have problems with the conservation , " kastelaniec says " we have to look for funds in the budget of the museum or we have to go look for funds from the polish ministry of culture or european union programs . "
that system works , he says , and prevents major problems at the site , but the foundation is attempting to take a more long term approach to preserving auschwitz . " the foundation will -lrb- ensure -rrb- that the team of very professional conservators will have no problem working on the preservation of the buildings or ruins , including the ruins of the crematories , " kastelaniec said .
" it would guarantee the security of the future of -lrb- the camp -rrb- . "

it operated from 1940 until 1945 , when it was liberated by the soviet union 's red army .
after world war ii , it was estimated that more than a million people died at auschwitz . most of the victims were european jews , but also included non-jewish poles , soviet prisoners of war , gypsies and anti-nazi resistance fighters .

he ’ s now the founder of the auschwitz-birkenau foundation and a former foreign minister of poland . in a statement on the auschwitz-birkenau memorial and museum website , bartoszewski spoke about the importance of preservation . " we will save from forgetting what they wanted to destroy , " he said , referring to nazis who tried to cover up what had gone on at the concentration camps . he also referred to the lasting legacy of holocaust survivors as part of the reason for creating the foundation . " we , the survivors , are in our last active years .
that is why acknowledged european authorities , whose personal experiences are connected with that time , appealed to create a constant preservation tool for this place as well as for continuing educational and museum activities , " bartoszewski said . mz / sh , afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the us is expected to make requests to european allies to accommodate detainees from the controversial detention facility at guantanamo bay within weeks , amid reports that germany could be willing to help . germany 's interior minister wolfgang schaeuble has said that germany would consider accepting former inmates from the controversial us military detention facility at guantanamo bay , according to a report in the wall street journal .
schaeuble had previously expressed reservations about the possiblity of germany taking guantanamo detainees , but in january german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in an open letter to us president barack obama that germany would be willing to do so if it would help obama close the naval base in cuba .
key meeting with us envoy schaeuble 's apparent change of heart follows a meeting in berlin on wednesday with us attorney general eric holder , who earlier in the week visited london and prague to discuss the closure of the disputed detention center .
one of obama 's first acts after taking office in january was to order the closure of the anti-terror lockup by the end of the year .
the prison , where prisoners have been held without charges or trial , had been widely criticized by the international community for its use of so-called " enhanced interrogation techniques " which included simulated drowning known as waterboarding .
the previous us administration under george w. bush claimed that the techniques used at guantanamo did not amount to torture .
willing allies ?
out of the 241 detainees at guantanamo , 30 people have so far been cleared for release .
holder said in berlin that the us would be likely to submit formal requests to allies to take in former detainees in the coming weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us is unsure where to put its prisoners once released holder added that he had been " pleasantly surprised " by the willingness of allies to help resettle guantanamo inmates .
since taking office in january , the uk has been sent one prisoner from guantanamo and france has pledged to take another .
following a meeting with schaeuble , holder told reporters : " although no specific requests were made and no specific promises were given , what i have worked to do during the course of the trip is to lay a foundation for more specific requests that i think will come in the future . "
" i know that europe did not open guantanamo and that in fact a great many on this continent opposed it , " holder said . " to close guantanamo we must all make sacrifices and we must all be willing to make unpopular choices . "
a spokesman for the interior ministry told deutsche welle that first of all , germany expected detainees to be released to their home countries , and that germany was not aware of any german nationals being held at guantanamo .
comments from interior ministry in cases where former detainees could not be returned to their home countries , germany considered the us to be primarily responsible for the accommodation of former detainees .
" if this is not possible then the us would need to explain why this is the case , " the spokesman said .
" if germany is asked to take a specific person the first thing which would have to be checked is whether there is a relationship between this person and germany . "
spain to investigate in a separate development , spanish judge balthasar garzon on wednesday formally launched a criminal investigation into whether us officials condoned the use of torture at guantanamo .
the probe has been given greater impetus following the release last week by the obama administration of classified documents which list the interrogation methods used at guantanamo .
the allegations of torture include the use of sexual abuse , beatings and the throwing of fluids into prisoners ' eyes . ml / en / rm afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" around 155 buildings , 300 ruins and 100,000 items , like suitcases , shoes and other proof of the crimes committed . "
the polish government will continue to fund the museum at auschwitz-birkenau , but money to maintain the historical integrity of the site has come from different sources in the past . " right now , if we have problems with the conservation , " kastelaniec says " we have to look for funds in the budget of the museum or we have to go look for funds from the polish ministry of culture or european union programs . "
that system works , he says , and prevents major problems at the site , but the foundation is attempting to take a more long term approach to preserving auschwitz . " the foundation will -lrb- ensure -rrb- that the team of very professional conservators will have no problem working on the preservation of the buildings or ruins , including the ruins of the crematories , " kastelaniec said .

" even as we clear away the wreckage of this recession ... we ca n't go back to an economy that is built on a pile of sand , " obama said . the global economy has largely been brought down by excessive risks taken in financial sectors , especially in the us housing market that began folding in mid-2006 . obama said he expected far-reaching reforms on how wall street is regulated to be adopted by the end of the year . pakistan instability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pakistani military has been unable to drive out the taliban obama spoke at length on most major foreign and domestic issues affecting the us , including the situation in pakistan , whose government is struggling to contain the growing taliban insurgency . obama said the pakistani government lacked the ability to provide basic services for its people and promised the us would do all it could to build up its institutions .

shareholders of hre have until monday to sell their stock to the government for a total of 290 million euros .
the flowers company said on thursday that it now expects to mount a legal challenge to the bank 's nationalisation .
german finance minister peer steinbrueck vowed that the goverment would simply nationalize hre if flowers & co refuses to accept the government 's share-price offer , which steinbrueck described as " very fair " .
hre became the most prominent german victim of the global credit crisis last september after its ireland-based unit depfa bank failed to find short-term funding .
since then the german government has shored up troubled hre with loan guarantees and cash injections totalling 102 billion euros .
the german government has passed temporary legislation to nationalize hre if a voluntary sale fails .
berlin owns around 9 percent of hre and jc flowers and allies are believed to hold around 22 percent of the company .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 30.04.2009 brussels calls for curbs on executive super-bonuses großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some bank executives have received bonuses despite huge profit loses the european commission has responded to public anger over perceived managerial greed in the midst of recession by recommending curbs on bankers ’ pay and bonuses . the european union executive also issued tighter rules , on wednesday , for managing high-risk alternative investment funds , such as hedge funds .
the moves were prompted by the global financial crisis , which has in part been blamed on short-term profit-taking and lax financial regulation .
the proposals are part of a push by the eu to increase financial regulation in a bid to bring confidence back to financial markets .
" up to now , there have been far too many perverse incentives in place in the financial services industry .
it is neither sensible nor sane that pay incentives encourage excessive risk-taking for short-term gain , " said eu internal market commissioner charlie mccreevy while unveiling his proposals .
according to the commissioner , managers ' salaries should reflect " sound and effective risk management " rather than short-term gains , while the payment of bonuses should be linked to the long-term performance of the company .
moreover , a company 's remuneration policy should be " adequately disclosed to stakeholders " and properly supervised .
finally , banks should be allowed to claw back bonuses paid on the basis of data " which proved to be manifestly misstated , " officials in brussels said in a statement .
undeserved bonuses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccreevy wants to clamp down on golden parachutes " our message is very clear : directors ' remuneration must be clearly linked to performance and not rewards for failure , " mccreevy said .
data published by the commission in march showed that many of europe 's chief executive officers enjoyed ballooning salaries between 2003 and 2007 , with average bonuses surging from an equivalent of 70 percent of their base salaries to 151 percent .
in issuing his recommendations , mccreevy also urged financial firms to limit the benefits they pay to fired executives - the so-called " golden parachutes " - to no more than double their basic salary .
severance pay should be banned in case of failure .
the guidelines are non-binding , but mccreevy said at least some of them could be incorporated in the commission 's revised capital requirements directive , due to be unveiled in june .
wednesday 's proposed directive on bringing hedge funds under greater supervisory scrutiny would be binding if it were approved by both the european parliament and the finance ministers of the eu 's 27 member states .
pros and cons commission officials said alternative investment fund managers -lrb- aifm -rrb- , which include the managers of hedge funds and private equity funds , controlled around 2 trillion euros -lrb- $ 2.65 trillion -rrb- in assets in the eu at the end of 2008 .
the bulk of aifms are based in london , and wednesday 's proposal is seen as a compromise between the hard-line stance of countries such as germany and france , and that of countries such as britain , which argue that stricter regulation could drive financial firms away from europe .
the proposal disappointed advocates of tighter regulation , such as poul nyrup rasmussen , head of the party of european socialists , who described the directive as having " more holes than a swiss cheese . "
mccreevy acknowledged divisions , saying " for some , these proposals go too far , for others they do not go far enough . "
wednesday 's proposals take into account recent discussions held in london by the leaders of the world 's 20 most powerful nations .

the moves were prompted by the global financial crisis , which has in part been blamed on short-term profit-taking and lax financial regulation .
the proposals are part of a push by the eu to increase financial regulation in a bid to bring confidence back to financial markets .
" up to now , there have been far too many perverse incentives in place in the financial services industry .
it is neither sensible nor sane that pay incentives encourage excessive risk-taking for short-term gain , " said eu internal market commissioner charlie mccreevy while unveiling his proposals .
according to the commissioner , managers ' salaries should reflect " sound and effective risk management " rather than short-term gains , while the payment of bonuses should be linked to the long-term performance of the company .
moreover , a company 's remuneration policy should be " adequately disclosed to stakeholders " and properly supervised .
finally , banks should be allowed to claw back bonuses paid on the basis of data " which proved to be manifestly misstated , " officials in brussels said in a statement .
undeserved bonuses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccreevy wants to clamp down on golden parachutes " our message is very clear : directors ' remuneration must be clearly linked to performance and not rewards for failure , " mccreevy said .
data published by the commission in march showed that many of europe 's chief executive officers enjoyed ballooning salaries between 2003 and 2007 , with average bonuses surging from an equivalent of 70 percent of their base salaries to 151 percent .
in issuing his recommendations , mccreevy also urged financial firms to limit the benefits they pay to fired executives - the so-called " golden parachutes " - to no more than double their basic salary .
severance pay should be banned in case of failure .
the guidelines are non-binding , but mccreevy said at least some of them could be incorporated in the commission 's revised capital requirements directive , due to be unveiled in june .
wednesday 's proposed directive on bringing hedge funds under greater supervisory scrutiny would be binding if it were approved by both the european parliament and the finance ministers of the eu 's 27 member states .
pros and cons commission officials said alternative investment fund managers -lrb- aifm -rrb- , which include the managers of hedge funds and private equity funds , controlled around 2 trillion euros -lrb- $ 2.65 trillion -rrb- in assets in the eu at the end of 2008 .
the bulk of aifms are based in london , and wednesday 's proposal is seen as a compromise between the hard-line stance of countries such as germany and france , and that of countries such as britain , which argue that stricter regulation could drive financial firms away from europe .
the proposal disappointed advocates of tighter regulation , such as poul nyrup rasmussen , head of the party of european socialists , who described the directive as having " more holes than a swiss cheese . "

the moves were prompted by the global financial crisis , which has in part been blamed on short-term profit-taking and lax financial regulation .
the proposals are part of a push by the eu to increase financial regulation in a bid to bring confidence back to financial markets .
" up to now , there have been far too many perverse incentives in place in the financial services industry .
it is neither sensible nor sane that pay incentives encourage excessive risk-taking for short-term gain , " said eu internal market commissioner charlie mccreevy while unveiling his proposals .
according to the commissioner , managers ' salaries should reflect " sound and effective risk management " rather than short-term gains , while the payment of bonuses should be linked to the long-term performance of the company .
moreover , a company 's remuneration policy should be " adequately disclosed to stakeholders " and properly supervised .
finally , banks should be allowed to claw back bonuses paid on the basis of data " which proved to be manifestly misstated , " officials in brussels said in a statement .
undeserved bonuses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccreevy wants to clamp down on golden parachutes " our message is very clear : directors ' remuneration must be clearly linked to performance and not rewards for failure , " mccreevy said .
data published by the commission in march showed that many of europe 's chief executive officers enjoyed ballooning salaries between 2003 and 2007 , with average bonuses surging from an equivalent of 70 percent of their base salaries to 151 percent .
in issuing his recommendations , mccreevy also urged financial firms to limit the benefits they pay to fired executives - the so-called " golden parachutes " - to no more than double their basic salary .
severance pay should be banned in case of failure .
the guidelines are non-binding , but mccreevy said at least some of them could be incorporated in the commission 's revised capital requirements directive , due to be unveiled in june .
wednesday 's proposed directive on bringing hedge funds under greater supervisory scrutiny would be binding if it were approved by both the european parliament and the finance ministers of the eu 's 27 member states .
pros and cons commission officials said alternative investment fund managers -lrb- aifm -rrb- , which include the managers of hedge funds and private equity funds , controlled around 2 trillion euros -lrb- $ 2.65 trillion -rrb- in assets in the eu at the end of 2008 .
the bulk of aifms are based in london , and wednesday 's proposal is seen as a compromise between the hard-line stance of countries such as germany and france , and that of countries such as britain , which argue that stricter regulation could drive financial firms away from europe .
the proposal disappointed advocates of tighter regulation , such as poul nyrup rasmussen , head of the party of european socialists , who described the directive as having " more holes than a swiss cheese . "
mccreevy acknowledged divisions , saying " for some , these proposals go too far , for others they do not go far enough . "
wednesday 's proposals take into account recent discussions held in london by the leaders of the world 's 20 most powerful nations .
european commission president jose manuel barroso said the eu was leading the way in the global drive to prevent further financial crises from occurring .
" -lrb- the proposals -rrb- will tackle systemic risks created by a lack of transparency and excessive risk-taking .

the match in bremen is the second of four duels between the two northern rivals - only some 100 kilometers apart - within 19 days .
last week they clashed in the semi-finals of the germany 's dfb cup when bremen got the upper hand in a penalty shoot-out .
but hamburg wo n't mind if they repeat last wednesday 's 1-1 score after regular time as a tie would be a good result to take back home for next week 's second leg .
tale of two clubs hamburg are still in the bundesliga title race despite a 2-0 defeat to borussia dortmund on saturday as they begin to emerge from the shadow of their neighbors , who have had a poor league season .
hamburg sit fourth in the bundesliga , while bremen languish in 10th .
the northern german club 's last major title came in 1987 when it won the dfb cup .
that success came four seasons after hamburg were crowned european champions .
bremen 's track record , meanwhile , has been an image of comparative success .
in the same timeframe the club has won three german league titles , four cup titles , the european cup winners ' cup and been a regular champions league qualifier .
despite the differences in long-term success , hamburg will make the short trip to bremen in good heart knowing they have done well on their travels in europe this season .
until losing at manchester city in the previous round , they had won five of their six games .

forward jonathan pitroipa has , however , recovered from a hip problem and brazilian axel silva is also available for a possible defensive midfield role again after he was allowed to miss the match against dortmund for personal reasons .
bremen should also be close to full strength , with captain frank baumann on the way back following a muscle complaint .
much could depend on the form of bremen 's brazilian midfielder diego , whom bremen confirmed wednesday was being pursued by juventus .
" if we again play our game then we will win , " diego said .

the northern german club 's last major title came in 1987 when it won the dfb cup .
that success came four seasons after hamburg were crowned european champions .
bremen 's track record , meanwhile , has been an image of comparative success .
in the same timeframe the club has won three german league titles , four cup titles , the european cup winners ' cup and been a regular champions league qualifier .
despite the differences in long-term success , hamburg will make the short trip to bremen in good heart knowing they have done well on their travels in europe this season .
until losing at manchester city in the previous round , they had won five of their six games .
" everyone knows that little things will be decisive against bremen , " their dutch coach martin jol said .
" we know them and they know us , so there 's nothing new there . "
ins and outs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : petric 's attacking prowess will be sorely missed on thursday jol will be without top scorer mladen petric , who required stitches to a gashed shin but hopes to be fit for the second leg , and defender marcell jansen , who has failed to recover from bruised ribs , the club said on wednesday .
forward jonathan pitroipa has , however , recovered from a hip problem and brazilian axel silva is also available for a possible defensive midfield role again after he was allowed to miss the match against dortmund for personal reasons .
bremen should also be close to full strength , with captain frank baumann on the way back following a muscle complaint .
much could depend on the form of bremen 's brazilian midfielder diego , whom bremen confirmed wednesday was being pursued by juventus .
" if we again play our game then we will win , " diego said .
first meeting the two ukrainian powerhouses have been carving up the league title between them in recent years but have never met in european competition .
no ukrainian team has ever reached the final of the uefa cup , and for donetsk , who eliminated olympique marseille in the quarters , the semi-finals of a european competition is unchartered territory .
dynamo kiev , who beat paris st germain in the previous round , do have european pedigree , having twice won the cup winners ' cups and having made the semi-finals of the european cup or champions league three times .
the ukrainian league leaders already eliminated one ukrainian side in metalist kharkiv , who they beat on away goals in the last 16 after a 1-0 home win was followed up by a 3-2 defeat away .
shakhtar 's romanian coach mircea lucescu already has one eye on the second leg with concerns over his side 's olympiysky stadium pitch .
" the pitch at olimpiysky is destroying our play , " he was reported as saying .

german chancellor angela merkel gave obama good marks for his time in office . " in many areas a new course was set very assertively , " merkel said in berlin .
" i 'm full of hope .
it was a very intensive 100 days . " merkel said the obama administration had reacted firmly to the economic crisis " and in my consideration done everything that one can to apply countermeasures . " this was important for the global economy , said the chancellor . merkel welcomed the " new course " set by the us with respect to climate protection and cooperation in afghanistan . obama had created the conditions " for very , very close relations " between the us and germany as well as with the european union , she said . obama satisfied bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says obama is taking the us in the right direction obama said he was happy with his efforts at attempting to stabilize the us economy but warned of more job losses before the country 's 16-month long recession comes to an end . " i am pleased with our progress but i am not satisfied , " he said in a press conference at the white house .
" millions of americans are still without jobs and homes , and more will be lost before this recession is over . " obama 's remarks came after government figures showed the us economy shrank 6.1 percent in the first quarter of this year , though the federal reserve touted signs that the outlook had " improved modestly " over the past few weeks . obama asked for " patience " from the public and also reiterated his long-running theme that the country had to build a " new foundation for growth " in the coming years that was less reliant on debt and lax regulations of financial institutions . " even as we clear away the wreckage of this recession ... we ca n't go back to an economy that is built on a pile of sand , " obama said . the global economy has largely been brought down by excessive risks taken in financial sectors , especially in the us housing market that began folding in mid-2006 . obama said he expected far-reaching reforms on how wall street is regulated to be adopted by the end of the year . pakistan instability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pakistani military has been unable to drive out the taliban obama spoke at length on most major foreign and domestic issues affecting the us , including the situation in pakistan , whose government is struggling to contain the growing taliban insurgency . obama said the pakistani government lacked the ability to provide basic services for its people and promised the us would do all it could to build up its institutions . " i am gravely concerned about the situation in pakistan , " obama said .
" the civilian government there right now is very fragile . " despite the fears , obama said he was confident the us could help ensure that pakistan 's nuclear weapons capability did not fall into the hands of extremists . " i 'm confident that we can make sure that pakistan 's nuclear arsenal is secure , " obama said . dfm , rm dpa / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , in a statement read out by his lawyers , he has now admitted to the offense .
the man is accused of breaking laws preventing illicit arms exports by declaring the graphite exported from 2005 to 2007 to be low-grade .
this would have avoided the need to apply for a government clearance which would almost certainly have been refused .
german intelligence suspects the graphite was bought for iran 's missile program .
tehran is suspected of secretly developing nuclear weapons which could be delivered as the payload of the missiles .
the accused is the former chief executive of carbon-industrie-produkte gmbh , a firm that specialized in trading graphite .
in 2007 , germany imposed a ban on exports of any graphite , even the low-grade type , to iran .
plan involved transit through turkey technical books say rocket nozzles are often made of graphite , which is a form of carbon .
according to the website of the german newspaper rhein zeitung , the businessman met an iranian man in 2003 who suggested the idea of smuggling .
in 2005 , the defendant began shipping graphite , which he declared as low-grade , into turkey via truck .
from there , a contact person would bring the graphite into iran .
he sold the graphite for four times the purchase price .
the money was wired to an account in the seychelles islands .
the man , whose name has been withheld under german media privacy guidelines , has been in custody since last june .
company workers knew nothing of the scheme , he asserts . jen , rm / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the us is expected to make requests to european allies to accommodate detainees from the controversial detention facility at guantanamo bay within weeks , amid reports that germany could be willing to help . germany 's interior minister wolfgang schaeuble has said that germany would consider accepting former inmates from the controversial us military detention facility at guantanamo bay , according to a report in the wall street journal .
schaeuble had previously expressed reservations about the possiblity of germany taking guantanamo detainees , but in january german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in an open letter to us president barack obama that germany would be willing to do so if it would help obama close the naval base in cuba .
key meeting with us envoy schaeuble 's apparent change of heart follows a meeting in berlin on wednesday with us attorney general eric holder , who earlier in the week visited london and prague to discuss the closure of the disputed detention center .
one of obama 's first acts after taking office in january was to order the closure of the anti-terror lockup by the end of the year .
the prison , where prisoners have been held without charges or trial , had been widely criticized by the international community for its use of so-called " enhanced interrogation techniques " which included simulated drowning known as waterboarding .
the previous us administration under george w. bush claimed that the techniques used at guantanamo did not amount to torture .
willing allies ?
out of the 241 detainees at guantanamo , 30 people have so far been cleared for release .
holder said in berlin that the us would be likely to submit formal requests to allies to take in former detainees in the coming weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us is unsure where to put its prisoners once released holder added that he had been " pleasantly surprised " by the willingness of allies to help resettle guantanamo inmates .
since taking office in january , the uk has been sent one prisoner from guantanamo and france has pledged to take another .
following a meeting with schaeuble , holder told reporters : " although no specific requests were made and no specific promises were given , what i have worked to do during the course of the trip is to lay a foundation for more specific requests that i think will come in the future . "
" i know that europe did not open guantanamo and that in fact a great many on this continent opposed it , " holder said . " to close guantanamo we must all make sacrifices and we must all be willing to make unpopular choices . "
a spokesman for the interior ministry told deutsche welle that first of all , germany expected detainees to be released to their home countries , and that germany was not aware of any german nationals being held at guantanamo .
comments from interior ministry in cases where former detainees could not be returned to their home countries , germany considered the us to be primarily responsible for the accommodation of former detainees .
" if this is not possible then the us would need to explain why this is the case , " the spokesman said .
" if germany is asked to take a specific person the first thing which would have to be checked is whether there is a relationship between this person and germany . "
spain to investigate in a separate development , spanish judge balthasar garzon on wednesday formally launched a criminal investigation into whether us officials condoned the use of torture at guantanamo .
the probe has been given greater impetus following the release last week by the obama administration of classified documents which list the interrogation methods used at guantanamo .
the allegations of torture include the use of sexual abuse , beatings and the throwing of fluids into prisoners ' eyes . ml / en / rm afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the us is expected to make requests to european allies to accommodate detainees from the controversial detention facility at guantanamo bay within weeks , amid reports that germany could be willing to help . germany 's interior minister wolfgang schaeuble has said that germany would consider accepting former inmates from the controversial us military detention facility at guantanamo bay , according to a report in the wall street journal .
schaeuble had previously expressed reservations about the possiblity of germany taking guantanamo detainees , but in january german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in an open letter to us president barack obama that germany would be willing to do so if it would help obama close the naval base in cuba .
key meeting with us envoy schaeuble 's apparent change of heart follows a meeting in berlin on wednesday with us attorney general eric holder , who earlier in the week visited london and prague to discuss the closure of the disputed detention center .
one of obama 's first acts after taking office in january was to order the closure of the anti-terror lockup by the end of the year .
the prison , where prisoners have been held without charges or trial , had been widely criticized by the international community for its use of so-called " enhanced interrogation techniques " which included simulated drowning known as waterboarding .
the previous us administration under george w. bush claimed that the techniques used at guantanamo did not amount to torture .
willing allies ?
out of the 241 detainees at guantanamo , 30 people have so far been cleared for release .
holder said in berlin that the us would be likely to submit formal requests to allies to take in former detainees in the coming weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us is unsure where to put its prisoners once released holder added that he had been " pleasantly surprised " by the willingness of allies to help resettle guantanamo inmates .
since taking office in january , the uk has been sent one prisoner from guantanamo and france has pledged to take another .
following a meeting with schaeuble , holder told reporters : " although no specific requests were made and no specific promises were given , what i have worked to do during the course of the trip is to lay a foundation for more specific requests that i think will come in the future . "
" i know that europe did not open guantanamo and that in fact a great many on this continent opposed it , " holder said . " to close guantanamo we must all make sacrifices and we must all be willing to make unpopular choices . "
a spokesman for the interior ministry told deutsche welle that first of all , germany expected detainees to be released to their home countries , and that germany was not aware of any german nationals being held at guantanamo .
comments from interior ministry in cases where former detainees could not be returned to their home countries , germany considered the us to be primarily responsible for the accommodation of former detainees .
" if this is not possible then the us would need to explain why this is the case , " the spokesman said .
" if germany is asked to take a specific person the first thing which would have to be checked is whether there is a relationship between this person and germany . "
spain to investigate in a separate development , spanish judge balthasar garzon on wednesday formally launched a criminal investigation into whether us officials condoned the use of torture at guantanamo .
the probe has been given greater impetus following the release last week by the obama administration of classified documents which list the interrogation methods used at guantanamo .

" nato has ordered the expulsion of two diplomats from the russian mission in brussels , in connection with a spying scandal in which a former estonian official passed alliance secrets to moscow , a diplomat in the alliance told afp news service .

the statement was attributed to jana rihova , spokeswoman for the czech labor and social affairs ministry . the european commission confirmed that belgium and denmark would scrap remaining curbs from may 1 for job seekers from the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , poland , slovakia and slovenia , all of which joined the eu in 2004 .
all other eu countries - except germany and austria - have already lifted the labor restrictions imposed on the 2004 newcomers . meanwhile , citizens of bulgaria and romania , which joined the eu in 2007 , continue to face restrictions in the older member states except finland and sweden .
the measures were originally meant to ease the concerns of unions in older member states , which feared that cheap workers would flood their labor markets . all temporary labor restrictions are due to be phased out by the end of 2013 . ad / sh , ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the foundation is attempting to raise 120 million euros -lrb- $ 160 million -rrb- to ensure long term maintenance funding for buildings and ruins at the former nazi death camp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister donald tusk has called upon other nations to support the auschwitz foundation .
although the foundation has only been officially in existence for a week , the international response to the request for funds has been positive . jacek kastenlaniec , the managing director of the auschwitz-birkenau foundation , told deutsche welle that germany has already pledged a million euros for the foundation , and plans to contribute much more next year .
" we have an official declaration of france that they will contribute to this endowment fund , " kastenlaniec added , " and two days ago -lrb- british prime minster -rrb- gordon brown said great britain would participate in this program . "
call for eu support the fundraising efforts of the foundation have also been put on the agenda of a european union summit set to take place in june .
despite the world-wide economic crisis , kastenlaniec says other countries have recognized the importance of the foundation 's goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for many it was a one-way journey but those who did return hope their suffering will never be forgotten " for sure , the economic crisis makes our task more difficult , " he says .
but the project was prepared before the start of the economic crisis , and we can not wait until -lrb- it -rrb- ends because the objects and the buildings will not wait .
it makes this operation more difficult , but observing the reactions , the authorities of different countries understand that this is a special situation . "
kastenlaniec is confident the foundation will reach its fundraising goal because of the role auschwitz plays in teaching future generations about the lessons of the past .
" i think this goal will be reached .
it ’ s not only the countries which were in the past responsible for what was happening there or the countries where there were deportations , but this is a project for future generations . ”
" this place helps young generations understand why we make so many efforts to live on a peaceful continent without conflicts and work out the consequences of hatred and anti semitism , " kastelaniec said .
long-term maintenance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year over a million visitors came to auschwitz and its musuem the site of the auschwitz-birkenau camp and the state-run museum covers nearly two square kilometres and includes many buildings and ruins from when the camp was operational .
if the foundation reaches its goal of 120 million euros , maintenance for the site will be secured for the future . " it 's about maintaining what 's already there , " said kastelaniec .
" around 155 buildings , 300 ruins and 100,000 items , like suitcases , shoes and other proof of the crimes committed . "
the polish government will continue to fund the museum at auschwitz-birkenau , but money to maintain the historical integrity of the site has come from different sources in the past . " right now , if we have problems with the conservation , " kastelaniec says " we have to look for funds in the budget of the museum or we have to go look for funds from the polish ministry of culture or european union programs . "
that system works , he says , and prevents major problems at the site , but the foundation is attempting to take a more long term approach to preserving auschwitz . " the foundation will -lrb- ensure -rrb- that the team of very professional conservators will have no problem working on the preservation of the buildings or ruins , including the ruins of the crematories , " kastelaniec said .
" it would guarantee the security of the future of -lrb- the camp -rrb- . "
notorious nazi death camp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wladyslaw bartoszewski , auschwitz survivor and founder of the auschwitz-birkenau foundation auschwitz-birkenau was one of the nazis ' most notorious concentration camps .
it operated from 1940 until 1945 , when it was liberated by the soviet union 's red army .
after world war ii , it was estimated that more than a million people died at auschwitz . most of the victims were european jews , but also included non-jewish poles , soviet prisoners of war , gypsies and anti-nazi resistance fighters .
some prisoners died in the camp 's gas chambers , others were worked or starved to death .
it was one of six german concentration camps in poland . the museum and preservation efforts of auschwitz have always been conducted in close contact with survivors of the camp .
they include wladyslaw bartoszewski , who was imprisoned at auschwitz in 1940 .
he ’ s now the founder of the auschwitz-birkenau foundation and a former foreign minister of poland . in a statement on the auschwitz-birkenau memorial and museum website , bartoszewski spoke about the importance of preservation . " we will save from forgetting what they wanted to destroy , " he said , referring to nazis who tried to cover up what had gone on at the concentration camps . he also referred to the lasting legacy of holocaust survivors as part of the reason for creating the foundation . " we , the survivors , are in our last active years .
that is why acknowledged european authorities , whose personal experiences are connected with that time , appealed to create a constant preservation tool for this place as well as for continuing educational and museum activities , " bartoszewski said . mz / sh , afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the foundation is attempting to raise 120 million euros -lrb- $ 160 million -rrb- to ensure long term maintenance funding for buildings and ruins at the former nazi death camp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister donald tusk has called upon other nations to support the auschwitz foundation .
although the foundation has only been officially in existence for a week , the international response to the request for funds has been positive . jacek kastenlaniec , the managing director of the auschwitz-birkenau foundation , told deutsche welle that germany has already pledged a million euros for the foundation , and plans to contribute much more next year .
" we have an official declaration of france that they will contribute to this endowment fund , " kastenlaniec added , " and two days ago -lrb- british prime minster -rrb- gordon brown said great britain would participate in this program . "
call for eu support the fundraising efforts of the foundation have also been put on the agenda of a european union summit set to take place in june .
despite the world-wide economic crisis , kastenlaniec says other countries have recognized the importance of the foundation 's goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for many it was a one-way journey but those who did return hope their suffering will never be forgotten " for sure , the economic crisis makes our task more difficult , " he says .
but the project was prepared before the start of the economic crisis , and we can not wait until -lrb- it -rrb- ends because the objects and the buildings will not wait .
it makes this operation more difficult , but observing the reactions , the authorities of different countries understand that this is a special situation . "
kastenlaniec is confident the foundation will reach its fundraising goal because of the role auschwitz plays in teaching future generations about the lessons of the past .
" i think this goal will be reached .
it ’ s not only the countries which were in the past responsible for what was happening there or the countries where there were deportations , but this is a project for future generations . ”
" this place helps young generations understand why we make so many efforts to live on a peaceful continent without conflicts and work out the consequences of hatred and anti semitism , " kastelaniec said .
long-term maintenance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year over a million visitors came to auschwitz and its musuem the site of the auschwitz-birkenau camp and the state-run museum covers nearly two square kilometres and includes many buildings and ruins from when the camp was operational .
if the foundation reaches its goal of 120 million euros , maintenance for the site will be secured for the future . " it 's about maintaining what 's already there , " said kastelaniec .
" around 155 buildings , 300 ruins and 100,000 items , like suitcases , shoes and other proof of the crimes committed . "
the polish government will continue to fund the museum at auschwitz-birkenau , but money to maintain the historical integrity of the site has come from different sources in the past . " right now , if we have problems with the conservation , " kastelaniec says " we have to look for funds in the budget of the museum or we have to go look for funds from the polish ministry of culture or european union programs . "
that system works , he says , and prevents major problems at the site , but the foundation is attempting to take a more long term approach to preserving auschwitz . " the foundation will -lrb- ensure -rrb- that the team of very professional conservators will have no problem working on the preservation of the buildings or ruins , including the ruins of the crematories , " kastelaniec said .
" it would guarantee the security of the future of -lrb- the camp -rrb- . "

dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
three confirmed cases of swine flu surface in eu given mexico 's status as a developing country , we are experiencing the effects of swine flu at a much greater magnitude .
many of mexico 's inhabitants may be malnourished , leading them to be more susceptible to the virus and can even be fatal .
this should be taken into account when comparing the effects of the virus among different countries . - lara arevalo , mexico i definitely think citizens from all over the world should step in to help support mexico in this situation .
we need more medications , equipment and even doctors . - jacobo alvarez , mexico i am very concerned about this new influenza , mainly because there is not much information about it .
i am 35-weeks pregnant and i can not find a site that tells me if i get this infection will my infant be harmed .
i also have a four-year-old son .
should i keep him out of daycare or school ?
i think that i am just as confused as the rest of the world . - rebecca black , us international community mulls response to piracy it is important that the international community understand the reasons why piracy and fundamentalism are spreading inside somalia and influencing the horn of africa region .
over the past three years , more than five local fishing cooperatives with more than four thousands beneficiaries suspended their fishing activities .
foreign vessels with high-tech trawlers have completely depleted the fish stocks in the areas of eyl , gara 'ad , hobyo harardher as well as the southern seashore .
until recently piracy was limited to the central regions of the country , but now more and more somalia districts are adopting the practice as a means to support themselves . - mohamed ali bile , somalia these outrageous armed attacks by the aggressive somali pirates must be stopped , no matter the age of the aggressors .
if they are armed and fire upon innocents , they must be curtailed by responsive firepower .
i realize somalia is a country without a lawful government ; it is controlled by warlords .
vessels plying the sealanes have the right to respond with adequate firepower to repel and / or eliminate the aggressors . - richard larssen , mexico everyone is focused on piracy but not asking why the piracy began in the first place : to ward off illegall fishing vessels and ships dumping toxic waste .
the accused are not always guilty . - marta kaye , us it is unbelievable that when pirates are captured , they receive a slap on their wrists and are sent on their way .
unless the european nations take decisive actions , this will be a continuing and escalating problem and the true losers will be the consumers of the goods being transported .

the us is expected to make requests to european allies to accommodate detainees from the controversial detention facility at guantanamo bay within weeks , amid reports that germany could be willing to help . germany 's interior minister wolfgang schaeuble has said that germany would consider accepting former inmates from the controversial us military detention facility at guantanamo bay , according to a report in the wall street journal .
schaeuble had previously expressed reservations about the possiblity of germany taking guantanamo detainees , but in january german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in an open letter to us president barack obama that germany would be willing to do so if it would help obama close the naval base in cuba .
key meeting with us envoy schaeuble 's apparent change of heart follows a meeting in berlin on wednesday with us attorney general eric holder , who earlier in the week visited london and prague to discuss the closure of the disputed detention center .
one of obama 's first acts after taking office in january was to order the closure of the anti-terror lockup by the end of the year .
the prison , where prisoners have been held without charges or trial , had been widely criticized by the international community for its use of so-called " enhanced interrogation techniques " which included simulated drowning known as waterboarding .
the previous us administration under george w. bush claimed that the techniques used at guantanamo did not amount to torture .
willing allies ?
out of the 241 detainees at guantanamo , 30 people have so far been cleared for release .
holder said in berlin that the us would be likely to submit formal requests to allies to take in former detainees in the coming weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us is unsure where to put its prisoners once released holder added that he had been " pleasantly surprised " by the willingness of allies to help resettle guantanamo inmates .
since taking office in january , the uk has been sent one prisoner from guantanamo and france has pledged to take another .
following a meeting with schaeuble , holder told reporters : " although no specific requests were made and no specific promises were given , what i have worked to do during the course of the trip is to lay a foundation for more specific requests that i think will come in the future . "
" i know that europe did not open guantanamo and that in fact a great many on this continent opposed it , " holder said . " to close guantanamo we must all make sacrifices and we must all be willing to make unpopular choices . "
a spokesman for the interior ministry told deutsche welle that first of all , germany expected detainees to be released to their home countries , and that germany was not aware of any german nationals being held at guantanamo .
comments from interior ministry in cases where former detainees could not be returned to their home countries , germany considered the us to be primarily responsible for the accommodation of former detainees .
" if this is not possible then the us would need to explain why this is the case , " the spokesman said .
" if germany is asked to take a specific person the first thing which would have to be checked is whether there is a relationship between this person and germany . "
spain to investigate in a separate development , spanish judge balthasar garzon on wednesday formally launched a criminal investigation into whether us officials condoned the use of torture at guantanamo .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 30.04.2009 brussels calls for curbs on executive super-bonuses großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some bank executives have received bonuses despite huge profit loses the european commission has responded to public anger over perceived managerial greed in the midst of recession by recommending curbs on bankers ’ pay and bonuses . the european union executive also issued tighter rules , on wednesday , for managing high-risk alternative investment funds , such as hedge funds .
the moves were prompted by the global financial crisis , which has in part been blamed on short-term profit-taking and lax financial regulation .
the proposals are part of a push by the eu to increase financial regulation in a bid to bring confidence back to financial markets .
" up to now , there have been far too many perverse incentives in place in the financial services industry .
it is neither sensible nor sane that pay incentives encourage excessive risk-taking for short-term gain , " said eu internal market commissioner charlie mccreevy while unveiling his proposals .
according to the commissioner , managers ' salaries should reflect " sound and effective risk management " rather than short-term gains , while the payment of bonuses should be linked to the long-term performance of the company .
moreover , a company 's remuneration policy should be " adequately disclosed to stakeholders " and properly supervised .
finally , banks should be allowed to claw back bonuses paid on the basis of data " which proved to be manifestly misstated , " officials in brussels said in a statement .
undeserved bonuses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccreevy wants to clamp down on golden parachutes " our message is very clear : directors ' remuneration must be clearly linked to performance and not rewards for failure , " mccreevy said .
data published by the commission in march showed that many of europe 's chief executive officers enjoyed ballooning salaries between 2003 and 2007 , with average bonuses surging from an equivalent of 70 percent of their base salaries to 151 percent .
in issuing his recommendations , mccreevy also urged financial firms to limit the benefits they pay to fired executives - the so-called " golden parachutes " - to no more than double their basic salary .
severance pay should be banned in case of failure .
the guidelines are non-binding , but mccreevy said at least some of them could be incorporated in the commission 's revised capital requirements directive , due to be unveiled in june .
wednesday 's proposed directive on bringing hedge funds under greater supervisory scrutiny would be binding if it were approved by both the european parliament and the finance ministers of the eu 's 27 member states .
pros and cons commission officials said alternative investment fund managers -lrb- aifm -rrb- , which include the managers of hedge funds and private equity funds , controlled around 2 trillion euros -lrb- $ 2.65 trillion -rrb- in assets in the eu at the end of 2008 .
the bulk of aifms are based in london , and wednesday 's proposal is seen as a compromise between the hard-line stance of countries such as germany and france , and that of countries such as britain , which argue that stricter regulation could drive financial firms away from europe .
the proposal disappointed advocates of tighter regulation , such as poul nyrup rasmussen , head of the party of european socialists , who described the directive as having " more holes than a swiss cheese . "
mccreevy acknowledged divisions , saying " for some , these proposals go too far , for others they do not go far enough . "
wednesday 's proposals take into account recent discussions held in london by the leaders of the world 's 20 most powerful nations .
european commission president jose manuel barroso said the eu was leading the way in the global drive to prevent further financial crises from occurring .
" -lrb- the proposals -rrb- will tackle systemic risks created by a lack of transparency and excessive risk-taking .
now we hope that others can join us , " barroso said . dfm , nw dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the moves were prompted by the global financial crisis , which has in part been blamed on short-term profit-taking and lax financial regulation .
the proposals are part of a push by the eu to increase financial regulation in a bid to bring confidence back to financial markets .
" up to now , there have been far too many perverse incentives in place in the financial services industry .
it is neither sensible nor sane that pay incentives encourage excessive risk-taking for short-term gain , " said eu internal market commissioner charlie mccreevy while unveiling his proposals .
according to the commissioner , managers ' salaries should reflect " sound and effective risk management " rather than short-term gains , while the payment of bonuses should be linked to the long-term performance of the company .
moreover , a company 's remuneration policy should be " adequately disclosed to stakeholders " and properly supervised .
finally , banks should be allowed to claw back bonuses paid on the basis of data " which proved to be manifestly misstated , " officials in brussels said in a statement .
undeserved bonuses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccreevy wants to clamp down on golden parachutes " our message is very clear : directors ' remuneration must be clearly linked to performance and not rewards for failure , " mccreevy said .
data published by the commission in march showed that many of europe 's chief executive officers enjoyed ballooning salaries between 2003 and 2007 , with average bonuses surging from an equivalent of 70 percent of their base salaries to 151 percent .
in issuing his recommendations , mccreevy also urged financial firms to limit the benefits they pay to fired executives - the so-called " golden parachutes " - to no more than double their basic salary .
severance pay should be banned in case of failure .
the guidelines are non-binding , but mccreevy said at least some of them could be incorporated in the commission 's revised capital requirements directive , due to be unveiled in june .
wednesday 's proposed directive on bringing hedge funds under greater supervisory scrutiny would be binding if it were approved by both the european parliament and the finance ministers of the eu 's 27 member states .
pros and cons commission officials said alternative investment fund managers -lrb- aifm -rrb- , which include the managers of hedge funds and private equity funds , controlled around 2 trillion euros -lrb- $ 2.65 trillion -rrb- in assets in the eu at the end of 2008 .
the bulk of aifms are based in london , and wednesday 's proposal is seen as a compromise between the hard-line stance of countries such as germany and france , and that of countries such as britain , which argue that stricter regulation could drive financial firms away from europe .
the proposal disappointed advocates of tighter regulation , such as poul nyrup rasmussen , head of the party of european socialists , who described the directive as having " more holes than a swiss cheese . "
mccreevy acknowledged divisions , saying " for some , these proposals go too far , for others they do not go far enough . "
wednesday 's proposals take into account recent discussions held in london by the leaders of the world 's 20 most powerful nations .
european commission president jose manuel barroso said the eu was leading the way in the global drive to prevent further financial crises from occurring .
" -lrb- the proposals -rrb- will tackle systemic risks created by a lack of transparency and excessive risk-taking .

however , in a statement read out by his lawyers , he has now admitted to the offense .
the man is accused of breaking laws preventing illicit arms exports by declaring the graphite exported from 2005 to 2007 to be low-grade .
this would have avoided the need to apply for a government clearance which would almost certainly have been refused .
german intelligence suspects the graphite was bought for iran 's missile program .
tehran is suspected of secretly developing nuclear weapons which could be delivered as the payload of the missiles .
the accused is the former chief executive of carbon-industrie-produkte gmbh , a firm that specialized in trading graphite .
in 2007 , germany imposed a ban on exports of any graphite , even the low-grade type , to iran .
plan involved transit through turkey technical books say rocket nozzles are often made of graphite , which is a form of carbon .
according to the website of the german newspaper rhein zeitung , the businessman met an iranian man in 2003 who suggested the idea of smuggling .
in 2005 , the defendant began shipping graphite , which he declared as low-grade , into turkey via truck .
from there , a contact person would bring the graphite into iran .
he sold the graphite for four times the purchase price .
the money was wired to an account in the seychelles islands .

the guidelines are non-binding , but mccreevy said at least some of them could be incorporated in the commission 's revised capital requirements directive , due to be unveiled in june .
wednesday 's proposed directive on bringing hedge funds under greater supervisory scrutiny would be binding if it were approved by both the european parliament and the finance ministers of the eu 's 27 member states .
pros and cons commission officials said alternative investment fund managers -lrb- aifm -rrb- , which include the managers of hedge funds and private equity funds , controlled around 2 trillion euros -lrb- $ 2.65 trillion -rrb- in assets in the eu at the end of 2008 .
the bulk of aifms are based in london , and wednesday 's proposal is seen as a compromise between the hard-line stance of countries such as germany and france , and that of countries such as britain , which argue that stricter regulation could drive financial firms away from europe .
the proposal disappointed advocates of tighter regulation , such as poul nyrup rasmussen , head of the party of european socialists , who described the directive as having " more holes than a swiss cheese . "
mccreevy acknowledged divisions , saying " for some , these proposals go too far , for others they do not go far enough . "

the moves were prompted by the global financial crisis , which has in part been blamed on short-term profit-taking and lax financial regulation .
the proposals are part of a push by the eu to increase financial regulation in a bid to bring confidence back to financial markets .
" up to now , there have been far too many perverse incentives in place in the financial services industry .
it is neither sensible nor sane that pay incentives encourage excessive risk-taking for short-term gain , " said eu internal market commissioner charlie mccreevy while unveiling his proposals .
according to the commissioner , managers ' salaries should reflect " sound and effective risk management " rather than short-term gains , while the payment of bonuses should be linked to the long-term performance of the company .
moreover , a company 's remuneration policy should be " adequately disclosed to stakeholders " and properly supervised .
finally , banks should be allowed to claw back bonuses paid on the basis of data " which proved to be manifestly misstated , " officials in brussels said in a statement .
undeserved bonuses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccreevy wants to clamp down on golden parachutes " our message is very clear : directors ' remuneration must be clearly linked to performance and not rewards for failure , " mccreevy said .
data published by the commission in march showed that many of europe 's chief executive officers enjoyed ballooning salaries between 2003 and 2007 , with average bonuses surging from an equivalent of 70 percent of their base salaries to 151 percent .
in issuing his recommendations , mccreevy also urged financial firms to limit the benefits they pay to fired executives - the so-called " golden parachutes " - to no more than double their basic salary .
severance pay should be banned in case of failure .
the guidelines are non-binding , but mccreevy said at least some of them could be incorporated in the commission 's revised capital requirements directive , due to be unveiled in june .

however , in a statement read out by his lawyers , he has now admitted to the offense .
the man is accused of breaking laws preventing illicit arms exports by declaring the graphite exported from 2005 to 2007 to be low-grade .
this would have avoided the need to apply for a government clearance which would almost certainly have been refused .
german intelligence suspects the graphite was bought for iran 's missile program .
tehran is suspected of secretly developing nuclear weapons which could be delivered as the payload of the missiles .
the accused is the former chief executive of carbon-industrie-produkte gmbh , a firm that specialized in trading graphite .
in 2007 , germany imposed a ban on exports of any graphite , even the low-grade type , to iran .
plan involved transit through turkey technical books say rocket nozzles are often made of graphite , which is a form of carbon .
according to the website of the german newspaper rhein zeitung , the businessman met an iranian man in 2003 who suggested the idea of smuggling .
in 2005 , the defendant began shipping graphite , which he declared as low-grade , into turkey via truck .
from there , a contact person would bring the graphite into iran .
he sold the graphite for four times the purchase price .
the money was wired to an account in the seychelles islands .

the wto 's general council , comprising all 153 members , voted unanimously in support of the frenchman .
lamy ran for the post unopposed , partly , as aides have quoted him as saying , " because no one else wants this job . "
it was the first time in the wto 's 15-year history that the candidacy had not been contested .
with protectionism on the increase in the midst of a major global downturn and world trade talks stalled , the widely respected head of the world trade organisation will have his work cut out to achieve a breakthrough during his second term of office .
doha remains stumbling block since he took over the reins in september 2005 , lamy has been seeking a conclusion to the doha round of trade liberalization negotiations .
when first appointed , the former european union trade commissioner said nailing down a global trade deal , on which negotiations began seven years ago , would be the " number one , number two and number three " priorities of his four-year term .
but agreement has been elusive .
lamy 's latest attempt at breaking the deadlock through a ministerial meeting of key economies in july 2008 ended in bitter disagreement between india and the united states .
speaking to the council earlier this week , the director-general reiterated the importance of concluding the doha round .
" beyond the trade-offs required to conclude the doha round and also beyond the market access that it will bring , lies its hugely important systemic value " he said .
creeping protectionism in a report to wto members in march , mr lamy noted that protectionism was on the rise .
he said " the danger today is of an incremental build-up of restrictions that could slowly strangle international trade , " noting that this could hamper economic recovery .
eu trade commissioner catherine ashton , who has called lamy a " tireless advocate of the benefits of open and rules-based trade , " welcomed the reappointment . ad / sh , afp / reuters / dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" nato has ordered the expulsion of two diplomats from the russian mission in brussels , in connection with a spying scandal in which a former estonian official passed alliance secrets to moscow , a diplomat in the alliance told afp news service .
" i can confirm it , " one diplomat told afp when asked about reports that the two had been ordered to leave .
russia : move is a ' crude provocation ' in response , the russian foreign ministry in moscow said the move was a " crude provocation " made on " an absolutely trumped up pretext . "
" this outrageous action fundamentally contradicts statements by nato 's leadership on its readiness to normalize ties with russia , " the russian ministry said .
just one day earlier nato and russia resumed official relations after an eight-month freeze tied to the russian-georgia war last august .
diplomats from the two sides met in brussels on wednesday .
on thursday , however , came the expulsions .
one nato diplomat told afp that the two expelled russian officials included a russian political counsellor and a son of vladimir chizhov , russia 's ambassador to the european union .
" our understanding is that this has been part of an investigation that has been going on for some time , " concerning the estonian spy scandal , the diplomat said .

estonia , a soviet-ruled republic until 1991 , joined nato and the european union in 2004 . relations with its powerful neighbor are rocky .

the foundation is attempting to raise 120 million euros -lrb- $ 160 million -rrb- to ensure long term maintenance funding for buildings and ruins at the former nazi death camp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister donald tusk has called upon other nations to support the auschwitz foundation .
although the foundation has only been officially in existence for a week , the international response to the request for funds has been positive . jacek kastenlaniec , the managing director of the auschwitz-birkenau foundation , told deutsche welle that germany has already pledged a million euros for the foundation , and plans to contribute much more next year .
" we have an official declaration of france that they will contribute to this endowment fund , " kastenlaniec added , " and two days ago -lrb- british prime minster -rrb- gordon brown said great britain would participate in this program . "
call for eu support the fundraising efforts of the foundation have also been put on the agenda of a european union summit set to take place in june .
despite the world-wide economic crisis , kastenlaniec says other countries have recognized the importance of the foundation 's goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for many it was a one-way journey but those who did return hope their suffering will never be forgotten " for sure , the economic crisis makes our task more difficult , " he says .
but the project was prepared before the start of the economic crisis , and we can not wait until -lrb- it -rrb- ends because the objects and the buildings will not wait .
it makes this operation more difficult , but observing the reactions , the authorities of different countries understand that this is a special situation . "
kastenlaniec is confident the foundation will reach its fundraising goal because of the role auschwitz plays in teaching future generations about the lessons of the past .

the foundation is attempting to raise 120 million euros -lrb- $ 160 million -rrb- to ensure long term maintenance funding for buildings and ruins at the former nazi death camp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister donald tusk has called upon other nations to support the auschwitz foundation .
although the foundation has only been officially in existence for a week , the international response to the request for funds has been positive . jacek kastenlaniec , the managing director of the auschwitz-birkenau foundation , told deutsche welle that germany has already pledged a million euros for the foundation , and plans to contribute much more next year .
" we have an official declaration of france that they will contribute to this endowment fund , " kastenlaniec added , " and two days ago -lrb- british prime minster -rrb- gordon brown said great britain would participate in this program . "
call for eu support the fundraising efforts of the foundation have also been put on the agenda of a european union summit set to take place in june .

the us is expected to make requests to european allies to accommodate detainees from the controversial detention facility at guantanamo bay within weeks , amid reports that germany could be willing to help . germany 's interior minister wolfgang schaeuble has said that germany would consider accepting former inmates from the controversial us military detention facility at guantanamo bay , according to a report in the wall street journal .
schaeuble had previously expressed reservations about the possiblity of germany taking guantanamo detainees , but in january german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in an open letter to us president barack obama that germany would be willing to do so if it would help obama close the naval base in cuba .
key meeting with us envoy schaeuble 's apparent change of heart follows a meeting in berlin on wednesday with us attorney general eric holder , who earlier in the week visited london and prague to discuss the closure of the disputed detention center .
one of obama 's first acts after taking office in january was to order the closure of the anti-terror lockup by the end of the year .
the prison , where prisoners have been held without charges or trial , had been widely criticized by the international community for its use of so-called " enhanced interrogation techniques " which included simulated drowning known as waterboarding .
the previous us administration under george w. bush claimed that the techniques used at guantanamo did not amount to torture .
willing allies ?
out of the 241 detainees at guantanamo , 30 people have so far been cleared for release .
holder said in berlin that the us would be likely to submit formal requests to allies to take in former detainees in the coming weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us is unsure where to put its prisoners once released holder added that he had been " pleasantly surprised " by the willingness of allies to help resettle guantanamo inmates .
since taking office in january , the uk has been sent one prisoner from guantanamo and france has pledged to take another .
following a meeting with schaeuble , holder told reporters : " although no specific requests were made and no specific promises were given , what i have worked to do during the course of the trip is to lay a foundation for more specific requests that i think will come in the future . "
" i know that europe did not open guantanamo and that in fact a great many on this continent opposed it , " holder said . " to close guantanamo we must all make sacrifices and we must all be willing to make unpopular choices . "
a spokesman for the interior ministry told deutsche welle that first of all , germany expected detainees to be released to their home countries , and that germany was not aware of any german nationals being held at guantanamo .
comments from interior ministry in cases where former detainees could not be returned to their home countries , germany considered the us to be primarily responsible for the accommodation of former detainees .
" if this is not possible then the us would need to explain why this is the case , " the spokesman said .
" if germany is asked to take a specific person the first thing which would have to be checked is whether there is a relationship between this person and germany . "
spain to investigate in a separate development , spanish judge balthasar garzon on wednesday formally launched a criminal investigation into whether us officials condoned the use of torture at guantanamo .
the probe has been given greater impetus following the release last week by the obama administration of classified documents which list the interrogation methods used at guantanamo .
the allegations of torture include the use of sexual abuse , beatings and the throwing of fluids into prisoners ' eyes . ml / en / rm afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 30.04.2009 brussels calls for curbs on executive super-bonuses großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some bank executives have received bonuses despite huge profit loses the european commission has responded to public anger over perceived managerial greed in the midst of recession by recommending curbs on bankers ’ pay and bonuses . the european union executive also issued tighter rules , on wednesday , for managing high-risk alternative investment funds , such as hedge funds .
the moves were prompted by the global financial crisis , which has in part been blamed on short-term profit-taking and lax financial regulation .
the proposals are part of a push by the eu to increase financial regulation in a bid to bring confidence back to financial markets .
" up to now , there have been far too many perverse incentives in place in the financial services industry .
it is neither sensible nor sane that pay incentives encourage excessive risk-taking for short-term gain , " said eu internal market commissioner charlie mccreevy while unveiling his proposals .
according to the commissioner , managers ' salaries should reflect " sound and effective risk management " rather than short-term gains , while the payment of bonuses should be linked to the long-term performance of the company .
moreover , a company 's remuneration policy should be " adequately disclosed to stakeholders " and properly supervised .
finally , banks should be allowed to claw back bonuses paid on the basis of data " which proved to be manifestly misstated , " officials in brussels said in a statement .
undeserved bonuses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccreevy wants to clamp down on golden parachutes " our message is very clear : directors ' remuneration must be clearly linked to performance and not rewards for failure , " mccreevy said .
data published by the commission in march showed that many of europe 's chief executive officers enjoyed ballooning salaries between 2003 and 2007 , with average bonuses surging from an equivalent of 70 percent of their base salaries to 151 percent .
in issuing his recommendations , mccreevy also urged financial firms to limit the benefits they pay to fired executives - the so-called " golden parachutes " - to no more than double their basic salary .
severance pay should be banned in case of failure .
the guidelines are non-binding , but mccreevy said at least some of them could be incorporated in the commission 's revised capital requirements directive , due to be unveiled in june .
wednesday 's proposed directive on bringing hedge funds under greater supervisory scrutiny would be binding if it were approved by both the european parliament and the finance ministers of the eu 's 27 member states .
pros and cons commission officials said alternative investment fund managers -lrb- aifm -rrb- , which include the managers of hedge funds and private equity funds , controlled around 2 trillion euros -lrb- $ 2.65 trillion -rrb- in assets in the eu at the end of 2008 .
the bulk of aifms are based in london , and wednesday 's proposal is seen as a compromise between the hard-line stance of countries such as germany and france , and that of countries such as britain , which argue that stricter regulation could drive financial firms away from europe .
the proposal disappointed advocates of tighter regulation , such as poul nyrup rasmussen , head of the party of european socialists , who described the directive as having " more holes than a swiss cheese . "
mccreevy acknowledged divisions , saying " for some , these proposals go too far , for others they do not go far enough . "
wednesday 's proposals take into account recent discussions held in london by the leaders of the world 's 20 most powerful nations .
european commission president jose manuel barroso said the eu was leading the way in the global drive to prevent further financial crises from occurring .
" -lrb- the proposals -rrb- will tackle systemic risks created by a lack of transparency and excessive risk-taking .

it is neither sensible nor sane that pay incentives encourage excessive risk-taking for short-term gain , " said eu internal market commissioner charlie mccreevy while unveiling his proposals .
according to the commissioner , managers ' salaries should reflect " sound and effective risk management " rather than short-term gains , while the payment of bonuses should be linked to the long-term performance of the company .
moreover , a company 's remuneration policy should be " adequately disclosed to stakeholders " and properly supervised .
finally , banks should be allowed to claw back bonuses paid on the basis of data " which proved to be manifestly misstated , " officials in brussels said in a statement .
undeserved bonuses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccreevy wants to clamp down on golden parachutes " our message is very clear : directors ' remuneration must be clearly linked to performance and not rewards for failure , " mccreevy said .
data published by the commission in march showed that many of europe 's chief executive officers enjoyed ballooning salaries between 2003 and 2007 , with average bonuses surging from an equivalent of 70 percent of their base salaries to 151 percent .
in issuing his recommendations , mccreevy also urged financial firms to limit the benefits they pay to fired executives - the so-called " golden parachutes " - to no more than double their basic salary .
severance pay should be banned in case of failure .
the guidelines are non-binding , but mccreevy said at least some of them could be incorporated in the commission 's revised capital requirements directive , due to be unveiled in june .
wednesday 's proposed directive on bringing hedge funds under greater supervisory scrutiny would be binding if it were approved by both the european parliament and the finance ministers of the eu 's 27 member states .
pros and cons commission officials said alternative investment fund managers -lrb- aifm -rrb- , which include the managers of hedge funds and private equity funds , controlled around 2 trillion euros -lrb- $ 2.65 trillion -rrb- in assets in the eu at the end of 2008 .
the bulk of aifms are based in london , and wednesday 's proposal is seen as a compromise between the hard-line stance of countries such as germany and france , and that of countries such as britain , which argue that stricter regulation could drive financial firms away from europe .
the proposal disappointed advocates of tighter regulation , such as poul nyrup rasmussen , head of the party of european socialists , who described the directive as having " more holes than a swiss cheese . "
mccreevy acknowledged divisions , saying " for some , these proposals go too far , for others they do not go far enough . "
wednesday 's proposals take into account recent discussions held in london by the leaders of the world 's 20 most powerful nations .
european commission president jose manuel barroso said the eu was leading the way in the global drive to prevent further financial crises from occurring .
" -lrb- the proposals -rrb- will tackle systemic risks created by a lack of transparency and excessive risk-taking .
now we hope that others can join us , " barroso said . dfm , nw dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the moves were prompted by the global financial crisis , which has in part been blamed on short-term profit-taking and lax financial regulation .
the proposals are part of a push by the eu to increase financial regulation in a bid to bring confidence back to financial markets .

the match in bremen is the second of four duels between the two northern rivals - only some 100 kilometers apart - within 19 days .
last week they clashed in the semi-finals of the germany 's dfb cup when bremen got the upper hand in a penalty shoot-out .
but hamburg wo n't mind if they repeat last wednesday 's 1-1 score after regular time as a tie would be a good result to take back home for next week 's second leg .
tale of two clubs hamburg are still in the bundesliga title race despite a 2-0 defeat to borussia dortmund on saturday as they begin to emerge from the shadow of their neighbors , who have had a poor league season .
hamburg sit fourth in the bundesliga , while bremen languish in 10th .
the northern german club 's last major title came in 1987 when it won the dfb cup .
that success came four seasons after hamburg were crowned european champions .
bremen 's track record , meanwhile , has been an image of comparative success .
in the same timeframe the club has won three german league titles , four cup titles , the european cup winners ' cup and been a regular champions league qualifier .
despite the differences in long-term success , hamburg will make the short trip to bremen in good heart knowing they have done well on their travels in europe this season .

forward jonathan pitroipa has , however , recovered from a hip problem and brazilian axel silva is also available for a possible defensive midfield role again after he was allowed to miss the match against dortmund for personal reasons .
bremen should also be close to full strength , with captain frank baumann on the way back following a muscle complaint .
much could depend on the form of bremen 's brazilian midfielder diego , whom bremen confirmed wednesday was being pursued by juventus .
" if we again play our game then we will win , " diego said .

the match in bremen is the second of four duels between the two northern rivals - only some 100 kilometers apart - within 19 days .
last week they clashed in the semi-finals of the germany 's dfb cup when bremen got the upper hand in a penalty shoot-out .
but hamburg wo n't mind if they repeat last wednesday 's 1-1 score after regular time as a tie would be a good result to take back home for next week 's second leg .
tale of two clubs hamburg are still in the bundesliga title race despite a 2-0 defeat to borussia dortmund on saturday as they begin to emerge from the shadow of their neighbors , who have had a poor league season .
hamburg sit fourth in the bundesliga , while bremen languish in 10th .
the northern german club 's last major title came in 1987 when it won the dfb cup .
that success came four seasons after hamburg were crowned european champions .
bremen 's track record , meanwhile , has been an image of comparative success .
in the same timeframe the club has won three german league titles , four cup titles , the european cup winners ' cup and been a regular champions league qualifier .
despite the differences in long-term success , hamburg will make the short trip to bremen in good heart knowing they have done well on their travels in europe this season .
until losing at manchester city in the previous round , they had won five of their six games .
" everyone knows that little things will be decisive against bremen , " their dutch coach martin jol said .
" we know them and they know us , so there 's nothing new there . "

forward jonathan pitroipa has , however , recovered from a hip problem and brazilian axel silva is also available for a possible defensive midfield role again after he was allowed to miss the match against dortmund for personal reasons .
bremen should also be close to full strength , with captain frank baumann on the way back following a muscle complaint .
much could depend on the form of bremen 's brazilian midfielder diego , whom bremen confirmed wednesday was being pursued by juventus .
" if we again play our game then we will win , " diego said .
first meeting the two ukrainian powerhouses have been carving up the league title between them in recent years but have never met in european competition .
no ukrainian team has ever reached the final of the uefa cup , and for donetsk , who eliminated olympique marseille in the quarters , the semi-finals of a european competition is unchartered territory .
dynamo kiev , who beat paris st germain in the previous round , do have european pedigree , having twice won the cup winners ' cups and having made the semi-finals of the european cup or champions league three times .
the ukrainian league leaders already eliminated one ukrainian side in metalist kharkiv , who they beat on away goals in the last 16 after a 1-0 home win was followed up by a 3-2 defeat away .

however , in a statement read out by his lawyers , he has now admitted to the offense .
the man is accused of breaking laws preventing illicit arms exports by declaring the graphite exported from 2005 to 2007 to be low-grade .
this would have avoided the need to apply for a government clearance which would almost certainly have been refused .
german intelligence suspects the graphite was bought for iran 's missile program .
tehran is suspected of secretly developing nuclear weapons which could be delivered as the payload of the missiles .
the accused is the former chief executive of carbon-industrie-produkte gmbh , a firm that specialized in trading graphite .
in 2007 , germany imposed a ban on exports of any graphite , even the low-grade type , to iran .
plan involved transit through turkey technical books say rocket nozzles are often made of graphite , which is a form of carbon .
according to the website of the german newspaper rhein zeitung , the businessman met an iranian man in 2003 who suggested the idea of smuggling .
in 2005 , the defendant began shipping graphite , which he declared as low-grade , into turkey via truck .
from there , a contact person would bring the graphite into iran .
he sold the graphite for four times the purchase price .
the money was wired to an account in the seychelles islands .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 30.04.2009 germany says willing to consider taking guantanamo detainees großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will europe help the us solve their guantanamo problem ?
the us is expected to make requests to european allies to accommodate detainees from the controversial detention facility at guantanamo bay within weeks , amid reports that germany could be willing to help . germany 's interior minister wolfgang schaeuble has said that germany would consider accepting former inmates from the controversial us military detention facility at guantanamo bay , according to a report in the wall street journal .
schaeuble had previously expressed reservations about the possiblity of germany taking guantanamo detainees , but in january german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in an open letter to us president barack obama that germany would be willing to do so if it would help obama close the naval base in cuba .
key meeting with us envoy schaeuble 's apparent change of heart follows a meeting in berlin on wednesday with us attorney general eric holder , who earlier in the week visited london and prague to discuss the closure of the disputed detention center .
one of obama 's first acts after taking office in january was to order the closure of the anti-terror lockup by the end of the year .
the prison , where prisoners have been held without charges or trial , had been widely criticized by the international community for its use of so-called " enhanced interrogation techniques " which included simulated drowning known as waterboarding .
the previous us administration under george w. bush claimed that the techniques used at guantanamo did not amount to torture .
willing allies ?
out of the 241 detainees at guantanamo , 30 people have so far been cleared for release .
holder said in berlin that the us would be likely to submit formal requests to allies to take in former detainees in the coming weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us is unsure where to put its prisoners once released holder added that he had been " pleasantly surprised " by the willingness of allies to help resettle guantanamo inmates .
since taking office in january , the uk has been sent one prisoner from guantanamo and france has pledged to take another .
following a meeting with schaeuble , holder told reporters : " although no specific requests were made and no specific promises were given , what i have worked to do during the course of the trip is to lay a foundation for more specific requests that i think will come in the future . "
" i know that europe did not open guantanamo and that in fact a great many on this continent opposed it , " holder said . " to close guantanamo we must all make sacrifices and we must all be willing to make unpopular choices . "
a spokesman for the interior ministry told deutsche welle that first of all , germany expected detainees to be released to their home countries , and that germany was not aware of any german nationals being held at guantanamo .
comments from interior ministry in cases where former detainees could not be returned to their home countries , germany considered the us to be primarily responsible for the accommodation of former detainees .
" if this is not possible then the us would need to explain why this is the case , " the spokesman said .
" if germany is asked to take a specific person the first thing which would have to be checked is whether there is a relationship between this person and germany . "
spain to investigate in a separate development , spanish judge balthasar garzon on wednesday formally launched a criminal investigation into whether us officials condoned the use of torture at guantanamo .
the probe has been given greater impetus following the release last week by the obama administration of classified documents which list the interrogation methods used at guantanamo .
the allegations of torture include the use of sexual abuse , beatings and the throwing of fluids into prisoners ' eyes . ml / en / rm afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one of obama 's first acts after taking office in january was to order the closure of the anti-terror lockup by the end of the year .
the prison , where prisoners have been held without charges or trial , had been widely criticized by the international community for its use of so-called " enhanced interrogation techniques " which included simulated drowning known as waterboarding .
the previous us administration under george w. bush claimed that the techniques used at guantanamo did not amount to torture .
willing allies ?
out of the 241 detainees at guantanamo , 30 people have so far been cleared for release .
holder said in berlin that the us would be likely to submit formal requests to allies to take in former detainees in the coming weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us is unsure where to put its prisoners once released holder added that he had been " pleasantly surprised " by the willingness of allies to help resettle guantanamo inmates .
since taking office in january , the uk has been sent one prisoner from guantanamo and france has pledged to take another .
following a meeting with schaeuble , holder told reporters : " although no specific requests were made and no specific promises were given , what i have worked to do during the course of the trip is to lay a foundation for more specific requests that i think will come in the future . "
" i know that europe did not open guantanamo and that in fact a great many on this continent opposed it , " holder said . " to close guantanamo we must all make sacrifices and we must all be willing to make unpopular choices . "
a spokesman for the interior ministry told deutsche welle that first of all , germany expected detainees to be released to their home countries , and that germany was not aware of any german nationals being held at guantanamo .
comments from interior ministry in cases where former detainees could not be returned to their home countries , germany considered the us to be primarily responsible for the accommodation of former detainees .
" if this is not possible then the us would need to explain why this is the case , " the spokesman said .
" if germany is asked to take a specific person the first thing which would have to be checked is whether there is a relationship between this person and germany . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister donald tusk has called upon other nations to support the auschwitz foundation .
although the foundation has only been officially in existence for a week , the international response to the request for funds has been positive . jacek kastenlaniec , the managing director of the auschwitz-birkenau foundation , told deutsche welle that germany has already pledged a million euros for the foundation , and plans to contribute much more next year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trade -pipe- 30.04.2009 pascal lamy is re-elected wto head großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pascal lamy remains at the helm of the wto with world trade talks stalled and protectionism on the rise , the world trade organization 's 153 members have approved a second term for the current director-general pascal lamy . wto member states have endorsed the trade body 's current director-general pascal lamy to head the organisation for four more years .
the wto 's general council , comprising all 153 members , voted unanimously in support of the frenchman .
lamy ran for the post unopposed , partly , as aides have quoted him as saying , " because no one else wants this job . "
it was the first time in the wto 's 15-year history that the candidacy had not been contested .
with protectionism on the increase in the midst of a major global downturn and world trade talks stalled , the widely respected head of the world trade organisation will have his work cut out to achieve a breakthrough during his second term of office .
doha remains stumbling block since he took over the reins in september 2005 , lamy has been seeking a conclusion to the doha round of trade liberalization negotiations .
when first appointed , the former european union trade commissioner said nailing down a global trade deal , on which negotiations began seven years ago , would be the " number one , number two and number three " priorities of his four-year term .
but agreement has been elusive .
lamy 's latest attempt at breaking the deadlock through a ministerial meeting of key economies in july 2008 ended in bitter disagreement between india and the united states .

the wto 's general council , comprising all 153 members , voted unanimously in support of the frenchman .
lamy ran for the post unopposed , partly , as aides have quoted him as saying , " because no one else wants this job . "
it was the first time in the wto 's 15-year history that the candidacy had not been contested .
with protectionism on the increase in the midst of a major global downturn and world trade talks stalled , the widely respected head of the world trade organisation will have his work cut out to achieve a breakthrough during his second term of office .
doha remains stumbling block since he took over the reins in september 2005 , lamy has been seeking a conclusion to the doha round of trade liberalization negotiations .
when first appointed , the former european union trade commissioner said nailing down a global trade deal , on which negotiations began seven years ago , would be the " number one , number two and number three " priorities of his four-year term .
but agreement has been elusive .
lamy 's latest attempt at breaking the deadlock through a ministerial meeting of key economies in july 2008 ended in bitter disagreement between india and the united states .

plan involved transit through turkey technical books say rocket nozzles are often made of graphite , which is a form of carbon .
according to the website of the german newspaper rhein zeitung , the businessman met an iranian man in 2003 who suggested the idea of smuggling .
in 2005 , the defendant began shipping graphite , which he declared as low-grade , into turkey via truck .
from there , a contact person would bring the graphite into iran .
he sold the graphite for four times the purchase price .

the wto 's general council , comprising all 153 members , voted unanimously in support of the frenchman .
lamy ran for the post unopposed , partly , as aides have quoted him as saying , " because no one else wants this job . "
it was the first time in the wto 's 15-year history that the candidacy had not been contested .
with protectionism on the increase in the midst of a major global downturn and world trade talks stalled , the widely respected head of the world trade organisation will have his work cut out to achieve a breakthrough during his second term of office .
doha remains stumbling block since he took over the reins in september 2005 , lamy has been seeking a conclusion to the doha round of trade liberalization negotiations .
when first appointed , the former european union trade commissioner said nailing down a global trade deal , on which negotiations began seven years ago , would be the " number one , number two and number three " priorities of his four-year term .
but agreement has been elusive .
lamy 's latest attempt at breaking the deadlock through a ministerial meeting of key economies in july 2008 ended in bitter disagreement between india and the united states .
speaking to the council earlier this week , the director-general reiterated the importance of concluding the doha round .
" beyond the trade-offs required to conclude the doha round and also beyond the market access that it will bring , lies its hugely important systemic value " he said .
creeping protectionism in a report to wto members in march , mr lamy noted that protectionism was on the rise .
he said " the danger today is of an incremental build-up of restrictions that could slowly strangle international trade , " noting that this could hamper economic recovery .
eu trade commissioner catherine ashton , who has called lamy a " tireless advocate of the benefits of open and rules-based trade , " welcomed the reappointment . ad / sh , afp / reuters / dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the us is expected to make requests to european allies to accommodate detainees from the controversial detention facility at guantanamo bay within weeks , amid reports that germany could be willing to help . germany 's interior minister wolfgang schaeuble has said that germany would consider accepting former inmates from the controversial us military detention facility at guantanamo bay , according to a report in the wall street journal .
schaeuble had previously expressed reservations about the possiblity of germany taking guantanamo detainees , but in january german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in an open letter to us president barack obama that germany would be willing to do so if it would help obama close the naval base in cuba .
key meeting with us envoy schaeuble 's apparent change of heart follows a meeting in berlin on wednesday with us attorney general eric holder , who earlier in the week visited london and prague to discuss the closure of the disputed detention center .
one of obama 's first acts after taking office in january was to order the closure of the anti-terror lockup by the end of the year .
the prison , where prisoners have been held without charges or trial , had been widely criticized by the international community for its use of so-called " enhanced interrogation techniques " which included simulated drowning known as waterboarding .
the previous us administration under george w. bush claimed that the techniques used at guantanamo did not amount to torture .
willing allies ?
out of the 241 detainees at guantanamo , 30 people have so far been cleared for release .
holder said in berlin that the us would be likely to submit formal requests to allies to take in former detainees in the coming weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us is unsure where to put its prisoners once released holder added that he had been " pleasantly surprised " by the willingness of allies to help resettle guantanamo inmates .
since taking office in january , the uk has been sent one prisoner from guantanamo and france has pledged to take another .
following a meeting with schaeuble , holder told reporters : " although no specific requests were made and no specific promises were given , what i have worked to do during the course of the trip is to lay a foundation for more specific requests that i think will come in the future . "
" i know that europe did not open guantanamo and that in fact a great many on this continent opposed it , " holder said . " to close guantanamo we must all make sacrifices and we must all be willing to make unpopular choices . "
a spokesman for the interior ministry told deutsche welle that first of all , germany expected detainees to be released to their home countries , and that germany was not aware of any german nationals being held at guantanamo .
comments from interior ministry in cases where former detainees could not be returned to their home countries , germany considered the us to be primarily responsible for the accommodation of former detainees .
" if this is not possible then the us would need to explain why this is the case , " the spokesman said .
" if germany is asked to take a specific person the first thing which would have to be checked is whether there is a relationship between this person and germany . "
spain to investigate in a separate development , spanish judge balthasar garzon on wednesday formally launched a criminal investigation into whether us officials condoned the use of torture at guantanamo .
the probe has been given greater impetus following the release last week by the obama administration of classified documents which list the interrogation methods used at guantanamo .
the allegations of torture include the use of sexual abuse , beatings and the throwing of fluids into prisoners ' eyes . ml / en / rm afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the us is expected to make requests to european allies to accommodate detainees from the controversial detention facility at guantanamo bay within weeks , amid reports that germany could be willing to help . germany 's interior minister wolfgang schaeuble has said that germany would consider accepting former inmates from the controversial us military detention facility at guantanamo bay , according to a report in the wall street journal .
schaeuble had previously expressed reservations about the possiblity of germany taking guantanamo detainees , but in january german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in an open letter to us president barack obama that germany would be willing to do so if it would help obama close the naval base in cuba .
key meeting with us envoy schaeuble 's apparent change of heart follows a meeting in berlin on wednesday with us attorney general eric holder , who earlier in the week visited london and prague to discuss the closure of the disputed detention center .
one of obama 's first acts after taking office in january was to order the closure of the anti-terror lockup by the end of the year .
the prison , where prisoners have been held without charges or trial , had been widely criticized by the international community for its use of so-called " enhanced interrogation techniques " which included simulated drowning known as waterboarding .
the previous us administration under george w. bush claimed that the techniques used at guantanamo did not amount to torture .
willing allies ?
out of the 241 detainees at guantanamo , 30 people have so far been cleared for release .
holder said in berlin that the us would be likely to submit formal requests to allies to take in former detainees in the coming weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us is unsure where to put its prisoners once released holder added that he had been " pleasantly surprised " by the willingness of allies to help resettle guantanamo inmates .
since taking office in january , the uk has been sent one prisoner from guantanamo and france has pledged to take another .
following a meeting with schaeuble , holder told reporters : " although no specific requests were made and no specific promises were given , what i have worked to do during the course of the trip is to lay a foundation for more specific requests that i think will come in the future . "
" i know that europe did not open guantanamo and that in fact a great many on this continent opposed it , " holder said . " to close guantanamo we must all make sacrifices and we must all be willing to make unpopular choices . "
a spokesman for the interior ministry told deutsche welle that first of all , germany expected detainees to be released to their home countries , and that germany was not aware of any german nationals being held at guantanamo .
comments from interior ministry in cases where former detainees could not be returned to their home countries , germany considered the us to be primarily responsible for the accommodation of former detainees .
" if this is not possible then the us would need to explain why this is the case , " the spokesman said .
" if germany is asked to take a specific person the first thing which would have to be checked is whether there is a relationship between this person and germany . "
spain to investigate in a separate development , spanish judge balthasar garzon on wednesday formally launched a criminal investigation into whether us officials condoned the use of torture at guantanamo .
the probe has been given greater impetus following the release last week by the obama administration of classified documents which list the interrogation methods used at guantanamo .
the allegations of torture include the use of sexual abuse , beatings and the throwing of fluids into prisoners ' eyes . ml / en / rm afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the foundation is attempting to raise 120 million euros -lrb- $ 160 million -rrb- to ensure long term maintenance funding for buildings and ruins at the former nazi death camp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister donald tusk has called upon other nations to support the auschwitz foundation .
although the foundation has only been officially in existence for a week , the international response to the request for funds has been positive . jacek kastenlaniec , the managing director of the auschwitz-birkenau foundation , told deutsche welle that germany has already pledged a million euros for the foundation , and plans to contribute much more next year .
" we have an official declaration of france that they will contribute to this endowment fund , " kastenlaniec added , " and two days ago -lrb- british prime minster -rrb- gordon brown said great britain would participate in this program . "
call for eu support the fundraising efforts of the foundation have also been put on the agenda of a european union summit set to take place in june .
despite the world-wide economic crisis , kastenlaniec says other countries have recognized the importance of the foundation 's goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for many it was a one-way journey but those who did return hope their suffering will never be forgotten " for sure , the economic crisis makes our task more difficult , " he says .
but the project was prepared before the start of the economic crisis , and we can not wait until -lrb- it -rrb- ends because the objects and the buildings will not wait .
it makes this operation more difficult , but observing the reactions , the authorities of different countries understand that this is a special situation . "
kastenlaniec is confident the foundation will reach its fundraising goal because of the role auschwitz plays in teaching future generations about the lessons of the past .
" i think this goal will be reached .
it ’ s not only the countries which were in the past responsible for what was happening there or the countries where there were deportations , but this is a project for future generations . ”
" this place helps young generations understand why we make so many efforts to live on a peaceful continent without conflicts and work out the consequences of hatred and anti semitism , " kastelaniec said .
long-term maintenance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year over a million visitors came to auschwitz and its musuem the site of the auschwitz-birkenau camp and the state-run museum covers nearly two square kilometres and includes many buildings and ruins from when the camp was operational .
if the foundation reaches its goal of 120 million euros , maintenance for the site will be secured for the future . " it 's about maintaining what 's already there , " said kastelaniec .
" around 155 buildings , 300 ruins and 100,000 items , like suitcases , shoes and other proof of the crimes committed . "
the polish government will continue to fund the museum at auschwitz-birkenau , but money to maintain the historical integrity of the site has come from different sources in the past . " right now , if we have problems with the conservation , " kastelaniec says " we have to look for funds in the budget of the museum or we have to go look for funds from the polish ministry of culture or european union programs . "
that system works , he says , and prevents major problems at the site , but the foundation is attempting to take a more long term approach to preserving auschwitz . " the foundation will -lrb- ensure -rrb- that the team of very professional conservators will have no problem working on the preservation of the buildings or ruins , including the ruins of the crematories , " kastelaniec said .
" it would guarantee the security of the future of -lrb- the camp -rrb- . "
notorious nazi death camp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wladyslaw bartoszewski , auschwitz survivor and founder of the auschwitz-birkenau foundation auschwitz-birkenau was one of the nazis ' most notorious concentration camps .
it operated from 1940 until 1945 , when it was liberated by the soviet union 's red army .
after world war ii , it was estimated that more than a million people died at auschwitz . most of the victims were european jews , but also included non-jewish poles , soviet prisoners of war , gypsies and anti-nazi resistance fighters .
some prisoners died in the camp 's gas chambers , others were worked or starved to death .
it was one of six german concentration camps in poland . the museum and preservation efforts of auschwitz have always been conducted in close contact with survivors of the camp .
they include wladyslaw bartoszewski , who was imprisoned at auschwitz in 1940 .
he ’ s now the founder of the auschwitz-birkenau foundation and a former foreign minister of poland . in a statement on the auschwitz-birkenau memorial and museum website , bartoszewski spoke about the importance of preservation . " we will save from forgetting what they wanted to destroy , " he said , referring to nazis who tried to cover up what had gone on at the concentration camps . he also referred to the lasting legacy of holocaust survivors as part of the reason for creating the foundation . " we , the survivors , are in our last active years .
that is why acknowledged european authorities , whose personal experiences are connected with that time , appealed to create a constant preservation tool for this place as well as for continuing educational and museum activities , " bartoszewski said . mz / sh , afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the foundation is attempting to raise 120 million euros -lrb- $ 160 million -rrb- to ensure long term maintenance funding for buildings and ruins at the former nazi death camp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister donald tusk has called upon other nations to support the auschwitz foundation .
although the foundation has only been officially in existence for a week , the international response to the request for funds has been positive . jacek kastenlaniec , the managing director of the auschwitz-birkenau foundation , told deutsche welle that germany has already pledged a million euros for the foundation , and plans to contribute much more next year .
" we have an official declaration of france that they will contribute to this endowment fund , " kastenlaniec added , " and two days ago -lrb- british prime minster -rrb- gordon brown said great britain would participate in this program . "
call for eu support the fundraising efforts of the foundation have also been put on the agenda of a european union summit set to take place in june .
despite the world-wide economic crisis , kastenlaniec says other countries have recognized the importance of the foundation 's goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for many it was a one-way journey but those who did return hope their suffering will never be forgotten " for sure , the economic crisis makes our task more difficult , " he says .
but the project was prepared before the start of the economic crisis , and we can not wait until -lrb- it -rrb- ends because the objects and the buildings will not wait .
it makes this operation more difficult , but observing the reactions , the authorities of different countries understand that this is a special situation . "
kastenlaniec is confident the foundation will reach its fundraising goal because of the role auschwitz plays in teaching future generations about the lessons of the past .
" i think this goal will be reached .
it ’ s not only the countries which were in the past responsible for what was happening there or the countries where there were deportations , but this is a project for future generations . ”
" this place helps young generations understand why we make so many efforts to live on a peaceful continent without conflicts and work out the consequences of hatred and anti semitism , " kastelaniec said .
long-term maintenance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year over a million visitors came to auschwitz and its musuem the site of the auschwitz-birkenau camp and the state-run museum covers nearly two square kilometres and includes many buildings and ruins from when the camp was operational .
if the foundation reaches its goal of 120 million euros , maintenance for the site will be secured for the future . " it 's about maintaining what 's already there , " said kastelaniec .
" around 155 buildings , 300 ruins and 100,000 items , like suitcases , shoes and other proof of the crimes committed . "
the polish government will continue to fund the museum at auschwitz-birkenau , but money to maintain the historical integrity of the site has come from different sources in the past . " right now , if we have problems with the conservation , " kastelaniec says " we have to look for funds in the budget of the museum or we have to go look for funds from the polish ministry of culture or european union programs . "
that system works , he says , and prevents major problems at the site , but the foundation is attempting to take a more long term approach to preserving auschwitz . " the foundation will -lrb- ensure -rrb- that the team of very professional conservators will have no problem working on the preservation of the buildings or ruins , including the ruins of the crematories , " kastelaniec said .
" it would guarantee the security of the future of -lrb- the camp -rrb- . "
notorious nazi death camp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wladyslaw bartoszewski , auschwitz survivor and founder of the auschwitz-birkenau foundation auschwitz-birkenau was one of the nazis ' most notorious concentration camps .
it operated from 1940 until 1945 , when it was liberated by the soviet union 's red army .
after world war ii , it was estimated that more than a million people died at auschwitz . most of the victims were european jews , but also included non-jewish poles , soviet prisoners of war , gypsies and anti-nazi resistance fighters .
some prisoners died in the camp 's gas chambers , others were worked or starved to death .
it was one of six german concentration camps in poland . the museum and preservation efforts of auschwitz have always been conducted in close contact with survivors of the camp .
they include wladyslaw bartoszewski , who was imprisoned at auschwitz in 1940 .
he ’ s now the founder of the auschwitz-birkenau foundation and a former foreign minister of poland . in a statement on the auschwitz-birkenau memorial and museum website , bartoszewski spoke about the importance of preservation . " we will save from forgetting what they wanted to destroy , " he said , referring to nazis who tried to cover up what had gone on at the concentration camps . he also referred to the lasting legacy of holocaust survivors as part of the reason for creating the foundation . " we , the survivors , are in our last active years .
that is why acknowledged european authorities , whose personal experiences are connected with that time , appealed to create a constant preservation tool for this place as well as for continuing educational and museum activities , " bartoszewski said . mz / sh , afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the foundation is attempting to raise 120 million euros -lrb- $ 160 million -rrb- to ensure long term maintenance funding for buildings and ruins at the former nazi death camp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister donald tusk has called upon other nations to support the auschwitz foundation .
although the foundation has only been officially in existence for a week , the international response to the request for funds has been positive . jacek kastenlaniec , the managing director of the auschwitz-birkenau foundation , told deutsche welle that germany has already pledged a million euros for the foundation , and plans to contribute much more next year .
" we have an official declaration of france that they will contribute to this endowment fund , " kastenlaniec added , " and two days ago -lrb- british prime minster -rrb- gordon brown said great britain would participate in this program . "
call for eu support the fundraising efforts of the foundation have also been put on the agenda of a european union summit set to take place in june .
despite the world-wide economic crisis , kastenlaniec says other countries have recognized the importance of the foundation 's goal .

but the project was prepared before the start of the economic crisis , and we can not wait until -lrb- it -rrb- ends because the objects and the buildings will not wait .
it makes this operation more difficult , but observing the reactions , the authorities of different countries understand that this is a special situation . "
kastenlaniec is confident the foundation will reach its fundraising goal because of the role auschwitz plays in teaching future generations about the lessons of the past .
" i think this goal will be reached .
it ’ s not only the countries which were in the past responsible for what was happening there or the countries where there were deportations , but this is a project for future generations . ”
" this place helps young generations understand why we make so many efforts to live on a peaceful continent without conflicts and work out the consequences of hatred and anti semitism , " kastelaniec said .

if the foundation reaches its goal of 120 million euros , maintenance for the site will be secured for the future . " it 's about maintaining what 's already there , " said kastelaniec .
" around 155 buildings , 300 ruins and 100,000 items , like suitcases , shoes and other proof of the crimes committed . "
the polish government will continue to fund the museum at auschwitz-birkenau , but money to maintain the historical integrity of the site has come from different sources in the past . " right now , if we have problems with the conservation , " kastelaniec says " we have to look for funds in the budget of the museum or we have to go look for funds from the polish ministry of culture or european union programs . "
that system works , he says , and prevents major problems at the site , but the foundation is attempting to take a more long term approach to preserving auschwitz . " the foundation will -lrb- ensure -rrb- that the team of very professional conservators will have no problem working on the preservation of the buildings or ruins , including the ruins of the crematories , " kastelaniec said .
" it would guarantee the security of the future of -lrb- the camp -rrb- . "

the foundation is attempting to raise 120 million euros -lrb- $ 160 million -rrb- to ensure long term maintenance funding for buildings and ruins at the former nazi death camp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister donald tusk has called upon other nations to support the auschwitz foundation .
although the foundation has only been officially in existence for a week , the international response to the request for funds has been positive . jacek kastenlaniec , the managing director of the auschwitz-birkenau foundation , told deutsche welle that germany has already pledged a million euros for the foundation , and plans to contribute much more next year .
" we have an official declaration of france that they will contribute to this endowment fund , " kastenlaniec added , " and two days ago -lrb- british prime minster -rrb- gordon brown said great britain would participate in this program . "
call for eu support the fundraising efforts of the foundation have also been put on the agenda of a european union summit set to take place in june .
despite the world-wide economic crisis , kastenlaniec says other countries have recognized the importance of the foundation 's goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for many it was a one-way journey but those who did return hope their suffering will never be forgotten " for sure , the economic crisis makes our task more difficult , " he says .
but the project was prepared before the start of the economic crisis , and we can not wait until -lrb- it -rrb- ends because the objects and the buildings will not wait .
it makes this operation more difficult , but observing the reactions , the authorities of different countries understand that this is a special situation . "
kastenlaniec is confident the foundation will reach its fundraising goal because of the role auschwitz plays in teaching future generations about the lessons of the past .
" i think this goal will be reached .
it ’ s not only the countries which were in the past responsible for what was happening there or the countries where there were deportations , but this is a project for future generations . ”
" this place helps young generations understand why we make so many efforts to live on a peaceful continent without conflicts and work out the consequences of hatred and anti semitism , " kastelaniec said .
long-term maintenance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year over a million visitors came to auschwitz and its musuem the site of the auschwitz-birkenau camp and the state-run museum covers nearly two square kilometres and includes many buildings and ruins from when the camp was operational .
if the foundation reaches its goal of 120 million euros , maintenance for the site will be secured for the future . " it 's about maintaining what 's already there , " said kastelaniec .
" around 155 buildings , 300 ruins and 100,000 items , like suitcases , shoes and other proof of the crimes committed . "
the polish government will continue to fund the museum at auschwitz-birkenau , but money to maintain the historical integrity of the site has come from different sources in the past . " right now , if we have problems with the conservation , " kastelaniec says " we have to look for funds in the budget of the museum or we have to go look for funds from the polish ministry of culture or european union programs . "
that system works , he says , and prevents major problems at the site , but the foundation is attempting to take a more long term approach to preserving auschwitz .

shareholders of hre have until monday to sell their stock to the government for a total of 290 million euros .
the flowers company said on thursday that it now expects to mount a legal challenge to the bank 's nationalisation .
german finance minister peer steinbrueck vowed that the goverment would simply nationalize hre if flowers & co refuses to accept the government 's share-price offer , which steinbrueck described as " very fair " .
hre became the most prominent german victim of the global credit crisis last september after its ireland-based unit depfa bank failed to find short-term funding .
since then the german government has shored up troubled hre with loan guarantees and cash injections totalling 102 billion euros .
the german government has passed temporary legislation to nationalize hre if a voluntary sale fails .

the moves were prompted by the global financial crisis , which has in part been blamed on short-term profit-taking and lax financial regulation .
the proposals are part of a push by the eu to increase financial regulation in a bid to bring confidence back to financial markets .
" up to now , there have been far too many perverse incentives in place in the financial services industry .
it is neither sensible nor sane that pay incentives encourage excessive risk-taking for short-term gain , " said eu internal market commissioner charlie mccreevy while unveiling his proposals .
according to the commissioner , managers ' salaries should reflect " sound and effective risk management " rather than short-term gains , while the payment of bonuses should be linked to the long-term performance of the company .
moreover , a company 's remuneration policy should be " adequately disclosed to stakeholders " and properly supervised .
finally , banks should be allowed to claw back bonuses paid on the basis of data " which proved to be manifestly misstated , " officials in brussels said in a statement .
undeserved bonuses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccreevy wants to clamp down on golden parachutes " our message is very clear : directors ' remuneration must be clearly linked to performance and not rewards for failure , " mccreevy said .
data published by the commission in march showed that many of europe 's chief executive officers enjoyed ballooning salaries between 2003 and 2007 , with average bonuses surging from an equivalent of 70 percent of their base salaries to 151 percent .
in issuing his recommendations , mccreevy also urged financial firms to limit the benefits they pay to fired executives - the so-called " golden parachutes " - to no more than double their basic salary .
severance pay should be banned in case of failure .
the guidelines are non-binding , but mccreevy said at least some of them could be incorporated in the commission 's revised capital requirements directive , due to be unveiled in june .
wednesday 's proposed directive on bringing hedge funds under greater supervisory scrutiny would be binding if it were approved by both the european parliament and the finance ministers of the eu 's 27 member states .
pros and cons commission officials said alternative investment fund managers -lrb- aifm -rrb- , which include the managers of hedge funds and private equity funds , controlled around 2 trillion euros -lrb- $ 2.65 trillion -rrb- in assets in the eu at the end of 2008 .
the bulk of aifms are based in london , and wednesday 's proposal is seen as a compromise between the hard-line stance of countries such as germany and france , and that of countries such as britain , which argue that stricter regulation could drive financial firms away from europe .
the proposal disappointed advocates of tighter regulation , such as poul nyrup rasmussen , head of the party of european socialists , who described the directive as having " more holes than a swiss cheese . "
mccreevy acknowledged divisions , saying " for some , these proposals go too far , for others they do not go far enough . "
wednesday 's proposals take into account recent discussions held in london by the leaders of the world 's 20 most powerful nations .
european commission president jose manuel barroso said the eu was leading the way in the global drive to prevent further financial crises from occurring .

the moves were prompted by the global financial crisis , which has in part been blamed on short-term profit-taking and lax financial regulation .
the proposals are part of a push by the eu to increase financial regulation in a bid to bring confidence back to financial markets .
" up to now , there have been far too many perverse incentives in place in the financial services industry .
it is neither sensible nor sane that pay incentives encourage excessive risk-taking for short-term gain , " said eu internal market commissioner charlie mccreevy while unveiling his proposals .
according to the commissioner , managers ' salaries should reflect " sound and effective risk management " rather than short-term gains , while the payment of bonuses should be linked to the long-term performance of the company .
moreover , a company 's remuneration policy should be " adequately disclosed to stakeholders " and properly supervised .
finally , banks should be allowed to claw back bonuses paid on the basis of data " which proved to be manifestly misstated , " officials in brussels said in a statement .
undeserved bonuses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccreevy wants to clamp down on golden parachutes " our message is very clear : directors ' remuneration must be clearly linked to performance and not rewards for failure , " mccreevy said .
data published by the commission in march showed that many of europe 's chief executive officers enjoyed ballooning salaries between 2003 and 2007 , with average bonuses surging from an equivalent of 70 percent of their base salaries to 151 percent .
in issuing his recommendations , mccreevy also urged financial firms to limit the benefits they pay to fired executives - the so-called " golden parachutes " - to no more than double their basic salary .
severance pay should be banned in case of failure .
the guidelines are non-binding , but mccreevy said at least some of them could be incorporated in the commission 's revised capital requirements directive , due to be unveiled in june .
wednesday 's proposed directive on bringing hedge funds under greater supervisory scrutiny would be binding if it were approved by both the european parliament and the finance ministers of the eu 's 27 member states .
pros and cons commission officials said alternative investment fund managers -lrb- aifm -rrb- , which include the managers of hedge funds and private equity funds , controlled around 2 trillion euros -lrb- $ 2.65 trillion -rrb- in assets in the eu at the end of 2008 .
the bulk of aifms are based in london , and wednesday 's proposal is seen as a compromise between the hard-line stance of countries such as germany and france , and that of countries such as britain , which argue that stricter regulation could drive financial firms away from europe .
the proposal disappointed advocates of tighter regulation , such as poul nyrup rasmussen , head of the party of european socialists , who described the directive as having " more holes than a swiss cheese . "
mccreevy acknowledged divisions , saying " for some , these proposals go too far , for others they do not go far enough . "
wednesday 's proposals take into account recent discussions held in london by the leaders of the world 's 20 most powerful nations .
european commission president jose manuel barroso said the eu was leading the way in the global drive to prevent further financial crises from occurring .
" -lrb- the proposals -rrb- will tackle systemic risks created by a lack of transparency and excessive risk-taking .
now we hope that others can join us , " barroso said . dfm , nw dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the match in bremen is the second of four duels between the two northern rivals - only some 100 kilometers apart - within 19 days .
last week they clashed in the semi-finals of the germany 's dfb cup when bremen got the upper hand in a penalty shoot-out .

the northern german club 's last major title came in 1987 when it won the dfb cup .
that success came four seasons after hamburg were crowned european champions .
bremen 's track record , meanwhile , has been an image of comparative success .
in the same timeframe the club has won three german league titles , four cup titles , the european cup winners ' cup and been a regular champions league qualifier .
despite the differences in long-term success , hamburg will make the short trip to bremen in good heart knowing they have done well on their travels in europe this season .

however , in a statement read out by his lawyers , he has now admitted to the offense .
the man is accused of breaking laws preventing illicit arms exports by declaring the graphite exported from 2005 to 2007 to be low-grade .
this would have avoided the need to apply for a government clearance which would almost certainly have been refused .
german intelligence suspects the graphite was bought for iran 's missile program .
tehran is suspected of secretly developing nuclear weapons which could be delivered as the payload of the missiles .
the accused is the former chief executive of carbon-industrie-produkte gmbh , a firm that specialized in trading graphite .
in 2007 , germany imposed a ban on exports of any graphite , even the low-grade type , to iran .
plan involved transit through turkey technical books say rocket nozzles are often made of graphite , which is a form of carbon .
according to the website of the german newspaper rhein zeitung , the businessman met an iranian man in 2003 who suggested the idea of smuggling .
in 2005 , the defendant began shipping graphite , which he declared as low-grade , into turkey via truck .
from there , a contact person would bring the graphite into iran .
he sold the graphite for four times the purchase price .
the money was wired to an account in the seychelles islands .
the man , whose name has been withheld under german media privacy guidelines , has been in custody since last june .
company workers knew nothing of the scheme , he asserts . jen , rm / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the wto 's general council , comprising all 153 members , voted unanimously in support of the frenchman .
lamy ran for the post unopposed , partly , as aides have quoted him as saying , " because no one else wants this job . "
it was the first time in the wto 's 15-year history that the candidacy had not been contested .
with protectionism on the increase in the midst of a major global downturn and world trade talks stalled , the widely respected head of the world trade organisation will have his work cut out to achieve a breakthrough during his second term of office .
doha remains stumbling block since he took over the reins in september 2005 , lamy has been seeking a conclusion to the doha round of trade liberalization negotiations .
when first appointed , the former european union trade commissioner said nailing down a global trade deal , on which negotiations began seven years ago , would be the " number one , number two and number three " priorities of his four-year term .
but agreement has been elusive .
lamy 's latest attempt at breaking the deadlock through a ministerial meeting of key economies in july 2008 ended in bitter disagreement between india and the united states .
speaking to the council earlier this week , the director-general reiterated the importance of concluding the doha round .
" beyond the trade-offs required to conclude the doha round and also beyond the market access that it will bring , lies its hugely important systemic value " he said .
creeping protectionism in a report to wto members in march , mr lamy noted that protectionism was on the rise .
he said " the danger today is of an incremental build-up of restrictions that could slowly strangle international trade , " noting that this could hamper economic recovery .
eu trade commissioner catherine ashton , who has called lamy a " tireless advocate of the benefits of open and rules-based trade , " welcomed the reappointment . ad / sh , afp / reuters / dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the wto 's general council , comprising all 153 members , voted unanimously in support of the frenchman .
lamy ran for the post unopposed , partly , as aides have quoted him as saying , " because no one else wants this job . "
it was the first time in the wto 's 15-year history that the candidacy had not been contested .
with protectionism on the increase in the midst of a major global downturn and world trade talks stalled , the widely respected head of the world trade organisation will have his work cut out to achieve a breakthrough during his second term of office .
doha remains stumbling block since he took over the reins in september 2005 , lamy has been seeking a conclusion to the doha round of trade liberalization negotiations .
when first appointed , the former european union trade commissioner said nailing down a global trade deal , on which negotiations began seven years ago , would be the " number one , number two and number three " priorities of his four-year term .
but agreement has been elusive .
lamy 's latest attempt at breaking the deadlock through a ministerial meeting of key economies in july 2008 ended in bitter disagreement between india and the united states .
speaking to the council earlier this week , the director-general reiterated the importance of concluding the doha round .

the wto 's general council , comprising all 153 members , voted unanimously in support of the frenchman .
lamy ran for the post unopposed , partly , as aides have quoted him as saying , " because no one else wants this job . "
it was the first time in the wto 's 15-year history that the candidacy had not been contested .
with protectionism on the increase in the midst of a major global downturn and world trade talks stalled , the widely respected head of the world trade organisation will have his work cut out to achieve a breakthrough during his second term of office .
doha remains stumbling block since he took over the reins in september 2005 , lamy has been seeking a conclusion to the doha round of trade liberalization negotiations .
when first appointed , the former european union trade commissioner said nailing down a global trade deal , on which negotiations began seven years ago , would be the " number one , number two and number three " priorities of his four-year term .
but agreement has been elusive .
lamy 's latest attempt at breaking the deadlock through a ministerial meeting of key economies in july 2008 ended in bitter disagreement between india and the united states .
speaking to the council earlier this week , the director-general reiterated the importance of concluding the doha round .
" beyond the trade-offs required to conclude the doha round and also beyond the market access that it will bring , lies its hugely important systemic value " he said .
creeping protectionism in a report to wto members in march , mr lamy noted that protectionism was on the rise .
he said " the danger today is of an incremental build-up of restrictions that could slowly strangle international trade , " noting that this could hamper economic recovery .
eu trade commissioner catherine ashton , who has called lamy a " tireless advocate of the benefits of open and rules-based trade , " welcomed the reappointment . ad / sh , afp / reuters / dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9797 headline news from the top of the hour dw-tv europe live journal - news with business we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

diplomats from the two sides met in brussels on wednesday .

the wto 's general council , comprising all 153 members , voted unanimously in support of the frenchman .
lamy ran for the post unopposed , partly , as aides have quoted him as saying , " because no one else wants this job . "
it was the first time in the wto 's 15-year history that the candidacy had not been contested .
with protectionism on the increase in the midst of a major global downturn and world trade talks stalled , the widely respected head of the world trade organisation will have his work cut out to achieve a breakthrough during his second term of office .
doha remains stumbling block since he took over the reins in september 2005 , lamy has been seeking a conclusion to the doha round of trade liberalization negotiations .
when first appointed , the former european union trade commissioner said nailing down a global trade deal , on which negotiations began seven years ago , would be the " number one , number two and number three " priorities of his four-year term .
but agreement has been elusive .
lamy 's latest attempt at breaking the deadlock through a ministerial meeting of key economies in july 2008 ended in bitter disagreement between india and the united states .
speaking to the council earlier this week , the director-general reiterated the importance of concluding the doha round .
" beyond the trade-offs required to conclude the doha round and also beyond the market access that it will bring , lies its hugely important systemic value " he said .
creeping protectionism in a report to wto members in march , mr lamy noted that protectionism was on the rise .
he said " the danger today is of an incremental build-up of restrictions that could slowly strangle international trade , " noting that this could hamper economic recovery .
eu trade commissioner catherine ashton , who has called lamy a " tireless advocate of the benefits of open and rules-based trade , " welcomed the reappointment . ad / sh , afp / reuters / dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9798 headline news from the top of the hour dw-tv europe live germany today - window on germany we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

the wto 's general council , comprising all 153 members , voted unanimously in support of the frenchman .
lamy ran for the post unopposed , partly , as aides have quoted him as saying , " because no one else wants this job . "
it was the first time in the wto 's 15-year history that the candidacy had not been contested .
with protectionism on the increase in the midst of a major global downturn and world trade talks stalled , the widely respected head of the world trade organisation will have his work cut out to achieve a breakthrough during his second term of office .
doha remains stumbling block since he took over the reins in september 2005 , lamy has been seeking a conclusion to the doha round of trade liberalization negotiations .
when first appointed , the former european union trade commissioner said nailing down a global trade deal , on which negotiations began seven years ago , would be the " number one , number two and number three " priorities of his four-year term .
but agreement has been elusive .
lamy 's latest attempt at breaking the deadlock through a ministerial meeting of key economies in july 2008 ended in bitter disagreement between india and the united states .
speaking to the council earlier this week , the director-general reiterated the importance of concluding the doha round .
" beyond the trade-offs required to conclude the doha round and also beyond the market access that it will bring , lies its hugely important systemic value " he said .
creeping protectionism in a report to wto members in march , mr lamy noted that protectionism was on the rise .
he said " the danger today is of an incremental build-up of restrictions that could slowly strangle international trade , " noting that this could hamper economic recovery .
eu trade commissioner catherine ashton , who has called lamy a " tireless advocate of the benefits of open and rules-based trade , " welcomed the reappointment . ad / sh , afp / reuters / dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9798 headline news from the top of the hour dw-tv europe live journal - nachrichten we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 30.04.2009 germany says willing to consider taking guantanamo detainees großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will europe help the us solve their guantanamo problem ?
the us is expected to make requests to european allies to accommodate detainees from the controversial detention facility at guantanamo bay within weeks , amid reports that germany could be willing to help . germany 's interior minister wolfgang schaeuble has said that germany would consider accepting former inmates from the controversial us military detention facility at guantanamo bay , according to a report in the wall street journal .
schaeuble had previously expressed reservations about the possiblity of germany taking guantanamo detainees , but in january german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in an open letter to us president barack obama that germany would be willing to do so if it would help obama close the naval base in cuba .
key meeting with us envoy schaeuble 's apparent change of heart follows a meeting in berlin on wednesday with us attorney general eric holder , who earlier in the week visited london and prague to discuss the closure of the disputed detention center .
one of obama 's first acts after taking office in january was to order the closure of the anti-terror lockup by the end of the year .
the prison , where prisoners have been held without charges or trial , had been widely criticized by the international community for its use of so-called " enhanced interrogation techniques " which included simulated drowning known as waterboarding .
the previous us administration under george w. bush claimed that the techniques used at guantanamo did not amount to torture .
willing allies ?
out of the 241 detainees at guantanamo , 30 people have so far been cleared for release .
holder said in berlin that the us would be likely to submit formal requests to allies to take in former detainees in the coming weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us is unsure where to put its prisoners once released holder added that he had been " pleasantly surprised " by the willingness of allies to help resettle guantanamo inmates .
since taking office in january , the uk has been sent one prisoner from guantanamo and france has pledged to take another .
following a meeting with schaeuble , holder told reporters : " although no specific requests were made and no specific promises were given , what i have worked to do during the course of the trip is to lay a foundation for more specific requests that i think will come in the future . "
" i know that europe did not open guantanamo and that in fact a great many on this continent opposed it , " holder said . " to close guantanamo we must all make sacrifices and we must all be willing to make unpopular choices . "
a spokesman for the interior ministry told deutsche welle that first of all , germany expected detainees to be released to their home countries , and that germany was not aware of any german nationals being held at guantanamo .
comments from interior ministry in cases where former detainees could not be returned to their home countries , germany considered the us to be primarily responsible for the accommodation of former detainees .
" if this is not possible then the us would need to explain why this is the case , " the spokesman said .
" if germany is asked to take a specific person the first thing which would have to be checked is whether there is a relationship between this person and germany . "
spain to investigate in a separate development , spanish judge balthasar garzon on wednesday formally launched a criminal investigation into whether us officials condoned the use of torture at guantanamo .
the probe has been given greater impetus following the release last week by the obama administration of classified documents which list the interrogation methods used at guantanamo .
the allegations of torture include the use of sexual abuse , beatings and the throwing of fluids into prisoners ' eyes . ml / en / rm afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de germans split on offering us help with guantanamo inmates it is up to the us alone to deal with prisoners released from the guantanamo prison camp , according to a leading german politician .
but other experts say germany should not exclude the option of taking in detainees .

the us is expected to make requests to european allies to accommodate detainees from the controversial detention facility at guantanamo bay within weeks , amid reports that germany could be willing to help . germany 's interior minister wolfgang schaeuble has said that germany would consider accepting former inmates from the controversial us military detention facility at guantanamo bay , according to a report in the wall street journal .
schaeuble had previously expressed reservations about the possiblity of germany taking guantanamo detainees , but in january german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in an open letter to us president barack obama that germany would be willing to do so if it would help obama close the naval base in cuba .
key meeting with us envoy schaeuble 's apparent change of heart follows a meeting in berlin on wednesday with us attorney general eric holder , who earlier in the week visited london and prague to discuss the closure of the disputed detention center .
one of obama 's first acts after taking office in january was to order the closure of the anti-terror lockup by the end of the year .
the prison , where prisoners have been held without charges or trial , had been widely criticized by the international community for its use of so-called " enhanced interrogation techniques " which included simulated drowning known as waterboarding .
the previous us administration under george w. bush claimed that the techniques used at guantanamo did not amount to torture .
willing allies ?
out of the 241 detainees at guantanamo , 30 people have so far been cleared for release .
holder said in berlin that the us would be likely to submit formal requests to allies to take in former detainees in the coming weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us is unsure where to put its prisoners once released holder added that he had been " pleasantly surprised " by the willingness of allies to help resettle guantanamo inmates .
since taking office in january , the uk has been sent one prisoner from guantanamo and france has pledged to take another .
following a meeting with schaeuble , holder told reporters : " although no specific requests were made and no specific promises were given , what i have worked to do during the course of the trip is to lay a foundation for more specific requests that i think will come in the future . "
" i know that europe did not open guantanamo and that in fact a great many on this continent opposed it , " holder said . " to close guantanamo we must all make sacrifices and we must all be willing to make unpopular choices . "
a spokesman for the interior ministry told deutsche welle that first of all , germany expected detainees to be released to their home countries , and that germany was not aware of any german nationals being held at guantanamo .
comments from interior ministry in cases where former detainees could not be returned to their home countries , germany considered the us to be primarily responsible for the accommodation of former detainees .
" if this is not possible then the us would need to explain why this is the case , " the spokesman said .
" if germany is asked to take a specific person the first thing which would have to be checked is whether there is a relationship between this person and germany . "
spain to investigate in a separate development , spanish judge balthasar garzon on wednesday formally launched a criminal investigation into whether us officials condoned the use of torture at guantanamo .
the probe has been given greater impetus following the release last week by the obama administration of classified documents which list the interrogation methods used at guantanamo .

the us is expected to make requests to european allies to accommodate detainees from the controversial detention facility at guantanamo bay within weeks , amid reports that germany could be willing to help . germany 's interior minister wolfgang schaeuble has said that germany would consider accepting former inmates from the controversial us military detention facility at guantanamo bay , according to a report in the wall street journal .
schaeuble had previously expressed reservations about the possiblity of germany taking guantanamo detainees , but in january german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in an open letter to us president barack obama that germany would be willing to do so if it would help obama close the naval base in cuba .
key meeting with us envoy schaeuble 's apparent change of heart follows a meeting in berlin on wednesday with us attorney general eric holder , who earlier in the week visited london and prague to discuss the closure of the disputed detention center .
one of obama 's first acts after taking office in january was to order the closure of the anti-terror lockup by the end of the year .
the prison , where prisoners have been held without charges or trial , had been widely criticized by the international community for its use of so-called " enhanced interrogation techniques " which included simulated drowning known as waterboarding .
the previous us administration under george w. bush claimed that the techniques used at guantanamo did not amount to torture .
willing allies ?
out of the 241 detainees at guantanamo , 30 people have so far been cleared for release .
holder said in berlin that the us would be likely to submit formal requests to allies to take in former detainees in the coming weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us is unsure where to put its prisoners once released holder added that he had been " pleasantly surprised " by the willingness of allies to help resettle guantanamo inmates .
since taking office in january , the uk has been sent one prisoner from guantanamo and france has pledged to take another .
following a meeting with schaeuble , holder told reporters : " although no specific requests were made and no specific promises were given , what i have worked to do during the course of the trip is to lay a foundation for more specific requests that i think will come in the future . "
" i know that europe did not open guantanamo and that in fact a great many on this continent opposed it , " holder said . " to close guantanamo we must all make sacrifices and we must all be willing to make unpopular choices . "
a spokesman for the interior ministry told deutsche welle that first of all , germany expected detainees to be released to their home countries , and that germany was not aware of any german nationals being held at guantanamo .
comments from interior ministry in cases where former detainees could not be returned to their home countries , germany considered the us to be primarily responsible for the accommodation of former detainees .
" if this is not possible then the us would need to explain why this is the case , " the spokesman said .
" if germany is asked to take a specific person the first thing which would have to be checked is whether there is a relationship between this person and germany . "
spain to investigate in a separate development , spanish judge balthasar garzon on wednesday formally launched a criminal investigation into whether us officials condoned the use of torture at guantanamo .
the probe has been given greater impetus following the release last week by the obama administration of classified documents which list the interrogation methods used at guantanamo .
the allegations of torture include the use of sexual abuse , beatings and the throwing of fluids into prisoners ' eyes . ml / en / rm afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it operated from 1940 until 1945 , when it was liberated by the soviet union 's red army .
after world war ii , it was estimated that more than a million people died at auschwitz . most of the victims were european jews , but also included non-jewish poles , soviet prisoners of war , gypsies and anti-nazi resistance fighters .
some prisoners died in the camp 's gas chambers , others were worked or starved to death .
it was one of six german concentration camps in poland . the museum and preservation efforts of auschwitz have always been conducted in close contact with survivors of the camp .
they include wladyslaw bartoszewski , who was imprisoned at auschwitz in 1940 .
he ’ s now the founder of the auschwitz-birkenau foundation and a former foreign minister of poland . in a statement on the auschwitz-birkenau memorial and museum website , bartoszewski spoke about the importance of preservation .

they include wladyslaw bartoszewski , who was imprisoned at auschwitz in 1940 .
he ’ s now the founder of the auschwitz-birkenau foundation and a former foreign minister of poland . in a statement on the auschwitz-birkenau memorial and museum website , bartoszewski spoke about the importance of preservation .

" we , the survivors , are in our last active years .

" nato has ordered the expulsion of two diplomats from the russian mission in brussels , in connection with a spying scandal in which a former estonian official passed alliance secrets to moscow , a diplomat in the alliance told afp news service .
" i can confirm it , " one diplomat told afp when asked about reports that the two had been ordered to leave .
russia : move is a ' crude provocation ' in response , the russian foreign ministry in moscow said the move was a " crude provocation " made on " an absolutely trumped up pretext . "
" this outrageous action fundamentally contradicts statements by nato 's leadership on its readiness to normalize ties with russia , " the russian ministry said .
just one day earlier nato and russia resumed official relations after an eight-month freeze tied to the russian-georgia war last august .
diplomats from the two sides met in brussels on wednesday .
on thursday , however , came the expulsions .
one nato diplomat told afp that the two expelled russian officials included a russian political counsellor and a son of vladimir chizhov , russia 's ambassador to the european union .
" our understanding is that this has been part of an investigation that has been going on for some time , " concerning the estonian spy scandal , the diplomat said .
estonian is jailed former estonian defense ministry official herman simm was arrested last september in a case which has proved deeply embarrassing for estonia after suggestions that nato secrets may have been leaked to russia .
simm was on the defense ministry staff between 1995 and 2006 , before being transferred to an adviser 's post until march 2008 .
estonia , a soviet-ruled republic until 1991 , joined nato and the european union in 2004 . relations with its powerful neighbor are rocky .

the statement was attributed to jana rihova , spokeswoman for the czech labor and social affairs ministry . the european commission confirmed that belgium and denmark would scrap remaining curbs from may 1 for job seekers from the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , poland , slovakia and slovenia , all of which joined the eu in 2004 .
all other eu countries - except germany and austria - have already lifted the labor restrictions imposed on the 2004 newcomers . meanwhile , citizens of bulgaria and romania , which joined the eu in 2007 , continue to face restrictions in the older member states except finland and sweden .
the measures were originally meant to ease the concerns of unions in older member states , which feared that cheap workers would flood their labor markets . all temporary labor restrictions are due to be phased out by the end of 2013 . ad / sh , ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 30.04.2009 poland seeks promises of funds to preserve auschwitz großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a trainload of victims destined for auschwitz concentration camp where more than a million died the polish government is calling on other countries to help support the newly-founded auschwitz-birkenau foundation , which hopes to raise 120 million euros to maintain the site of the former nazi death camp . in a letter to the leaders of 39 nations , polish prime minister donald tusk has called on other countries to support the newly established auschwitz-birkenau foundation .
the foundation is attempting to raise 120 million euros -lrb- $ 160 million -rrb- to ensure long term maintenance funding for buildings and ruins at the former nazi death camp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister donald tusk has called upon other nations to support the auschwitz foundation .
although the foundation has only been officially in existence for a week , the international response to the request for funds has been positive . jacek kastenlaniec , the managing director of the auschwitz-birkenau foundation , told deutsche welle that germany has already pledged a million euros for the foundation , and plans to contribute much more next year .
" we have an official declaration of france that they will contribute to this endowment fund , " kastenlaniec added , " and two days ago -lrb- british prime minster -rrb- gordon brown said great britain would participate in this program . "
call for eu support the fundraising efforts of the foundation have also been put on the agenda of a european union summit set to take place in june .
despite the world-wide economic crisis , kastenlaniec says other countries have recognized the importance of the foundation 's goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for many it was a one-way journey but those who did return hope their suffering will never be forgotten " for sure , the economic crisis makes our task more difficult , " he says .
but the project was prepared before the start of the economic crisis , and we can not wait until -lrb- it -rrb- ends because the objects and the buildings will not wait .
it makes this operation more difficult , but observing the reactions , the authorities of different countries understand that this is a special situation . "
kastenlaniec is confident the foundation will reach its fundraising goal because of the role auschwitz plays in teaching future generations about the lessons of the past .
" i think this goal will be reached .
it ’ s not only the countries which were in the past responsible for what was happening there or the countries where there were deportations , but this is a project for future generations . ”
" this place helps young generations understand why we make so many efforts to live on a peaceful continent without conflicts and work out the consequences of hatred and anti semitism , " kastelaniec said .
long-term maintenance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year over a million visitors came to auschwitz and its musuem the site of the auschwitz-birkenau camp and the state-run museum covers nearly two square kilometres and includes many buildings and ruins from when the camp was operational .
if the foundation reaches its goal of 120 million euros , maintenance for the site will be secured for the future . " it 's about maintaining what 's already there , " said kastelaniec .
" around 155 buildings , 300 ruins and 100,000 items , like suitcases , shoes and other proof of the crimes committed . "
the polish government will continue to fund the museum at auschwitz-birkenau , but money to maintain the historical integrity of the site has come from different sources in the past . " right now , if we have problems with the conservation , " kastelaniec says " we have to look for funds in the budget of the museum or we have to go look for funds from the polish ministry of culture or european union programs . "
that system works , he says , and prevents major problems at the site , but the foundation is attempting to take a more long term approach to preserving auschwitz . " the foundation will -lrb- ensure -rrb- that the team of very professional conservators will have no problem working on the preservation of the buildings or ruins , including the ruins of the crematories , " kastelaniec said .
" it would guarantee the security of the future of -lrb- the camp -rrb- . "
notorious nazi death camp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wladyslaw bartoszewski , auschwitz survivor and founder of the auschwitz-birkenau foundation auschwitz-birkenau was one of the nazis ' most notorious concentration camps .
it operated from 1940 until 1945 , when it was liberated by the soviet union 's red army .
after world war ii , it was estimated that more than a million people died at auschwitz . most of the victims were european jews , but also included non-jewish poles , soviet prisoners of war , gypsies and anti-nazi resistance fighters .
some prisoners died in the camp 's gas chambers , others were worked or starved to death .
it was one of six german concentration camps in poland . the museum and preservation efforts of auschwitz have always been conducted in close contact with survivors of the camp .
they include wladyslaw bartoszewski , who was imprisoned at auschwitz in 1940 .
he ’ s now the founder of the auschwitz-birkenau foundation and a former foreign minister of poland . in a statement on the auschwitz-birkenau memorial and museum website , bartoszewski spoke about the importance of preservation . " we will save from forgetting what they wanted to destroy , " he said , referring to nazis who tried to cover up what had gone on at the concentration camps . he also referred to the lasting legacy of holocaust survivors as part of the reason for creating the foundation . " we , the survivors , are in our last active years .
that is why acknowledged european authorities , whose personal experiences are connected with that time , appealed to create a constant preservation tool for this place as well as for continuing educational and museum activities , " bartoszewski said . mz / sh , afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 30.04.2009 brussels calls for curbs on executive super-bonuses großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some bank executives have received bonuses despite huge profit loses the european commission has responded to public anger over perceived managerial greed in the midst of recession by recommending curbs on bankers ’ pay and bonuses . the european union executive also issued tighter rules , on wednesday , for managing high-risk alternative investment funds , such as hedge funds .
the moves were prompted by the global financial crisis , which has in part been blamed on short-term profit-taking and lax financial regulation .
the proposals are part of a push by the eu to increase financial regulation in a bid to bring confidence back to financial markets .
" up to now , there have been far too many perverse incentives in place in the financial services industry .
it is neither sensible nor sane that pay incentives encourage excessive risk-taking for short-term gain , " said eu internal market commissioner charlie mccreevy while unveiling his proposals .
according to the commissioner , managers ' salaries should reflect " sound and effective risk management " rather than short-term gains , while the payment of bonuses should be linked to the long-term performance of the company .
moreover , a company 's remuneration policy should be " adequately disclosed to stakeholders " and properly supervised .
finally , banks should be allowed to claw back bonuses paid on the basis of data " which proved to be manifestly misstated , " officials in brussels said in a statement .
undeserved bonuses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccreevy wants to clamp down on golden parachutes " our message is very clear : directors ' remuneration must be clearly linked to performance and not rewards for failure , " mccreevy said .
data published by the commission in march showed that many of europe 's chief executive officers enjoyed ballooning salaries between 2003 and 2007 , with average bonuses surging from an equivalent of 70 percent of their base salaries to 151 percent .
in issuing his recommendations , mccreevy also urged financial firms to limit the benefits they pay to fired executives - the so-called " golden parachutes " - to no more than double their basic salary .
severance pay should be banned in case of failure .
the guidelines are non-binding , but mccreevy said at least some of them could be incorporated in the commission 's revised capital requirements directive , due to be unveiled in june .
wednesday 's proposed directive on bringing hedge funds under greater supervisory scrutiny would be binding if it were approved by both the european parliament and the finance ministers of the eu 's 27 member states .
pros and cons commission officials said alternative investment fund managers -lrb- aifm -rrb- , which include the managers of hedge funds and private equity funds , controlled around 2 trillion euros -lrb- $ 2.65 trillion -rrb- in assets in the eu at the end of 2008 .
the bulk of aifms are based in london , and wednesday 's proposal is seen as a compromise between the hard-line stance of countries such as germany and france , and that of countries such as britain , which argue that stricter regulation could drive financial firms away from europe .
the proposal disappointed advocates of tighter regulation , such as poul nyrup rasmussen , head of the party of european socialists , who described the directive as having " more holes than a swiss cheese . "
mccreevy acknowledged divisions , saying " for some , these proposals go too far , for others they do not go far enough . "
wednesday 's proposals take into account recent discussions held in london by the leaders of the world 's 20 most powerful nations .
european commission president jose manuel barroso said the eu was leading the way in the global drive to prevent further financial crises from occurring .
" -lrb- the proposals -rrb- will tackle systemic risks created by a lack of transparency and excessive risk-taking .
now we hope that others can join us , " barroso said . dfm , nw dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the wto 's general council , comprising all 153 members , voted unanimously in support of the frenchman .
lamy ran for the post unopposed , partly , as aides have quoted him as saying , " because no one else wants this job . "
it was the first time in the wto 's 15-year history that the candidacy had not been contested .
with protectionism on the increase in the midst of a major global downturn and world trade talks stalled , the widely respected head of the world trade organisation will have his work cut out to achieve a breakthrough during his second term of office .
doha remains stumbling block since he took over the reins in september 2005 , lamy has been seeking a conclusion to the doha round of trade liberalization negotiations .
when first appointed , the former european union trade commissioner said nailing down a global trade deal , on which negotiations began seven years ago , would be the " number one , number two and number three " priorities of his four-year term .
but agreement has been elusive .
lamy 's latest attempt at breaking the deadlock through a ministerial meeting of key economies in july 2008 ended in bitter disagreement between india and the united states .
speaking to the council earlier this week , the director-general reiterated the importance of concluding the doha round .
" beyond the trade-offs required to conclude the doha round and also beyond the market access that it will bring , lies its hugely important systemic value " he said .
creeping protectionism in a report to wto members in march , mr lamy noted that protectionism was on the rise .
he said " the danger today is of an incremental build-up of restrictions that could slowly strangle international trade , " noting that this could hamper economic recovery .
eu trade commissioner catherine ashton , who has called lamy a " tireless advocate of the benefits of open and rules-based trade , " welcomed the reappointment . ad / sh , afp / reuters / dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the foundation is attempting to raise 120 million euros -lrb- $ 160 million -rrb- to ensure long term maintenance funding for buildings and ruins at the former nazi death camp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister donald tusk has called upon other nations to support the auschwitz foundation .
although the foundation has only been officially in existence for a week , the international response to the request for funds has been positive . jacek kastenlaniec , the managing director of the auschwitz-birkenau foundation , told deutsche welle that germany has already pledged a million euros for the foundation , and plans to contribute much more next year .
" we have an official declaration of france that they will contribute to this endowment fund , " kastenlaniec added , " and two days ago -lrb- british prime minster -rrb- gordon brown said great britain would participate in this program . "
call for eu support the fundraising efforts of the foundation have also been put on the agenda of a european union summit set to take place in june .
despite the world-wide economic crisis , kastenlaniec says other countries have recognized the importance of the foundation 's goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for many it was a one-way journey but those who did return hope their suffering will never be forgotten " for sure , the economic crisis makes our task more difficult , " he says .
but the project was prepared before the start of the economic crisis , and we can not wait until -lrb- it -rrb- ends because the objects and the buildings will not wait .
it makes this operation more difficult , but observing the reactions , the authorities of different countries understand that this is a special situation . "
kastenlaniec is confident the foundation will reach its fundraising goal because of the role auschwitz plays in teaching future generations about the lessons of the past .
" i think this goal will be reached .
it ’ s not only the countries which were in the past responsible for what was happening there or the countries where there were deportations , but this is a project for future generations . ”
" this place helps young generations understand why we make so many efforts to live on a peaceful continent without conflicts and work out the consequences of hatred and anti semitism , " kastelaniec said .
long-term maintenance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year over a million visitors came to auschwitz and its musuem the site of the auschwitz-birkenau camp and the state-run museum covers nearly two square kilometres and includes many buildings and ruins from when the camp was operational .
if the foundation reaches its goal of 120 million euros , maintenance for the site will be secured for the future . " it 's about maintaining what 's already there , " said kastelaniec .
" around 155 buildings , 300 ruins and 100,000 items , like suitcases , shoes and other proof of the crimes committed . "
the polish government will continue to fund the museum at auschwitz-birkenau , but money to maintain the historical integrity of the site has come from different sources in the past . " right now , if we have problems with the conservation , " kastelaniec says " we have to look for funds in the budget of the museum or we have to go look for funds from the polish ministry of culture or european union programs . "
that system works , he says , and prevents major problems at the site , but the foundation is attempting to take a more long term approach to preserving auschwitz . " the foundation will -lrb- ensure -rrb- that the team of very professional conservators will have no problem working on the preservation of the buildings or ruins , including the ruins of the crematories , " kastelaniec said .
" it would guarantee the security of the future of -lrb- the camp -rrb- . "
notorious nazi death camp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wladyslaw bartoszewski , auschwitz survivor and founder of the auschwitz-birkenau foundation auschwitz-birkenau was one of the nazis ' most notorious concentration camps .
it operated from 1940 until 1945 , when it was liberated by the soviet union 's red army .
after world war ii , it was estimated that more than a million people died at auschwitz . most of the victims were european jews , but also included non-jewish poles , soviet prisoners of war , gypsies and anti-nazi resistance fighters .
some prisoners died in the camp 's gas chambers , others were worked or starved to death .
it was one of six german concentration camps in poland . the museum and preservation efforts of auschwitz have always been conducted in close contact with survivors of the camp .
they include wladyslaw bartoszewski , who was imprisoned at auschwitz in 1940 .
he ’ s now the founder of the auschwitz-birkenau foundation and a former foreign minister of poland . in a statement on the auschwitz-birkenau memorial and museum website , bartoszewski spoke about the importance of preservation . " we will save from forgetting what they wanted to destroy , " he said , referring to nazis who tried to cover up what had gone on at the concentration camps . he also referred to the lasting legacy of holocaust survivors as part of the reason for creating the foundation . " we , the survivors , are in our last active years .
that is why acknowledged european authorities , whose personal experiences are connected with that time , appealed to create a constant preservation tool for this place as well as for continuing educational and museum activities , " bartoszewski said . mz / sh , afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" up to now , there have been far too many perverse incentives in place in the financial services industry .
it is neither sensible nor sane that pay incentives encourage excessive risk-taking for short-term gain , " said eu internal market commissioner charlie mccreevy while unveiling his proposals .
according to the commissioner , managers ' salaries should reflect " sound and effective risk management " rather than short-term gains , while the payment of bonuses should be linked to the long-term performance of the company .
moreover , a company 's remuneration policy should be " adequately disclosed to stakeholders " and properly supervised .
finally , banks should be allowed to claw back bonuses paid on the basis of data " which proved to be manifestly misstated , " officials in brussels said in a statement .
undeserved bonuses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccreevy wants to clamp down on golden parachutes " our message is very clear : directors ' remuneration must be clearly linked to performance and not rewards for failure , " mccreevy said .

wednesday 's proposed directive on bringing hedge funds under greater supervisory scrutiny would be binding if it were approved by both the european parliament and the finance ministers of the eu 's 27 member states .
pros and cons commission officials said alternative investment fund managers -lrb- aifm -rrb- , which include the managers of hedge funds and private equity funds , controlled around 2 trillion euros -lrb- $ 2.65 trillion -rrb- in assets in the eu at the end of 2008 .

the moves were prompted by the global financial crisis , which has in part been blamed on short-term profit-taking and lax financial regulation .
the proposals are part of a push by the eu to increase financial regulation in a bid to bring confidence back to financial markets .
" up to now , there have been far too many perverse incentives in place in the financial services industry .
it is neither sensible nor sane that pay incentives encourage excessive risk-taking for short-term gain , " said eu internal market commissioner charlie mccreevy while unveiling his proposals .
according to the commissioner , managers ' salaries should reflect " sound and effective risk management " rather than short-term gains , while the payment of bonuses should be linked to the long-term performance of the company .
moreover , a company 's remuneration policy should be " adequately disclosed to stakeholders " and properly supervised .
finally , banks should be allowed to claw back bonuses paid on the basis of data " which proved to be manifestly misstated , " officials in brussels said in a statement .
undeserved bonuses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccreevy wants to clamp down on golden parachutes " our message is very clear : directors ' remuneration must be clearly linked to performance and not rewards for failure , " mccreevy said .
data published by the commission in march showed that many of europe 's chief executive officers enjoyed ballooning salaries between 2003 and 2007 , with average bonuses surging from an equivalent of 70 percent of their base salaries to 151 percent .
in issuing his recommendations , mccreevy also urged financial firms to limit the benefits they pay to fired executives - the so-called " golden parachutes " - to no more than double their basic salary .
severance pay should be banned in case of failure .
the guidelines are non-binding , but mccreevy said at least some of them could be incorporated in the commission 's revised capital requirements directive , due to be unveiled in june .
wednesday 's proposed directive on bringing hedge funds under greater supervisory scrutiny would be binding if it were approved by both the european parliament and the finance ministers of the eu 's 27 member states .
pros and cons commission officials said alternative investment fund managers -lrb- aifm -rrb- , which include the managers of hedge funds and private equity funds , controlled around 2 trillion euros -lrb- $ 2.65 trillion -rrb- in assets in the eu at the end of 2008 .
the bulk of aifms are based in london , and wednesday 's proposal is seen as a compromise between the hard-line stance of countries such as germany and france , and that of countries such as britain , which argue that stricter regulation could drive financial firms away from europe .
the proposal disappointed advocates of tighter regulation , such as poul nyrup rasmussen , head of the party of european socialists , who described the directive as having " more holes than a swiss cheese . "
mccreevy acknowledged divisions , saying " for some , these proposals go too far , for others they do not go far enough . "
wednesday 's proposals take into account recent discussions held in london by the leaders of the world 's 20 most powerful nations .
european commission president jose manuel barroso said the eu was leading the way in the global drive to prevent further financial crises from occurring .

shareholders of hre have until monday to sell their stock to the government for a total of 290 million euros .
the flowers company said on thursday that it now expects to mount a legal challenge to the bank 's nationalisation .
german finance minister peer steinbrueck vowed that the goverment would simply nationalize hre if flowers & co refuses to accept the government 's share-price offer , which steinbrueck described as " very fair " .
hre became the most prominent german victim of the global credit crisis last september after its ireland-based unit depfa bank failed to find short-term funding .
since then the german government has shored up troubled hre with loan guarantees and cash injections totalling 102 billion euros .
the german government has passed temporary legislation to nationalize hre if a voluntary sale fails .
berlin owns around 9 percent of hre and jc flowers and allies are believed to hold around 22 percent of the company .
the rest of the shares are in the hands of private and institutional investors . ml , rm dpa / ap / reuters / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the statement was attributed to jana rihova , spokeswoman for the czech labor and social affairs ministry . the european commission confirmed that belgium and denmark would scrap remaining curbs from may 1 for job seekers from the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , poland , slovakia and slovenia , all of which joined the eu in 2004 .
all other eu countries - except germany and austria - have already lifted the labor restrictions imposed on the 2004 newcomers . meanwhile , citizens of bulgaria and romania , which joined the eu in 2007 , continue to face restrictions in the older member states except finland and sweden .
the measures were originally meant to ease the concerns of unions in older member states , which feared that cheap workers would flood their labor markets . all temporary labor restrictions are due to be phased out by the end of 2013 . ad / sh , ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" nato has ordered the expulsion of two diplomats from the russian mission in brussels , in connection with a spying scandal in which a former estonian official passed alliance secrets to moscow , a diplomat in the alliance told afp news service .
" i can confirm it , " one diplomat told afp when asked about reports that the two had been ordered to leave .
russia : move is a ' crude provocation ' in response , the russian foreign ministry in moscow said the move was a " crude provocation " made on " an absolutely trumped up pretext . "
" this outrageous action fundamentally contradicts statements by nato 's leadership on its readiness to normalize ties with russia , " the russian ministry said .
just one day earlier nato and russia resumed official relations after an eight-month freeze tied to the russian-georgia war last august .
diplomats from the two sides met in brussels on wednesday .
on thursday , however , came the expulsions .
one nato diplomat told afp that the two expelled russian officials included a russian political counsellor and a son of vladimir chizhov , russia 's ambassador to the european union .
" our understanding is that this has been part of an investigation that has been going on for some time , " concerning the estonian spy scandal , the diplomat said .
estonian is jailed former estonian defense ministry official herman simm was arrested last september in a case which has proved deeply embarrassing for estonia after suggestions that nato secrets may have been leaked to russia .
simm was on the defense ministry staff between 1995 and 2006 , before being transferred to an adviser 's post until march 2008 .
estonia , a soviet-ruled republic until 1991 , joined nato and the european union in 2004 . relations with its powerful neighbor are rocky .

the statement was attributed to jana rihova , spokeswoman for the czech labor and social affairs ministry . the european commission confirmed that belgium and denmark would scrap remaining curbs from may 1 for job seekers from the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , poland , slovakia and slovenia , all of which joined the eu in 2004 .
all other eu countries - except germany and austria - have already lifted the labor restrictions imposed on the 2004 newcomers . meanwhile , citizens of bulgaria and romania , which joined the eu in 2007 , continue to face restrictions in the older member states except finland and sweden .
the measures were originally meant to ease the concerns of unions in older member states , which feared that cheap workers would flood their labor markets . all temporary labor restrictions are due to be phased out by the end of 2013 . ad / sh , ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german chancellor angela merkel gave obama good marks for his time in office . " in many areas a new course was set very assertively , " merkel said in berlin .
" i 'm full of hope .
it was a very intensive 100 days . " merkel said the obama administration had reacted firmly to the economic crisis " and in my consideration done everything that one can to apply countermeasures .

" i am pleased with our progress but i am not satisfied , " he said in a press conference at the white house .
" millions of americans are still without jobs and homes , and more will be lost before this recession is over . " obama 's remarks came after government figures showed the us economy shrank 6.1 percent in the first quarter of this year , though the federal reserve touted signs that the outlook had " improved modestly " over the past few weeks . obama asked for " patience " from the public and also reiterated his long-running theme that the country had to build a " new foundation for growth " in the coming years that was less reliant on debt and lax regulations of financial institutions . " even as we clear away the wreckage of this recession ... we ca n't go back to an economy that is built on a pile of sand , " obama said . the global economy has largely been brought down by excessive risks taken in financial sectors , especially in the us housing market that began folding in mid-2006 . obama said he expected far-reaching reforms on how wall street is regulated to be adopted by the end of the year . pakistan instability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pakistani military has been unable to drive out the taliban obama spoke at length on most major foreign and domestic issues affecting the us , including the situation in pakistan , whose government is struggling to contain the growing taliban insurgency . obama said the pakistani government lacked the ability to provide basic services for its people and promised the us would do all it could to build up its institutions . " i am gravely concerned about the situation in pakistan , " obama said .
" the civilian government there right now is very fragile . " despite the fears , obama said he was confident the us could help ensure that pakistan 's nuclear weapons capability did not fall into the hands of extremists . " i 'm confident that we can make sure that pakistan 's nuclear arsenal is secure , " obama said . dfm , rm dpa / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" nato has ordered the expulsion of two diplomats from the russian mission in brussels , in connection with a spying scandal in which a former estonian official passed alliance secrets to moscow , a diplomat in the alliance told afp news service .
" i can confirm it , " one diplomat told afp when asked about reports that the two had been ordered to leave .
russia : move is a ' crude provocation ' in response , the russian foreign ministry in moscow said the move was a " crude provocation " made on " an absolutely trumped up pretext . "

just one day earlier nato and russia resumed official relations after an eight-month freeze tied to the russian-georgia war last august .
diplomats from the two sides met in brussels on wednesday .
on thursday , however , came the expulsions .
one nato diplomat told afp that the two expelled russian officials included a russian political counsellor and a son of vladimir chizhov , russia 's ambassador to the european union .
" our understanding is that this has been part of an investigation that has been going on for some time , " concerning the estonian spy scandal , the diplomat said .

estonia , a soviet-ruled republic until 1991 , joined nato and the european union in 2004 . relations with its powerful neighbor are rocky .

as one of the shareholders , dw took charge of the selection and adaptation of the programs , as well as the acquisition of foreign rights .
from 1983 , dw began producing television programs on its own .
in 1998 , transtel was closed down and its tasks were fully integrated into dw but the brand dw-transtel remained .

are the demonstrations peaceful or is there a violent revolution taking place ?
the worldwide competition for opinions is about terms , their meaning and the constant presence in the media .
the number of national and international information providers keeps growing .
arabic , chinese or russian broadcasters have broken through the west ’ s former dominance and are providing another perspective to the world .
what some may call a fairly-won election , others call a fraud .
in the battle to win opinions and the struggle of interpretive predominance , deutsche welle presents the german perspective on worldwide events .
how is the worldwide financial crisis , the middle east conflict and the fight for a european constitution discussed in germany ?
how does the country work ?
its democracy , its rule of law , its social market economy ?
this is what deutsche welle delivers – smart , up-to-date and with all the necessary background information .
it stands behind independent journalism as that is the only way to ensure credibility . from “ détente ” to intercultural dialogue when deutsche welle was first launched on may 3 , 1953 , the then german president theodor heuss said the task of germany ’ s international radio was to promote “ détente ” .
now , 60 years after the founding of the federal republic of germany and 20 years after the fall of the berlin wall and the east-west conflict , “ détente ” has given way to intercultural dialogue .
over the years , deutsche welle gained a reputation as “ the voice of freedom ” – from the 1968 “ prague spring ” and the era of dictatorship in greece to the wars in the balkans and in chechnya to the current trouble spots in afghanistan and iraq .
this is now being replaced by its growing standing as the “ voice of human rights ” . working with multimedia radio programming and online content is available in 30 languages : albanian , amharic , arabic , bengali , bulgarian , bosnian , chinese , croatian , dari , english , farsi , french , german , greek , hausa , hindi , indonesian , kiswahili , macedonian , pashtu , polish , portuguese -lrb- for africa and brazil -rrb- , romanian , russian , serbian , spanish , turkish , ukrainian and urdu .
in the course of digitalization and media convergence , deutsche welle began merging the radio and online departments in 2008 to create one multimedia team for each language .
the broadcasting center in bonn thus hosts many editorial teams that produce content for radio as well as for the multimedia website www.dw-world.de.
the internet is an interactive medium and plays an important role when it comes to intercultural dialogue .
communication is two-way and the user ’ s opinion is in demand – via e-mail , in forums or surveys .
there is also a wide variety of newsletters available free of charge .
deutsche welle is one of the leaders on the internet when it comes to audio and video content .
programming from dw-tv and dw-radio is available around the clock as a live stream or in the online archive .
even older programs can be accessed at any time .

usually he gets a steady stream of drop-in customers all day .
but for the last four days , revenues have halved .
" not many people want to come into the shop " , he says .
" they are afraid .
they ask us to pick up their packages from their homes " .
his experience is one of millions in this huge bustling city .
a minuscule virus has transformed the capital .
what was once one of the noisiest , dirtiest , busiest places in the world , has become strangely sterile - a quiet city , where many people wear masks outdoors , and most do n't go out .
this mutation is costing a fortune .
in mexico city alone , the mayor , marcelo ebrard , has put the figure at $ 88m -lrb- £ 59m -rrb- a day .
but how much will swine flu hit the wider mexican economy ?
tourism , which represents 8 % of mexico 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , is the sector which will inevitably be hardest hit .
in the current environment , most people see little incentive to visit mexico , and plenty of reason to leave .
the mexican government has lobbied hard behind the scenes to prevent its borders being closed , or any formal quarantine being imposed .
but other governments and airlines are beginning to apply their own restrictions .
job losses cuba and argentina have already stopped direct flights to mexico .
france is seeking a formal european ban on flights .
the real cost of swine flu depends on how long this crisis lasts . "
it looks like swine flu will at best postpone a recovery to the second half of the year " damian fraser ubs ubs bank in mexico city estimates the crisis could take out 0.2 % of annual gdp if it subsides in the next two weeks , or 0.8 % of gdp if it goes on for two months .
the timing could hardly be worse .
mexico is already in the midst of a complex and disruptive drug war , and is being hit hard by the global recession .
not even taking swine flu into account , mexico 's central bank forecasts a fall in gdp of up to 4.8 % this year .
" the hope was that the economy would stabilise in the second quarter and then improve , but it looks like swine flu will at best postpone a recovery to the second half of the year " says damian fraser , latin america equity strategist at ubs .
another concern is how far the swine flu might hit the us economy .
mexico sends 80 % of its exports to the united states , and in the event the virus has economic repercussions there , matters will only get worse here .
unemployment could be the most striking consequence .
mexican economist rogelio ramires - from consultancy firm ecanal - believes that a crisis lasting several weeks , together with a prolonged us recession , could result in one in every eight mexicans losing their jobs .
" we are looking at a very dramatic fall " , he says .
globalisation has enabled this new virus to be spread around the world with extraordinary speed .
any sharp decline in the mexican economy will be equally far felt .

usually he gets a steady stream of drop-in customers all day .
but for the last four days , revenues have halved .
" not many people want to come into the shop " , he says .
" they are afraid .
they ask us to pick up their packages from their homes " .
his experience is one of millions in this huge bustling city .
a minuscule virus has transformed the capital .
what was once one of the noisiest , dirtiest , busiest places in the world , has become strangely sterile - a quiet city , where many people wear masks outdoors , and most do n't go out .
this mutation is costing a fortune .
in mexico city alone , the mayor , marcelo ebrard , has put the figure at $ 88m -lrb- £ 59m -rrb- a day .
but how much will swine flu hit the wider mexican economy ?
tourism , which represents 8 % of mexico 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , is the sector which will inevitably be hardest hit .
in the current environment , most people see little incentive to visit mexico , and plenty of reason to leave .
the mexican government has lobbied hard behind the scenes to prevent its borders being closed , or any formal quarantine being imposed .
but other governments and airlines are beginning to apply their own restrictions .
job losses cuba and argentina have already stopped direct flights to mexico .
france is seeking a formal european ban on flights .
the real cost of swine flu depends on how long this crisis lasts .
it looks like swine flu will at best postpone a recovery to the second half of the year damian fraser ubs ubs bank in mexico city estimates the crisis could take out 0.2 % of annual gdp if it subsides in the next two weeks , or 0.8 % of gdp if it goes on for two months .
the timing could hardly be worse .
mexico is already in the midst of a complex and disruptive drug war , and is being hit hard by the global recession .
not even taking swine flu into account , mexico 's central bank forecasts a fall in gdp of up to 4.8 % this year .
" the hope was that the economy would stabilise in the second quarter and then improve , but it looks like swine flu will at best postpone a recovery to the second half of the year " says damian fraser , latin america equity strategist at ubs .
another concern is how far the swine flu might hit the us economy .
mexico sends 80 % of its exports to the united states , and in the event the virus has economic repercussions there , matters will only get worse here .
unemployment could be the most striking consequence .
mexican economist rogelio ramires - from consultancy firm ecanal - believes that a crisis lasting several weeks , together with a prolonged us recession , could result in one in every eight mexicans losing their jobs .
" we are looking at a very dramatic fall " , he says .
globalisation has enabled this new virus to be spread around the world with extraordinary speed .
any sharp decline in the mexican economy will be equally far felt .

usually he gets a steady stream of drop-in customers all day .
but for the last four days , revenues have halved .
" not many people want to come into the shop " , he says .
" they are afraid .
they ask us to pick up their packages from their homes " .
his experience is one of millions in this huge bustling city .
a minuscule virus has transformed the capital .
what was once one of the noisiest , dirtiest , busiest places in the world , has become strangely sterile - a quiet city , where many people wear masks outdoors , and most do n't go out .
this mutation is costing a fortune .
in mexico city alone , the mayor , marcelo ebrard , has put the figure at $ 88m -lrb- £ 59m -rrb- a day .
but how much will swine flu hit the wider mexican economy ?
tourism , which represents 8 % of mexico 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , is the sector which will inevitably be hardest hit .
in the current environment , most people see little incentive to visit mexico , and plenty of reason to leave .
the mexican government has lobbied hard behind the scenes to prevent its borders being closed , or any formal quarantine being imposed .
but other governments and airlines are beginning to apply their own restrictions .
job losses cuba and argentina have already stopped direct flights to mexico .
france is seeking a formal european ban on flights .
the real cost of swine flu depends on how long this crisis lasts .
it looks like swine flu will at best postpone a recovery to the second half of the year damian fraser ubs ubs bank in mexico city estimates the crisis could take out 0.2 % of annual gdp if it subsides in the next two weeks , or 0.8 % of gdp if it goes on for two months .
the timing could hardly be worse .
mexico is already in the midst of a complex and disruptive drug war , and is being hit hard by the global recession .
not even taking swine flu into account , mexico 's central bank forecasts a fall in gdp of up to 4.8 % this year .
" the hope was that the economy would stabilise in the second quarter and then improve , but it looks like swine flu will at best postpone a recovery to the second half of the year " says damian fraser , latin america equity strategist at ubs .
another concern is how far the swine flu might hit the us economy .
mexico sends 80 % of its exports to the united states , and in the event the virus has economic repercussions there , matters will only get worse here .
unemployment could be the most striking consequence .
mexican economist rogelio ramires - from consultancy firm ecanal - believes that a crisis lasting several weeks , together with a prolonged us recession , could result in one in every eight mexicans losing their jobs .
" we are looking at a very dramatic fall " , he says .
globalisation has enabled this new virus to be spread around the world with extraordinary speed .
any sharp decline in the mexican economy will be equally far felt .
