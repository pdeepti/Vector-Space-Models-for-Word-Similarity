civil society groups have been campaigning to bring the issue to the notice of the mekong river governments , asking them to scrap the plans . the 11 dams along the lower mekong river are planned for laos , cambodia and the thai-lao border .
the hydropower generated by them is to meet the increasing demand for electricity across the region .
the 4,800 kilometre mekong river flows from the tibetan plateau through southern china and myanmar before reaching the mekong basin and eventually flowing to the south china sea through southern vietnam .
problems for food security civil society groups groups point to the threat to fish stocks , water access and general food security for the millions of people living in the region if the hydropower dam developments go ahead .
premrudee daoroung is a co-director of the bangkok-based group ' towards ecological recovery and regional alliance ' -lrb- terra -rrb- .
she says because several dams are planned the situation is vastly more complicated than earlier campaigns to halt damming on the mekong .
" compared with the past 20 years , the situation has become pretty critical now – a lot more difficult – in terms of the figures of the dams , because they are not one country ’ s dams anymore .
we have to consider the cross-border issues .
the main reason for our campaign right now is to save the mekong as a whole – which is not comparable to the past . "
postcard campaign civil society groups have combined efforts to present the case to regional governments .
through a postcard petition campaign more than 16,000 people have signed on urging the prime ministers of cambodia , laos , thailand and vietnam to put a stop to the developments .
thai prime minister abhisit vejjajiva said the issue should be raised with the association of south east asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- .
carl middleton from the environmental group ' international rivers ' , says there is now a greater understanding of both the importance of the fishing industry and the wider social impact if the dams go ahead .
" compared to when these dams were first conceived the world ’ s moved on – hydropower is last century ’ s technology .
so these projects in the past , they were stopped by various reasons , including the high environmental and social impact .
but the fact is now there are far better options to meeting energy needs in the region . "
threatening endangered species middleton says the hydropower projects would affect the more than 50 species of migratory fish in one the world ’ s most productive inland fisheries .
the dams would also threaten several endangered species such as the irrawaddy dolphin and the mekong giant catfish .
downstream in vietnam ’ s delta region , agronomists fear the dams will drastically affect the country ’ s rice growing bowl , limiting fresh water flows and leading to more sea water flowing inland .
as a result , soil acidity would increase destroying rice fields and affecting the lives of 17 million people .
the groups have also called for greater action by the mekong river commission or mrc - to take a stronger stance over future developments that affect the river , the lifeblood for so many in the region .

civil society groups have been campaigning to bring the issue to the notice of the mekong river governments , asking them to scrap the plans . the 11 dams along the lower mekong river are planned for laos , cambodia and the thai-lao border .
the hydropower generated by them is to meet the increasing demand for electricity across the region .
the 4,800 kilometre mekong river flows from the tibetan plateau through southern china and myanmar before reaching the mekong basin and eventually flowing to the south china sea through southern vietnam .
problems for food security civil society groups groups point to the threat to fish stocks , water access and general food security for the millions of people living in the region if the hydropower dam developments go ahead .
premrudee daoroung is a co-director of the bangkok-based group ' towards ecological recovery and regional alliance ' -lrb- terra -rrb- .
she says because several dams are planned the situation is vastly more complicated than earlier campaigns to halt damming on the mekong .
" compared with the past 20 years , the situation has become pretty critical now – a lot more difficult – in terms of the figures of the dams , because they are not one country ’ s dams anymore .
we have to consider the cross-border issues .
the main reason for our campaign right now is to save the mekong as a whole – which is not comparable to the past . "
postcard campaign civil society groups have combined efforts to present the case to regional governments .
through a postcard petition campaign more than 16,000 people have signed on urging the prime ministers of cambodia , laos , thailand and vietnam to put a stop to the developments .
thai prime minister abhisit vejjajiva said the issue should be raised with the association of south east asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- .
carl middleton from the environmental group ' international rivers ' , says there is now a greater understanding of both the importance of the fishing industry and the wider social impact if the dams go ahead .
" compared to when these dams were first conceived the world ’ s moved on – hydropower is last century ’ s technology .
so these projects in the past , they were stopped by various reasons , including the high environmental and social impact .
but the fact is now there are far better options to meeting energy needs in the region . "
threatening endangered species middleton says the hydropower projects would affect the more than 50 species of migratory fish in one the world ’ s most productive inland fisheries .
the dams would also threaten several endangered species such as the irrawaddy dolphin and the mekong giant catfish .
downstream in vietnam ’ s delta region , agronomists fear the dams will drastically affect the country ’ s rice growing bowl , limiting fresh water flows and leading to more sea water flowing inland .
as a result , soil acidity would increase destroying rice fields and affecting the lives of 17 million people .

the decision was announced friday at the world heritage committee 's annual meeting in seville , spain . germany and the netherlands registered the wadden sea , a tidal wetlands area on their northern coasts , as a contender for the unesco world heritage title at the beginning of 2008 . friday 's announcement makes the nature reserve the first one in germany to be awarded the status .
recently , the wadden sea has been under threat due to the constant flow of shipping traffic and plans for oil and gas drilling .
there is also concern about the effect climate change could have on the area .
visited by thousands of tourists every year , the wadden sea spans more than 10,000 kilometers and borders three countries in total : the netherlands , germany , and denmark .
visitors flock there year-round to enjoy the endless expanse of shallow mud flats , caught between land and sea , and its diverse wildlife .
under protection in 1985 , germany officially declared the wadden sea tidal flats a nature reserve and national park .
parts of it have also been protected under national park status in the netherlands .
environmentalists fear for the wadden sea 's future though as plans to deepen the elbe river , which borders the wadden sea , to accomodate ships en route to the hamburg harbor could have a damaging effect on the nature reserve .
many different species make their home there , including seals , and an estimated 1.5 million birds descend on the wadden sea for food during migratory seasons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wadden sea is home to many different species there has also been concern about the oil and gas drilling platforms planted in the middle of the park . in the german state of schleswig-holstein , it is legal to drill for oil in national parks , however , it goes against the rules of the unesco world heritage committee .
in order to get around a potential barrier to receiving the title , germany and the netherlands cut out the sections of the park used for drilling in their application . there are also long-term concerns about the effect climate change will have on the wetlands , as rising sea levels could cause the area to slowly erode over time .
a unesco world heritage title is the highest honor yet for the wadden sea and advocates say it will help to ensure its conservation . germany boasts a long list of unesco world heritage sites in addition to the wadden sea , including the hanseatic city of lübeck , the cologne cathedral , and the messel pit , one of the world 's most improtant sites for fossils . the unesco world heritage committee will announce their final decision on all new entries by the end of the conference on june 30th. vj dpa / afp / kna editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 26.06.2009 erdogan criticizes germany , france for blocking turkey 's eu bid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany and france have been vocal in their opposition to turkey 's eu membership during a visit to brussels to revive ankara 's deadlocked eu accession talks , turkish premier erdogan slammed germany and france for opposing full eu membership for his predominantly muslim country . turkish prime minster recep tayyip erdogan on friday accused germany and france of stalling its european union membership bid by offering ankara a " privileged partnership " rather than full membership .
" turkey can not accept the position of germany and france .
a privileged partnership does n't exist in -lrb- european law -rrb- , " erdogan told journalists before attending a forum in brussels , adding that turkey 's goal is full membership and any alternative " is out of the question . "
erdogan said french president nicolas sarkozy had been inconsistent , showing more openness to turkey 's accession in private talks than in public .
" our european friends unfortunately have a unilateral expectation which is rather populist and it saddens us .
i hope we will overcome this , " he said .
ankara launches diplomatic drive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan , left , faces an uphill battle on turkey 's eu entry bid turkey has mounted a diplomatic offensive aimed at boosting its chances of joining the eu , with erdogan visiting brussels twice in the span of three months .
in addition , his foreign minister , ahmet devutoglu , was also in brussels on friday to meet the eu enlargement commissioner , olli rehn , ahead of an accession conference planned for next week .
turkey 's membership was also a campaign issue in this month 's european parliament election , with some right-wing parties making gains after opposing its accession .
" some narrow-minded politicians have used turkey as election material , and we believe this to be very wrong and very populist , " erdogan said .
" we will never give up .
we are patient , we do our homework ... and we continue moving forward . "
changing the constitution erdogan 's comments come just a day after he had told journalists that plans to change the turkish constitution , key to keeping turkey 's bid for eu membership on track , are a " waste of time " as long as opposition parties keep blocking all efforts in parliament . erdogan 's comments were the clearest sign yet that his government could ditch its long standing goal of joining the 27-nation bloc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most europeans oppose turkey 's entry bid because it is a moslem country , poor , and situated mostly in asia erdogan promised after march local elections to renew efforts to revamp the 1982 constitution , drawn up under military rule , which would go a long way towards removing one of the major obstacles in ankara 's eu path . " all parties should be involved in efforts to reform the constitution , but the main opposition party rejects and blocks all efforts .

" turkey can not accept the position of germany and france .
a privileged partnership does n't exist in -lrb- european law -rrb- , " erdogan told journalists before attending a forum in brussels , adding that turkey 's goal is full membership and any alternative " is out of the question . "
erdogan said french president nicolas sarkozy had been inconsistent , showing more openness to turkey 's accession in private talks than in public .
" our european friends unfortunately have a unilateral expectation which is rather populist and it saddens us .
i hope we will overcome this , " he said .
ankara launches diplomatic drive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan , left , faces an uphill battle on turkey 's eu entry bid turkey has mounted a diplomatic offensive aimed at boosting its chances of joining the eu , with erdogan visiting brussels twice in the span of three months .
in addition , his foreign minister , ahmet devutoglu , was also in brussels on friday to meet the eu enlargement commissioner , olli rehn , ahead of an accession conference planned for next week .
turkey 's membership was also a campaign issue in this month 's european parliament election , with some right-wing parties making gains after opposing its accession .
" some narrow-minded politicians have used turkey as election material , and we believe this to be very wrong and very populist , " erdogan said .
" we will never give up .
we are patient , we do our homework ... and we continue moving forward . "
changing the constitution erdogan 's comments come just a day after he had told journalists that plans to change the turkish constitution , key to keeping turkey 's bid for eu membership on track , are a " waste of time " as long as opposition parties keep blocking all efforts in parliament . erdogan 's comments were the clearest sign yet that his government could ditch its long standing goal of joining the 27-nation bloc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most europeans oppose turkey 's entry bid because it is a moslem country , poor , and situated mostly in asia erdogan promised after march local elections to renew efforts to revamp the 1982 constitution , drawn up under military rule , which would go a long way towards removing one of the major obstacles in ankara 's eu path . " all parties should be involved in efforts to reform the constitution , but the main opposition party rejects and blocks all efforts .
so as long as we are faced with such an approach these efforts are nothing but a waste of time .
we will have to continue with the present constitution , " erdogan said . sweden supports turkey 's eu bid the eu wants turkey to speed up political and economic reforms , including the removal of curbs on free speech , ensuring more rights for minorities and reducing the influence of the armed forces in government affairs .

her biggest wish is for something that many people take for granted : sleep .
" during the day , i can distract myself , " she said .
" but at night , i have problems sleeping , and nightmares .

petek , now 38 , was 18 when she began her university studies in her hometown of izmir in western turkey .
she wanted to become a journalist , and wrote articles for student organizations criticizing an increase of repression and the authoritarian approach of the turkish government .
she was sent to jail three times for her writing after being convicted or being a member in a forbidden organization .
her most recent imprisonment was from 1994-2002 , but even seven years later , it churns up too many memories for her to talk about .
since her time in a turkish prison , the situation of prisoners there has improved somewhat , she said , but people are still being tortured .

" the people are faced with a dilemma : either they betray their organization or they have to watch as their wives , mothers , or sisters are raped . "
petek is one of many former torture victims who come to the therapy center for help .
the demand on the center 's services is so high that there is often a waiting list .
when she first arrived in germany with her husband in 2004 , petek was told she 'd have to wait one to two years to be admitted .

that 's why i 'm here , and i 'm very happy about that . "

her biggest wish is for something that many people take for granted : sleep .
" during the day , i can distract myself , " she said .
" but at night , i have problems sleeping , and nightmares .

petek , now 38 , was 18 when she began her university studies in her hometown of izmir in western turkey .
she wanted to become a journalist , and wrote articles for student organizations criticizing an increase of repression and the authoritarian approach of the turkish government .
she was sent to jail three times for her writing after being convicted or being a member in a forbidden organization .
her most recent imprisonment was from 1994-2002 , but even seven years later , it churns up too many memories for her to talk about .

hamidye said torture methods are becoming increasingly psychological , and often leave behind no physical marks .

petek is one of many former torture victims who come to the therapy center for help .
the demand on the center 's services is so high that there is often a waiting list .

guest commentator susanne neubert says that we have a global responsibility to counter soil degradation and there 's no time to lose . some 70 percent of the world 's arid regions face desertification , and in around 110 countries - most of them poor - desertification threatens an area roughly the size of europe . twenty million tons of grain are lost annually due to desertification and , over the past 40 years , one third of the world 's arable land has been abandoned . even though there is no doubt about the causes of desertification , and the strategies needed to combat it are known , no turnaround is yet in sight .
why is it that neither the un desertification convention nor countless initiatives and programs have managed to halt the ongoing process of desertification ? unsustainable land management bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in many regions water for irrigation is not readily available the principal factors behind desertification are unsustainable land management and climate change .
as far as land management is concerned , incorrect farming practices also play a major role .
these include the cultivation of annual crop species , coupled with management methods that intermittently leave soils uncovered and exposed to erosion . other aspects of " incorrect " farming practices include faulty irrigation and either a total lack of fertilization or lopsided use of mineral fertilisers .
this often leads to soil mineralization , particularly in tropical regions , depriving soils of their capacity to store water .
carbon compounds , previously fixed in the soil in the form of organic matter , are released into the air in the course of the mineralization process .
this reduces the soil 's buffering capacity for drought and flooding , at the same time directly contributing to climate change . a good number of resource problems are closely interlinked : together , deforestation , species loss , climate change , growing scarcity of water resources , and the loss of organic matter in soils are responsible for desertification ; they are both its cause and effect . does this mean that we have no choice but to capitulate ?
no .
what it means is that by developing and using intelligent approaches we can achieve several goals at once .
soil conservation techniques , including erosion control walls , agro-forestry , and organic fertilization , are methods that are both effective and widely known - and these need to be applied on a larger scale . the reason why the picture continues to be dominated by individual measures is not technical in nature , indeed this must be seen as a problem bound up with economic incentives and political interests . incentives to support farmers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protecting trees can counter soil degradation since agriculture is organized primarily along private lines , soil conservation measures need to be carried out mainly by the private sector .
it is essential that incentives be set to ensure that investments in farmland yield returns , and the relatively high prices currently commanded by agricultural goods offer a good opportunity . there is considerable evidence that farmers carry out soil protection measures on their own if they lack more profitable alternatives and if the know-how and cost viability are available .
there is no lack of instructive examples , and german development cooperation offers a good number of them .
it is high time to start providing farmers in desertification-prone regions with appropriate advisory services as well as with the funds they need to transport stones to build erosion control walls , etc . , and to do so not intermittently but as a general rule . however , both agro-industry and institutional conditions also need to be modernized .
one correct and promising approach would be to encourage the agrochemical industry to gear production more to soil substrate additives . moreover , the agricultural policies of developing countries urgently need to be reoriented to reduce the fertilizer subsidies so widespread today and instead to increase the credit available in the agricultural sector .
and land rights need to be modified in such a way as to ensure that farmers have incentives to undertake soil conservation measures . no time to lose bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : modernizing the agro industry is vital in coutering the impact of climate change instead of continuing to generate vast amounts of greenhouse gases by producing and using mineral fertilizers incapable of achieving the hoped-for results on degraded soils , it would make far more sense to engage in organic agriculture keyed chiefly to on-farm resources .
this could serve to enhance soil storage capacity and - in cases where the needed organic matter is unavailable - to regenerate it by using industrially produced soil substrates .
land management of this kind tends to raise yields per unit area to earlier levels , and to do so precisely in arid regions . but is also essential to protect land at the supra-farm level , on state-owned land .
this , though , calls for a huge supply of labor .
in keeping with a proposal advanced by the united nations environment program -lrb- unep -rrb- , a " global green new deal " could be used to realize the action plans adopted to implement the un desertification convention , and in times of recession this would at the same time amount to an effective labor market policy . this should also include large-scale projects - like the building of " green walls " in china and the sahel belt - and efforts to link them with the numerous individual participatory measures already in progress , in order to achieve synergy effects . it would be important to implement measures geared at once to conservation and re-cultivation in order to come up with comprehensive measures that serve to reach several goals at the same time : protection of forests , water , climate , and soils .
this is a realistic aim in that the different organizational phases involved basically tend to correlate positively with one another . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neubert says that desertification is partly reversible how much time do we have left ?
the good news is that in many cases desertification is reversible .
the bad new is that this goes hand in hand with declining marginal utility , and when a certain stage of degradation has been reached , re-cultivation proves so labor-intensive that it is more attractive for the population to migrate to urban areas .
in other words , we have no time to lose .
this is not a question of " aid " but of global responsibility . author : dr.susanne neubert / -lrb- ara -rrb- editor : kate bowen dr. susanne neubert is a senior researcher at the german development institute -lrb- deutsches institut für entwicklungspolitik - die -rrb- , which is a multi-disciplinary think-tank for german and multilateral development policy .

soil conservation techniques , including erosion control walls , agro-forestry , and organic fertilization , are methods that are both effective and widely known - and these need to be applied on a larger scale . the reason why the picture continues to be dominated by individual measures is not technical in nature , indeed this must be seen as a problem bound up with economic incentives and political interests . incentives to support farmers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protecting trees can counter soil degradation since agriculture is organized primarily along private lines , soil conservation measures need to be carried out mainly by the private sector .
it is essential that incentives be set to ensure that investments in farmland yield returns , and the relatively high prices currently commanded by agricultural goods offer a good opportunity . there is considerable evidence that farmers carry out soil protection measures on their own if they lack more profitable alternatives and if the know-how and cost viability are available .
there is no lack of instructive examples , and german development cooperation offers a good number of them .
it is high time to start providing farmers in desertification-prone regions with appropriate advisory services as well as with the funds they need to transport stones to build erosion control walls , etc . , and to do so not intermittently but as a general rule . however , both agro-industry and institutional conditions also need to be modernized .
one correct and promising approach would be to encourage the agrochemical industry to gear production more to soil substrate additives . moreover , the agricultural policies of developing countries urgently need to be reoriented to reduce the fertilizer subsidies so widespread today and instead to increase the credit available in the agricultural sector .

this could serve to enhance soil storage capacity and - in cases where the needed organic matter is unavailable - to regenerate it by using industrially produced soil substrates .
land management of this kind tends to raise yields per unit area to earlier levels , and to do so precisely in arid regions . but is also essential to protect land at the supra-farm level , on state-owned land .

guest commentator susanne neubert says that we have a global responsibility to counter soil degradation and there 's no time to lose . some 70 percent of the world 's arid regions face desertification , and in around 110 countries - most of them poor - desertification threatens an area roughly the size of europe . twenty million tons of grain are lost annually due to desertification and , over the past 40 years , one third of the world 's arable land has been abandoned . even though there is no doubt about the causes of desertification , and the strategies needed to combat it are known , no turnaround is yet in sight .
why is it that neither the un desertification convention nor countless initiatives and programs have managed to halt the ongoing process of desertification ? unsustainable land management bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in many regions water for irrigation is not readily available the principal factors behind desertification are unsustainable land management and climate change .
as far as land management is concerned , incorrect farming practices also play a major role .
these include the cultivation of annual crop species , coupled with management methods that intermittently leave soils uncovered and exposed to erosion . other aspects of " incorrect " farming practices include faulty irrigation and either a total lack of fertilization or lopsided use of mineral fertilisers .
this often leads to soil mineralization , particularly in tropical regions , depriving soils of their capacity to store water .
carbon compounds , previously fixed in the soil in the form of organic matter , are released into the air in the course of the mineralization process .
this reduces the soil 's buffering capacity for drought and flooding , at the same time directly contributing to climate change . a good number of resource problems are closely interlinked : together , deforestation , species loss , climate change , growing scarcity of water resources , and the loss of organic matter in soils are responsible for desertification ; they are both its cause and effect . does this mean that we have no choice but to capitulate ?

guest commentator susanne neubert says that we have a global responsibility to counter soil degradation and there 's no time to lose . some 70 percent of the world 's arid regions face desertification , and in around 110 countries - most of them poor - desertification threatens an area roughly the size of europe . twenty million tons of grain are lost annually due to desertification and , over the past 40 years , one third of the world 's arable land has been abandoned . even though there is no doubt about the causes of desertification , and the strategies needed to combat it are known , no turnaround is yet in sight .
why is it that neither the un desertification convention nor countless initiatives and programs have managed to halt the ongoing process of desertification ? unsustainable land management bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in many regions water for irrigation is not readily available the principal factors behind desertification are unsustainable land management and climate change .
as far as land management is concerned , incorrect farming practices also play a major role .
these include the cultivation of annual crop species , coupled with management methods that intermittently leave soils uncovered and exposed to erosion . other aspects of " incorrect " farming practices include faulty irrigation and either a total lack of fertilization or lopsided use of mineral fertilisers .
this often leads to soil mineralization , particularly in tropical regions , depriving soils of their capacity to store water .
carbon compounds , previously fixed in the soil in the form of organic matter , are released into the air in the course of the mineralization process .
this reduces the soil 's buffering capacity for drought and flooding , at the same time directly contributing to climate change . a good number of resource problems are closely interlinked : together , deforestation , species loss , climate change , growing scarcity of water resources , and the loss of organic matter in soils are responsible for desertification ; they are both its cause and effect . does this mean that we have no choice but to capitulate ?
no .
what it means is that by developing and using intelligent approaches we can achieve several goals at once .
soil conservation techniques , including erosion control walls , agro-forestry , and organic fertilization , are methods that are both effective and widely known - and these need to be applied on a larger scale . the reason why the picture continues to be dominated by individual measures is not technical in nature , indeed this must be seen as a problem bound up with economic incentives and political interests . incentives to support farmers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protecting trees can counter soil degradation since agriculture is organized primarily along private lines , soil conservation measures need to be carried out mainly by the private sector .
it is essential that incentives be set to ensure that investments in farmland yield returns , and the relatively high prices currently commanded by agricultural goods offer a good opportunity . there is considerable evidence that farmers carry out soil protection measures on their own if they lack more profitable alternatives and if the know-how and cost viability are available .
there is no lack of instructive examples , and german development cooperation offers a good number of them .
it is high time to start providing farmers in desertification-prone regions with appropriate advisory services as well as with the funds they need to transport stones to build erosion control walls , etc . , and to do so not intermittently but as a general rule . however , both agro-industry and institutional conditions also need to be modernized .
one correct and promising approach would be to encourage the agrochemical industry to gear production more to soil substrate additives . moreover , the agricultural policies of developing countries urgently need to be reoriented to reduce the fertilizer subsidies so widespread today and instead to increase the credit available in the agricultural sector .
and land rights need to be modified in such a way as to ensure that farmers have incentives to undertake soil conservation measures . no time to lose bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : modernizing the agro industry is vital in coutering the impact of climate change instead of continuing to generate vast amounts of greenhouse gases by producing and using mineral fertilizers incapable of achieving the hoped-for results on degraded soils , it would make far more sense to engage in organic agriculture keyed chiefly to on-farm resources .
this could serve to enhance soil storage capacity and - in cases where the needed organic matter is unavailable - to regenerate it by using industrially produced soil substrates .
land management of this kind tends to raise yields per unit area to earlier levels , and to do so precisely in arid regions . but is also essential to protect land at the supra-farm level , on state-owned land .
this , though , calls for a huge supply of labor .
in keeping with a proposal advanced by the united nations environment program -lrb- unep -rrb- , a " global green new deal " could be used to realize the action plans adopted to implement the un desertification convention , and in times of recession this would at the same time amount to an effective labor market policy . this should also include large-scale projects - like the building of " green walls " in china and the sahel belt - and efforts to link them with the numerous individual participatory measures already in progress , in order to achieve synergy effects . it would be important to implement measures geared at once to conservation and re-cultivation in order to come up with comprehensive measures that serve to reach several goals at the same time : protection of forests , water , climate , and soils .
this is a realistic aim in that the different organizational phases involved basically tend to correlate positively with one another . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neubert says that desertification is partly reversible how much time do we have left ?
the good news is that in many cases desertification is reversible .
the bad new is that this goes hand in hand with declining marginal utility , and when a certain stage of degradation has been reached , re-cultivation proves so labor-intensive that it is more attractive for the population to migrate to urban areas .
in other words , we have no time to lose .

" turkey can not accept the position of germany and france .
a privileged partnership does n't exist in -lrb- european law -rrb- , " erdogan told journalists before attending a forum in brussels , adding that turkey 's goal is full membership and any alternative " is out of the question . "
erdogan said french president nicolas sarkozy had been inconsistent , showing more openness to turkey 's accession in private talks than in public .
" our european friends unfortunately have a unilateral expectation which is rather populist and it saddens us .
i hope we will overcome this , " he said .
ankara launches diplomatic drive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan , left , faces an uphill battle on turkey 's eu entry bid turkey has mounted a diplomatic offensive aimed at boosting its chances of joining the eu , with erdogan visiting brussels twice in the span of three months .
in addition , his foreign minister , ahmet devutoglu , was also in brussels on friday to meet the eu enlargement commissioner , olli rehn , ahead of an accession conference planned for next week .
turkey 's membership was also a campaign issue in this month 's european parliament election , with some right-wing parties making gains after opposing its accession .
" some narrow-minded politicians have used turkey as election material , and we believe this to be very wrong and very populist , " erdogan said .
" we will never give up .
we are patient , we do our homework ... and we continue moving forward . "
changing the constitution erdogan 's comments come just a day after he had told journalists that plans to change the turkish constitution , key to keeping turkey 's bid for eu membership on track , are a " waste of time " as long as opposition parties keep blocking all efforts in parliament . erdogan 's comments were the clearest sign yet that his government could ditch its long standing goal of joining the 27-nation bloc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most europeans oppose turkey 's entry bid because it is a moslem country , poor , and situated mostly in asia erdogan promised after march local elections to renew efforts to revamp the 1982 constitution , drawn up under military rule , which would go a long way towards removing one of the major obstacles in ankara 's eu path . " all parties should be involved in efforts to reform the constitution , but the main opposition party rejects and blocks all efforts .
so as long as we are faced with such an approach these efforts are nothing but a waste of time .
we will have to continue with the present constitution , " erdogan said . sweden supports turkey 's eu bid the eu wants turkey to speed up political and economic reforms , including the removal of curbs on free speech , ensuring more rights for minorities and reducing the influence of the armed forces in government affairs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president sarkozy and german chancellor merkel are vocal opponents of full eu membership for turkey any sign that turkey is throwing in the towel could spell serious trouble for its membership bid and even have negative consequences for the country 's political and economic stability , analysts say .
" we are getting very close to crunch time , " said amanda akcakoca , a specialist on the issue at the european policy center in brussels .
" turkey needs to think out of the box and do something unexpected to impress europe . "
ankara ’ s bid for eu membership does , however , have the support of sweden , which takes over the six-month eu presidency on july 1 .
swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt has said his country will try its best to open a new chapter of european union membership negotiations with turkey when it takes over the rotating eu presidency next week . reinfeldt told the associated press news agency that such negotiations would be of " utmost strategic importance for europe " and pointed out the european union had promised it would negotiate with turkey .
cyprus question the process has also been slowed by ankara 's refusal to recognize eu member cyprus .
on thursday , european commission president jose manuel barroso said cypriots should seize a “ historic chance ” to reunite the mediterranean island .
" there is a unique chance this year to bring an end to this long-running conflict on european soil , " barroso told journalists .
" this chance must be taken . " cyprus was divided in a turkish invasion in 1974 after a brief greek-inspired coup .
turkey 's entry to the european union partly hinges on a peace deal in cyprus , whose greek cypriots represent the island in the bloc .
the eu unanimously began accession talks with turkey in 2005 , but since then , negotiations have slowed to a crawl with the bloc deeply divided about accepting turkey .
adding to the sense of limbo , so far only 10 of the 35 policy areas that candidates must complete have been opened , and eight of these have been frozen over the cyprus dispute. nrt / mrm / afp / ap / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 3,300-kilometer -lrb- 2,000-mile -rrb- nabucco pipeline is a key energy project which will bring gas from the caspian sea to austria via turkey , bulgaria , romania and hungary .
the nabucco pipeline has been given a high priority in eu energy policy , however differences between the countries has stalled the project .
according to manager magazin , fischer 's most important job will be to keep turkey happy .
" fischer is highly regarded in turkey because he was always open to it joining the eu , " according to the article .
the pipeline 's main goal - and greatest hurdle - is to bypass russia , in a bid to reduce europe 's energy dependence on moscow .

just after he left office in 2005 , schroeder signed a lucrative deal with russian state-run energy giant gazprom to head the advisory board for the company 's nord stream pipeline project .
while still in office , schroeder signed the agreement to build the pipeline with his close friend vladimir putin , the current russian prime minister .
last january , schroeder also joined the board of british-russian oil firm tnk-bp .
fischer and schroeder were the leading two politicians in the seven year social democrat / green coalition government .

the 3,300-kilometer -lrb- 2,000-mile -rrb- nabucco pipeline is a key energy project which will bring gas from the caspian sea to austria via turkey , bulgaria , romania and hungary .
the nabucco pipeline has been given a high priority in eu energy policy , however differences between the countries has stalled the project .
according to manager magazin , fischer 's most important job will be to keep turkey happy .
" fischer is highly regarded in turkey because he was always open to it joining the eu , " according to the article .
the pipeline 's main goal - and greatest hurdle - is to bypass russia , in a bid to reduce europe 's energy dependence on moscow .
currently , the eu gets about one-third of its energy from russia , through transit countries belarus and ukraine .
nabucco has therefore been a hot political topic between the eu and russia , with moscow doing everything it can to torpedo the process .
high-profile lobbying bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder works for russia 's competing nord stream project the russians , for their part , have been pushing for the nord stream pipeline through the north sea .
they are supported in their efforts by joschka fischer 's former boss and political ally , ex-chancellor gerhard schroeder .
just after he left office in 2005 , schroeder signed a lucrative deal with russian state-run energy giant gazprom to head the advisory board for the company 's nord stream pipeline project .
while still in office , schroeder signed the agreement to build the pipeline with his close friend vladimir putin , the current russian prime minister .
last january , schroeder also joined the board of british-russian oil firm tnk-bp .
fischer and schroeder were the leading two politicians in the seven year social democrat / green coalition government .
fischer withdrew from politics after the greens failed to win enough votes to remain in government in the 2005 elections .

" we have tried our very best and we do n't move , " said the european union agriculture commissioner mariann fischer boel .
" we went to the absolute limit of what was acceptable to the agricultural community .
we wo n't go any further , " echoed french farm minister bruno le maire .
agriculture is one of the most contentious topics at the doha round of the wto talks , which was launched in the gulf state of qatar in 2001 .
rich countries , like the european union and the united states , support their farmers with subsidies , in order for the farmers to be able to make a decent profit from their products .
developing countries like india , china and other smaller countries in africa , asia and south america often produce the same agricultural products .
they can also sell them for less , because it costs them less to produce it .
for example , a farmer in bavaria makes much more than a farmer in hunan province in china .
so , in order for bavarian agricultural products to compete with chinese products , the german government pays the bavarian farmer a certain amount of money so that when the german product is on the shelf in the eu , it costs the same as the chinese product .
it can also restrict the amount of a similar product that the chinese can sell in germany , called quotas , or charge tariffs on those products .
who paid for that jetliner ?

the ceo of airbus , tom enders says that airbus needs the 11 billion euros in government financing in order for airbus to compete with boeing .
the doha round of the wto talks are ongoing and there is no resolution in sight , although wto president pascal lamy has said that negotiations are 80 percent complete .

" we have tried our very best and we do n't move , " said the european union agriculture commissioner mariann fischer boel .
" we went to the absolute limit of what was acceptable to the agricultural community .
we wo n't go any further , " echoed french farm minister bruno le maire .
agriculture is one of the most contentious topics at the doha round of the wto talks , which was launched in the gulf state of qatar in 2001 .
rich countries , like the european union and the united states , support their farmers with subsidies , in order for the farmers to be able to make a decent profit from their products .
developing countries like india , china and other smaller countries in africa , asia and south america often produce the same agricultural products .
they can also sell them for less , because it costs them less to produce it .
for example , a farmer in bavaria makes much more than a farmer in hunan province in china .
so , in order for bavarian agricultural products to compete with chinese products , the german government pays the bavarian farmer a certain amount of money so that when the german product is on the shelf in the eu , it costs the same as the chinese product .
it can also restrict the amount of a similar product that the chinese can sell in germany , called quotas , or charge tariffs on those products .
who paid for that jetliner ?

the three major aircraft manufacturers in the world are boeing and lockheed in the us , and airbus in the eu .
recently the us has said that it will respond quickly and swiftly if european nations help airbus financially to launch a new plane , designated the airbus a350 .
the ceo of airbus , tom enders says that airbus needs the 11 billion euros in government financing in order for airbus to compete with boeing .
the doha round of the wto talks are ongoing and there is no resolution in sight , although wto president pascal lamy has said that negotiations are 80 percent complete .
" we must finish next year , " pascal recently told a french radio station .
“ technically , that is feasible .
politically things have taken a turn for the better . ”
in the meantime , the us and the chinese will continue to take their disagreements to the wto , the eu will look for a way to protect its farmers and still sign off on the doha agreement .

public gay pride demonstrations , known as christopher street day , are held every summer in cities around the world to commemorate the event .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amendments to the constitution are the focus of this year 's christopher street day parades klaus jetz , head of the lesbian and gay federation in germany -lrb- lsvd -rrb- , told deutsche welle that the political focus of this year 's christopher street day parades , which will begin this weekend in berlin , will be on amending article 3 of the german constitution .
" getting the anti-discrimination amendment passed has been an important topic for the organization since our founding in 1990 , " he said . " it is great that we have finally managed to rally support for this topic beyond our own community , within the political sphere . "
this week , the german parliament voted to push for a federal initiative to make additions to article 3 of the constitution , which protects citizens against discrimination based on gender , race , or religion .
they want , among other things , to add sexual orientation to that list .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's mayor klaus wowereit was one of the first politicians to publicly come out of the closet social democrat klaus wowereit , berlin 's openly homosexual mayor , spoke out in favor of the amendment .
in an interview with the german news agency dpa , wowereit said he whole-heartedly supported the initiative .
he called the laws passed to allow homosexual civil partnerships a " milestone , " but said that there was still judicial room for improvement .
same responsibilities , different rights wowereit took the lead from his party colleague , justice minister brigitte zypries .
in an interview with the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , zypries said that changing article 3 and article 6 of the constitution - which protects the institution of marriage and the family - would send " a clear signal " to society .
while german federal law gives homosexuals the right to enter a civil partnership , they do n't enjoy the same rights as heterosexual married couples when it comes to taxes , retirement , civil servant benefits , or adoption law .
zypries said that homosexual couples have the same responsibilities , but not the same rights as heterosexuals .
" i find this to be incredibly unjust , both on human and on judicial grounds , " the newspaper quoted zypries as saying .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civil unions are important for couples but do not grant the same rights as marriage taking a stand klaus jetz from the lesbian and gay federation in germany -lrb- lsvd -rrb- said that although both the european parliament and the european commission have taken a clear stance against discrimination based on sexual orientation , enshrining the same in the german constitution would have tangible advantages for the gay and lesbian community .
" homosexual couples are not able to adopt children in germany .
and ' rainbow families ' - gay and lesbian couples with biological children - do n't get the same tax breaks as heterosexual couples , " jetz said .
support in society growing article 3 of the constitution was amended for the last time in 1995 , to protect the disabled from discrimination .
at the time , there was not enough political backing to include sexual orientation to the list . but that seems to be changing .
on their web site , the lesbian and gay federation in germany lists a slew of supporters , from all walks of life - actors , politicians , even a rabbi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christopher street day is celebrated all over europe three major parties - the social democrats , the greens , and the left party - are in favor of an amendment .
but a two-thirds majority will be necessary to change the constitution and will need to include members of the conservative parties as well .
" we have to get the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- on board , " jetz said .
but the interior minister of the southern state of bavaria , joachim herrmann , has spoken out against the proposal .
the minister who belongs to the arch-conservative csu party , the sister bavarian party of the cdu , says he sees no reason to extend the constitutional protection of the family .
gay rights activists accuse the conservatives of blocking legislation that would give homosexuals more rights .
" we need the conservatives to understand that this is about protecting a minority in the population , " jetz said . " giving us more rights wo n't change anything for them . "

a privileged partnership does n't exist in -lrb- european law -rrb- , " erdogan told journalists before attending a forum in brussels , adding that turkey 's goal is full membership and any alternative " is out of the question . "
erdogan said french president nicolas sarkozy had been inconsistent , showing more openness to turkey 's accession in private talks than in public .
" our european friends unfortunately have a unilateral expectation which is rather populist and it saddens us .
i hope we will overcome this , " he said .
ankara launches diplomatic drive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan , left , faces an uphill battle on turkey 's eu entry bid turkey has mounted a diplomatic offensive aimed at boosting its chances of joining the eu , with erdogan visiting brussels twice in the span of three months .
in addition , his foreign minister , ahmet devutoglu , was also in brussels on friday to meet the eu enlargement commissioner , olli rehn , ahead of an accession conference planned for next week .
turkey 's membership was also a campaign issue in this month 's european parliament election , with some right-wing parties making gains after opposing its accession .
" some narrow-minded politicians have used turkey as election material , and we believe this to be very wrong and very populist , " erdogan said .
" we will never give up .
we are patient , we do our homework ... and we continue moving forward . "
changing the constitution erdogan 's comments come just a day after he had told journalists that plans to change the turkish constitution , key to keeping turkey 's bid for eu membership on track , are a " waste of time " as long as opposition parties keep blocking all efforts in parliament . erdogan 's comments were the clearest sign yet that his government could ditch its long standing goal of joining the 27-nation bloc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most europeans oppose turkey 's entry bid because it is a moslem country , poor , and situated mostly in asia erdogan promised after march local elections to renew efforts to revamp the 1982 constitution , drawn up under military rule , which would go a long way towards removing one of the major obstacles in ankara 's eu path . " all parties should be involved in efforts to reform the constitution , but the main opposition party rejects and blocks all efforts .
so as long as we are faced with such an approach these efforts are nothing but a waste of time .
we will have to continue with the present constitution , " erdogan said . sweden supports turkey 's eu bid the eu wants turkey to speed up political and economic reforms , including the removal of curbs on free speech , ensuring more rights for minorities and reducing the influence of the armed forces in government affairs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president sarkozy and german chancellor merkel are vocal opponents of full eu membership for turkey any sign that turkey is throwing in the towel could spell serious trouble for its membership bid and even have negative consequences for the country 's political and economic stability , analysts say .
" we are getting very close to crunch time , " said amanda akcakoca , a specialist on the issue at the european policy center in brussels .
" turkey needs to think out of the box and do something unexpected to impress europe . "
ankara ’ s bid for eu membership does , however , have the support of sweden , which takes over the six-month eu presidency on july 1 .
swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt has said his country will try its best to open a new chapter of european union membership negotiations with turkey when it takes over the rotating eu presidency next week . reinfeldt told the associated press news agency that such negotiations would be of " utmost strategic importance for europe " and pointed out the european union had promised it would negotiate with turkey .
cyprus question the process has also been slowed by ankara 's refusal to recognize eu member cyprus .
on thursday , european commission president jose manuel barroso said cypriots should seize a “ historic chance ” to reunite the mediterranean island .
" there is a unique chance this year to bring an end to this long-running conflict on european soil , " barroso told journalists .
" this chance must be taken . " cyprus was divided in a turkish invasion in 1974 after a brief greek-inspired coup .
turkey 's entry to the european union partly hinges on a peace deal in cyprus , whose greek cypriots represent the island in the bloc .
the eu unanimously began accession talks with turkey in 2005 , but since then , negotiations have slowed to a crawl with the bloc deeply divided about accepting turkey .
adding to the sense of limbo , so far only 10 of the 35 policy areas that candidates must complete have been opened , and eight of these have been frozen over the cyprus dispute. nrt / mrm / afp / ap / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" turkey can not accept the position of germany and france .
a privileged partnership does n't exist in -lrb- european law -rrb- , " erdogan told journalists before attending a forum in brussels , adding that turkey 's goal is full membership and any alternative " is out of the question . "
erdogan said french president nicolas sarkozy had been inconsistent , showing more openness to turkey 's accession in private talks than in public .
" our european friends unfortunately have a unilateral expectation which is rather populist and it saddens us .
i hope we will overcome this , " he said .
ankara launches diplomatic drive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan , left , faces an uphill battle on turkey 's eu entry bid turkey has mounted a diplomatic offensive aimed at boosting its chances of joining the eu , with erdogan visiting brussels twice in the span of three months .
in addition , his foreign minister , ahmet devutoglu , was also in brussels on friday to meet the eu enlargement commissioner , olli rehn , ahead of an accession conference planned for next week .
turkey 's membership was also a campaign issue in this month 's european parliament election , with some right-wing parties making gains after opposing its accession .
" some narrow-minded politicians have used turkey as election material , and we believe this to be very wrong and very populist , " erdogan said .
" we will never give up .
we are patient , we do our homework ... and we continue moving forward . "
changing the constitution erdogan 's comments come just a day after he had told journalists that plans to change the turkish constitution , key to keeping turkey 's bid for eu membership on track , are a " waste of time " as long as opposition parties keep blocking all efforts in parliament . erdogan 's comments were the clearest sign yet that his government could ditch its long standing goal of joining the 27-nation bloc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most europeans oppose turkey 's entry bid because it is a moslem country , poor , and situated mostly in asia erdogan promised after march local elections to renew efforts to revamp the 1982 constitution , drawn up under military rule , which would go a long way towards removing one of the major obstacles in ankara 's eu path . " all parties should be involved in efforts to reform the constitution , but the main opposition party rejects and blocks all efforts .
so as long as we are faced with such an approach these efforts are nothing but a waste of time .
we will have to continue with the present constitution , " erdogan said . sweden supports turkey 's eu bid the eu wants turkey to speed up political and economic reforms , including the removal of curbs on free speech , ensuring more rights for minorities and reducing the influence of the armed forces in government affairs .

public gay pride demonstrations , known as christopher street day , are held every summer in cities around the world to commemorate the event .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amendments to the constitution are the focus of this year 's christopher street day parades klaus jetz , head of the lesbian and gay federation in germany -lrb- lsvd -rrb- , told deutsche welle that the political focus of this year 's christopher street day parades , which will begin this weekend in berlin , will be on amending article 3 of the german constitution .
" getting the anti-discrimination amendment passed has been an important topic for the organization since our founding in 1990 , " he said . " it is great that we have finally managed to rally support for this topic beyond our own community , within the political sphere . "
this week , the german parliament voted to push for a federal initiative to make additions to article 3 of the constitution , which protects citizens against discrimination based on gender , race , or religion .
they want , among other things , to add sexual orientation to that list .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's mayor klaus wowereit was one of the first politicians to publicly come out of the closet social democrat klaus wowereit , berlin 's openly homosexual mayor , spoke out in favor of the amendment .
in an interview with the german news agency dpa , wowereit said he whole-heartedly supported the initiative .
he called the laws passed to allow homosexual civil partnerships a " milestone , " but said that there was still judicial room for improvement .
same responsibilities , different rights wowereit took the lead from his party colleague , justice minister brigitte zypries .
in an interview with the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , zypries said that changing article 3 and article 6 of the constitution - which protects the institution of marriage and the family - would send " a clear signal " to society .
while german federal law gives homosexuals the right to enter a civil partnership , they do n't enjoy the same rights as heterosexual married couples when it comes to taxes , retirement , civil servant benefits , or adoption law .
zypries said that homosexual couples have the same responsibilities , but not the same rights as heterosexuals .
" i find this to be incredibly unjust , both on human and on judicial grounds , " the newspaper quoted zypries as saying .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civil unions are important for couples but do not grant the same rights as marriage taking a stand klaus jetz from the lesbian and gay federation in germany -lrb- lsvd -rrb- said that although both the european parliament and the european commission have taken a clear stance against discrimination based on sexual orientation , enshrining the same in the german constitution would have tangible advantages for the gay and lesbian community .
" homosexual couples are not able to adopt children in germany .
and ' rainbow families ' - gay and lesbian couples with biological children - do n't get the same tax breaks as heterosexual couples , " jetz said .
support in society growing article 3 of the constitution was amended for the last time in 1995 , to protect the disabled from discrimination .
at the time , there was not enough political backing to include sexual orientation to the list . but that seems to be changing .
on their web site , the lesbian and gay federation in germany lists a slew of supporters , from all walks of life - actors , politicians , even a rabbi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christopher street day is celebrated all over europe three major parties - the social democrats , the greens , and the left party - are in favor of an amendment .

" we have to get the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- on board , " jetz said .
but the interior minister of the southern state of bavaria , joachim herrmann , has spoken out against the proposal .
the minister who belongs to the arch-conservative csu party , the sister bavarian party of the cdu , says he sees no reason to extend the constitutional protection of the family .
gay rights activists accuse the conservatives of blocking legislation that would give homosexuals more rights .
" we need the conservatives to understand that this is about protecting a minority in the population , " jetz said . " giving us more rights wo n't change anything for them . "

jackson sold over 750 million albums in his sometimes controversial career . the 50 year-old " king of pop " was rushed to the nearby ucla medical center , and county coroner fred corral said he was unresponsive and pronounced dead soon after .
medical officers are now conducting an autopsy to check for toxicology or other problems - with results set to be published later on friday . fans the world over mourned the pop star as word of his death spread quickly . " michael jackson was weightless - a moonwalker , a transformer , a werewolf , he was n't of this world , " wrote the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung friday .
" as long as he had a handle on his weightlessness and could play with it , it was his biggest capital .
but in the end it 's what killed him . " even moonwalkers ca n't lose contact to earth for very long , " concluded the paper . the descent of a star bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the king of pop announced his comeback tour in march 2009 born in 1958 in gary , indiana , jackson became a child star as a member of the jackson five .
as an adult , jackson moved on to a successful - and often controversial - solo career .
this career peaked with his 1982 record " thriller , " which is the best selling album of all time . in later life jackson struggled with a series of court cases and allegations about his private life , damaging his career and his financial situation , but he remained a popular character with an enormous fan base . the german newsmagazine spiegel online wrote that jackson had two faces : one was " the monster , more alien than human , lifted , pale and in the end as emaciated as a skeleton . " on the other hand , there was " the genius that reinvented pop , sold more albums than anyone else -lrb- … -rrb- and was admired by the masses - in particular by his musical heirs , who never would have existed without his influence and who are now mourning his passing with an unequalled flood of condolence : beyonce , usher , justin timberlake , to name three of many .

jackson sold over 750 million albums in his sometimes controversial career . the 50 year-old " king of pop " was rushed to the nearby ucla medical center , and county coroner fred corral said he was unresponsive and pronounced dead soon after .
medical officers are now conducting an autopsy to check for toxicology or other problems - with results set to be published later on friday . fans the world over mourned the pop star as word of his death spread quickly . " michael jackson was weightless - a moonwalker , a transformer , a werewolf , he was n't of this world , " wrote the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung friday .
" as long as he had a handle on his weightlessness and could play with it , it was his biggest capital .
but in the end it 's what killed him .

as an adult , jackson moved on to a successful - and often controversial - solo career .
this career peaked with his 1982 record " thriller , " which is the best selling album of all time . in later life jackson struggled with a series of court cases and allegations about his private life , damaging his career and his financial situation , but he remained a popular character with an enormous fan base . the german newsmagazine spiegel online wrote that jackson had two faces : one was " the monster , more alien than human , lifted , pale and in the end as emaciated as a skeleton . " on the other hand , there was " the genius that reinvented pop , sold more albums than anyone else -lrb- … -rrb- and was admired by the masses - in particular by his musical heirs , who never would have existed without his influence and who are now mourning his passing with an unequalled flood of condolence : beyonce , usher , justin timberlake , to name three of many .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amendments to the constitution are the focus of this year 's christopher street day parades klaus jetz , head of the lesbian and gay federation in germany -lrb- lsvd -rrb- , told deutsche welle that the political focus of this year 's christopher street day parades , which will begin this weekend in berlin , will be on amending article 3 of the german constitution .
" getting the anti-discrimination amendment passed has been an important topic for the organization since our founding in 1990 , " he said . " it is great that we have finally managed to rally support for this topic beyond our own community , within the political sphere . "
this week , the german parliament voted to push for a federal initiative to make additions to article 3 of the constitution , which protects citizens against discrimination based on gender , race , or religion .
they want , among other things , to add sexual orientation to that list .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's mayor klaus wowereit was one of the first politicians to publicly come out of the closet social democrat klaus wowereit , berlin 's openly homosexual mayor , spoke out in favor of the amendment .
in an interview with the german news agency dpa , wowereit said he whole-heartedly supported the initiative .
he called the laws passed to allow homosexual civil partnerships a " milestone , " but said that there was still judicial room for improvement .
same responsibilities , different rights wowereit took the lead from his party colleague , justice minister brigitte zypries .
in an interview with the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , zypries said that changing article 3 and article 6 of the constitution - which protects the institution of marriage and the family - would send " a clear signal " to society .
while german federal law gives homosexuals the right to enter a civil partnership , they do n't enjoy the same rights as heterosexual married couples when it comes to taxes , retirement , civil servant benefits , or adoption law .
zypries said that homosexual couples have the same responsibilities , but not the same rights as heterosexuals .
" i find this to be incredibly unjust , both on human and on judicial grounds , " the newspaper quoted zypries as saying .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civil unions are important for couples but do not grant the same rights as marriage taking a stand klaus jetz from the lesbian and gay federation in germany -lrb- lsvd -rrb- said that although both the european parliament and the european commission have taken a clear stance against discrimination based on sexual orientation , enshrining the same in the german constitution would have tangible advantages for the gay and lesbian community .
" homosexual couples are not able to adopt children in germany .
and ' rainbow families ' - gay and lesbian couples with biological children - do n't get the same tax breaks as heterosexual couples , " jetz said .
support in society growing article 3 of the constitution was amended for the last time in 1995 , to protect the disabled from discrimination .
at the time , there was not enough political backing to include sexual orientation to the list . but that seems to be changing .
on their web site , the lesbian and gay federation in germany lists a slew of supporters , from all walks of life - actors , politicians , even a rabbi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christopher street day is celebrated all over europe three major parties - the social democrats , the greens , and the left party - are in favor of an amendment .
but a two-thirds majority will be necessary to change the constitution and will need to include members of the conservative parties as well .
" we have to get the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- on board , " jetz said .
but the interior minister of the southern state of bavaria , joachim herrmann , has spoken out against the proposal .
the minister who belongs to the arch-conservative csu party , the sister bavarian party of the cdu , says he sees no reason to extend the constitutional protection of the family .
gay rights activists accuse the conservatives of blocking legislation that would give homosexuals more rights .
" we need the conservatives to understand that this is about protecting a minority in the population , " jetz said . " giving us more rights wo n't change anything for them . "

" we have tried our very best and we do n't move , " said the european union agriculture commissioner mariann fischer boel .
" we went to the absolute limit of what was acceptable to the agricultural community .
we wo n't go any further , " echoed french farm minister bruno le maire .
agriculture is one of the most contentious topics at the doha round of the wto talks , which was launched in the gulf state of qatar in 2001 .
rich countries , like the european union and the united states , support their farmers with subsidies , in order for the farmers to be able to make a decent profit from their products .
developing countries like india , china and other smaller countries in africa , asia and south america often produce the same agricultural products .
they can also sell them for less , because it costs them less to produce it .
for example , a farmer in bavaria makes much more than a farmer in hunan province in china .
so , in order for bavarian agricultural products to compete with chinese products , the german government pays the bavarian farmer a certain amount of money so that when the german product is on the shelf in the eu , it costs the same as the chinese product .
it can also restrict the amount of a similar product that the chinese can sell in germany , called quotas , or charge tariffs on those products .
who paid for that jetliner ?

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans honored the victims of violence in iran presenting the document , italian foreign minister franco frattini expressed the group of eight 's " solidarity with the victims " and said the violence in iran had to " stop immediately . "
before the meeting , frattini had called for a stronger statement of condemnation , but russian insistence that such a message would only antagonize iran led to a softening of that stance .
north korea sharply rebuked for nuclear test that terminology , however , was reserved instead for north korea .
" we condemn in the strongest terms the nuclear test conducted on may 25 in violation of un security council resolution 1718 and the rocket launch of april 5 , which constitute a threat to regional peace and stability , " the statement said .

public gay pride demonstrations , known as christopher street day , are held every summer in cities around the world to commemorate the event .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amendments to the constitution are the focus of this year 's christopher street day parades klaus jetz , head of the lesbian and gay federation in germany -lrb- lsvd -rrb- , told deutsche welle that the political focus of this year 's christopher street day parades , which will begin this weekend in berlin , will be on amending article 3 of the german constitution .
" getting the anti-discrimination amendment passed has been an important topic for the organization since our founding in 1990 , " he said . " it is great that we have finally managed to rally support for this topic beyond our own community , within the political sphere . "
this week , the german parliament voted to push for a federal initiative to make additions to article 3 of the constitution , which protects citizens against discrimination based on gender , race , or religion .
they want , among other things , to add sexual orientation to that list .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's mayor klaus wowereit was one of the first politicians to publicly come out of the closet social democrat klaus wowereit , berlin 's openly homosexual mayor , spoke out in favor of the amendment .
in an interview with the german news agency dpa , wowereit said he whole-heartedly supported the initiative .
he called the laws passed to allow homosexual civil partnerships a " milestone , " but said that there was still judicial room for improvement .
same responsibilities , different rights wowereit took the lead from his party colleague , justice minister brigitte zypries .
in an interview with the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , zypries said that changing article 3 and article 6 of the constitution - which protects the institution of marriage and the family - would send " a clear signal " to society .
while german federal law gives homosexuals the right to enter a civil partnership , they do n't enjoy the same rights as heterosexual married couples when it comes to taxes , retirement , civil servant benefits , or adoption law .
zypries said that homosexual couples have the same responsibilities , but not the same rights as heterosexuals .
" i find this to be incredibly unjust , both on human and on judicial grounds , " the newspaper quoted zypries as saying .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civil unions are important for couples but do not grant the same rights as marriage taking a stand klaus jetz from the lesbian and gay federation in germany -lrb- lsvd -rrb- said that although both the european parliament and the european commission have taken a clear stance against discrimination based on sexual orientation , enshrining the same in the german constitution would have tangible advantages for the gay and lesbian community .
" homosexual couples are not able to adopt children in germany .
and ' rainbow families ' - gay and lesbian couples with biological children - do n't get the same tax breaks as heterosexual couples , " jetz said .
support in society growing article 3 of the constitution was amended for the last time in 1995 , to protect the disabled from discrimination .
at the time , there was not enough political backing to include sexual orientation to the list . but that seems to be changing .
on their web site , the lesbian and gay federation in germany lists a slew of supporters , from all walks of life - actors , politicians , even a rabbi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christopher street day is celebrated all over europe three major parties - the social democrats , the greens , and the left party - are in favor of an amendment .
but a two-thirds majority will be necessary to change the constitution and will need to include members of the conservative parties as well .
" we have to get the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- on board , " jetz said .
but the interior minister of the southern state of bavaria , joachim herrmann , has spoken out against the proposal .
the minister who belongs to the arch-conservative csu party , the sister bavarian party of the cdu , says he sees no reason to extend the constitutional protection of the family .
gay rights activists accuse the conservatives of blocking legislation that would give homosexuals more rights .
" we need the conservatives to understand that this is about protecting a minority in the population , " jetz said . " giving us more rights wo n't change anything for them . "

jackson sold over 750 million albums in his sometimes controversial career . the 50 year-old " king of pop " was rushed to the nearby ucla medical center , and county coroner fred corral said he was unresponsive and pronounced dead soon after .
medical officers are now conducting an autopsy to check for toxicology or other problems - with results set to be published later on friday . fans the world over mourned the pop star as word of his death spread quickly . " michael jackson was weightless - a moonwalker , a transformer , a werewolf , he was n't of this world , " wrote the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung friday .
" as long as he had a handle on his weightlessness and could play with it , it was his biggest capital .
but in the end it 's what killed him .

as an adult , jackson moved on to a successful - and often controversial - solo career .
this career peaked with his 1982 record " thriller , " which is the best selling album of all time . in later life jackson struggled with a series of court cases and allegations about his private life , damaging his career and his financial situation , but he remained a popular character with an enormous fan base . the german newsmagazine spiegel online wrote that jackson had two faces : one was " the monster , more alien than human , lifted , pale and in the end as emaciated as a skeleton . " on the other hand , there was " the genius that reinvented pop , sold more albums than anyone else -lrb- … -rrb- and was admired by the masses - in particular by his musical heirs , who never would have existed without his influence and who are now mourning his passing with an unequalled flood of condolence : beyonce , usher , justin timberlake , to name three of many . " at the time of his death he had been preparing for a 50-concert run in london that was meant to rejuvenate his career , and secure his financial future . " a comeback has seldom been as necessary as it was in jackson 's case , " wrote the sueddeutsche . though it 's now too late for a comeback , the troubled pop icon leaves behind a generation that has at some point tried to moonwalk and a legacy of young musicians - like beyonce and timberlake - who are carrying on in his footsteps . bildunterschrift : michael jackson in 1971 , 1977 and 1979 -lrb- from left -rrb- bildunterschrift : michael jackson 1983 , 1987 and 1990 -lrb- from left -rrb- kjb / msh , ap / dpa / afp editor : darren mara send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 3,300-kilometer -lrb- 2,000-mile -rrb- nabucco pipeline is a key energy project which will bring gas from the caspian sea to austria via turkey , bulgaria , romania and hungary .
the nabucco pipeline has been given a high priority in eu energy policy , however differences between the countries has stalled the project .
according to manager magazin , fischer 's most important job will be to keep turkey happy .
" fischer is highly regarded in turkey because he was always open to it joining the eu , " according to the article .
the pipeline 's main goal - and greatest hurdle - is to bypass russia , in a bid to reduce europe 's energy dependence on moscow .

just after he left office in 2005 , schroeder signed a lucrative deal with russian state-run energy giant gazprom to head the advisory board for the company 's nord stream pipeline project .
while still in office , schroeder signed the agreement to build the pipeline with his close friend vladimir putin , the current russian prime minister .
last january , schroeder also joined the board of british-russian oil firm tnk-bp .
fischer and schroeder were the leading two politicians in the seven year social democrat / green coalition government .

" we have tried our very best and we do n't move , " said the european union agriculture commissioner mariann fischer boel .
" we went to the absolute limit of what was acceptable to the agricultural community .
we wo n't go any further , " echoed french farm minister bruno le maire .
agriculture is one of the most contentious topics at the doha round of the wto talks , which was launched in the gulf state of qatar in 2001 .
rich countries , like the european union and the united states , support their farmers with subsidies , in order for the farmers to be able to make a decent profit from their products .
developing countries like india , china and other smaller countries in africa , asia and south america often produce the same agricultural products .
they can also sell them for less , because it costs them less to produce it .
for example , a farmer in bavaria makes much more than a farmer in hunan province in china .
so , in order for bavarian agricultural products to compete with chinese products , the german government pays the bavarian farmer a certain amount of money so that when the german product is on the shelf in the eu , it costs the same as the chinese product .
it can also restrict the amount of a similar product that the chinese can sell in germany , called quotas , or charge tariffs on those products .
who paid for that jetliner ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus ceo enders says he needs help with a350 tariffs , quotas and subsidies are all controversial ideas in world trade .

the three major aircraft manufacturers in the world are boeing and lockheed in the us , and airbus in the eu .
recently the us has said that it will respond quickly and swiftly if european nations help airbus financially to launch a new plane , designated the airbus a350 .
the ceo of airbus , tom enders says that airbus needs the 11 billion euros in government financing in order for airbus to compete with boeing .
the doha round of the wto talks are ongoing and there is no resolution in sight , although wto president pascal lamy has said that negotiations are 80 percent complete .
" we must finish next year , " pascal recently told a french radio station .
“ technically , that is feasible .
politically things have taken a turn for the better . ”
in the meantime , the us and the chinese will continue to take their disagreements to the wto , the eu will look for a way to protect its farmers and still sign off on the doha agreement .
and the russians ?

jackson sold over 750 million albums in his sometimes controversial career . the 50 year-old " king of pop " was rushed to the nearby ucla medical center , and county coroner fred corral said he was unresponsive and pronounced dead soon after .
medical officers are now conducting an autopsy to check for toxicology or other problems - with results set to be published later on friday . fans the world over mourned the pop star as word of his death spread quickly . " michael jackson was weightless - a moonwalker , a transformer , a werewolf , he was n't of this world , " wrote the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung friday .
" as long as he had a handle on his weightlessness and could play with it , it was his biggest capital .
but in the end it 's what killed him . " even moonwalkers ca n't lose contact to earth for very long , " concluded the paper . the descent of a star bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the king of pop announced his comeback tour in march 2009 born in 1958 in gary , indiana , jackson became a child star as a member of the jackson five .
as an adult , jackson moved on to a successful - and often controversial - solo career .
this career peaked with his 1982 record " thriller , " which is the best selling album of all time . in later life jackson struggled with a series of court cases and allegations about his private life , damaging his career and his financial situation , but he remained a popular character with an enormous fan base . the german newsmagazine spiegel online wrote that jackson had two faces : one was " the monster , more alien than human , lifted , pale and in the end as emaciated as a skeleton .

" we have tried our very best and we do n't move , " said the european union agriculture commissioner mariann fischer boel .
" we went to the absolute limit of what was acceptable to the agricultural community .
we wo n't go any further , " echoed french farm minister bruno le maire .
agriculture is one of the most contentious topics at the doha round of the wto talks , which was launched in the gulf state of qatar in 2001 .
rich countries , like the european union and the united states , support their farmers with subsidies , in order for the farmers to be able to make a decent profit from their products .
developing countries like india , china and other smaller countries in africa , asia and south america often produce the same agricultural products .
they can also sell them for less , because it costs them less to produce it .
for example , a farmer in bavaria makes much more than a farmer in hunan province in china .
so , in order for bavarian agricultural products to compete with chinese products , the german government pays the bavarian farmer a certain amount of money so that when the german product is on the shelf in the eu , it costs the same as the chinese product .
it can also restrict the amount of a similar product that the chinese can sell in germany , called quotas , or charge tariffs on those products .
who paid for that jetliner ?

the three major aircraft manufacturers in the world are boeing and lockheed in the us , and airbus in the eu .
recently the us has said that it will respond quickly and swiftly if european nations help airbus financially to launch a new plane , designated the airbus a350 .
the ceo of airbus , tom enders says that airbus needs the 11 billion euros in government financing in order for airbus to compete with boeing .
the doha round of the wto talks are ongoing and there is no resolution in sight , although wto president pascal lamy has said that negotiations are 80 percent complete .
" we must finish next year , " pascal recently told a french radio station .
“ technically , that is feasible .
politically things have taken a turn for the better . ”
in the meantime , the us and the chinese will continue to take their disagreements to the wto , the eu will look for a way to protect its farmers and still sign off on the doha agreement .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amendments to the constitution are the focus of this year 's christopher street day parades klaus jetz , head of the lesbian and gay federation in germany -lrb- lsvd -rrb- , told deutsche welle that the political focus of this year 's christopher street day parades , which will begin this weekend in berlin , will be on amending article 3 of the german constitution .
" getting the anti-discrimination amendment passed has been an important topic for the organization since our founding in 1990 , " he said . " it is great that we have finally managed to rally support for this topic beyond our own community , within the political sphere . "
this week , the german parliament voted to push for a federal initiative to make additions to article 3 of the constitution , which protects citizens against discrimination based on gender , race , or religion .
they want , among other things , to add sexual orientation to that list .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's mayor klaus wowereit was one of the first politicians to publicly come out of the closet social democrat klaus wowereit , berlin 's openly homosexual mayor , spoke out in favor of the amendment .
in an interview with the german news agency dpa , wowereit said he whole-heartedly supported the initiative .
he called the laws passed to allow homosexual civil partnerships a " milestone , " but said that there was still judicial room for improvement .
same responsibilities , different rights wowereit took the lead from his party colleague , justice minister brigitte zypries .
in an interview with the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , zypries said that changing article 3 and article 6 of the constitution - which protects the institution of marriage and the family - would send " a clear signal " to society .
while german federal law gives homosexuals the right to enter a civil partnership , they do n't enjoy the same rights as heterosexual married couples when it comes to taxes , retirement , civil servant benefits , or adoption law .
zypries said that homosexual couples have the same responsibilities , but not the same rights as heterosexuals .
" i find this to be incredibly unjust , both on human and on judicial grounds , " the newspaper quoted zypries as saying .

" homosexual couples are not able to adopt children in germany .
and ' rainbow families ' - gay and lesbian couples with biological children - do n't get the same tax breaks as heterosexual couples , " jetz said .

at the time , there was not enough political backing to include sexual orientation to the list . but that seems to be changing .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christopher street day is celebrated all over europe three major parties - the social democrats , the greens , and the left party - are in favor of an amendment .

" we have to get the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- on board , " jetz said .
but the interior minister of the southern state of bavaria , joachim herrmann , has spoken out against the proposal .
the minister who belongs to the arch-conservative csu party , the sister bavarian party of the cdu , says he sees no reason to extend the constitutional protection of the family .
gay rights activists accuse the conservatives of blocking legislation that would give homosexuals more rights .
" we need the conservatives to understand that this is about protecting a minority in the population , " jetz said . " giving us more rights wo n't change anything for them . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internationals -pipe- 26.06.2009 under 21s provide a mixed picture of germany 's footballing future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these young men are trying to become the most successful german u21 team ever the 2009 u21 european championships are being touted as a chance to see tomorrow 's stars today .
but in germany 's case , the real stars do n't stick with the team very long .
dw 's jefferson chase explains . when the young german eleven beat italy 1-0 in the semifinals of the event on friday , june 26 , they moved a step closer to making history .
germany may be a soccer powerhouse , but the record of the u21 national team is anything but stellar .
incredibly enough , they 've never won a major tournament - a blot that coach horst hrubesch currently wants to rectify in sweden .
still , after needing a nervy draw against england to qualify for the knock-out stage , hrubesch is n't exactly jumping for joy .
" the only thing i 'm happy about is making the semis , " the coach told dpa news agency after the england match .
" i 'm not at all satisfied with how we did it - it was way below our ambitions . "
with the german u17 and u19 teams having won their european titles , this could be the year for germany 's youth teams .
but would it signal a glorious future ahead for the adult german national team ?
probably not .
here today , gone tomorrow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year , before taking his current job , hrubesch won europe with the u19 germany 's footballing reputation is one of solidity and consistency rather than mercurial brilliance so you might expect the national soccer association , the dfb , to bring up players gradually through the various levels .
but the opposite is the case .
goalkeeping legend oliver kahn and super striker miroslav klose never played in the youth ranks , going straight into the main national team .
and while most of the current national squad did take the pitch for the u21s , very few of the real stars - michael ballack , bastian schweinsteiger or lukas podolski , for example - made more than a handful of appearances , before being promoted up to the big league .
the uefa u21 championship has only been in existence in its current form since 1978 , and it took some time for germany to take them seriously .
even into the 1990s the dfb eleven were playing with a sweeper .
as a result , germany have always gone home empty handed while italy have won europe five times , and even england - never a national side known for tournament successes - have hoisted the trophy twice .
ones to watch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany are glad oezil , r , choose to play for them instead of turkey given the german u21s ' history , the players most likely to play roles in the top squad are those who have already been called up by national coach joachim loew .
diminutive forward marko marin has n't been able to make much of a mark in sweden , but leverkusen 's gonzalo castro , stuttgart 's sami khedira and schalke goalkeeper manuel neuer have performed well .
and the star of the show has been mesut oezil , who normally plays on the wing for his club bremen but who has shone in a striker role for hrubesch , setting up both of goals in germany 's 2-nil win over finland in the group stage .
and the breakthrough player of the squad is defender jerome boateng .
boateng usually serves as right back and has struggled to keep a position in the starting line-up for his club hamburg .
but he 's drawn high marks in all his matches for the young germans playing as a central defender - a role for which hamburg might consider him when he returns from sweden .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : castro is part of germany 's multi-cultural squad those names point to an unmistakable trend within the german national team - the growing prominence of players who were born outside germany or who come from an immigrant background .
klose , podolski , both polish born , have established themselves as mainstays in germany adult national team - and they 've recently been joined by piotr trochowski .
in the u21 , eight of the current 24 members of the squad come from multi-national backgrounds .
so if germany continues the tradition of integrating younger players quickly into the main men 's team , some of hrubesch 's charges could play a role at the 2010 world cup in south africa .

" we have tried our very best and we do n't move , " said the european union agriculture commissioner mariann fischer boel .
" we went to the absolute limit of what was acceptable to the agricultural community .
we wo n't go any further , " echoed french farm minister bruno le maire .
agriculture is one of the most contentious topics at the doha round of the wto talks , which was launched in the gulf state of qatar in 2001 .
rich countries , like the european union and the united states , support their farmers with subsidies , in order for the farmers to be able to make a decent profit from their products .
developing countries like india , china and other smaller countries in africa , asia and south america often produce the same agricultural products .
they can also sell them for less , because it costs them less to produce it .
for example , a farmer in bavaria makes much more than a farmer in hunan province in china .
so , in order for bavarian agricultural products to compete with chinese products , the german government pays the bavarian farmer a certain amount of money so that when the german product is on the shelf in the eu , it costs the same as the chinese product .
it can also restrict the amount of a similar product that the chinese can sell in germany , called quotas , or charge tariffs on those products .
who paid for that jetliner ?

the three major aircraft manufacturers in the world are boeing and lockheed in the us , and airbus in the eu .
recently the us has said that it will respond quickly and swiftly if european nations help airbus financially to launch a new plane , designated the airbus a350 .
the ceo of airbus , tom enders says that airbus needs the 11 billion euros in government financing in order for airbus to compete with boeing .
the doha round of the wto talks are ongoing and there is no resolution in sight , although wto president pascal lamy has said that negotiations are 80 percent complete .
" we must finish next year , " pascal recently told a french radio station .
“ technically , that is feasible .
politically things have taken a turn for the better . ”
in the meantime , the us and the chinese will continue to take their disagreements to the wto , the eu will look for a way to protect its farmers and still sign off on the doha agreement .

the 3,300-kilometer -lrb- 2,000-mile -rrb- nabucco pipeline is a key energy project which will bring gas from the caspian sea to austria via turkey , bulgaria , romania and hungary .
the nabucco pipeline has been given a high priority in eu energy policy , however differences between the countries has stalled the project .
according to manager magazin , fischer 's most important job will be to keep turkey happy .
" fischer is highly regarded in turkey because he was always open to it joining the eu , " according to the article .
the pipeline 's main goal - and greatest hurdle - is to bypass russia , in a bid to reduce europe 's energy dependence on moscow .
currently , the eu gets about one-third of its energy from russia , through transit countries belarus and ukraine .
nabucco has therefore been a hot political topic between the eu and russia , with moscow doing everything it can to torpedo the process .

just after he left office in 2005 , schroeder signed a lucrative deal with russian state-run energy giant gazprom to head the advisory board for the company 's nord stream pipeline project .
while still in office , schroeder signed the agreement to build the pipeline with his close friend vladimir putin , the current russian prime minister .
last january , schroeder also joined the board of british-russian oil firm tnk-bp .
fischer and schroeder were the leading two politicians in the seven year social democrat / green coalition government .
fischer withdrew from politics after the greens failed to win enough votes to remain in government in the 2005 elections .

the 3,300-kilometer -lrb- 2,000-mile -rrb- nabucco pipeline is a key energy project which will bring gas from the caspian sea to austria via turkey , bulgaria , romania and hungary .
the nabucco pipeline has been given a high priority in eu energy policy , however differences between the countries has stalled the project .
according to manager magazin , fischer 's most important job will be to keep turkey happy .
" fischer is highly regarded in turkey because he was always open to it joining the eu , " according to the article .
the pipeline 's main goal - and greatest hurdle - is to bypass russia , in a bid to reduce europe 's energy dependence on moscow .
currently , the eu gets about one-third of its energy from russia , through transit countries belarus and ukraine .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internationals -pipe- 26.06.2009 under 21s provide a mixed picture of germany 's footballing future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these young men are trying to become the most successful german u21 team ever the 2009 u21 european championships are being touted as a chance to see tomorrow 's stars today .
but in germany 's case , the real stars do n't stick with the team very long .
dw 's jefferson chase explains . when the young german eleven beat italy 1-0 in the semifinals of the event on friday , june 26 , they moved a step closer to making history .
germany may be a soccer powerhouse , but the record of the u21 national team is anything but stellar .
incredibly enough , they 've never won a major tournament - a blot that coach horst hrubesch currently wants to rectify in sweden .
still , after needing a nervy draw against england to qualify for the knock-out stage , hrubesch is n't exactly jumping for joy .
" the only thing i 'm happy about is making the semis , " the coach told dpa news agency after the england match .
" i 'm not at all satisfied with how we did it - it was way below our ambitions . "
with the german u17 and u19 teams having won their european titles , this could be the year for germany 's youth teams .
but would it signal a glorious future ahead for the adult german national team ?
probably not .
here today , gone tomorrow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year , before taking his current job , hrubesch won europe with the u19 germany 's footballing reputation is one of solidity and consistency rather than mercurial brilliance so you might expect the national soccer association , the dfb , to bring up players gradually through the various levels .
but the opposite is the case .
goalkeeping legend oliver kahn and super striker miroslav klose never played in the youth ranks , going straight into the main national team .
and while most of the current national squad did take the pitch for the u21s , very few of the real stars - michael ballack , bastian schweinsteiger or lukas podolski , for example - made more than a handful of appearances , before being promoted up to the big league .
the uefa u21 championship has only been in existence in its current form since 1978 , and it took some time for germany to take them seriously .
even into the 1990s the dfb eleven were playing with a sweeper .
as a result , germany have always gone home empty handed while italy have won europe five times , and even england - never a national side known for tournament successes - have hoisted the trophy twice .
ones to watch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany are glad oezil , r , choose to play for them instead of turkey given the german u21s ' history , the players most likely to play roles in the top squad are those who have already been called up by national coach joachim loew .
diminutive forward marko marin has n't been able to make much of a mark in sweden , but leverkusen 's gonzalo castro , stuttgart 's sami khedira and schalke goalkeeper manuel neuer have performed well .
and the star of the show has been mesut oezil , who normally plays on the wing for his club bremen but who has shone in a striker role for hrubesch , setting up both of goals in germany 's 2-nil win over finland in the group stage .
and the breakthrough player of the squad is defender jerome boateng .
boateng usually serves as right back and has struggled to keep a position in the starting line-up for his club hamburg .
but he 's drawn high marks in all his matches for the young germans playing as a central defender - a role for which hamburg might consider him when he returns from sweden .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : castro is part of germany 's multi-cultural squad those names point to an unmistakable trend within the german national team - the growing prominence of players who were born outside germany or who come from an immigrant background .
klose , podolski , both polish born , have established themselves as mainstays in germany adult national team - and they 've recently been joined by piotr trochowski .
in the u21 , eight of the current 24 members of the squad come from multi-national backgrounds .
so if germany continues the tradition of integrating younger players quickly into the main men 's team , some of hrubesch 's charges could play a role at the 2010 world cup in south africa .

public gay pride demonstrations , known as christopher street day , are held every summer in cities around the world to commemorate the event .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amendments to the constitution are the focus of this year 's christopher street day parades klaus jetz , head of the lesbian and gay federation in germany -lrb- lsvd -rrb- , told deutsche welle that the political focus of this year 's christopher street day parades , which will begin this weekend in berlin , will be on amending article 3 of the german constitution .
" getting the anti-discrimination amendment passed has been an important topic for the organization since our founding in 1990 , " he said . " it is great that we have finally managed to rally support for this topic beyond our own community , within the political sphere . "
this week , the german parliament voted to push for a federal initiative to make additions to article 3 of the constitution , which protects citizens against discrimination based on gender , race , or religion .
they want , among other things , to add sexual orientation to that list .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's mayor klaus wowereit was one of the first politicians to publicly come out of the closet social democrat klaus wowereit , berlin 's openly homosexual mayor , spoke out in favor of the amendment .
in an interview with the german news agency dpa , wowereit said he whole-heartedly supported the initiative .
he called the laws passed to allow homosexual civil partnerships a " milestone , " but said that there was still judicial room for improvement .
same responsibilities , different rights wowereit took the lead from his party colleague , justice minister brigitte zypries .
in an interview with the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , zypries said that changing article 3 and article 6 of the constitution - which protects the institution of marriage and the family - would send " a clear signal " to society .
while german federal law gives homosexuals the right to enter a civil partnership , they do n't enjoy the same rights as heterosexual married couples when it comes to taxes , retirement , civil servant benefits , or adoption law .
zypries said that homosexual couples have the same responsibilities , but not the same rights as heterosexuals .
" i find this to be incredibly unjust , both on human and on judicial grounds , " the newspaper quoted zypries as saying .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civil unions are important for couples but do not grant the same rights as marriage taking a stand klaus jetz from the lesbian and gay federation in germany -lrb- lsvd -rrb- said that although both the european parliament and the european commission have taken a clear stance against discrimination based on sexual orientation , enshrining the same in the german constitution would have tangible advantages for the gay and lesbian community .
" homosexual couples are not able to adopt children in germany .
and ' rainbow families ' - gay and lesbian couples with biological children - do n't get the same tax breaks as heterosexual couples , " jetz said .
support in society growing article 3 of the constitution was amended for the last time in 1995 , to protect the disabled from discrimination .
at the time , there was not enough political backing to include sexual orientation to the list . but that seems to be changing .
on their web site , the lesbian and gay federation in germany lists a slew of supporters , from all walks of life - actors , politicians , even a rabbi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christopher street day is celebrated all over europe three major parties - the social democrats , the greens , and the left party - are in favor of an amendment .
but a two-thirds majority will be necessary to change the constitution and will need to include members of the conservative parties as well .
" we have to get the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- on board , " jetz said .
but the interior minister of the southern state of bavaria , joachim herrmann , has spoken out against the proposal .
the minister who belongs to the arch-conservative csu party , the sister bavarian party of the cdu , says he sees no reason to extend the constitutional protection of the family .
gay rights activists accuse the conservatives of blocking legislation that would give homosexuals more rights .
" we need the conservatives to understand that this is about protecting a minority in the population , " jetz said . " giving us more rights wo n't change anything for them . "

but in germany 's case , the real stars do n't stick with the team very long .
dw 's jefferson chase explains . when the young german eleven beat italy 1-0 in the semifinals of the event on friday , june 26 , they moved a step closer to making history .
germany may be a soccer powerhouse , but the record of the u21 national team is anything but stellar .
incredibly enough , they 've never won a major tournament - a blot that coach horst hrubesch currently wants to rectify in sweden .
still , after needing a nervy draw against england to qualify for the knock-out stage , hrubesch is n't exactly jumping for joy .
" the only thing i 'm happy about is making the semis , " the coach told dpa news agency after the england match .
" i 'm not at all satisfied with how we did it - it was way below our ambitions . "
with the german u17 and u19 teams having won their european titles , this could be the year for germany 's youth teams .
but would it signal a glorious future ahead for the adult german national team ?
probably not .
here today , gone tomorrow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year , before taking his current job , hrubesch won europe with the u19 germany 's footballing reputation is one of solidity and consistency rather than mercurial brilliance so you might expect the national soccer association , the dfb , to bring up players gradually through the various levels .
but the opposite is the case .
goalkeeping legend oliver kahn and super striker miroslav klose never played in the youth ranks , going straight into the main national team .
and while most of the current national squad did take the pitch for the u21s , very few of the real stars - michael ballack , bastian schweinsteiger or lukas podolski , for example - made more than a handful of appearances , before being promoted up to the big league .
the uefa u21 championship has only been in existence in its current form since 1978 , and it took some time for germany to take them seriously .
even into the 1990s the dfb eleven were playing with a sweeper .
as a result , germany have always gone home empty handed while italy have won europe five times , and even england - never a national side known for tournament successes - have hoisted the trophy twice .
ones to watch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany are glad oezil , r , choose to play for them instead of turkey given the german u21s ' history , the players most likely to play roles in the top squad are those who have already been called up by national coach joachim loew .
diminutive forward marko marin has n't been able to make much of a mark in sweden , but leverkusen 's gonzalo castro , stuttgart 's sami khedira and schalke goalkeeper manuel neuer have performed well .
and the star of the show has been mesut oezil , who normally plays on the wing for his club bremen but who has shone in a striker role for hrubesch , setting up both of goals in germany 's 2-nil win over finland in the group stage .
and the breakthrough player of the squad is defender jerome boateng .
boateng usually serves as right back and has struggled to keep a position in the starting line-up for his club hamburg .
but he 's drawn high marks in all his matches for the young germans playing as a central defender - a role for which hamburg might consider him when he returns from sweden .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : castro is part of germany 's multi-cultural squad those names point to an unmistakable trend within the german national team - the growing prominence of players who were born outside germany or who come from an immigrant background .
klose , podolski , both polish born , have established themselves as mainstays in germany adult national team - and they 've recently been joined by piotr trochowski .
in the u21 , eight of the current 24 members of the squad come from multi-national backgrounds .
so if germany continues the tradition of integrating younger players quickly into the main men 's team , some of hrubesch 's charges could play a role at the 2010 world cup in south africa .

jackson sold over 750 million albums in his sometimes controversial career . the 50 year-old " king of pop " was rushed to the nearby ucla medical center , and county coroner fred corral said he was unresponsive and pronounced dead soon after .
medical officers are now conducting an autopsy to check for toxicology or other problems - with results set to be published later on friday . fans the world over mourned the pop star as word of his death spread quickly . " michael jackson was weightless - a moonwalker , a transformer , a werewolf , he was n't of this world , " wrote the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung friday .
" as long as he had a handle on his weightlessness and could play with it , it was his biggest capital .

as an adult , jackson moved on to a successful - and often controversial - solo career .
this career peaked with his 1982 record " thriller , " which is the best selling album of all time . in later life jackson struggled with a series of court cases and allegations about his private life , damaging his career and his financial situation , but he remained a popular character with an enormous fan base . the german newsmagazine spiegel online wrote that jackson had two faces : one was " the monster , more alien than human , lifted , pale and in the end as emaciated as a skeleton . " on the other hand , there was " the genius that reinvented pop , sold more albums than anyone else -lrb- … -rrb- and was admired by the masses - in particular by his musical heirs , who never would have existed without his influence and who are now mourning his passing with an unequalled flood of condolence : beyonce , usher , justin timberlake , to name three of many . " at the time of his death he had been preparing for a 50-concert run in london that was meant to rejuvenate his career , and secure his financial future . " a comeback has seldom been as necessary as it was in jackson 's case , " wrote the sueddeutsche . though it 's now too late for a comeback , the troubled pop icon leaves behind a generation that has at some point tried to moonwalk and a legacy of young musicians - like beyonce and timberlake - who are carrying on in his footsteps . bildunterschrift : michael jackson in 1971 , 1977 and 1979 -lrb- from left -rrb- bildunterschrift : michael jackson 1983 , 1987 and 1990 -lrb- from left -rrb- kjb / msh , ap / dpa / afp editor : darren mara send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 3,300-kilometer -lrb- 2,000-mile -rrb- nabucco pipeline is a key energy project which will bring gas from the caspian sea to austria via turkey , bulgaria , romania and hungary .
the nabucco pipeline has been given a high priority in eu energy policy , however differences between the countries has stalled the project .
according to manager magazin , fischer 's most important job will be to keep turkey happy .
" fischer is highly regarded in turkey because he was always open to it joining the eu , " according to the article .
the pipeline 's main goal - and greatest hurdle - is to bypass russia , in a bid to reduce europe 's energy dependence on moscow .
currently , the eu gets about one-third of its energy from russia , through transit countries belarus and ukraine .
nabucco has therefore been a hot political topic between the eu and russia , with moscow doing everything it can to torpedo the process .
high-profile lobbying bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder works for russia 's competing nord stream project the russians , for their part , have been pushing for the nord stream pipeline through the north sea .
they are supported in their efforts by joschka fischer 's former boss and political ally , ex-chancellor gerhard schroeder .
just after he left office in 2005 , schroeder signed a lucrative deal with russian state-run energy giant gazprom to head the advisory board for the company 's nord stream pipeline project .
while still in office , schroeder signed the agreement to build the pipeline with his close friend vladimir putin , the current russian prime minister .
last january , schroeder also joined the board of british-russian oil firm tnk-bp .
fischer and schroeder were the leading two politicians in the seven year social democrat / green coalition government .
fischer withdrew from politics after the greens failed to win enough votes to remain in government in the 2005 elections .
since then , he has lived in the united states , working as a lecturer at princeton university. kj / afp / dpa editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they also called on a freeze in " natural growth " of existing israeli settlements and urged all parties " to re-enter direct negotiations on all standing issues consistent with the road map . "

but in germany 's case , the real stars do n't stick with the team very long .
dw 's jefferson chase explains . when the young german eleven beat italy 1-0 in the semifinals of the event on friday , june 26 , they moved a step closer to making history .
germany may be a soccer powerhouse , but the record of the u21 national team is anything but stellar .
incredibly enough , they 've never won a major tournament - a blot that coach horst hrubesch currently wants to rectify in sweden .
still , after needing a nervy draw against england to qualify for the knock-out stage , hrubesch is n't exactly jumping for joy .
" the only thing i 'm happy about is making the semis , " the coach told dpa news agency after the england match .
" i 'm not at all satisfied with how we did it - it was way below our ambitions . "
with the german u17 and u19 teams having won their european titles , this could be the year for germany 's youth teams .
but would it signal a glorious future ahead for the adult german national team ?
probably not .
here today , gone tomorrow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year , before taking his current job , hrubesch won europe with the u19 germany 's footballing reputation is one of solidity and consistency rather than mercurial brilliance so you might expect the national soccer association , the dfb , to bring up players gradually through the various levels .
but the opposite is the case .
goalkeeping legend oliver kahn and super striker miroslav klose never played in the youth ranks , going straight into the main national team .
and while most of the current national squad did take the pitch for the u21s , very few of the real stars - michael ballack , bastian schweinsteiger or lukas podolski , for example - made more than a handful of appearances , before being promoted up to the big league .
the uefa u21 championship has only been in existence in its current form since 1978 , and it took some time for germany to take them seriously .
even into the 1990s the dfb eleven were playing with a sweeper .
as a result , germany have always gone home empty handed while italy have won europe five times , and even england - never a national side known for tournament successes - have hoisted the trophy twice .
ones to watch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany are glad oezil , r , choose to play for them instead of turkey given the german u21s ' history , the players most likely to play roles in the top squad are those who have already been called up by national coach joachim loew .
diminutive forward marko marin has n't been able to make much of a mark in sweden , but leverkusen 's gonzalo castro , stuttgart 's sami khedira and schalke goalkeeper manuel neuer have performed well .
and the star of the show has been mesut oezil , who normally plays on the wing for his club bremen but who has shone in a striker role for hrubesch , setting up both of goals in germany 's 2-nil win over finland in the group stage .
and the breakthrough player of the squad is defender jerome boateng .
boateng usually serves as right back and has struggled to keep a position in the starting line-up for his club hamburg .
but he 's drawn high marks in all his matches for the young germans playing as a central defender - a role for which hamburg might consider him when he returns from sweden .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : castro is part of germany 's multi-cultural squad those names point to an unmistakable trend within the german national team - the growing prominence of players who were born outside germany or who come from an immigrant background .
klose , podolski , both polish born , have established themselves as mainstays in germany adult national team - and they 've recently been joined by piotr trochowski .
in the u21 , eight of the current 24 members of the squad come from multi-national backgrounds .
so if germany continues the tradition of integrating younger players quickly into the main men 's team , some of hrubesch 's charges could play a role at the 2010 world cup in south africa .

" we went to the absolute limit of what was acceptable to the agricultural community .

agriculture is one of the most contentious topics at the doha round of the wto talks , which was launched in the gulf state of qatar in 2001 .
rich countries , like the european union and the united states , support their farmers with subsidies , in order for the farmers to be able to make a decent profit from their products .
developing countries like india , china and other smaller countries in africa , asia and south america often produce the same agricultural products .
they can also sell them for less , because it costs them less to produce it .
for example , a farmer in bavaria makes much more than a farmer in hunan province in china .
so , in order for bavarian agricultural products to compete with chinese products , the german government pays the bavarian farmer a certain amount of money so that when the german product is on the shelf in the eu , it costs the same as the chinese product .
it can also restrict the amount of a similar product that the chinese can sell in germany , called quotas , or charge tariffs on those products .

" turkey can not accept the position of germany and france .
a privileged partnership does n't exist in -lrb- european law -rrb- , " erdogan told journalists before attending a forum in brussels , adding that turkey 's goal is full membership and any alternative " is out of the question . "
erdogan said french president nicolas sarkozy had been inconsistent , showing more openness to turkey 's accession in private talks than in public .
" our european friends unfortunately have a unilateral expectation which is rather populist and it saddens us .
i hope we will overcome this , " he said .
ankara launches diplomatic drive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan , left , faces an uphill battle on turkey 's eu entry bid turkey has mounted a diplomatic offensive aimed at boosting its chances of joining the eu , with erdogan visiting brussels twice in the span of three months .
in addition , his foreign minister , ahmet devutoglu , was also in brussels on friday to meet the eu enlargement commissioner , olli rehn , ahead of an accession conference planned for next week .
turkey 's membership was also a campaign issue in this month 's european parliament election , with some right-wing parties making gains after opposing its accession .
" some narrow-minded politicians have used turkey as election material , and we believe this to be very wrong and very populist , " erdogan said .
" we will never give up .
we are patient , we do our homework ... and we continue moving forward . "
changing the constitution erdogan 's comments come just a day after he had told journalists that plans to change the turkish constitution , key to keeping turkey 's bid for eu membership on track , are a " waste of time " as long as opposition parties keep blocking all efforts in parliament . erdogan 's comments were the clearest sign yet that his government could ditch its long standing goal of joining the 27-nation bloc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most europeans oppose turkey 's entry bid because it is a moslem country , poor , and situated mostly in asia erdogan promised after march local elections to renew efforts to revamp the 1982 constitution , drawn up under military rule , which would go a long way towards removing one of the major obstacles in ankara 's eu path . " all parties should be involved in efforts to reform the constitution , but the main opposition party rejects and blocks all efforts .
so as long as we are faced with such an approach these efforts are nothing but a waste of time .
we will have to continue with the present constitution , " erdogan said . sweden supports turkey 's eu bid the eu wants turkey to speed up political and economic reforms , including the removal of curbs on free speech , ensuring more rights for minorities and reducing the influence of the armed forces in government affairs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president sarkozy and german chancellor merkel are vocal opponents of full eu membership for turkey any sign that turkey is throwing in the towel could spell serious trouble for its membership bid and even have negative consequences for the country 's political and economic stability , analysts say .
" we are getting very close to crunch time , " said amanda akcakoca , a specialist on the issue at the european policy center in brussels .
" turkey needs to think out of the box and do something unexpected to impress europe . "
ankara ’ s bid for eu membership does , however , have the support of sweden , which takes over the six-month eu presidency on july 1 .
swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt has said his country will try its best to open a new chapter of european union membership negotiations with turkey when it takes over the rotating eu presidency next week . reinfeldt told the associated press news agency that such negotiations would be of " utmost strategic importance for europe " and pointed out the european union had promised it would negotiate with turkey .
cyprus question the process has also been slowed by ankara 's refusal to recognize eu member cyprus .
on thursday , european commission president jose manuel barroso said cypriots should seize a “ historic chance ” to reunite the mediterranean island .
" there is a unique chance this year to bring an end to this long-running conflict on european soil , " barroso told journalists .
" this chance must be taken . " cyprus was divided in a turkish invasion in 1974 after a brief greek-inspired coup .
turkey 's entry to the european union partly hinges on a peace deal in cyprus , whose greek cypriots represent the island in the bloc .
the eu unanimously began accession talks with turkey in 2005 , but since then , negotiations have slowed to a crawl with the bloc deeply divided about accepting turkey .
adding to the sense of limbo , so far only 10 of the 35 policy areas that candidates must complete have been opened , and eight of these have been frozen over the cyprus dispute. nrt / mrm / afp / ap / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" turkey can not accept the position of germany and france .
a privileged partnership does n't exist in -lrb- european law -rrb- , " erdogan told journalists before attending a forum in brussels , adding that turkey 's goal is full membership and any alternative " is out of the question . "
erdogan said french president nicolas sarkozy had been inconsistent , showing more openness to turkey 's accession in private talks than in public .
" our european friends unfortunately have a unilateral expectation which is rather populist and it saddens us .
i hope we will overcome this , " he said .

turkey 's membership was also a campaign issue in this month 's european parliament election , with some right-wing parties making gains after opposing its accession .
" some narrow-minded politicians have used turkey as election material , and we believe this to be very wrong and very populist , " erdogan said .
" we will never give up .
we are patient , we do our homework ... and we continue moving forward . "
changing the constitution erdogan 's comments come just a day after he had told journalists that plans to change the turkish constitution , key to keeping turkey 's bid for eu membership on track , are a " waste of time " as long as opposition parties keep blocking all efforts in parliament . erdogan 's comments were the clearest sign yet that his government could ditch its long standing goal of joining the 27-nation bloc .

" turkey can not accept the position of germany and france .
a privileged partnership does n't exist in -lrb- european law -rrb- , " erdogan told journalists before attending a forum in brussels , adding that turkey 's goal is full membership and any alternative " is out of the question . "
erdogan said french president nicolas sarkozy had been inconsistent , showing more openness to turkey 's accession in private talks than in public .
" our european friends unfortunately have a unilateral expectation which is rather populist and it saddens us .
i hope we will overcome this , " he said .
ankara launches diplomatic drive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan , left , faces an uphill battle on turkey 's eu entry bid turkey has mounted a diplomatic offensive aimed at boosting its chances of joining the eu , with erdogan visiting brussels twice in the span of three months .
in addition , his foreign minister , ahmet devutoglu , was also in brussels on friday to meet the eu enlargement commissioner , olli rehn , ahead of an accession conference planned for next week .
turkey 's membership was also a campaign issue in this month 's european parliament election , with some right-wing parties making gains after opposing its accession .
" some narrow-minded politicians have used turkey as election material , and we believe this to be very wrong and very populist , " erdogan said .
" we will never give up .
we are patient , we do our homework ... and we continue moving forward . "
changing the constitution erdogan 's comments come just a day after he had told journalists that plans to change the turkish constitution , key to keeping turkey 's bid for eu membership on track , are a " waste of time " as long as opposition parties keep blocking all efforts in parliament . erdogan 's comments were the clearest sign yet that his government could ditch its long standing goal of joining the 27-nation bloc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most europeans oppose turkey 's entry bid because it is a moslem country , poor , and situated mostly in asia erdogan promised after march local elections to renew efforts to revamp the 1982 constitution , drawn up under military rule , which would go a long way towards removing one of the major obstacles in ankara 's eu path . " all parties should be involved in efforts to reform the constitution , but the main opposition party rejects and blocks all efforts .
so as long as we are faced with such an approach these efforts are nothing but a waste of time .
we will have to continue with the present constitution , " erdogan said . sweden supports turkey 's eu bid the eu wants turkey to speed up political and economic reforms , including the removal of curbs on free speech , ensuring more rights for minorities and reducing the influence of the armed forces in government affairs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president sarkozy and german chancellor merkel are vocal opponents of full eu membership for turkey any sign that turkey is throwing in the towel could spell serious trouble for its membership bid and even have negative consequences for the country 's political and economic stability , analysts say .
" we are getting very close to crunch time , " said amanda akcakoca , a specialist on the issue at the european policy center in brussels .
" turkey needs to think out of the box and do something unexpected to impress europe . "
ankara ’ s bid for eu membership does , however , have the support of sweden , which takes over the six-month eu presidency on july 1 .
swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt has said his country will try its best to open a new chapter of european union membership negotiations with turkey when it takes over the rotating eu presidency next week . reinfeldt told the associated press news agency that such negotiations would be of " utmost strategic importance for europe " and pointed out the european union had promised it would negotiate with turkey .
cyprus question the process has also been slowed by ankara 's refusal to recognize eu member cyprus .
on thursday , european commission president jose manuel barroso said cypriots should seize a “ historic chance ” to reunite the mediterranean island .
" there is a unique chance this year to bring an end to this long-running conflict on european soil , " barroso told journalists .
" this chance must be taken . " cyprus was divided in a turkish invasion in 1974 after a brief greek-inspired coup .
turkey 's entry to the european union partly hinges on a peace deal in cyprus , whose greek cypriots represent the island in the bloc .
the eu unanimously began accession talks with turkey in 2005 , but since then , negotiations have slowed to a crawl with the bloc deeply divided about accepting turkey .
adding to the sense of limbo , so far only 10 of the 35 policy areas that candidates must complete have been opened , and eight of these have been frozen over the cyprus dispute. nrt / mrm / afp / ap / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trade -pipe- 26.06.2009 france , eu refuse more concessions in wto talks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agriculture subsidies are a contentious issue saying they have gone as far as they can , agricultural ministers from the eu and france say they will not make any more concessions to reach a deal at the wto talks . using language that does not allow for much negotiation , france and the european commission said that they would not make any more concessions in order to reach a deal at the world trade organization 's -lrb- wto -rrb- doha talks .
" we have tried our very best and we do n't move , " said the european union agriculture commissioner mariann fischer boel .
" we went to the absolute limit of what was acceptable to the agricultural community .
we wo n't go any further , " echoed french farm minister bruno le maire .
agriculture is one of the most contentious topics at the doha round of the wto talks , which was launched in the gulf state of qatar in 2001 .
rich countries , like the european union and the united states , support their farmers with subsidies , in order for the farmers to be able to make a decent profit from their products .
developing countries like india , china and other smaller countries in africa , asia and south america often produce the same agricultural products .
they can also sell them for less , because it costs them less to produce it .
for example , a farmer in bavaria makes much more than a farmer in hunan province in china .
so , in order for bavarian agricultural products to compete with chinese products , the german government pays the bavarian farmer a certain amount of money so that when the german product is on the shelf in the eu , it costs the same as the chinese product .
it can also restrict the amount of a similar product that the chinese can sell in germany , called quotas , or charge tariffs on those products .
who paid for that jetliner ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus ceo enders says he needs help with a350 tariffs , quotas and subsidies are all controversial ideas in world trade .
take airplanes .
the three major aircraft manufacturers in the world are boeing and lockheed in the us , and airbus in the eu .
recently the us has said that it will respond quickly and swiftly if european nations help airbus financially to launch a new plane , designated the airbus a350 .
the ceo of airbus , tom enders says that airbus needs the 11 billion euros in government financing in order for airbus to compete with boeing .
the doha round of the wto talks are ongoing and there is no resolution in sight , although wto president pascal lamy has said that negotiations are 80 percent complete .
" we must finish next year , " pascal recently told a french radio station .
“ technically , that is feasible .
politically things have taken a turn for the better . ”
in the meantime , the us and the chinese will continue to take their disagreements to the wto , the eu will look for a way to protect its farmers and still sign off on the doha agreement .
and the russians ?
one of the largest economies in the world ?
they do n't even belong to the wto although they recently said that they want to join. av / reuters / ap / afp editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

torture victims carry the burden of their experiences forever , but one therapy center in cologne seeks to make living with the memories bearable . petek t. * has been a patient at the cologne therapy center for torture victims for two years now , but the memories of her torture during her imprisonment in turkey are still very vivid .
her biggest wish is for something that many people take for granted : sleep .
" during the day , i can distract myself , " she said .
" but at night , i have problems sleeping , and nightmares .
the traumatic experiences always come back . "
petek , now 38 , was 18 when she began her university studies in her hometown of izmir in western turkey .
she wanted to become a journalist , and wrote articles for student organizations criticizing an increase of repression and the authoritarian approach of the turkish government .
she was sent to jail three times for her writing after being convicted or being a member in a forbidden organization .
her most recent imprisonment was from 1994-2002 , but even seven years later , it churns up too many memories for her to talk about .
since her time in a turkish prison , the situation of prisoners there has improved somewhat , she said , but people are still being tortured .
" people are still dying in prison under unclear circumstances , but the government denies that there is systematic torture going on in turkey , " said petek .

uenal hamidye is petek 's therapist at the therapy center , and is familiar with many cases that are similar to hers .
hamidye said torture methods are becoming increasingly psychological , and often leave behind no physical marks .
" for example , someone might come and say ' if you do n't talk , we 're going to get your wife and rape her , " ' she said .
" the people are faced with a dilemma : either they betray their organization or they have to watch as their wives , mothers , or sisters are raped . "
petek is one of many former torture victims who come to the therapy center for help .
the demand on the center 's services is so high that there is often a waiting list .
when she first arrived in germany with her husband in 2004 , petek was told she 'd have to wait one to two years to be admitted .
" a psychological crisis does n't wait , " said petek .
" i saw no more point in my life anymore .
but i had a breakdown and was brought to the clinic where the doctors put me in contact with -lrb- hamidye -rrb- .
that 's why i 'm here , and i 'm very happy about that . "
the therapy center treats between 600 and 800 torture victims each year .
the center offers individual and group therapy sessions , and also gives help in dealing with day to day life , including learning german or completing administrative tasks connected with moving to a different country .

she has concentration problems and can not work , which makes it difficult to fully embrace her new home in germany .

guest commentator susanne neubert says that we have a global responsibility to counter soil degradation and there 's no time to lose . some 70 percent of the world 's arid regions face desertification , and in around 110 countries - most of them poor - desertification threatens an area roughly the size of europe . twenty million tons of grain are lost annually due to desertification and , over the past 40 years , one third of the world 's arable land has been abandoned . even though there is no doubt about the causes of desertification , and the strategies needed to combat it are known , no turnaround is yet in sight .
why is it that neither the un desertification convention nor countless initiatives and programs have managed to halt the ongoing process of desertification ? unsustainable land management bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in many regions water for irrigation is not readily available the principal factors behind desertification are unsustainable land management and climate change .
as far as land management is concerned , incorrect farming practices also play a major role .
these include the cultivation of annual crop species , coupled with management methods that intermittently leave soils uncovered and exposed to erosion . other aspects of " incorrect " farming practices include faulty irrigation and either a total lack of fertilization or lopsided use of mineral fertilisers .
this often leads to soil mineralization , particularly in tropical regions , depriving soils of their capacity to store water .
carbon compounds , previously fixed in the soil in the form of organic matter , are released into the air in the course of the mineralization process .
this reduces the soil 's buffering capacity for drought and flooding , at the same time directly contributing to climate change . a good number of resource problems are closely interlinked : together , deforestation , species loss , climate change , growing scarcity of water resources , and the loss of organic matter in soils are responsible for desertification ; they are both its cause and effect . does this mean that we have no choice but to capitulate ?
no .
what it means is that by developing and using intelligent approaches we can achieve several goals at once .
soil conservation techniques , including erosion control walls , agro-forestry , and organic fertilization , are methods that are both effective and widely known - and these need to be applied on a larger scale . the reason why the picture continues to be dominated by individual measures is not technical in nature , indeed this must be seen as a problem bound up with economic incentives and political interests . incentives to support farmers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protecting trees can counter soil degradation since agriculture is organized primarily along private lines , soil conservation measures need to be carried out mainly by the private sector .
it is essential that incentives be set to ensure that investments in farmland yield returns , and the relatively high prices currently commanded by agricultural goods offer a good opportunity . there is considerable evidence that farmers carry out soil protection measures on their own if they lack more profitable alternatives and if the know-how and cost viability are available .
there is no lack of instructive examples , and german development cooperation offers a good number of them .
it is high time to start providing farmers in desertification-prone regions with appropriate advisory services as well as with the funds they need to transport stones to build erosion control walls , etc . , and to do so not intermittently but as a general rule . however , both agro-industry and institutional conditions also need to be modernized .
one correct and promising approach would be to encourage the agrochemical industry to gear production more to soil substrate additives . moreover , the agricultural policies of developing countries urgently need to be reoriented to reduce the fertilizer subsidies so widespread today and instead to increase the credit available in the agricultural sector .
and land rights need to be modified in such a way as to ensure that farmers have incentives to undertake soil conservation measures . no time to lose bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : modernizing the agro industry is vital in coutering the impact of climate change instead of continuing to generate vast amounts of greenhouse gases by producing and using mineral fertilizers incapable of achieving the hoped-for results on degraded soils , it would make far more sense to engage in organic agriculture keyed chiefly to on-farm resources .
this could serve to enhance soil storage capacity and - in cases where the needed organic matter is unavailable - to regenerate it by using industrially produced soil substrates .
land management of this kind tends to raise yields per unit area to earlier levels , and to do so precisely in arid regions . but is also essential to protect land at the supra-farm level , on state-owned land .
this , though , calls for a huge supply of labor .
in keeping with a proposal advanced by the united nations environment program -lrb- unep -rrb- , a " global green new deal " could be used to realize the action plans adopted to implement the un desertification convention , and in times of recession this would at the same time amount to an effective labor market policy . this should also include large-scale projects - like the building of " green walls " in china and the sahel belt - and efforts to link them with the numerous individual participatory measures already in progress , in order to achieve synergy effects . it would be important to implement measures geared at once to conservation and re-cultivation in order to come up with comprehensive measures that serve to reach several goals at the same time : protection of forests , water , climate , and soils .
this is a realistic aim in that the different organizational phases involved basically tend to correlate positively with one another . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neubert says that desertification is partly reversible how much time do we have left ?
the good news is that in many cases desertification is reversible .
the bad new is that this goes hand in hand with declining marginal utility , and when a certain stage of degradation has been reached , re-cultivation proves so labor-intensive that it is more attractive for the population to migrate to urban areas .
in other words , we have no time to lose .

torture victims carry the burden of their experiences forever , but one therapy center in cologne seeks to make living with the memories bearable . petek t. * has been a patient at the cologne therapy center for torture victims for two years now , but the memories of her torture during her imprisonment in turkey are still very vivid .
her biggest wish is for something that many people take for granted : sleep .
" during the day , i can distract myself , " she said .
" but at night , i have problems sleeping , and nightmares .
the traumatic experiences always come back . "
petek , now 38 , was 18 when she began her university studies in her hometown of izmir in western turkey .
she wanted to become a journalist , and wrote articles for student organizations criticizing an increase of repression and the authoritarian approach of the turkish government .
she was sent to jail three times for her writing after being convicted or being a member in a forbidden organization .
her most recent imprisonment was from 1994-2002 , but even seven years later , it churns up too many memories for her to talk about .
since her time in a turkish prison , the situation of prisoners there has improved somewhat , she said , but people are still being tortured .
" people are still dying in prison under unclear circumstances , but the government denies that there is systematic torture going on in turkey , " said petek .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in some places , phsychological torture has replaced traditional methods waiting list for torture therapy the cologne therapy center for torture victims was founded in 1985 as a pilot project by the un high commissioner of refugees , and is run as a charitable organization .
uenal hamidye is petek 's therapist at the therapy center , and is familiar with many cases that are similar to hers .
hamidye said torture methods are becoming increasingly psychological , and often leave behind no physical marks .
" for example , someone might come and say ' if you do n't talk , we 're going to get your wife and rape her , " ' she said .
" the people are faced with a dilemma : either they betray their organization or they have to watch as their wives , mothers , or sisters are raped . "
petek is one of many former torture victims who come to the therapy center for help .
the demand on the center 's services is so high that there is often a waiting list .
when she first arrived in germany with her husband in 2004 , petek was told she 'd have to wait one to two years to be admitted .
" a psychological crisis does n't wait , " said petek .
" i saw no more point in my life anymore .
but i had a breakdown and was brought to the clinic where the doctors put me in contact with -lrb- hamidye -rrb- .

guest commentator susanne neubert says that we have a global responsibility to counter soil degradation and there 's no time to lose . some 70 percent of the world 's arid regions face desertification , and in around 110 countries - most of them poor - desertification threatens an area roughly the size of europe . twenty million tons of grain are lost annually due to desertification and , over the past 40 years , one third of the world 's arable land has been abandoned . even though there is no doubt about the causes of desertification , and the strategies needed to combat it are known , no turnaround is yet in sight .
why is it that neither the un desertification convention nor countless initiatives and programs have managed to halt the ongoing process of desertification ? unsustainable land management bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in many regions water for irrigation is not readily available the principal factors behind desertification are unsustainable land management and climate change .
as far as land management is concerned , incorrect farming practices also play a major role .
these include the cultivation of annual crop species , coupled with management methods that intermittently leave soils uncovered and exposed to erosion . other aspects of " incorrect " farming practices include faulty irrigation and either a total lack of fertilization or lopsided use of mineral fertilisers .
this often leads to soil mineralization , particularly in tropical regions , depriving soils of their capacity to store water .
carbon compounds , previously fixed in the soil in the form of organic matter , are released into the air in the course of the mineralization process .
this reduces the soil 's buffering capacity for drought and flooding , at the same time directly contributing to climate change . a good number of resource problems are closely interlinked : together , deforestation , species loss , climate change , growing scarcity of water resources , and the loss of organic matter in soils are responsible for desertification ; they are both its cause and effect . does this mean that we have no choice but to capitulate ?
no .
what it means is that by developing and using intelligent approaches we can achieve several goals at once .
soil conservation techniques , including erosion control walls , agro-forestry , and organic fertilization , are methods that are both effective and widely known - and these need to be applied on a larger scale . the reason why the picture continues to be dominated by individual measures is not technical in nature , indeed this must be seen as a problem bound up with economic incentives and political interests . incentives to support farmers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protecting trees can counter soil degradation since agriculture is organized primarily along private lines , soil conservation measures need to be carried out mainly by the private sector .
it is essential that incentives be set to ensure that investments in farmland yield returns , and the relatively high prices currently commanded by agricultural goods offer a good opportunity . there is considerable evidence that farmers carry out soil protection measures on their own if they lack more profitable alternatives and if the know-how and cost viability are available .
there is no lack of instructive examples , and german development cooperation offers a good number of them .
it is high time to start providing farmers in desertification-prone regions with appropriate advisory services as well as with the funds they need to transport stones to build erosion control walls , etc . , and to do so not intermittently but as a general rule . however , both agro-industry and institutional conditions also need to be modernized .
one correct and promising approach would be to encourage the agrochemical industry to gear production more to soil substrate additives . moreover , the agricultural policies of developing countries urgently need to be reoriented to reduce the fertilizer subsidies so widespread today and instead to increase the credit available in the agricultural sector .
and land rights need to be modified in such a way as to ensure that farmers have incentives to undertake soil conservation measures . no time to lose bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : modernizing the agro industry is vital in coutering the impact of climate change instead of continuing to generate vast amounts of greenhouse gases by producing and using mineral fertilizers incapable of achieving the hoped-for results on degraded soils , it would make far more sense to engage in organic agriculture keyed chiefly to on-farm resources .
this could serve to enhance soil storage capacity and - in cases where the needed organic matter is unavailable - to regenerate it by using industrially produced soil substrates .
land management of this kind tends to raise yields per unit area to earlier levels , and to do so precisely in arid regions . but is also essential to protect land at the supra-farm level , on state-owned land .
this , though , calls for a huge supply of labor .
in keeping with a proposal advanced by the united nations environment program -lrb- unep -rrb- , a " global green new deal " could be used to realize the action plans adopted to implement the un desertification convention , and in times of recession this would at the same time amount to an effective labor market policy . this should also include large-scale projects - like the building of " green walls " in china and the sahel belt - and efforts to link them with the numerous individual participatory measures already in progress , in order to achieve synergy effects . it would be important to implement measures geared at once to conservation and re-cultivation in order to come up with comprehensive measures that serve to reach several goals at the same time : protection of forests , water , climate , and soils .
this is a realistic aim in that the different organizational phases involved basically tend to correlate positively with one another . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neubert says that desertification is partly reversible how much time do we have left ?
the good news is that in many cases desertification is reversible .
the bad new is that this goes hand in hand with declining marginal utility , and when a certain stage of degradation has been reached , re-cultivation proves so labor-intensive that it is more attractive for the population to migrate to urban areas .
in other words , we have no time to lose .
this is not a question of " aid " but of global responsibility . author : dr.susanne neubert / -lrb- ara -rrb- editor : kate bowen dr. susanne neubert is a senior researcher at the german development institute -lrb- deutsches institut für entwicklungspolitik - die -rrb- , which is a multi-disciplinary think-tank for german and multilateral development policy .

it is essential that incentives be set to ensure that investments in farmland yield returns , and the relatively high prices currently commanded by agricultural goods offer a good opportunity . there is considerable evidence that farmers carry out soil protection measures on their own if they lack more profitable alternatives and if the know-how and cost viability are available .
there is no lack of instructive examples , and german development cooperation offers a good number of them .
it is high time to start providing farmers in desertification-prone regions with appropriate advisory services as well as with the funds they need to transport stones to build erosion control walls , etc . , and to do so not intermittently but as a general rule . however , both agro-industry and institutional conditions also need to be modernized .
one correct and promising approach would be to encourage the agrochemical industry to gear production more to soil substrate additives . moreover , the agricultural policies of developing countries urgently need to be reoriented to reduce the fertilizer subsidies so widespread today and instead to increase the credit available in the agricultural sector .
and land rights need to be modified in such a way as to ensure that farmers have incentives to undertake soil conservation measures . no time to lose bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : modernizing the agro industry is vital in coutering the impact of climate change instead of continuing to generate vast amounts of greenhouse gases by producing and using mineral fertilizers incapable of achieving the hoped-for results on degraded soils , it would make far more sense to engage in organic agriculture keyed chiefly to on-farm resources .
this could serve to enhance soil storage capacity and - in cases where the needed organic matter is unavailable - to regenerate it by using industrially produced soil substrates .
land management of this kind tends to raise yields per unit area to earlier levels , and to do so precisely in arid regions . but is also essential to protect land at the supra-farm level , on state-owned land .
this , though , calls for a huge supply of labor .
in keeping with a proposal advanced by the united nations environment program -lrb- unep -rrb- , a " global green new deal " could be used to realize the action plans adopted to implement the un desertification convention , and in times of recession this would at the same time amount to an effective labor market policy . this should also include large-scale projects - like the building of " green walls " in china and the sahel belt - and efforts to link them with the numerous individual participatory measures already in progress , in order to achieve synergy effects . it would be important to implement measures geared at once to conservation and re-cultivation in order to come up with comprehensive measures that serve to reach several goals at the same time : protection of forests , water , climate , and soils .
this is a realistic aim in that the different organizational phases involved basically tend to correlate positively with one another . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neubert says that desertification is partly reversible how much time do we have left ?

guest commentator susanne neubert says that we have a global responsibility to counter soil degradation and there 's no time to lose . some 70 percent of the world 's arid regions face desertification , and in around 110 countries - most of them poor - desertification threatens an area roughly the size of europe . twenty million tons of grain are lost annually due to desertification and , over the past 40 years , one third of the world 's arable land has been abandoned . even though there is no doubt about the causes of desertification , and the strategies needed to combat it are known , no turnaround is yet in sight .
why is it that neither the un desertification convention nor countless initiatives and programs have managed to halt the ongoing process of desertification ? unsustainable land management bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in many regions water for irrigation is not readily available the principal factors behind desertification are unsustainable land management and climate change .
as far as land management is concerned , incorrect farming practices also play a major role .
these include the cultivation of annual crop species , coupled with management methods that intermittently leave soils uncovered and exposed to erosion . other aspects of " incorrect " farming practices include faulty irrigation and either a total lack of fertilization or lopsided use of mineral fertilisers .
this often leads to soil mineralization , particularly in tropical regions , depriving soils of their capacity to store water .
carbon compounds , previously fixed in the soil in the form of organic matter , are released into the air in the course of the mineralization process .
this reduces the soil 's buffering capacity for drought and flooding , at the same time directly contributing to climate change . a good number of resource problems are closely interlinked : together , deforestation , species loss , climate change , growing scarcity of water resources , and the loss of organic matter in soils are responsible for desertification ; they are both its cause and effect . does this mean that we have no choice but to capitulate ?
no .
what it means is that by developing and using intelligent approaches we can achieve several goals at once .
soil conservation techniques , including erosion control walls , agro-forestry , and organic fertilization , are methods that are both effective and widely known - and these need to be applied on a larger scale . the reason why the picture continues to be dominated by individual measures is not technical in nature , indeed this must be seen as a problem bound up with economic incentives and political interests . incentives to support farmers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protecting trees can counter soil degradation since agriculture is organized primarily along private lines , soil conservation measures need to be carried out mainly by the private sector .

torture victims carry the burden of their experiences forever , but one therapy center in cologne seeks to make living with the memories bearable . petek t. * has been a patient at the cologne therapy center for torture victims for two years now , but the memories of her torture during her imprisonment in turkey are still very vivid .
her biggest wish is for something that many people take for granted : sleep .
" during the day , i can distract myself , " she said .
" but at night , i have problems sleeping , and nightmares .
the traumatic experiences always come back . "
petek , now 38 , was 18 when she began her university studies in her hometown of izmir in western turkey .
she wanted to become a journalist , and wrote articles for student organizations criticizing an increase of repression and the authoritarian approach of the turkish government .
she was sent to jail three times for her writing after being convicted or being a member in a forbidden organization .
her most recent imprisonment was from 1994-2002 , but even seven years later , it churns up too many memories for her to talk about .
since her time in a turkish prison , the situation of prisoners there has improved somewhat , she said , but people are still being tortured .
" people are still dying in prison under unclear circumstances , but the government denies that there is systematic torture going on in turkey , " said petek .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in some places , phsychological torture has replaced traditional methods waiting list for torture therapy the cologne therapy center for torture victims was founded in 1985 as a pilot project by the un high commissioner of refugees , and is run as a charitable organization .
uenal hamidye is petek 's therapist at the therapy center , and is familiar with many cases that are similar to hers .
hamidye said torture methods are becoming increasingly psychological , and often leave behind no physical marks .
" for example , someone might come and say ' if you do n't talk , we 're going to get your wife and rape her , " ' she said .
" the people are faced with a dilemma : either they betray their organization or they have to watch as their wives , mothers , or sisters are raped . "
petek is one of many former torture victims who come to the therapy center for help .
the demand on the center 's services is so high that there is often a waiting list .
when she first arrived in germany with her husband in 2004 , petek was told she 'd have to wait one to two years to be admitted .
" a psychological crisis does n't wait , " said petek .
" i saw no more point in my life anymore .
but i had a breakdown and was brought to the clinic where the doctors put me in contact with -lrb- hamidye -rrb- .
that 's why i 'm here , and i 'm very happy about that . "
the therapy center treats between 600 and 800 torture victims each year .
the center offers individual and group therapy sessions , and also gives help in dealing with day to day life , including learning german or completing administrative tasks connected with moving to a different country .
no ' getting back to normal ' for torture victims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un human rights commissioner navanethem pillay has called for the prohibition of torture brigitte brand-wilhelmy , director of the therapy center , said that most of the current patients come from iran , iraq , certain african nations , and particularly from former yugoslavia . " we have women here who lost their entire families in massacres , " brand-wilhelmy said .
" they watched as their siblings and parents were murdered .
we hear stories where it is hard to imagine how people can do such things to one another . "
it takes a lot of time for torture victims to recover from their experiences , and petek is still working through the effects of what was done to her .
it 's not just nightmares , either .
her therapist has told her she is suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder .
she has concentration problems and can not work , which makes it difficult to fully embrace her new home in germany .
" every day is a struggle , " petek said .
" my husband and i do n't have family or friends here , we only have each other .
because of the effects of the torture , it is hard to learn new things ; at the moment , learning german is taking quite a while .
we 'd love to get adjusted to living in germany , but it 's difficult . " * her last name has been withheld for privacy reasons .

public gay pride demonstrations , known as christopher street day , are held every summer in cities around the world to commemorate the event .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amendments to the constitution are the focus of this year 's christopher street day parades klaus jetz , head of the lesbian and gay federation in germany -lrb- lsvd -rrb- , told deutsche welle that the political focus of this year 's christopher street day parades , which will begin this weekend in berlin , will be on amending article 3 of the german constitution .
" getting the anti-discrimination amendment passed has been an important topic for the organization since our founding in 1990 , " he said . " it is great that we have finally managed to rally support for this topic beyond our own community , within the political sphere . "
this week , the german parliament voted to push for a federal initiative to make additions to article 3 of the constitution , which protects citizens against discrimination based on gender , race , or religion .
they want , among other things , to add sexual orientation to that list .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's mayor klaus wowereit was one of the first politicians to publicly come out of the closet social democrat klaus wowereit , berlin 's openly homosexual mayor , spoke out in favor of the amendment .
in an interview with the german news agency dpa , wowereit said he whole-heartedly supported the initiative .
he called the laws passed to allow homosexual civil partnerships a " milestone , " but said that there was still judicial room for improvement .
same responsibilities , different rights wowereit took the lead from his party colleague , justice minister brigitte zypries .
in an interview with the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , zypries said that changing article 3 and article 6 of the constitution - which protects the institution of marriage and the family - would send " a clear signal " to society .
while german federal law gives homosexuals the right to enter a civil partnership , they do n't enjoy the same rights as heterosexual married couples when it comes to taxes , retirement , civil servant benefits , or adoption law .
zypries said that homosexual couples have the same responsibilities , but not the same rights as heterosexuals .
" i find this to be incredibly unjust , both on human and on judicial grounds , " the newspaper quoted zypries as saying .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civil unions are important for couples but do not grant the same rights as marriage taking a stand klaus jetz from the lesbian and gay federation in germany -lrb- lsvd -rrb- said that although both the european parliament and the european commission have taken a clear stance against discrimination based on sexual orientation , enshrining the same in the german constitution would have tangible advantages for the gay and lesbian community .
" homosexual couples are not able to adopt children in germany .
and ' rainbow families ' - gay and lesbian couples with biological children - do n't get the same tax breaks as heterosexual couples , " jetz said .
support in society growing article 3 of the constitution was amended for the last time in 1995 , to protect the disabled from discrimination .
at the time , there was not enough political backing to include sexual orientation to the list . but that seems to be changing .
on their web site , the lesbian and gay federation in germany lists a slew of supporters , from all walks of life - actors , politicians , even a rabbi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christopher street day is celebrated all over europe three major parties - the social democrats , the greens , and the left party - are in favor of an amendment .
but a two-thirds majority will be necessary to change the constitution and will need to include members of the conservative parties as well .
" we have to get the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- on board , " jetz said .
but the interior minister of the southern state of bavaria , joachim herrmann , has spoken out against the proposal .
the minister who belongs to the arch-conservative csu party , the sister bavarian party of the cdu , says he sees no reason to extend the constitutional protection of the family .
gay rights activists accuse the conservatives of blocking legislation that would give homosexuals more rights .
" we need the conservatives to understand that this is about protecting a minority in the population , " jetz said . " giving us more rights wo n't change anything for them . "

public gay pride demonstrations , known as christopher street day , are held every summer in cities around the world to commemorate the event .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amendments to the constitution are the focus of this year 's christopher street day parades klaus jetz , head of the lesbian and gay federation in germany -lrb- lsvd -rrb- , told deutsche welle that the political focus of this year 's christopher street day parades , which will begin this weekend in berlin , will be on amending article 3 of the german constitution .
" getting the anti-discrimination amendment passed has been an important topic for the organization since our founding in 1990 , " he said . " it is great that we have finally managed to rally support for this topic beyond our own community , within the political sphere . "
this week , the german parliament voted to push for a federal initiative to make additions to article 3 of the constitution , which protects citizens against discrimination based on gender , race , or religion .
they want , among other things , to add sexual orientation to that list .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's mayor klaus wowereit was one of the first politicians to publicly come out of the closet social democrat klaus wowereit , berlin 's openly homosexual mayor , spoke out in favor of the amendment .
in an interview with the german news agency dpa , wowereit said he whole-heartedly supported the initiative .
he called the laws passed to allow homosexual civil partnerships a " milestone , " but said that there was still judicial room for improvement .
same responsibilities , different rights wowereit took the lead from his party colleague , justice minister brigitte zypries .
in an interview with the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , zypries said that changing article 3 and article 6 of the constitution - which protects the institution of marriage and the family - would send " a clear signal " to society .
while german federal law gives homosexuals the right to enter a civil partnership , they do n't enjoy the same rights as heterosexual married couples when it comes to taxes , retirement , civil servant benefits , or adoption law .
zypries said that homosexual couples have the same responsibilities , but not the same rights as heterosexuals .
" i find this to be incredibly unjust , both on human and on judicial grounds , " the newspaper quoted zypries as saying .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civil unions are important for couples but do not grant the same rights as marriage taking a stand klaus jetz from the lesbian and gay federation in germany -lrb- lsvd -rrb- said that although both the european parliament and the european commission have taken a clear stance against discrimination based on sexual orientation , enshrining the same in the german constitution would have tangible advantages for the gay and lesbian community .
" homosexual couples are not able to adopt children in germany .
and ' rainbow families ' - gay and lesbian couples with biological children - do n't get the same tax breaks as heterosexual couples , " jetz said .
support in society growing article 3 of the constitution was amended for the last time in 1995 , to protect the disabled from discrimination .
at the time , there was not enough political backing to include sexual orientation to the list . but that seems to be changing .
on their web site , the lesbian and gay federation in germany lists a slew of supporters , from all walks of life - actors , politicians , even a rabbi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christopher street day is celebrated all over europe three major parties - the social democrats , the greens , and the left party - are in favor of an amendment .
but a two-thirds majority will be necessary to change the constitution and will need to include members of the conservative parties as well .
" we have to get the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- on board , " jetz said .
but the interior minister of the southern state of bavaria , joachim herrmann , has spoken out against the proposal .
the minister who belongs to the arch-conservative csu party , the sister bavarian party of the cdu , says he sees no reason to extend the constitutional protection of the family .
gay rights activists accuse the conservatives of blocking legislation that would give homosexuals more rights .
" we need the conservatives to understand that this is about protecting a minority in the population , " jetz said . " giving us more rights wo n't change anything for them . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internationals -pipe- 26.06.2009 under 21s provide a mixed picture of germany 's footballing future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these young men are trying to become the most successful german u21 team ever the 2009 u21 european championships are being touted as a chance to see tomorrow 's stars today .
but in germany 's case , the real stars do n't stick with the team very long .
dw 's jefferson chase explains . when the young german eleven beat italy 1-0 in the semifinals of the event on friday , june 26 , they moved a step closer to making history .
germany may be a soccer powerhouse , but the record of the u21 national team is anything but stellar .
incredibly enough , they 've never won a major tournament - a blot that coach horst hrubesch currently wants to rectify in sweden .
still , after needing a nervy draw against england to qualify for the knock-out stage , hrubesch is n't exactly jumping for joy .
" the only thing i 'm happy about is making the semis , " the coach told dpa news agency after the england match .
" i 'm not at all satisfied with how we did it - it was way below our ambitions . "
with the german u17 and u19 teams having won their european titles , this could be the year for germany 's youth teams .
but would it signal a glorious future ahead for the adult german national team ?
probably not .
here today , gone tomorrow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year , before taking his current job , hrubesch won europe with the u19 germany 's footballing reputation is one of solidity and consistency rather than mercurial brilliance so you might expect the national soccer association , the dfb , to bring up players gradually through the various levels .
but the opposite is the case .
goalkeeping legend oliver kahn and super striker miroslav klose never played in the youth ranks , going straight into the main national team .
and while most of the current national squad did take the pitch for the u21s , very few of the real stars - michael ballack , bastian schweinsteiger or lukas podolski , for example - made more than a handful of appearances , before being promoted up to the big league .
the uefa u21 championship has only been in existence in its current form since 1978 , and it took some time for germany to take them seriously .
even into the 1990s the dfb eleven were playing with a sweeper .
as a result , germany have always gone home empty handed while italy have won europe five times , and even england - never a national side known for tournament successes - have hoisted the trophy twice .
ones to watch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany are glad oezil , r , choose to play for them instead of turkey given the german u21s ' history , the players most likely to play roles in the top squad are those who have already been called up by national coach joachim loew .
diminutive forward marko marin has n't been able to make much of a mark in sweden , but leverkusen 's gonzalo castro , stuttgart 's sami khedira and schalke goalkeeper manuel neuer have performed well .
and the star of the show has been mesut oezil , who normally plays on the wing for his club bremen but who has shone in a striker role for hrubesch , setting up both of goals in germany 's 2-nil win over finland in the group stage .
and the breakthrough player of the squad is defender jerome boateng .
boateng usually serves as right back and has struggled to keep a position in the starting line-up for his club hamburg .
but he 's drawn high marks in all his matches for the young germans playing as a central defender - a role for which hamburg might consider him when he returns from sweden .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : castro is part of germany 's multi-cultural squad those names point to an unmistakable trend within the german national team - the growing prominence of players who were born outside germany or who come from an immigrant background .
klose , podolski , both polish born , have established themselves as mainstays in germany adult national team - and they 've recently been joined by piotr trochowski .
in the u21 , eight of the current 24 members of the squad come from multi-national backgrounds .
so if germany continues the tradition of integrating younger players quickly into the main men 's team , some of hrubesch 's charges could play a role at the 2010 world cup in south africa .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 26.06.2009 cologne therapy center helps torture victims get their lives back großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : torture is carried out in prisons and detention centers in many countries june 26 is the un international day in support of victims of torture .
torture victims carry the burden of their experiences forever , but one therapy center in cologne seeks to make living with the memories bearable . petek t. * has been a patient at the cologne therapy center for torture victims for two years now , but the memories of her torture during her imprisonment in turkey are still very vivid .
her biggest wish is for something that many people take for granted : sleep .
" during the day , i can distract myself , " she said .
" but at night , i have problems sleeping , and nightmares .
the traumatic experiences always come back . "
petek , now 38 , was 18 when she began her university studies in her hometown of izmir in western turkey .
she wanted to become a journalist , and wrote articles for student organizations criticizing an increase of repression and the authoritarian approach of the turkish government .
she was sent to jail three times for her writing after being convicted or being a member in a forbidden organization .
her most recent imprisonment was from 1994-2002 , but even seven years later , it churns up too many memories for her to talk about .
since her time in a turkish prison , the situation of prisoners there has improved somewhat , she said , but people are still being tortured .
" people are still dying in prison under unclear circumstances , but the government denies that there is systematic torture going on in turkey , " said petek .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in some places , phsychological torture has replaced traditional methods waiting list for torture therapy the cologne therapy center for torture victims was founded in 1985 as a pilot project by the un high commissioner of refugees , and is run as a charitable organization .
uenal hamidye is petek 's therapist at the therapy center , and is familiar with many cases that are similar to hers .
hamidye said torture methods are becoming increasingly psychological , and often leave behind no physical marks .
" for example , someone might come and say ' if you do n't talk , we 're going to get your wife and rape her , " ' she said .
" the people are faced with a dilemma : either they betray their organization or they have to watch as their wives , mothers , or sisters are raped . "
petek is one of many former torture victims who come to the therapy center for help .
the demand on the center 's services is so high that there is often a waiting list .
when she first arrived in germany with her husband in 2004 , petek was told she 'd have to wait one to two years to be admitted .
" a psychological crisis does n't wait , " said petek .
" i saw no more point in my life anymore .
but i had a breakdown and was brought to the clinic where the doctors put me in contact with -lrb- hamidye -rrb- .
that 's why i 'm here , and i 'm very happy about that . "
the therapy center treats between 600 and 800 torture victims each year .
the center offers individual and group therapy sessions , and also gives help in dealing with day to day life , including learning german or completing administrative tasks connected with moving to a different country .
no ' getting back to normal ' for torture victims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un human rights commissioner navanethem pillay has called for the prohibition of torture brigitte brand-wilhelmy , director of the therapy center , said that most of the current patients come from iran , iraq , certain african nations , and particularly from former yugoslavia . " we have women here who lost their entire families in massacres , " brand-wilhelmy said .
" they watched as their siblings and parents were murdered .
we hear stories where it is hard to imagine how people can do such things to one another . "
it takes a lot of time for torture victims to recover from their experiences , and petek is still working through the effects of what was done to her .
it 's not just nightmares , either .
her therapist has told her she is suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder .
she has concentration problems and can not work , which makes it difficult to fully embrace her new home in germany .
" every day is a struggle , " petek said .
" my husband and i do n't have family or friends here , we only have each other .
because of the effects of the torture , it is hard to learn new things ; at the moment , learning german is taking quite a while .
we 'd love to get adjusted to living in germany , but it 's difficult . " * her last name has been withheld for privacy reasons .

petek , now 38 , was 18 when she began her university studies in her hometown of izmir in western turkey .
she wanted to become a journalist , and wrote articles for student organizations criticizing an increase of repression and the authoritarian approach of the turkish government .
she was sent to jail three times for her writing after being convicted or being a member in a forbidden organization .
her most recent imprisonment was from 1994-2002 , but even seven years later , it churns up too many memories for her to talk about .
since her time in a turkish prison , the situation of prisoners there has improved somewhat , she said , but people are still being tortured .
" people are still dying in prison under unclear circumstances , but the government denies that there is systematic torture going on in turkey , " said petek .

uenal hamidye is petek 's therapist at the therapy center , and is familiar with many cases that are similar to hers .
hamidye said torture methods are becoming increasingly psychological , and often leave behind no physical marks .
" for example , someone might come and say ' if you do n't talk , we 're going to get your wife and rape her , " ' she said .
" the people are faced with a dilemma : either they betray their organization or they have to watch as their wives , mothers , or sisters are raped . "
petek is one of many former torture victims who come to the therapy center for help .
the demand on the center 's services is so high that there is often a waiting list .
when she first arrived in germany with her husband in 2004 , petek was told she 'd have to wait one to two years to be admitted .
" a psychological crisis does n't wait , " said petek .
" i saw no more point in my life anymore .

that 's why i 'm here , and i 'm very happy about that . "

" the people are faced with a dilemma : either they betray their organization or they have to watch as their wives , mothers , or sisters are raped . "
petek is one of many former torture victims who come to the therapy center for help .
the demand on the center 's services is so high that there is often a waiting list .
when she first arrived in germany with her husband in 2004 , petek was told she 'd have to wait one to two years to be admitted .
" a psychological crisis does n't wait , " said petek .
" i saw no more point in my life anymore .
but i had a breakdown and was brought to the clinic where the doctors put me in contact with -lrb- hamidye -rrb- .
that 's why i 'm here , and i 'm very happy about that . "
the therapy center treats between 600 and 800 torture victims each year .
the center offers individual and group therapy sessions , and also gives help in dealing with day to day life , including learning german or completing administrative tasks connected with moving to a different country .
no ' getting back to normal ' for torture victims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un human rights commissioner navanethem pillay has called for the prohibition of torture brigitte brand-wilhelmy , director of the therapy center , said that most of the current patients come from iran , iraq , certain african nations , and particularly from former yugoslavia . " we have women here who lost their entire families in massacres , " brand-wilhelmy said .
" they watched as their siblings and parents were murdered .
we hear stories where it is hard to imagine how people can do such things to one another . "
it takes a lot of time for torture victims to recover from their experiences , and petek is still working through the effects of what was done to her .
it 's not just nightmares , either .
her therapist has told her she is suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder .
she has concentration problems and can not work , which makes it difficult to fully embrace her new home in germany .
" every day is a struggle , " petek said .
" my husband and i do n't have family or friends here , we only have each other .
because of the effects of the torture , it is hard to learn new things ; at the moment , learning german is taking quite a while .
we 'd love to get adjusted to living in germany , but it 's difficult . " * her last name has been withheld for privacy reasons .

" we have tried our very best and we do n't move , " said the european union agriculture commissioner mariann fischer boel .
" we went to the absolute limit of what was acceptable to the agricultural community .
we wo n't go any further , " echoed french farm minister bruno le maire .
agriculture is one of the most contentious topics at the doha round of the wto talks , which was launched in the gulf state of qatar in 2001 .
rich countries , like the european union and the united states , support their farmers with subsidies , in order for the farmers to be able to make a decent profit from their products .
developing countries like india , china and other smaller countries in africa , asia and south america often produce the same agricultural products .
they can also sell them for less , because it costs them less to produce it .
for example , a farmer in bavaria makes much more than a farmer in hunan province in china .
so , in order for bavarian agricultural products to compete with chinese products , the german government pays the bavarian farmer a certain amount of money so that when the german product is on the shelf in the eu , it costs the same as the chinese product .
it can also restrict the amount of a similar product that the chinese can sell in germany , called quotas , or charge tariffs on those products .
who paid for that jetliner ?

the ceo of airbus , tom enders says that airbus needs the 11 billion euros in government financing in order for airbus to compete with boeing .

" we have tried our very best and we do n't move , " said the european union agriculture commissioner mariann fischer boel .
" we went to the absolute limit of what was acceptable to the agricultural community .
we wo n't go any further , " echoed french farm minister bruno le maire .
agriculture is one of the most contentious topics at the doha round of the wto talks , which was launched in the gulf state of qatar in 2001 .
rich countries , like the european union and the united states , support their farmers with subsidies , in order for the farmers to be able to make a decent profit from their products .
developing countries like india , china and other smaller countries in africa , asia and south america often produce the same agricultural products .
they can also sell them for less , because it costs them less to produce it .
for example , a farmer in bavaria makes much more than a farmer in hunan province in china .
so , in order for bavarian agricultural products to compete with chinese products , the german government pays the bavarian farmer a certain amount of money so that when the german product is on the shelf in the eu , it costs the same as the chinese product .
it can also restrict the amount of a similar product that the chinese can sell in germany , called quotas , or charge tariffs on those products .
who paid for that jetliner ?

the three major aircraft manufacturers in the world are boeing and lockheed in the us , and airbus in the eu .
recently the us has said that it will respond quickly and swiftly if european nations help airbus financially to launch a new plane , designated the airbus a350 .
the ceo of airbus , tom enders says that airbus needs the 11 billion euros in government financing in order for airbus to compete with boeing .
the doha round of the wto talks are ongoing and there is no resolution in sight , although wto president pascal lamy has said that negotiations are 80 percent complete .
" we must finish next year , " pascal recently told a french radio station .
“ technically , that is feasible .
politically things have taken a turn for the better . ”
in the meantime , the us and the chinese will continue to take their disagreements to the wto , the eu will look for a way to protect its farmers and still sign off on the doha agreement .

the 3,300-kilometer -lrb- 2,000-mile -rrb- nabucco pipeline is a key energy project which will bring gas from the caspian sea to austria via turkey , bulgaria , romania and hungary .

the 3,300-kilometer -lrb- 2,000-mile -rrb- nabucco pipeline is a key energy project which will bring gas from the caspian sea to austria via turkey , bulgaria , romania and hungary .
the nabucco pipeline has been given a high priority in eu energy policy , however differences between the countries has stalled the project .
according to manager magazin , fischer 's most important job will be to keep turkey happy .
" fischer is highly regarded in turkey because he was always open to it joining the eu , " according to the article .
the pipeline 's main goal - and greatest hurdle - is to bypass russia , in a bid to reduce europe 's energy dependence on moscow .
currently , the eu gets about one-third of its energy from russia , through transit countries belarus and ukraine .
nabucco has therefore been a hot political topic between the eu and russia , with moscow doing everything it can to torpedo the process .
high-profile lobbying bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder works for russia 's competing nord stream project the russians , for their part , have been pushing for the nord stream pipeline through the north sea .
they are supported in their efforts by joschka fischer 's former boss and political ally , ex-chancellor gerhard schroeder .
just after he left office in 2005 , schroeder signed a lucrative deal with russian state-run energy giant gazprom to head the advisory board for the company 's nord stream pipeline project .
while still in office , schroeder signed the agreement to build the pipeline with his close friend vladimir putin , the current russian prime minister .
last january , schroeder also joined the board of british-russian oil firm tnk-bp .
fischer and schroeder were the leading two politicians in the seven year social democrat / green coalition government .
fischer withdrew from politics after the greens failed to win enough votes to remain in government in the 2005 elections .

public gay pride demonstrations , known as christopher street day , are held every summer in cities around the world to commemorate the event .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amendments to the constitution are the focus of this year 's christopher street day parades klaus jetz , head of the lesbian and gay federation in germany -lrb- lsvd -rrb- , told deutsche welle that the political focus of this year 's christopher street day parades , which will begin this weekend in berlin , will be on amending article 3 of the german constitution .
" getting the anti-discrimination amendment passed has been an important topic for the organization since our founding in 1990 , " he said . " it is great that we have finally managed to rally support for this topic beyond our own community , within the political sphere . "
this week , the german parliament voted to push for a federal initiative to make additions to article 3 of the constitution , which protects citizens against discrimination based on gender , race , or religion .
they want , among other things , to add sexual orientation to that list .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's mayor klaus wowereit was one of the first politicians to publicly come out of the closet social democrat klaus wowereit , berlin 's openly homosexual mayor , spoke out in favor of the amendment .
in an interview with the german news agency dpa , wowereit said he whole-heartedly supported the initiative .
he called the laws passed to allow homosexual civil partnerships a " milestone , " but said that there was still judicial room for improvement .
same responsibilities , different rights wowereit took the lead from his party colleague , justice minister brigitte zypries .
in an interview with the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , zypries said that changing article 3 and article 6 of the constitution - which protects the institution of marriage and the family - would send " a clear signal " to society .
while german federal law gives homosexuals the right to enter a civil partnership , they do n't enjoy the same rights as heterosexual married couples when it comes to taxes , retirement , civil servant benefits , or adoption law .
zypries said that homosexual couples have the same responsibilities , but not the same rights as heterosexuals .
" i find this to be incredibly unjust , both on human and on judicial grounds , " the newspaper quoted zypries as saying .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civil unions are important for couples but do not grant the same rights as marriage taking a stand klaus jetz from the lesbian and gay federation in germany -lrb- lsvd -rrb- said that although both the european parliament and the european commission have taken a clear stance against discrimination based on sexual orientation , enshrining the same in the german constitution would have tangible advantages for the gay and lesbian community .
" homosexual couples are not able to adopt children in germany .
and ' rainbow families ' - gay and lesbian couples with biological children - do n't get the same tax breaks as heterosexual couples , " jetz said .
support in society growing article 3 of the constitution was amended for the last time in 1995 , to protect the disabled from discrimination .
at the time , there was not enough political backing to include sexual orientation to the list . but that seems to be changing .
on their web site , the lesbian and gay federation in germany lists a slew of supporters , from all walks of life - actors , politicians , even a rabbi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christopher street day is celebrated all over europe three major parties - the social democrats , the greens , and the left party - are in favor of an amendment .
but a two-thirds majority will be necessary to change the constitution and will need to include members of the conservative parties as well .
" we have to get the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- on board , " jetz said .
but the interior minister of the southern state of bavaria , joachim herrmann , has spoken out against the proposal .
the minister who belongs to the arch-conservative csu party , the sister bavarian party of the cdu , says he sees no reason to extend the constitutional protection of the family .
gay rights activists accuse the conservatives of blocking legislation that would give homosexuals more rights .
" we need the conservatives to understand that this is about protecting a minority in the population , " jetz said . " giving us more rights wo n't change anything for them . "

but in germany 's case , the real stars do n't stick with the team very long .
dw 's jefferson chase explains . when the young german eleven beat italy 1-0 in the semifinals of the event on friday , june 26 , they moved a step closer to making history .
germany may be a soccer powerhouse , but the record of the u21 national team is anything but stellar .
incredibly enough , they 've never won a major tournament - a blot that coach horst hrubesch currently wants to rectify in sweden .
still , after needing a nervy draw against england to qualify for the knock-out stage , hrubesch is n't exactly jumping for joy .
" the only thing i 'm happy about is making the semis , " the coach told dpa news agency after the england match .
" i 'm not at all satisfied with how we did it - it was way below our ambitions . "
with the german u17 and u19 teams having won their european titles , this could be the year for germany 's youth teams .
but would it signal a glorious future ahead for the adult german national team ?
probably not .
here today , gone tomorrow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year , before taking his current job , hrubesch won europe with the u19 germany 's footballing reputation is one of solidity and consistency rather than mercurial brilliance so you might expect the national soccer association , the dfb , to bring up players gradually through the various levels .
but the opposite is the case .
goalkeeping legend oliver kahn and super striker miroslav klose never played in the youth ranks , going straight into the main national team .
and while most of the current national squad did take the pitch for the u21s , very few of the real stars - michael ballack , bastian schweinsteiger or lukas podolski , for example - made more than a handful of appearances , before being promoted up to the big league .
the uefa u21 championship has only been in existence in its current form since 1978 , and it took some time for germany to take them seriously .
even into the 1990s the dfb eleven were playing with a sweeper .
as a result , germany have always gone home empty handed while italy have won europe five times , and even england - never a national side known for tournament successes - have hoisted the trophy twice .
ones to watch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany are glad oezil , r , choose to play for them instead of turkey given the german u21s ' history , the players most likely to play roles in the top squad are those who have already been called up by national coach joachim loew .
diminutive forward marko marin has n't been able to make much of a mark in sweden , but leverkusen 's gonzalo castro , stuttgart 's sami khedira and schalke goalkeeper manuel neuer have performed well .
and the star of the show has been mesut oezil , who normally plays on the wing for his club bremen but who has shone in a striker role for hrubesch , setting up both of goals in germany 's 2-nil win over finland in the group stage .
and the breakthrough player of the squad is defender jerome boateng .
boateng usually serves as right back and has struggled to keep a position in the starting line-up for his club hamburg .
but he 's drawn high marks in all his matches for the young germans playing as a central defender - a role for which hamburg might consider him when he returns from sweden .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : castro is part of germany 's multi-cultural squad those names point to an unmistakable trend within the german national team - the growing prominence of players who were born outside germany or who come from an immigrant background .
klose , podolski , both polish born , have established themselves as mainstays in germany adult national team - and they 've recently been joined by piotr trochowski .
in the u21 , eight of the current 24 members of the squad come from multi-national backgrounds .
so if germany continues the tradition of integrating younger players quickly into the main men 's team , some of hrubesch 's charges could play a role at the 2010 world cup in south africa .

public gay pride demonstrations , known as christopher street day , are held every summer in cities around the world to commemorate the event .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amendments to the constitution are the focus of this year 's christopher street day parades klaus jetz , head of the lesbian and gay federation in germany -lrb- lsvd -rrb- , told deutsche welle that the political focus of this year 's christopher street day parades , which will begin this weekend in berlin , will be on amending article 3 of the german constitution .
" getting the anti-discrimination amendment passed has been an important topic for the organization since our founding in 1990 , " he said . " it is great that we have finally managed to rally support for this topic beyond our own community , within the political sphere . "
this week , the german parliament voted to push for a federal initiative to make additions to article 3 of the constitution , which protects citizens against discrimination based on gender , race , or religion .
they want , among other things , to add sexual orientation to that list .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's mayor klaus wowereit was one of the first politicians to publicly come out of the closet social democrat klaus wowereit , berlin 's openly homosexual mayor , spoke out in favor of the amendment .
in an interview with the german news agency dpa , wowereit said he whole-heartedly supported the initiative .
he called the laws passed to allow homosexual civil partnerships a " milestone , " but said that there was still judicial room for improvement .
same responsibilities , different rights wowereit took the lead from his party colleague , justice minister brigitte zypries .
in an interview with the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , zypries said that changing article 3 and article 6 of the constitution - which protects the institution of marriage and the family - would send " a clear signal " to society .
while german federal law gives homosexuals the right to enter a civil partnership , they do n't enjoy the same rights as heterosexual married couples when it comes to taxes , retirement , civil servant benefits , or adoption law .
zypries said that homosexual couples have the same responsibilities , but not the same rights as heterosexuals .
" i find this to be incredibly unjust , both on human and on judicial grounds , " the newspaper quoted zypries as saying .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civil unions are important for couples but do not grant the same rights as marriage taking a stand klaus jetz from the lesbian and gay federation in germany -lrb- lsvd -rrb- said that although both the european parliament and the european commission have taken a clear stance against discrimination based on sexual orientation , enshrining the same in the german constitution would have tangible advantages for the gay and lesbian community .
" homosexual couples are not able to adopt children in germany .
and ' rainbow families ' - gay and lesbian couples with biological children - do n't get the same tax breaks as heterosexual couples , " jetz said .
support in society growing article 3 of the constitution was amended for the last time in 1995 , to protect the disabled from discrimination .
at the time , there was not enough political backing to include sexual orientation to the list . but that seems to be changing .
on their web site , the lesbian and gay federation in germany lists a slew of supporters , from all walks of life - actors , politicians , even a rabbi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christopher street day is celebrated all over europe three major parties - the social democrats , the greens , and the left party - are in favor of an amendment .
but a two-thirds majority will be necessary to change the constitution and will need to include members of the conservative parties as well .
" we have to get the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- on board , " jetz said .
but the interior minister of the southern state of bavaria , joachim herrmann , has spoken out against the proposal .
the minister who belongs to the arch-conservative csu party , the sister bavarian party of the cdu , says he sees no reason to extend the constitutional protection of the family .
gay rights activists accuse the conservatives of blocking legislation that would give homosexuals more rights .
" we need the conservatives to understand that this is about protecting a minority in the population , " jetz said . " giving us more rights wo n't change anything for them . "

public gay pride demonstrations , known as christopher street day , are held every summer in cities around the world to commemorate the event .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amendments to the constitution are the focus of this year 's christopher street day parades klaus jetz , head of the lesbian and gay federation in germany -lrb- lsvd -rrb- , told deutsche welle that the political focus of this year 's christopher street day parades , which will begin this weekend in berlin , will be on amending article 3 of the german constitution .
" getting the anti-discrimination amendment passed has been an important topic for the organization since our founding in 1990 , " he said . " it is great that we have finally managed to rally support for this topic beyond our own community , within the political sphere . "
this week , the german parliament voted to push for a federal initiative to make additions to article 3 of the constitution , which protects citizens against discrimination based on gender , race , or religion .
they want , among other things , to add sexual orientation to that list .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's mayor klaus wowereit was one of the first politicians to publicly come out of the closet social democrat klaus wowereit , berlin 's openly homosexual mayor , spoke out in favor of the amendment .
in an interview with the german news agency dpa , wowereit said he whole-heartedly supported the initiative .
he called the laws passed to allow homosexual civil partnerships a " milestone , " but said that there was still judicial room for improvement .
same responsibilities , different rights wowereit took the lead from his party colleague , justice minister brigitte zypries .
in an interview with the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , zypries said that changing article 3 and article 6 of the constitution - which protects the institution of marriage and the family - would send " a clear signal " to society .
while german federal law gives homosexuals the right to enter a civil partnership , they do n't enjoy the same rights as heterosexual married couples when it comes to taxes , retirement , civil servant benefits , or adoption law .
zypries said that homosexual couples have the same responsibilities , but not the same rights as heterosexuals .
" i find this to be incredibly unjust , both on human and on judicial grounds , " the newspaper quoted zypries as saying .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civil unions are important for couples but do not grant the same rights as marriage taking a stand klaus jetz from the lesbian and gay federation in germany -lrb- lsvd -rrb- said that although both the european parliament and the european commission have taken a clear stance against discrimination based on sexual orientation , enshrining the same in the german constitution would have tangible advantages for the gay and lesbian community .
" homosexual couples are not able to adopt children in germany .
and ' rainbow families ' - gay and lesbian couples with biological children - do n't get the same tax breaks as heterosexual couples , " jetz said .
support in society growing article 3 of the constitution was amended for the last time in 1995 , to protect the disabled from discrimination .
at the time , there was not enough political backing to include sexual orientation to the list . but that seems to be changing .
on their web site , the lesbian and gay federation in germany lists a slew of supporters , from all walks of life - actors , politicians , even a rabbi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christopher street day is celebrated all over europe three major parties - the social democrats , the greens , and the left party - are in favor of an amendment .
but a two-thirds majority will be necessary to change the constitution and will need to include members of the conservative parties as well .
" we have to get the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- on board , " jetz said .
but the interior minister of the southern state of bavaria , joachim herrmann , has spoken out against the proposal .
the minister who belongs to the arch-conservative csu party , the sister bavarian party of the cdu , says he sees no reason to extend the constitutional protection of the family .
gay rights activists accuse the conservatives of blocking legislation that would give homosexuals more rights .
" we need the conservatives to understand that this is about protecting a minority in the population , " jetz said . " giving us more rights wo n't change anything for them . "

guest commentator susanne neubert says that we have a global responsibility to counter soil degradation and there 's no time to lose . some 70 percent of the world 's arid regions face desertification , and in around 110 countries - most of them poor - desertification threatens an area roughly the size of europe . twenty million tons of grain are lost annually due to desertification and , over the past 40 years , one third of the world 's arable land has been abandoned . even though there is no doubt about the causes of desertification , and the strategies needed to combat it are known , no turnaround is yet in sight .
why is it that neither the un desertification convention nor countless initiatives and programs have managed to halt the ongoing process of desertification ? unsustainable land management bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in many regions water for irrigation is not readily available the principal factors behind desertification are unsustainable land management and climate change .
as far as land management is concerned , incorrect farming practices also play a major role .
these include the cultivation of annual crop species , coupled with management methods that intermittently leave soils uncovered and exposed to erosion . other aspects of " incorrect " farming practices include faulty irrigation and either a total lack of fertilization or lopsided use of mineral fertilisers .
this often leads to soil mineralization , particularly in tropical regions , depriving soils of their capacity to store water .
carbon compounds , previously fixed in the soil in the form of organic matter , are released into the air in the course of the mineralization process .
this reduces the soil 's buffering capacity for drought and flooding , at the same time directly contributing to climate change . a good number of resource problems are closely interlinked : together , deforestation , species loss , climate change , growing scarcity of water resources , and the loss of organic matter in soils are responsible for desertification ; they are both its cause and effect . does this mean that we have no choice but to capitulate ?
no .
what it means is that by developing and using intelligent approaches we can achieve several goals at once .
soil conservation techniques , including erosion control walls , agro-forestry , and organic fertilization , are methods that are both effective and widely known - and these need to be applied on a larger scale . the reason why the picture continues to be dominated by individual measures is not technical in nature , indeed this must be seen as a problem bound up with economic incentives and political interests . incentives to support farmers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protecting trees can counter soil degradation since agriculture is organized primarily along private lines , soil conservation measures need to be carried out mainly by the private sector .
it is essential that incentives be set to ensure that investments in farmland yield returns , and the relatively high prices currently commanded by agricultural goods offer a good opportunity . there is considerable evidence that farmers carry out soil protection measures on their own if they lack more profitable alternatives and if the know-how and cost viability are available .
there is no lack of instructive examples , and german development cooperation offers a good number of them .
it is high time to start providing farmers in desertification-prone regions with appropriate advisory services as well as with the funds they need to transport stones to build erosion control walls , etc . , and to do so not intermittently but as a general rule . however , both agro-industry and institutional conditions also need to be modernized .
one correct and promising approach would be to encourage the agrochemical industry to gear production more to soil substrate additives . moreover , the agricultural policies of developing countries urgently need to be reoriented to reduce the fertilizer subsidies so widespread today and instead to increase the credit available in the agricultural sector .
and land rights need to be modified in such a way as to ensure that farmers have incentives to undertake soil conservation measures . no time to lose bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : modernizing the agro industry is vital in coutering the impact of climate change instead of continuing to generate vast amounts of greenhouse gases by producing and using mineral fertilizers incapable of achieving the hoped-for results on degraded soils , it would make far more sense to engage in organic agriculture keyed chiefly to on-farm resources .
this could serve to enhance soil storage capacity and - in cases where the needed organic matter is unavailable - to regenerate it by using industrially produced soil substrates .
land management of this kind tends to raise yields per unit area to earlier levels , and to do so precisely in arid regions . but is also essential to protect land at the supra-farm level , on state-owned land .
this , though , calls for a huge supply of labor .
in keeping with a proposal advanced by the united nations environment program -lrb- unep -rrb- , a " global green new deal " could be used to realize the action plans adopted to implement the un desertification convention , and in times of recession this would at the same time amount to an effective labor market policy . this should also include large-scale projects - like the building of " green walls " in china and the sahel belt - and efforts to link them with the numerous individual participatory measures already in progress , in order to achieve synergy effects . it would be important to implement measures geared at once to conservation and re-cultivation in order to come up with comprehensive measures that serve to reach several goals at the same time : protection of forests , water , climate , and soils .
this is a realistic aim in that the different organizational phases involved basically tend to correlate positively with one another . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neubert says that desertification is partly reversible how much time do we have left ?
the good news is that in many cases desertification is reversible .
the bad new is that this goes hand in hand with declining marginal utility , and when a certain stage of degradation has been reached , re-cultivation proves so labor-intensive that it is more attractive for the population to migrate to urban areas .
in other words , we have no time to lose .

guest commentator susanne neubert says that we have a global responsibility to counter soil degradation and there 's no time to lose . some 70 percent of the world 's arid regions face desertification , and in around 110 countries - most of them poor - desertification threatens an area roughly the size of europe . twenty million tons of grain are lost annually due to desertification and , over the past 40 years , one third of the world 's arable land has been abandoned . even though there is no doubt about the causes of desertification , and the strategies needed to combat it are known , no turnaround is yet in sight .
why is it that neither the un desertification convention nor countless initiatives and programs have managed to halt the ongoing process of desertification ? unsustainable land management bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in many regions water for irrigation is not readily available the principal factors behind desertification are unsustainable land management and climate change .
as far as land management is concerned , incorrect farming practices also play a major role .
these include the cultivation of annual crop species , coupled with management methods that intermittently leave soils uncovered and exposed to erosion . other aspects of " incorrect " farming practices include faulty irrigation and either a total lack of fertilization or lopsided use of mineral fertilisers .
this often leads to soil mineralization , particularly in tropical regions , depriving soils of their capacity to store water .
carbon compounds , previously fixed in the soil in the form of organic matter , are released into the air in the course of the mineralization process .
this reduces the soil 's buffering capacity for drought and flooding , at the same time directly contributing to climate change . a good number of resource problems are closely interlinked : together , deforestation , species loss , climate change , growing scarcity of water resources , and the loss of organic matter in soils are responsible for desertification ; they are both its cause and effect . does this mean that we have no choice but to capitulate ?
no .
what it means is that by developing and using intelligent approaches we can achieve several goals at once .
soil conservation techniques , including erosion control walls , agro-forestry , and organic fertilization , are methods that are both effective and widely known - and these need to be applied on a larger scale . the reason why the picture continues to be dominated by individual measures is not technical in nature , indeed this must be seen as a problem bound up with economic incentives and political interests . incentives to support farmers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protecting trees can counter soil degradation since agriculture is organized primarily along private lines , soil conservation measures need to be carried out mainly by the private sector .
it is essential that incentives be set to ensure that investments in farmland yield returns , and the relatively high prices currently commanded by agricultural goods offer a good opportunity . there is considerable evidence that farmers carry out soil protection measures on their own if they lack more profitable alternatives and if the know-how and cost viability are available .
there is no lack of instructive examples , and german development cooperation offers a good number of them .
it is high time to start providing farmers in desertification-prone regions with appropriate advisory services as well as with the funds they need to transport stones to build erosion control walls , etc . , and to do so not intermittently but as a general rule . however , both agro-industry and institutional conditions also need to be modernized .
one correct and promising approach would be to encourage the agrochemical industry to gear production more to soil substrate additives . moreover , the agricultural policies of developing countries urgently need to be reoriented to reduce the fertilizer subsidies so widespread today and instead to increase the credit available in the agricultural sector .
and land rights need to be modified in such a way as to ensure that farmers have incentives to undertake soil conservation measures . no time to lose bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : modernizing the agro industry is vital in coutering the impact of climate change instead of continuing to generate vast amounts of greenhouse gases by producing and using mineral fertilizers incapable of achieving the hoped-for results on degraded soils , it would make far more sense to engage in organic agriculture keyed chiefly to on-farm resources .
this could serve to enhance soil storage capacity and - in cases where the needed organic matter is unavailable - to regenerate it by using industrially produced soil substrates .
land management of this kind tends to raise yields per unit area to earlier levels , and to do so precisely in arid regions . but is also essential to protect land at the supra-farm level , on state-owned land .
this , though , calls for a huge supply of labor .

guest commentator susanne neubert says that we have a global responsibility to counter soil degradation and there 's no time to lose . some 70 percent of the world 's arid regions face desertification , and in around 110 countries - most of them poor - desertification threatens an area roughly the size of europe . twenty million tons of grain are lost annually due to desertification and , over the past 40 years , one third of the world 's arable land has been abandoned . even though there is no doubt about the causes of desertification , and the strategies needed to combat it are known , no turnaround is yet in sight .
why is it that neither the un desertification convention nor countless initiatives and programs have managed to halt the ongoing process of desertification ? unsustainable land management bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in many regions water for irrigation is not readily available the principal factors behind desertification are unsustainable land management and climate change .
as far as land management is concerned , incorrect farming practices also play a major role .
these include the cultivation of annual crop species , coupled with management methods that intermittently leave soils uncovered and exposed to erosion . other aspects of " incorrect " farming practices include faulty irrigation and either a total lack of fertilization or lopsided use of mineral fertilisers .
this often leads to soil mineralization , particularly in tropical regions , depriving soils of their capacity to store water .
carbon compounds , previously fixed in the soil in the form of organic matter , are released into the air in the course of the mineralization process .
this reduces the soil 's buffering capacity for drought and flooding , at the same time directly contributing to climate change . a good number of resource problems are closely interlinked : together , deforestation , species loss , climate change , growing scarcity of water resources , and the loss of organic matter in soils are responsible for desertification ; they are both its cause and effect . does this mean that we have no choice but to capitulate ?
no .
what it means is that by developing and using intelligent approaches we can achieve several goals at once .
soil conservation techniques , including erosion control walls , agro-forestry , and organic fertilization , are methods that are both effective and widely known - and these need to be applied on a larger scale . the reason why the picture continues to be dominated by individual measures is not technical in nature , indeed this must be seen as a problem bound up with economic incentives and political interests . incentives to support farmers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protecting trees can counter soil degradation since agriculture is organized primarily along private lines , soil conservation measures need to be carried out mainly by the private sector .
it is essential that incentives be set to ensure that investments in farmland yield returns , and the relatively high prices currently commanded by agricultural goods offer a good opportunity . there is considerable evidence that farmers carry out soil protection measures on their own if they lack more profitable alternatives and if the know-how and cost viability are available .
there is no lack of instructive examples , and german development cooperation offers a good number of them .
it is high time to start providing farmers in desertification-prone regions with appropriate advisory services as well as with the funds they need to transport stones to build erosion control walls , etc . , and to do so not intermittently but as a general rule . however , both agro-industry and institutional conditions also need to be modernized .
one correct and promising approach would be to encourage the agrochemical industry to gear production more to soil substrate additives . moreover , the agricultural policies of developing countries urgently need to be reoriented to reduce the fertilizer subsidies so widespread today and instead to increase the credit available in the agricultural sector .
and land rights need to be modified in such a way as to ensure that farmers have incentives to undertake soil conservation measures . no time to lose bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : modernizing the agro industry is vital in coutering the impact of climate change instead of continuing to generate vast amounts of greenhouse gases by producing and using mineral fertilizers incapable of achieving the hoped-for results on degraded soils , it would make far more sense to engage in organic agriculture keyed chiefly to on-farm resources .
this could serve to enhance soil storage capacity and - in cases where the needed organic matter is unavailable - to regenerate it by using industrially produced soil substrates .
land management of this kind tends to raise yields per unit area to earlier levels , and to do so precisely in arid regions . but is also essential to protect land at the supra-farm level , on state-owned land .
this , though , calls for a huge supply of labor .
in keeping with a proposal advanced by the united nations environment program -lrb- unep -rrb- , a " global green new deal " could be used to realize the action plans adopted to implement the un desertification convention , and in times of recession this would at the same time amount to an effective labor market policy . this should also include large-scale projects - like the building of " green walls " in china and the sahel belt - and efforts to link them with the numerous individual participatory measures already in progress , in order to achieve synergy effects . it would be important to implement measures geared at once to conservation and re-cultivation in order to come up with comprehensive measures that serve to reach several goals at the same time : protection of forests , water , climate , and soils .
this is a realistic aim in that the different organizational phases involved basically tend to correlate positively with one another . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neubert says that desertification is partly reversible how much time do we have left ?
the good news is that in many cases desertification is reversible .
the bad new is that this goes hand in hand with declining marginal utility , and when a certain stage of degradation has been reached , re-cultivation proves so labor-intensive that it is more attractive for the population to migrate to urban areas .
in other words , we have no time to lose .
this is not a question of " aid " but of global responsibility . author : dr.susanne neubert / -lrb- ara -rrb- editor : kate bowen dr. susanne neubert is a senior researcher at the german development institute -lrb- deutsches institut für entwicklungspolitik - die -rrb- , which is a multi-disciplinary think-tank for german and multilateral development policy .

this career peaked with his 1982 record " thriller , " which is the best selling album of all time . in later life jackson struggled with a series of court cases and allegations about his private life , damaging his career and his financial situation , but he remained a popular character with an enormous fan base . the german newsmagazine spiegel online wrote that jackson had two faces : one was " the monster , more alien than human , lifted , pale and in the end as emaciated as a skeleton . " on the other hand , there was " the genius that reinvented pop , sold more albums than anyone else -lrb- … -rrb- and was admired by the masses - in particular by his musical heirs , who never would have existed without his influence and who are now mourning his passing with an unequalled flood of condolence : beyonce , usher , justin timberlake , to name three of many .

" a comeback has seldom been as necessary as it was in jackson 's case , " wrote the sueddeutsche . though it 's now too late for a comeback , the troubled pop icon leaves behind a generation that has at some point tried to moonwalk and a legacy of young musicians - like beyonce and timberlake - who are carrying on in his footsteps . bildunterschrift : michael jackson in 1971 , 1977 and 1979 -lrb- from left -rrb- bildunterschrift : michael jackson 1983 , 1987 and 1990 -lrb- from left -rrb- kjb / msh , ap / dpa / afp editor : darren mara send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 26.06.2009 erdogan criticizes germany , france for blocking turkey 's eu bid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany and france have been vocal in their opposition to turkey 's eu membership during a visit to brussels to revive ankara 's deadlocked eu accession talks , turkish premier erdogan slammed germany and france for opposing full eu membership for his predominantly muslim country . turkish prime minster recep tayyip erdogan on friday accused germany and france of stalling its european union membership bid by offering ankara a " privileged partnership " rather than full membership .
" turkey can not accept the position of germany and france .
a privileged partnership does n't exist in -lrb- european law -rrb- , " erdogan told journalists before attending a forum in brussels , adding that turkey 's goal is full membership and any alternative " is out of the question . "
erdogan said french president nicolas sarkozy had been inconsistent , showing more openness to turkey 's accession in private talks than in public .
" our european friends unfortunately have a unilateral expectation which is rather populist and it saddens us .
i hope we will overcome this , " he said .
ankara launches diplomatic drive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan , left , faces an uphill battle on turkey 's eu entry bid turkey has mounted a diplomatic offensive aimed at boosting its chances of joining the eu , with erdogan visiting brussels twice in the span of three months .
in addition , his foreign minister , ahmet devutoglu , was also in brussels on friday to meet the eu enlargement commissioner , olli rehn , ahead of an accession conference planned for next week .
turkey 's membership was also a campaign issue in this month 's european parliament election , with some right-wing parties making gains after opposing its accession .
" some narrow-minded politicians have used turkey as election material , and we believe this to be very wrong and very populist , " erdogan said .
" we will never give up .
we are patient , we do our homework ... and we continue moving forward . "
changing the constitution erdogan 's comments come just a day after he had told journalists that plans to change the turkish constitution , key to keeping turkey 's bid for eu membership on track , are a " waste of time " as long as opposition parties keep blocking all efforts in parliament . erdogan 's comments were the clearest sign yet that his government could ditch its long standing goal of joining the 27-nation bloc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most europeans oppose turkey 's entry bid because it is a moslem country , poor , and situated mostly in asia erdogan promised after march local elections to renew efforts to revamp the 1982 constitution , drawn up under military rule , which would go a long way towards removing one of the major obstacles in ankara 's eu path . " all parties should be involved in efforts to reform the constitution , but the main opposition party rejects and blocks all efforts .
so as long as we are faced with such an approach these efforts are nothing but a waste of time .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 26.06.2009 cologne therapy center helps torture victims get their lives back großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : torture is carried out in prisons and detention centers in many countries june 26 is the un international day in support of victims of torture .
torture victims carry the burden of their experiences forever , but one therapy center in cologne seeks to make living with the memories bearable . petek t. * has been a patient at the cologne therapy center for torture victims for two years now , but the memories of her torture during her imprisonment in turkey are still very vivid .
her biggest wish is for something that many people take for granted : sleep .
" during the day , i can distract myself , " she said .
" but at night , i have problems sleeping , and nightmares .
the traumatic experiences always come back . "
petek , now 38 , was 18 when she began her university studies in her hometown of izmir in western turkey .
she wanted to become a journalist , and wrote articles for student organizations criticizing an increase of repression and the authoritarian approach of the turkish government .
she was sent to jail three times for her writing after being convicted or being a member in a forbidden organization .
her most recent imprisonment was from 1994-2002 , but even seven years later , it churns up too many memories for her to talk about .
since her time in a turkish prison , the situation of prisoners there has improved somewhat , she said , but people are still being tortured .
" people are still dying in prison under unclear circumstances , but the government denies that there is systematic torture going on in turkey , " said petek .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in some places , phsychological torture has replaced traditional methods waiting list for torture therapy the cologne therapy center for torture victims was founded in 1985 as a pilot project by the un high commissioner of refugees , and is run as a charitable organization .
uenal hamidye is petek 's therapist at the therapy center , and is familiar with many cases that are similar to hers .
hamidye said torture methods are becoming increasingly psychological , and often leave behind no physical marks .
" for example , someone might come and say ' if you do n't talk , we 're going to get your wife and rape her , " ' she said .
" the people are faced with a dilemma : either they betray their organization or they have to watch as their wives , mothers , or sisters are raped . "
petek is one of many former torture victims who come to the therapy center for help .
the demand on the center 's services is so high that there is often a waiting list .
when she first arrived in germany with her husband in 2004 , petek was told she 'd have to wait one to two years to be admitted .
" a psychological crisis does n't wait , " said petek .
" i saw no more point in my life anymore .
but i had a breakdown and was brought to the clinic where the doctors put me in contact with -lrb- hamidye -rrb- .
that 's why i 'm here , and i 'm very happy about that . "
the therapy center treats between 600 and 800 torture victims each year .
the center offers individual and group therapy sessions , and also gives help in dealing with day to day life , including learning german or completing administrative tasks connected with moving to a different country .
no ' getting back to normal ' for torture victims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un human rights commissioner navanethem pillay has called for the prohibition of torture brigitte brand-wilhelmy , director of the therapy center , said that most of the current patients come from iran , iraq , certain african nations , and particularly from former yugoslavia . " we have women here who lost their entire families in massacres , " brand-wilhelmy said .
" they watched as their siblings and parents were murdered .
we hear stories where it is hard to imagine how people can do such things to one another . "
it takes a lot of time for torture victims to recover from their experiences , and petek is still working through the effects of what was done to her .
it 's not just nightmares , either .
her therapist has told her she is suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder .
she has concentration problems and can not work , which makes it difficult to fully embrace her new home in germany .
" every day is a struggle , " petek said .
" my husband and i do n't have family or friends here , we only have each other .
because of the effects of the torture , it is hard to learn new things ; at the moment , learning german is taking quite a while .
we 'd love to get adjusted to living in germany , but it 's difficult . " * her last name has been withheld for privacy reasons .

but in germany 's case , the real stars do n't stick with the team very long .
dw 's jefferson chase explains . when the young german eleven beat italy 1-0 in the semifinals of the event on friday , june 26 , they moved a step closer to making history .
germany may be a soccer powerhouse , but the record of the u21 national team is anything but stellar .
incredibly enough , they 've never won a major tournament - a blot that coach horst hrubesch currently wants to rectify in sweden .
still , after needing a nervy draw against england to qualify for the knock-out stage , hrubesch is n't exactly jumping for joy .
" the only thing i 'm happy about is making the semis , " the coach told dpa news agency after the england match .
" i 'm not at all satisfied with how we did it - it was way below our ambitions . "
with the german u17 and u19 teams having won their european titles , this could be the year for germany 's youth teams .
but would it signal a glorious future ahead for the adult german national team ?
probably not .
here today , gone tomorrow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year , before taking his current job , hrubesch won europe with the u19 germany 's footballing reputation is one of solidity and consistency rather than mercurial brilliance so you might expect the national soccer association , the dfb , to bring up players gradually through the various levels .
but the opposite is the case .
goalkeeping legend oliver kahn and super striker miroslav klose never played in the youth ranks , going straight into the main national team .
and while most of the current national squad did take the pitch for the u21s , very few of the real stars - michael ballack , bastian schweinsteiger or lukas podolski , for example - made more than a handful of appearances , before being promoted up to the big league .
the uefa u21 championship has only been in existence in its current form since 1978 , and it took some time for germany to take them seriously .
even into the 1990s the dfb eleven were playing with a sweeper .
as a result , germany have always gone home empty handed while italy have won europe five times , and even england - never a national side known for tournament successes - have hoisted the trophy twice .
ones to watch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany are glad oezil , r , choose to play for them instead of turkey given the german u21s ' history , the players most likely to play roles in the top squad are those who have already been called up by national coach joachim loew .
diminutive forward marko marin has n't been able to make much of a mark in sweden , but leverkusen 's gonzalo castro , stuttgart 's sami khedira and schalke goalkeeper manuel neuer have performed well .
and the star of the show has been mesut oezil , who normally plays on the wing for his club bremen but who has shone in a striker role for hrubesch , setting up both of goals in germany 's 2-nil win over finland in the group stage .
and the breakthrough player of the squad is defender jerome boateng .
boateng usually serves as right back and has struggled to keep a position in the starting line-up for his club hamburg .
but he 's drawn high marks in all his matches for the young germans playing as a central defender - a role for which hamburg might consider him when he returns from sweden .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : castro is part of germany 's multi-cultural squad those names point to an unmistakable trend within the german national team - the growing prominence of players who were born outside germany or who come from an immigrant background .
klose , podolski , both polish born , have established themselves as mainstays in germany adult national team - and they 've recently been joined by piotr trochowski .
in the u21 , eight of the current 24 members of the squad come from multi-national backgrounds .
so if germany continues the tradition of integrating younger players quickly into the main men 's team , some of hrubesch 's charges could play a role at the 2010 world cup in south africa .

but in germany 's case , the real stars do n't stick with the team very long .
dw 's jefferson chase explains . when the young german eleven beat italy 1-0 in the semifinals of the event on friday , june 26 , they moved a step closer to making history .
germany may be a soccer powerhouse , but the record of the u21 national team is anything but stellar .
incredibly enough , they 've never won a major tournament - a blot that coach horst hrubesch currently wants to rectify in sweden .
still , after needing a nervy draw against england to qualify for the knock-out stage , hrubesch is n't exactly jumping for joy .
" the only thing i 'm happy about is making the semis , " the coach told dpa news agency after the england match .
" i 'm not at all satisfied with how we did it - it was way below our ambitions . "
with the german u17 and u19 teams having won their european titles , this could be the year for germany 's youth teams .
but would it signal a glorious future ahead for the adult german national team ?
probably not .
here today , gone tomorrow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year , before taking his current job , hrubesch won europe with the u19 germany 's footballing reputation is one of solidity and consistency rather than mercurial brilliance so you might expect the national soccer association , the dfb , to bring up players gradually through the various levels .
but the opposite is the case .
goalkeeping legend oliver kahn and super striker miroslav klose never played in the youth ranks , going straight into the main national team .
and while most of the current national squad did take the pitch for the u21s , very few of the real stars - michael ballack , bastian schweinsteiger or lukas podolski , for example - made more than a handful of appearances , before being promoted up to the big league .
the uefa u21 championship has only been in existence in its current form since 1978 , and it took some time for germany to take them seriously .
even into the 1990s the dfb eleven were playing with a sweeper .
as a result , germany have always gone home empty handed while italy have won europe five times , and even england - never a national side known for tournament successes - have hoisted the trophy twice .
ones to watch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany are glad oezil , r , choose to play for them instead of turkey given the german u21s ' history , the players most likely to play roles in the top squad are those who have already been called up by national coach joachim loew .
diminutive forward marko marin has n't been able to make much of a mark in sweden , but leverkusen 's gonzalo castro , stuttgart 's sami khedira and schalke goalkeeper manuel neuer have performed well .
and the star of the show has been mesut oezil , who normally plays on the wing for his club bremen but who has shone in a striker role for hrubesch , setting up both of goals in germany 's 2-nil win over finland in the group stage .
and the breakthrough player of the squad is defender jerome boateng .
boateng usually serves as right back and has struggled to keep a position in the starting line-up for his club hamburg .
but he 's drawn high marks in all his matches for the young germans playing as a central defender - a role for which hamburg might consider him when he returns from sweden .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : castro is part of germany 's multi-cultural squad those names point to an unmistakable trend within the german national team - the growing prominence of players who were born outside germany or who come from an immigrant background .
klose , podolski , both polish born , have established themselves as mainstays in germany adult national team - and they 've recently been joined by piotr trochowski .
in the u21 , eight of the current 24 members of the squad come from multi-national backgrounds .
so if germany continues the tradition of integrating younger players quickly into the main men 's team , some of hrubesch 's charges could play a role at the 2010 world cup in south africa .

civil society groups have been campaigning to bring the issue to the notice of the mekong river governments , asking them to scrap the plans . the 11 dams along the lower mekong river are planned for laos , cambodia and the thai-lao border .
the hydropower generated by them is to meet the increasing demand for electricity across the region .
the 4,800 kilometre mekong river flows from the tibetan plateau through southern china and myanmar before reaching the mekong basin and eventually flowing to the south china sea through southern vietnam .
problems for food security civil society groups groups point to the threat to fish stocks , water access and general food security for the millions of people living in the region if the hydropower dam developments go ahead .
premrudee daoroung is a co-director of the bangkok-based group ' towards ecological recovery and regional alliance ' -lrb- terra -rrb- .
she says because several dams are planned the situation is vastly more complicated than earlier campaigns to halt damming on the mekong .
" compared with the past 20 years , the situation has become pretty critical now – a lot more difficult – in terms of the figures of the dams , because they are not one country ’ s dams anymore .
we have to consider the cross-border issues .
the main reason for our campaign right now is to save the mekong as a whole – which is not comparable to the past . "
postcard campaign civil society groups have combined efforts to present the case to regional governments .
through a postcard petition campaign more than 16,000 people have signed on urging the prime ministers of cambodia , laos , thailand and vietnam to put a stop to the developments .
thai prime minister abhisit vejjajiva said the issue should be raised with the association of south east asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- .
carl middleton from the environmental group ' international rivers ' , says there is now a greater understanding of both the importance of the fishing industry and the wider social impact if the dams go ahead .
" compared to when these dams were first conceived the world ’ s moved on – hydropower is last century ’ s technology .
so these projects in the past , they were stopped by various reasons , including the high environmental and social impact .
but the fact is now there are far better options to meeting energy needs in the region . "
threatening endangered species middleton says the hydropower projects would affect the more than 50 species of migratory fish in one the world ’ s most productive inland fisheries .
the dams would also threaten several endangered species such as the irrawaddy dolphin and the mekong giant catfish .
downstream in vietnam ’ s delta region , agronomists fear the dams will drastically affect the country ’ s rice growing bowl , limiting fresh water flows and leading to more sea water flowing inland .
as a result , soil acidity would increase destroying rice fields and affecting the lives of 17 million people .
the groups have also called for greater action by the mekong river commission or mrc - to take a stronger stance over future developments that affect the river , the lifeblood for so many in the region .

civil society groups have been campaigning to bring the issue to the notice of the mekong river governments , asking them to scrap the plans . the 11 dams along the lower mekong river are planned for laos , cambodia and the thai-lao border .
the hydropower generated by them is to meet the increasing demand for electricity across the region .
the 4,800 kilometre mekong river flows from the tibetan plateau through southern china and myanmar before reaching the mekong basin and eventually flowing to the south china sea through southern vietnam .
problems for food security civil society groups groups point to the threat to fish stocks , water access and general food security for the millions of people living in the region if the hydropower dam developments go ahead .
premrudee daoroung is a co-director of the bangkok-based group ' towards ecological recovery and regional alliance ' -lrb- terra -rrb- .
she says because several dams are planned the situation is vastly more complicated than earlier campaigns to halt damming on the mekong .
" compared with the past 20 years , the situation has become pretty critical now – a lot more difficult – in terms of the figures of the dams , because they are not one country ’ s dams anymore .
we have to consider the cross-border issues .
the main reason for our campaign right now is to save the mekong as a whole – which is not comparable to the past . "
postcard campaign civil society groups have combined efforts to present the case to regional governments .
through a postcard petition campaign more than 16,000 people have signed on urging the prime ministers of cambodia , laos , thailand and vietnam to put a stop to the developments .
thai prime minister abhisit vejjajiva said the issue should be raised with the association of south east asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- .
carl middleton from the environmental group ' international rivers ' , says there is now a greater understanding of both the importance of the fishing industry and the wider social impact if the dams go ahead .
" compared to when these dams were first conceived the world ’ s moved on – hydropower is last century ’ s technology .
so these projects in the past , they were stopped by various reasons , including the high environmental and social impact .
but the fact is now there are far better options to meeting energy needs in the region . "
threatening endangered species middleton says the hydropower projects would affect the more than 50 species of migratory fish in one the world ’ s most productive inland fisheries .
the dams would also threaten several endangered species such as the irrawaddy dolphin and the mekong giant catfish .
downstream in vietnam ’ s delta region , agronomists fear the dams will drastically affect the country ’ s rice growing bowl , limiting fresh water flows and leading to more sea water flowing inland .
as a result , soil acidity would increase destroying rice fields and affecting the lives of 17 million people .
the groups have also called for greater action by the mekong river commission or mrc - to take a stronger stance over future developments that affect the river , the lifeblood for so many in the region .

but in germany 's case , the real stars do n't stick with the team very long .
dw 's jefferson chase explains . when the young german eleven beat italy 1-0 in the semifinals of the event on friday , june 26 , they moved a step closer to making history .
germany may be a soccer powerhouse , but the record of the u21 national team is anything but stellar .
incredibly enough , they 've never won a major tournament - a blot that coach horst hrubesch currently wants to rectify in sweden .
still , after needing a nervy draw against england to qualify for the knock-out stage , hrubesch is n't exactly jumping for joy .
" the only thing i 'm happy about is making the semis , " the coach told dpa news agency after the england match .
" i 'm not at all satisfied with how we did it - it was way below our ambitions . "
with the german u17 and u19 teams having won their european titles , this could be the year for germany 's youth teams .
but would it signal a glorious future ahead for the adult german national team ?
probably not .
here today , gone tomorrow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year , before taking his current job , hrubesch won europe with the u19 germany 's footballing reputation is one of solidity and consistency rather than mercurial brilliance so you might expect the national soccer association , the dfb , to bring up players gradually through the various levels .
but the opposite is the case .
goalkeeping legend oliver kahn and super striker miroslav klose never played in the youth ranks , going straight into the main national team .
and while most of the current national squad did take the pitch for the u21s , very few of the real stars - michael ballack , bastian schweinsteiger or lukas podolski , for example - made more than a handful of appearances , before being promoted up to the big league .
the uefa u21 championship has only been in existence in its current form since 1978 , and it took some time for germany to take them seriously .
even into the 1990s the dfb eleven were playing with a sweeper .
as a result , germany have always gone home empty handed while italy have won europe five times , and even england - never a national side known for tournament successes - have hoisted the trophy twice .
ones to watch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany are glad oezil , r , choose to play for them instead of turkey given the german u21s ' history , the players most likely to play roles in the top squad are those who have already been called up by national coach joachim loew .
diminutive forward marko marin has n't been able to make much of a mark in sweden , but leverkusen 's gonzalo castro , stuttgart 's sami khedira and schalke goalkeeper manuel neuer have performed well .
and the star of the show has been mesut oezil , who normally plays on the wing for his club bremen but who has shone in a striker role for hrubesch , setting up both of goals in germany 's 2-nil win over finland in the group stage .
and the breakthrough player of the squad is defender jerome boateng .
boateng usually serves as right back and has struggled to keep a position in the starting line-up for his club hamburg .
but he 's drawn high marks in all his matches for the young germans playing as a central defender - a role for which hamburg might consider him when he returns from sweden .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : castro is part of germany 's multi-cultural squad those names point to an unmistakable trend within the german national team - the growing prominence of players who were born outside germany or who come from an immigrant background .
klose , podolski , both polish born , have established themselves as mainstays in germany adult national team - and they 've recently been joined by piotr trochowski .
in the u21 , eight of the current 24 members of the squad come from multi-national backgrounds .
so if germany continues the tradition of integrating younger players quickly into the main men 's team , some of hrubesch 's charges could play a role at the 2010 world cup in south africa .

still , after needing a nervy draw against england to qualify for the knock-out stage , hrubesch is n't exactly jumping for joy .
" the only thing i 'm happy about is making the semis , " the coach told dpa news agency after the england match .
" i 'm not at all satisfied with how we did it - it was way below our ambitions . "
with the german u17 and u19 teams having won their european titles , this could be the year for germany 's youth teams .
but would it signal a glorious future ahead for the adult german national team ?
probably not .
here today , gone tomorrow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year , before taking his current job , hrubesch won europe with the u19 germany 's footballing reputation is one of solidity and consistency rather than mercurial brilliance so you might expect the national soccer association , the dfb , to bring up players gradually through the various levels .
but the opposite is the case .
goalkeeping legend oliver kahn and super striker miroslav klose never played in the youth ranks , going straight into the main national team .
and while most of the current national squad did take the pitch for the u21s , very few of the real stars - michael ballack , bastian schweinsteiger or lukas podolski , for example - made more than a handful of appearances , before being promoted up to the big league .
the uefa u21 championship has only been in existence in its current form since 1978 , and it took some time for germany to take them seriously .
even into the 1990s the dfb eleven were playing with a sweeper .
as a result , germany have always gone home empty handed while italy have won europe five times , and even england - never a national side known for tournament successes - have hoisted the trophy twice .
ones to watch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany are glad oezil , r , choose to play for them instead of turkey given the german u21s ' history , the players most likely to play roles in the top squad are those who have already been called up by national coach joachim loew .
diminutive forward marko marin has n't been able to make much of a mark in sweden , but leverkusen 's gonzalo castro , stuttgart 's sami khedira and schalke goalkeeper manuel neuer have performed well .
and the star of the show has been mesut oezil , who normally plays on the wing for his club bremen but who has shone in a striker role for hrubesch , setting up both of goals in germany 's 2-nil win over finland in the group stage .
and the breakthrough player of the squad is defender jerome boateng .
boateng usually serves as right back and has struggled to keep a position in the starting line-up for his club hamburg .
but he 's drawn high marks in all his matches for the young germans playing as a central defender - a role for which hamburg might consider him when he returns from sweden .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : castro is part of germany 's multi-cultural squad those names point to an unmistakable trend within the german national team - the growing prominence of players who were born outside germany or who come from an immigrant background .
klose , podolski , both polish born , have established themselves as mainstays in germany adult national team - and they 've recently been joined by piotr trochowski .
in the u21 , eight of the current 24 members of the squad come from multi-national backgrounds .
so if germany continues the tradition of integrating younger players quickly into the main men 's team , some of hrubesch 's charges could play a role at the 2010 world cup in south africa .

" turkey can not accept the position of germany and france .

erdogan said french president nicolas sarkozy had been inconsistent , showing more openness to turkey 's accession in private talks than in public .
" our european friends unfortunately have a unilateral expectation which is rather populist and it saddens us .
i hope we will overcome this , " he said .
ankara launches diplomatic drive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan , left , faces an uphill battle on turkey 's eu entry bid turkey has mounted a diplomatic offensive aimed at boosting its chances of joining the eu , with erdogan visiting brussels twice in the span of three months .
in addition , his foreign minister , ahmet devutoglu , was also in brussels on friday to meet the eu enlargement commissioner , olli rehn , ahead of an accession conference planned for next week .
turkey 's membership was also a campaign issue in this month 's european parliament election , with some right-wing parties making gains after opposing its accession .
" some narrow-minded politicians have used turkey as election material , and we believe this to be very wrong and very populist , " erdogan said .
" we will never give up .

guest commentator susanne neubert says that we have a global responsibility to counter soil degradation and there 's no time to lose . some 70 percent of the world 's arid regions face desertification , and in around 110 countries - most of them poor - desertification threatens an area roughly the size of europe . twenty million tons of grain are lost annually due to desertification and , over the past 40 years , one third of the world 's arable land has been abandoned . even though there is no doubt about the causes of desertification , and the strategies needed to combat it are known , no turnaround is yet in sight .
why is it that neither the un desertification convention nor countless initiatives and programs have managed to halt the ongoing process of desertification ? unsustainable land management bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in many regions water for irrigation is not readily available the principal factors behind desertification are unsustainable land management and climate change .
as far as land management is concerned , incorrect farming practices also play a major role .
these include the cultivation of annual crop species , coupled with management methods that intermittently leave soils uncovered and exposed to erosion . other aspects of " incorrect " farming practices include faulty irrigation and either a total lack of fertilization or lopsided use of mineral fertilisers .
this often leads to soil mineralization , particularly in tropical regions , depriving soils of their capacity to store water .
carbon compounds , previously fixed in the soil in the form of organic matter , are released into the air in the course of the mineralization process .
this reduces the soil 's buffering capacity for drought and flooding , at the same time directly contributing to climate change . a good number of resource problems are closely interlinked : together , deforestation , species loss , climate change , growing scarcity of water resources , and the loss of organic matter in soils are responsible for desertification ; they are both its cause and effect . does this mean that we have no choice but to capitulate ?
no .
what it means is that by developing and using intelligent approaches we can achieve several goals at once .
soil conservation techniques , including erosion control walls , agro-forestry , and organic fertilization , are methods that are both effective and widely known - and these need to be applied on a larger scale . the reason why the picture continues to be dominated by individual measures is not technical in nature , indeed this must be seen as a problem bound up with economic incentives and political interests . incentives to support farmers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protecting trees can counter soil degradation since agriculture is organized primarily along private lines , soil conservation measures need to be carried out mainly by the private sector .
it is essential that incentives be set to ensure that investments in farmland yield returns , and the relatively high prices currently commanded by agricultural goods offer a good opportunity . there is considerable evidence that farmers carry out soil protection measures on their own if they lack more profitable alternatives and if the know-how and cost viability are available .
there is no lack of instructive examples , and german development cooperation offers a good number of them .
it is high time to start providing farmers in desertification-prone regions with appropriate advisory services as well as with the funds they need to transport stones to build erosion control walls , etc . , and to do so not intermittently but as a general rule . however , both agro-industry and institutional conditions also need to be modernized .
one correct and promising approach would be to encourage the agrochemical industry to gear production more to soil substrate additives . moreover , the agricultural policies of developing countries urgently need to be reoriented to reduce the fertilizer subsidies so widespread today and instead to increase the credit available in the agricultural sector .
and land rights need to be modified in such a way as to ensure that farmers have incentives to undertake soil conservation measures . no time to lose bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : modernizing the agro industry is vital in coutering the impact of climate change instead of continuing to generate vast amounts of greenhouse gases by producing and using mineral fertilizers incapable of achieving the hoped-for results on degraded soils , it would make far more sense to engage in organic agriculture keyed chiefly to on-farm resources .
this could serve to enhance soil storage capacity and - in cases where the needed organic matter is unavailable - to regenerate it by using industrially produced soil substrates .
land management of this kind tends to raise yields per unit area to earlier levels , and to do so precisely in arid regions . but is also essential to protect land at the supra-farm level , on state-owned land .
this , though , calls for a huge supply of labor .
in keeping with a proposal advanced by the united nations environment program -lrb- unep -rrb- , a " global green new deal " could be used to realize the action plans adopted to implement the un desertification convention , and in times of recession this would at the same time amount to an effective labor market policy . this should also include large-scale projects - like the building of " green walls " in china and the sahel belt - and efforts to link them with the numerous individual participatory measures already in progress , in order to achieve synergy effects . it would be important to implement measures geared at once to conservation and re-cultivation in order to come up with comprehensive measures that serve to reach several goals at the same time : protection of forests , water , climate , and soils .
this is a realistic aim in that the different organizational phases involved basically tend to correlate positively with one another . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neubert says that desertification is partly reversible how much time do we have left ?
the good news is that in many cases desertification is reversible .
the bad new is that this goes hand in hand with declining marginal utility , and when a certain stage of degradation has been reached , re-cultivation proves so labor-intensive that it is more attractive for the population to migrate to urban areas .
in other words , we have no time to lose .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 26.06.2009 cologne therapy center helps torture victims get their lives back großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : torture is carried out in prisons and detention centers in many countries june 26 is the un international day in support of victims of torture .
torture victims carry the burden of their experiences forever , but one therapy center in cologne seeks to make living with the memories bearable . petek t. * has been a patient at the cologne therapy center for torture victims for two years now , but the memories of her torture during her imprisonment in turkey are still very vivid .
her biggest wish is for something that many people take for granted : sleep .
" during the day , i can distract myself , " she said .
" but at night , i have problems sleeping , and nightmares .
the traumatic experiences always come back . "
petek , now 38 , was 18 when she began her university studies in her hometown of izmir in western turkey .
she wanted to become a journalist , and wrote articles for student organizations criticizing an increase of repression and the authoritarian approach of the turkish government .
she was sent to jail three times for her writing after being convicted or being a member in a forbidden organization .
her most recent imprisonment was from 1994-2002 , but even seven years later , it churns up too many memories for her to talk about .
since her time in a turkish prison , the situation of prisoners there has improved somewhat , she said , but people are still being tortured .
" people are still dying in prison under unclear circumstances , but the government denies that there is systematic torture going on in turkey , " said petek .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in some places , phsychological torture has replaced traditional methods waiting list for torture therapy the cologne therapy center for torture victims was founded in 1985 as a pilot project by the un high commissioner of refugees , and is run as a charitable organization .
uenal hamidye is petek 's therapist at the therapy center , and is familiar with many cases that are similar to hers .
hamidye said torture methods are becoming increasingly psychological , and often leave behind no physical marks .
" for example , someone might come and say ' if you do n't talk , we 're going to get your wife and rape her , " ' she said .
" the people are faced with a dilemma : either they betray their organization or they have to watch as their wives , mothers , or sisters are raped . "
petek is one of many former torture victims who come to the therapy center for help .
the demand on the center 's services is so high that there is often a waiting list .
when she first arrived in germany with her husband in 2004 , petek was told she 'd have to wait one to two years to be admitted .
" a psychological crisis does n't wait , " said petek .
" i saw no more point in my life anymore .
but i had a breakdown and was brought to the clinic where the doctors put me in contact with -lrb- hamidye -rrb- .
that 's why i 'm here , and i 'm very happy about that . "
the therapy center treats between 600 and 800 torture victims each year .
the center offers individual and group therapy sessions , and also gives help in dealing with day to day life , including learning german or completing administrative tasks connected with moving to a different country .
no ' getting back to normal ' for torture victims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un human rights commissioner navanethem pillay has called for the prohibition of torture brigitte brand-wilhelmy , director of the therapy center , said that most of the current patients come from iran , iraq , certain african nations , and particularly from former yugoslavia . " we have women here who lost their entire families in massacres , " brand-wilhelmy said .

torture victims carry the burden of their experiences forever , but one therapy center in cologne seeks to make living with the memories bearable . petek t. * has been a patient at the cologne therapy center for torture victims for two years now , but the memories of her torture during her imprisonment in turkey are still very vivid .
her biggest wish is for something that many people take for granted : sleep .
" during the day , i can distract myself , " she said .
" but at night , i have problems sleeping , and nightmares .
the traumatic experiences always come back . "
petek , now 38 , was 18 when she began her university studies in her hometown of izmir in western turkey .
she wanted to become a journalist , and wrote articles for student organizations criticizing an increase of repression and the authoritarian approach of the turkish government .
she was sent to jail three times for her writing after being convicted or being a member in a forbidden organization .
her most recent imprisonment was from 1994-2002 , but even seven years later , it churns up too many memories for her to talk about .
since her time in a turkish prison , the situation of prisoners there has improved somewhat , she said , but people are still being tortured .
" people are still dying in prison under unclear circumstances , but the government denies that there is systematic torture going on in turkey , " said petek .

uenal hamidye is petek 's therapist at the therapy center , and is familiar with many cases that are similar to hers .
hamidye said torture methods are becoming increasingly psychological , and often leave behind no physical marks .
" for example , someone might come and say ' if you do n't talk , we 're going to get your wife and rape her , " ' she said .
" the people are faced with a dilemma : either they betray their organization or they have to watch as their wives , mothers , or sisters are raped . "
petek is one of many former torture victims who come to the therapy center for help .
the demand on the center 's services is so high that there is often a waiting list .
when she first arrived in germany with her husband in 2004 , petek was told she 'd have to wait one to two years to be admitted .
" a psychological crisis does n't wait , " said petek .
" i saw no more point in my life anymore .
but i had a breakdown and was brought to the clinic where the doctors put me in contact with -lrb- hamidye -rrb- .
that 's why i 'm here , and i 'm very happy about that . "
the therapy center treats between 600 and 800 torture victims each year .
the center offers individual and group therapy sessions , and also gives help in dealing with day to day life , including learning german or completing administrative tasks connected with moving to a different country .

torture victims carry the burden of their experiences forever , but one therapy center in cologne seeks to make living with the memories bearable . petek t. * has been a patient at the cologne therapy center for torture victims for two years now , but the memories of her torture during her imprisonment in turkey are still very vivid .
her biggest wish is for something that many people take for granted : sleep .
" during the day , i can distract myself , " she said .
" but at night , i have problems sleeping , and nightmares .
the traumatic experiences always come back . "
petek , now 38 , was 18 when she began her university studies in her hometown of izmir in western turkey .
she wanted to become a journalist , and wrote articles for student organizations criticizing an increase of repression and the authoritarian approach of the turkish government .
she was sent to jail three times for her writing after being convicted or being a member in a forbidden organization .
her most recent imprisonment was from 1994-2002 , but even seven years later , it churns up too many memories for her to talk about .
since her time in a turkish prison , the situation of prisoners there has improved somewhat , she said , but people are still being tortured .
" people are still dying in prison under unclear circumstances , but the government denies that there is systematic torture going on in turkey , " said petek .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in some places , phsychological torture has replaced traditional methods waiting list for torture therapy the cologne therapy center for torture victims was founded in 1985 as a pilot project by the un high commissioner of refugees , and is run as a charitable organization .
uenal hamidye is petek 's therapist at the therapy center , and is familiar with many cases that are similar to hers .
hamidye said torture methods are becoming increasingly psychological , and often leave behind no physical marks .
" for example , someone might come and say ' if you do n't talk , we 're going to get your wife and rape her , " ' she said .
" the people are faced with a dilemma : either they betray their organization or they have to watch as their wives , mothers , or sisters are raped . "
petek is one of many former torture victims who come to the therapy center for help .
the demand on the center 's services is so high that there is often a waiting list .
when she first arrived in germany with her husband in 2004 , petek was told she 'd have to wait one to two years to be admitted .
" a psychological crisis does n't wait , " said petek .
" i saw no more point in my life anymore .
but i had a breakdown and was brought to the clinic where the doctors put me in contact with -lrb- hamidye -rrb- .
that 's why i 'm here , and i 'm very happy about that . "
the therapy center treats between 600 and 800 torture victims each year .
the center offers individual and group therapy sessions , and also gives help in dealing with day to day life , including learning german or completing administrative tasks connected with moving to a different country .
no ' getting back to normal ' for torture victims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un human rights commissioner navanethem pillay has called for the prohibition of torture brigitte brand-wilhelmy , director of the therapy center , said that most of the current patients come from iran , iraq , certain african nations , and particularly from former yugoslavia . " we have women here who lost their entire families in massacres , " brand-wilhelmy said .
" they watched as their siblings and parents were murdered .
we hear stories where it is hard to imagine how people can do such things to one another . "
it takes a lot of time for torture victims to recover from their experiences , and petek is still working through the effects of what was done to her .
it 's not just nightmares , either .
her therapist has told her she is suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder .
she has concentration problems and can not work , which makes it difficult to fully embrace her new home in germany .
" every day is a struggle , " petek said .
" my husband and i do n't have family or friends here , we only have each other .
because of the effects of the torture , it is hard to learn new things ; at the moment , learning german is taking quite a while .
we 'd love to get adjusted to living in germany , but it 's difficult . " * her last name has been withheld for privacy reasons .

but in germany 's case , the real stars do n't stick with the team very long .
dw 's jefferson chase explains . when the young german eleven beat italy 1-0 in the semifinals of the event on friday , june 26 , they moved a step closer to making history .
germany may be a soccer powerhouse , but the record of the u21 national team is anything but stellar .
incredibly enough , they 've never won a major tournament - a blot that coach horst hrubesch currently wants to rectify in sweden .
still , after needing a nervy draw against england to qualify for the knock-out stage , hrubesch is n't exactly jumping for joy .
" the only thing i 'm happy about is making the semis , " the coach told dpa news agency after the england match .
" i 'm not at all satisfied with how we did it - it was way below our ambitions . "
with the german u17 and u19 teams having won their european titles , this could be the year for germany 's youth teams .
but would it signal a glorious future ahead for the adult german national team ?
probably not .
here today , gone tomorrow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year , before taking his current job , hrubesch won europe with the u19 germany 's footballing reputation is one of solidity and consistency rather than mercurial brilliance so you might expect the national soccer association , the dfb , to bring up players gradually through the various levels .
but the opposite is the case .
goalkeeping legend oliver kahn and super striker miroslav klose never played in the youth ranks , going straight into the main national team .
and while most of the current national squad did take the pitch for the u21s , very few of the real stars - michael ballack , bastian schweinsteiger or lukas podolski , for example - made more than a handful of appearances , before being promoted up to the big league .
the uefa u21 championship has only been in existence in its current form since 1978 , and it took some time for germany to take them seriously .
even into the 1990s the dfb eleven were playing with a sweeper .
as a result , germany have always gone home empty handed while italy have won europe five times , and even england - never a national side known for tournament successes - have hoisted the trophy twice .
ones to watch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany are glad oezil , r , choose to play for them instead of turkey given the german u21s ' history , the players most likely to play roles in the top squad are those who have already been called up by national coach joachim loew .
diminutive forward marko marin has n't been able to make much of a mark in sweden , but leverkusen 's gonzalo castro , stuttgart 's sami khedira and schalke goalkeeper manuel neuer have performed well .
and the star of the show has been mesut oezil , who normally plays on the wing for his club bremen but who has shone in a striker role for hrubesch , setting up both of goals in germany 's 2-nil win over finland in the group stage .
and the breakthrough player of the squad is defender jerome boateng .
boateng usually serves as right back and has struggled to keep a position in the starting line-up for his club hamburg .
but he 's drawn high marks in all his matches for the young germans playing as a central defender - a role for which hamburg might consider him when he returns from sweden .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : castro is part of germany 's multi-cultural squad those names point to an unmistakable trend within the german national team - the growing prominence of players who were born outside germany or who come from an immigrant background .
klose , podolski , both polish born , have established themselves as mainstays in germany adult national team - and they 've recently been joined by piotr trochowski .
in the u21 , eight of the current 24 members of the squad come from multi-national backgrounds .
so if germany continues the tradition of integrating younger players quickly into the main men 's team , some of hrubesch 's charges could play a role at the 2010 world cup in south africa .

guest commentator susanne neubert says that we have a global responsibility to counter soil degradation and there 's no time to lose . some 70 percent of the world 's arid regions face desertification , and in around 110 countries - most of them poor - desertification threatens an area roughly the size of europe . twenty million tons of grain are lost annually due to desertification and , over the past 40 years , one third of the world 's arable land has been abandoned . even though there is no doubt about the causes of desertification , and the strategies needed to combat it are known , no turnaround is yet in sight .
why is it that neither the un desertification convention nor countless initiatives and programs have managed to halt the ongoing process of desertification ? unsustainable land management bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in many regions water for irrigation is not readily available the principal factors behind desertification are unsustainable land management and climate change .
as far as land management is concerned , incorrect farming practices also play a major role .
these include the cultivation of annual crop species , coupled with management methods that intermittently leave soils uncovered and exposed to erosion . other aspects of " incorrect " farming practices include faulty irrigation and either a total lack of fertilization or lopsided use of mineral fertilisers .
this often leads to soil mineralization , particularly in tropical regions , depriving soils of their capacity to store water .
carbon compounds , previously fixed in the soil in the form of organic matter , are released into the air in the course of the mineralization process .
this reduces the soil 's buffering capacity for drought and flooding , at the same time directly contributing to climate change . a good number of resource problems are closely interlinked : together , deforestation , species loss , climate change , growing scarcity of water resources , and the loss of organic matter in soils are responsible for desertification ; they are both its cause and effect . does this mean that we have no choice but to capitulate ?
no .
what it means is that by developing and using intelligent approaches we can achieve several goals at once .
soil conservation techniques , including erosion control walls , agro-forestry , and organic fertilization , are methods that are both effective and widely known - and these need to be applied on a larger scale . the reason why the picture continues to be dominated by individual measures is not technical in nature , indeed this must be seen as a problem bound up with economic incentives and political interests . incentives to support farmers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protecting trees can counter soil degradation since agriculture is organized primarily along private lines , soil conservation measures need to be carried out mainly by the private sector .
it is essential that incentives be set to ensure that investments in farmland yield returns , and the relatively high prices currently commanded by agricultural goods offer a good opportunity . there is considerable evidence that farmers carry out soil protection measures on their own if they lack more profitable alternatives and if the know-how and cost viability are available .
there is no lack of instructive examples , and german development cooperation offers a good number of them .
it is high time to start providing farmers in desertification-prone regions with appropriate advisory services as well as with the funds they need to transport stones to build erosion control walls , etc . , and to do so not intermittently but as a general rule . however , both agro-industry and institutional conditions also need to be modernized .
one correct and promising approach would be to encourage the agrochemical industry to gear production more to soil substrate additives . moreover , the agricultural policies of developing countries urgently need to be reoriented to reduce the fertilizer subsidies so widespread today and instead to increase the credit available in the agricultural sector .
and land rights need to be modified in such a way as to ensure that farmers have incentives to undertake soil conservation measures . no time to lose bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : modernizing the agro industry is vital in coutering the impact of climate change instead of continuing to generate vast amounts of greenhouse gases by producing and using mineral fertilizers incapable of achieving the hoped-for results on degraded soils , it would make far more sense to engage in organic agriculture keyed chiefly to on-farm resources .
this could serve to enhance soil storage capacity and - in cases where the needed organic matter is unavailable - to regenerate it by using industrially produced soil substrates .
land management of this kind tends to raise yields per unit area to earlier levels , and to do so precisely in arid regions . but is also essential to protect land at the supra-farm level , on state-owned land .
this , though , calls for a huge supply of labor .
in keeping with a proposal advanced by the united nations environment program -lrb- unep -rrb- , a " global green new deal " could be used to realize the action plans adopted to implement the un desertification convention , and in times of recession this would at the same time amount to an effective labor market policy . this should also include large-scale projects - like the building of " green walls " in china and the sahel belt - and efforts to link them with the numerous individual participatory measures already in progress , in order to achieve synergy effects . it would be important to implement measures geared at once to conservation and re-cultivation in order to come up with comprehensive measures that serve to reach several goals at the same time : protection of forests , water , climate , and soils .
this is a realistic aim in that the different organizational phases involved basically tend to correlate positively with one another . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neubert says that desertification is partly reversible how much time do we have left ?
the good news is that in many cases desertification is reversible .
the bad new is that this goes hand in hand with declining marginal utility , and when a certain stage of degradation has been reached , re-cultivation proves so labor-intensive that it is more attractive for the population to migrate to urban areas .
in other words , we have no time to lose .
this is not a question of " aid " but of global responsibility . author : dr.susanne neubert / -lrb- ara -rrb- editor : kate bowen dr. susanne neubert is a senior researcher at the german development institute -lrb- deutsches institut für entwicklungspolitik - die -rrb- , which is a multi-disciplinary think-tank for german and multilateral development policy .

guest commentator susanne neubert says that we have a global responsibility to counter soil degradation and there 's no time to lose . some 70 percent of the world 's arid regions face desertification , and in around 110 countries - most of them poor - desertification threatens an area roughly the size of europe . twenty million tons of grain are lost annually due to desertification and , over the past 40 years , one third of the world 's arable land has been abandoned . even though there is no doubt about the causes of desertification , and the strategies needed to combat it are known , no turnaround is yet in sight .
why is it that neither the un desertification convention nor countless initiatives and programs have managed to halt the ongoing process of desertification ? unsustainable land management bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in many regions water for irrigation is not readily available the principal factors behind desertification are unsustainable land management and climate change .
as far as land management is concerned , incorrect farming practices also play a major role .
these include the cultivation of annual crop species , coupled with management methods that intermittently leave soils uncovered and exposed to erosion . other aspects of " incorrect " farming practices include faulty irrigation and either a total lack of fertilization or lopsided use of mineral fertilisers .
this often leads to soil mineralization , particularly in tropical regions , depriving soils of their capacity to store water .
carbon compounds , previously fixed in the soil in the form of organic matter , are released into the air in the course of the mineralization process .
this reduces the soil 's buffering capacity for drought and flooding , at the same time directly contributing to climate change . a good number of resource problems are closely interlinked : together , deforestation , species loss , climate change , growing scarcity of water resources , and the loss of organic matter in soils are responsible for desertification ; they are both its cause and effect . does this mean that we have no choice but to capitulate ?
no .
what it means is that by developing and using intelligent approaches we can achieve several goals at once .
soil conservation techniques , including erosion control walls , agro-forestry , and organic fertilization , are methods that are both effective and widely known - and these need to be applied on a larger scale . the reason why the picture continues to be dominated by individual measures is not technical in nature , indeed this must be seen as a problem bound up with economic incentives and political interests . incentives to support farmers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protecting trees can counter soil degradation since agriculture is organized primarily along private lines , soil conservation measures need to be carried out mainly by the private sector .
it is essential that incentives be set to ensure that investments in farmland yield returns , and the relatively high prices currently commanded by agricultural goods offer a good opportunity . there is considerable evidence that farmers carry out soil protection measures on their own if they lack more profitable alternatives and if the know-how and cost viability are available .
there is no lack of instructive examples , and german development cooperation offers a good number of them .
it is high time to start providing farmers in desertification-prone regions with appropriate advisory services as well as with the funds they need to transport stones to build erosion control walls , etc . , and to do so not intermittently but as a general rule . however , both agro-industry and institutional conditions also need to be modernized .
one correct and promising approach would be to encourage the agrochemical industry to gear production more to soil substrate additives . moreover , the agricultural policies of developing countries urgently need to be reoriented to reduce the fertilizer subsidies so widespread today and instead to increase the credit available in the agricultural sector .
and land rights need to be modified in such a way as to ensure that farmers have incentives to undertake soil conservation measures . no time to lose bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : modernizing the agro industry is vital in coutering the impact of climate change instead of continuing to generate vast amounts of greenhouse gases by producing and using mineral fertilizers incapable of achieving the hoped-for results on degraded soils , it would make far more sense to engage in organic agriculture keyed chiefly to on-farm resources .
this could serve to enhance soil storage capacity and - in cases where the needed organic matter is unavailable - to regenerate it by using industrially produced soil substrates .
land management of this kind tends to raise yields per unit area to earlier levels , and to do so precisely in arid regions . but is also essential to protect land at the supra-farm level , on state-owned land .

" turkey can not accept the position of germany and france .
a privileged partnership does n't exist in -lrb- european law -rrb- , " erdogan told journalists before attending a forum in brussels , adding that turkey 's goal is full membership and any alternative " is out of the question . "
erdogan said french president nicolas sarkozy had been inconsistent , showing more openness to turkey 's accession in private talks than in public .
" our european friends unfortunately have a unilateral expectation which is rather populist and it saddens us .
i hope we will overcome this , " he said .
ankara launches diplomatic drive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan , left , faces an uphill battle on turkey 's eu entry bid turkey has mounted a diplomatic offensive aimed at boosting its chances of joining the eu , with erdogan visiting brussels twice in the span of three months .
in addition , his foreign minister , ahmet devutoglu , was also in brussels on friday to meet the eu enlargement commissioner , olli rehn , ahead of an accession conference planned for next week .
turkey 's membership was also a campaign issue in this month 's european parliament election , with some right-wing parties making gains after opposing its accession .
" some narrow-minded politicians have used turkey as election material , and we believe this to be very wrong and very populist , " erdogan said .
" we will never give up .
we are patient , we do our homework ... and we continue moving forward . "
changing the constitution erdogan 's comments come just a day after he had told journalists that plans to change the turkish constitution , key to keeping turkey 's bid for eu membership on track , are a " waste of time " as long as opposition parties keep blocking all efforts in parliament . erdogan 's comments were the clearest sign yet that his government could ditch its long standing goal of joining the 27-nation bloc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most europeans oppose turkey 's entry bid because it is a moslem country , poor , and situated mostly in asia erdogan promised after march local elections to renew efforts to revamp the 1982 constitution , drawn up under military rule , which would go a long way towards removing one of the major obstacles in ankara 's eu path . " all parties should be involved in efforts to reform the constitution , but the main opposition party rejects and blocks all efforts .
so as long as we are faced with such an approach these efforts are nothing but a waste of time .
we will have to continue with the present constitution , " erdogan said . sweden supports turkey 's eu bid the eu wants turkey to speed up political and economic reforms , including the removal of curbs on free speech , ensuring more rights for minorities and reducing the influence of the armed forces in government affairs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president sarkozy and german chancellor merkel are vocal opponents of full eu membership for turkey any sign that turkey is throwing in the towel could spell serious trouble for its membership bid and even have negative consequences for the country 's political and economic stability , analysts say .
" we are getting very close to crunch time , " said amanda akcakoca , a specialist on the issue at the european policy center in brussels .
" turkey needs to think out of the box and do something unexpected to impress europe . "
ankara ’ s bid for eu membership does , however , have the support of sweden , which takes over the six-month eu presidency on july 1 .
swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt has said his country will try its best to open a new chapter of european union membership negotiations with turkey when it takes over the rotating eu presidency next week . reinfeldt told the associated press news agency that such negotiations would be of " utmost strategic importance for europe " and pointed out the european union had promised it would negotiate with turkey .
cyprus question the process has also been slowed by ankara 's refusal to recognize eu member cyprus .
on thursday , european commission president jose manuel barroso said cypriots should seize a “ historic chance ” to reunite the mediterranean island .
" there is a unique chance this year to bring an end to this long-running conflict on european soil , " barroso told journalists .
" this chance must be taken . " cyprus was divided in a turkish invasion in 1974 after a brief greek-inspired coup .
turkey 's entry to the european union partly hinges on a peace deal in cyprus , whose greek cypriots represent the island in the bloc .
the eu unanimously began accession talks with turkey in 2005 , but since then , negotiations have slowed to a crawl with the bloc deeply divided about accepting turkey .
adding to the sense of limbo , so far only 10 of the 35 policy areas that candidates must complete have been opened , and eight of these have been frozen over the cyprus dispute. nrt / mrm / afp / ap / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internationals -pipe- 26.06.2009 under 21s provide a mixed picture of germany 's footballing future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these young men are trying to become the most successful german u21 team ever the 2009 u21 european championships are being touted as a chance to see tomorrow 's stars today .
but in germany 's case , the real stars do n't stick with the team very long .
dw 's jefferson chase explains . when the young german eleven beat italy 1-0 in the semifinals of the event on friday , june 26 , they moved a step closer to making history .
germany may be a soccer powerhouse , but the record of the u21 national team is anything but stellar .
incredibly enough , they 've never won a major tournament - a blot that coach horst hrubesch currently wants to rectify in sweden .
still , after needing a nervy draw against england to qualify for the knock-out stage , hrubesch is n't exactly jumping for joy .
" the only thing i 'm happy about is making the semis , " the coach told dpa news agency after the england match .
" i 'm not at all satisfied with how we did it - it was way below our ambitions . "
with the german u17 and u19 teams having won their european titles , this could be the year for germany 's youth teams .
but would it signal a glorious future ahead for the adult german national team ?
probably not .
here today , gone tomorrow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year , before taking his current job , hrubesch won europe with the u19 germany 's footballing reputation is one of solidity and consistency rather than mercurial brilliance so you might expect the national soccer association , the dfb , to bring up players gradually through the various levels .
but the opposite is the case .
goalkeeping legend oliver kahn and super striker miroslav klose never played in the youth ranks , going straight into the main national team .
and while most of the current national squad did take the pitch for the u21s , very few of the real stars - michael ballack , bastian schweinsteiger or lukas podolski , for example - made more than a handful of appearances , before being promoted up to the big league .
the uefa u21 championship has only been in existence in its current form since 1978 , and it took some time for germany to take them seriously .
even into the 1990s the dfb eleven were playing with a sweeper .
as a result , germany have always gone home empty handed while italy have won europe five times , and even england - never a national side known for tournament successes - have hoisted the trophy twice .
ones to watch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany are glad oezil , r , choose to play for them instead of turkey given the german u21s ' history , the players most likely to play roles in the top squad are those who have already been called up by national coach joachim loew .
diminutive forward marko marin has n't been able to make much of a mark in sweden , but leverkusen 's gonzalo castro , stuttgart 's sami khedira and schalke goalkeeper manuel neuer have performed well .
and the star of the show has been mesut oezil , who normally plays on the wing for his club bremen but who has shone in a striker role for hrubesch , setting up both of goals in germany 's 2-nil win over finland in the group stage .
and the breakthrough player of the squad is defender jerome boateng .
boateng usually serves as right back and has struggled to keep a position in the starting line-up for his club hamburg .
but he 's drawn high marks in all his matches for the young germans playing as a central defender - a role for which hamburg might consider him when he returns from sweden .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : castro is part of germany 's multi-cultural squad those names point to an unmistakable trend within the german national team - the growing prominence of players who were born outside germany or who come from an immigrant background .
klose , podolski , both polish born , have established themselves as mainstays in germany adult national team - and they 've recently been joined by piotr trochowski .
in the u21 , eight of the current 24 members of the squad come from multi-national backgrounds .
so if germany continues the tradition of integrating younger players quickly into the main men 's team , some of hrubesch 's charges could play a role at the 2010 world cup in south africa .

but in germany 's case , the real stars do n't stick with the team very long .
dw 's jefferson chase explains . when the young german eleven beat italy 1-0 in the semifinals of the event on friday , june 26 , they moved a step closer to making history .
germany may be a soccer powerhouse , but the record of the u21 national team is anything but stellar .
incredibly enough , they 've never won a major tournament - a blot that coach horst hrubesch currently wants to rectify in sweden .
still , after needing a nervy draw against england to qualify for the knock-out stage , hrubesch is n't exactly jumping for joy .
" the only thing i 'm happy about is making the semis , " the coach told dpa news agency after the england match .
" i 'm not at all satisfied with how we did it - it was way below our ambitions . "
with the german u17 and u19 teams having won their european titles , this could be the year for germany 's youth teams .
but would it signal a glorious future ahead for the adult german national team ?
probably not .
here today , gone tomorrow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year , before taking his current job , hrubesch won europe with the u19 germany 's footballing reputation is one of solidity and consistency rather than mercurial brilliance so you might expect the national soccer association , the dfb , to bring up players gradually through the various levels .
but the opposite is the case .
goalkeeping legend oliver kahn and super striker miroslav klose never played in the youth ranks , going straight into the main national team .
and while most of the current national squad did take the pitch for the u21s , very few of the real stars - michael ballack , bastian schweinsteiger or lukas podolski , for example - made more than a handful of appearances , before being promoted up to the big league .
the uefa u21 championship has only been in existence in its current form since 1978 , and it took some time for germany to take them seriously .
even into the 1990s the dfb eleven were playing with a sweeper .
as a result , germany have always gone home empty handed while italy have won europe five times , and even england - never a national side known for tournament successes - have hoisted the trophy twice .
ones to watch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany are glad oezil , r , choose to play for them instead of turkey given the german u21s ' history , the players most likely to play roles in the top squad are those who have already been called up by national coach joachim loew .
diminutive forward marko marin has n't been able to make much of a mark in sweden , but leverkusen 's gonzalo castro , stuttgart 's sami khedira and schalke goalkeeper manuel neuer have performed well .
and the star of the show has been mesut oezil , who normally plays on the wing for his club bremen but who has shone in a striker role for hrubesch , setting up both of goals in germany 's 2-nil win over finland in the group stage .
and the breakthrough player of the squad is defender jerome boateng .
boateng usually serves as right back and has struggled to keep a position in the starting line-up for his club hamburg .
but he 's drawn high marks in all his matches for the young germans playing as a central defender - a role for which hamburg might consider him when he returns from sweden .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : castro is part of germany 's multi-cultural squad those names point to an unmistakable trend within the german national team - the growing prominence of players who were born outside germany or who come from an immigrant background .
klose , podolski , both polish born , have established themselves as mainstays in germany adult national team - and they 've recently been joined by piotr trochowski .
in the u21 , eight of the current 24 members of the squad come from multi-national backgrounds .
so if germany continues the tradition of integrating younger players quickly into the main men 's team , some of hrubesch 's charges could play a role at the 2010 world cup in south africa .

" turkey can not accept the position of germany and france .
a privileged partnership does n't exist in -lrb- european law -rrb- , " erdogan told journalists before attending a forum in brussels , adding that turkey 's goal is full membership and any alternative " is out of the question . "
erdogan said french president nicolas sarkozy had been inconsistent , showing more openness to turkey 's accession in private talks than in public .
" our european friends unfortunately have a unilateral expectation which is rather populist and it saddens us .
i hope we will overcome this , " he said .
ankara launches diplomatic drive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan , left , faces an uphill battle on turkey 's eu entry bid turkey has mounted a diplomatic offensive aimed at boosting its chances of joining the eu , with erdogan visiting brussels twice in the span of three months .
in addition , his foreign minister , ahmet devutoglu , was also in brussels on friday to meet the eu enlargement commissioner , olli rehn , ahead of an accession conference planned for next week .
turkey 's membership was also a campaign issue in this month 's european parliament election , with some right-wing parties making gains after opposing its accession .
" some narrow-minded politicians have used turkey as election material , and we believe this to be very wrong and very populist , " erdogan said .
" we will never give up .
we are patient , we do our homework ... and we continue moving forward . "
changing the constitution erdogan 's comments come just a day after he had told journalists that plans to change the turkish constitution , key to keeping turkey 's bid for eu membership on track , are a " waste of time " as long as opposition parties keep blocking all efforts in parliament . erdogan 's comments were the clearest sign yet that his government could ditch its long standing goal of joining the 27-nation bloc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most europeans oppose turkey 's entry bid because it is a moslem country , poor , and situated mostly in asia erdogan promised after march local elections to renew efforts to revamp the 1982 constitution , drawn up under military rule , which would go a long way towards removing one of the major obstacles in ankara 's eu path . " all parties should be involved in efforts to reform the constitution , but the main opposition party rejects and blocks all efforts .
so as long as we are faced with such an approach these efforts are nothing but a waste of time .
we will have to continue with the present constitution , " erdogan said . sweden supports turkey 's eu bid the eu wants turkey to speed up political and economic reforms , including the removal of curbs on free speech , ensuring more rights for minorities and reducing the influence of the armed forces in government affairs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president sarkozy and german chancellor merkel are vocal opponents of full eu membership for turkey any sign that turkey is throwing in the towel could spell serious trouble for its membership bid and even have negative consequences for the country 's political and economic stability , analysts say .
" we are getting very close to crunch time , " said amanda akcakoca , a specialist on the issue at the european policy center in brussels .
" turkey needs to think out of the box and do something unexpected to impress europe . "
ankara ’ s bid for eu membership does , however , have the support of sweden , which takes over the six-month eu presidency on july 1 .
swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt has said his country will try its best to open a new chapter of european union membership negotiations with turkey when it takes over the rotating eu presidency next week . reinfeldt told the associated press news agency that such negotiations would be of " utmost strategic importance for europe " and pointed out the european union had promised it would negotiate with turkey .

a privileged partnership does n't exist in -lrb- european law -rrb- , " erdogan told journalists before attending a forum in brussels , adding that turkey 's goal is full membership and any alternative " is out of the question . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internationals -pipe- 26.06.2009 under 21s provide a mixed picture of germany 's footballing future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these young men are trying to become the most successful german u21 team ever the 2009 u21 european championships are being touted as a chance to see tomorrow 's stars today .
but in germany 's case , the real stars do n't stick with the team very long .
dw 's jefferson chase explains . when the young german eleven beat italy 1-0 in the semifinals of the event on friday , june 26 , they moved a step closer to making history .
germany may be a soccer powerhouse , but the record of the u21 national team is anything but stellar .
incredibly enough , they 've never won a major tournament - a blot that coach horst hrubesch currently wants to rectify in sweden .
still , after needing a nervy draw against england to qualify for the knock-out stage , hrubesch is n't exactly jumping for joy .
" the only thing i 'm happy about is making the semis , " the coach told dpa news agency after the england match .
" i 'm not at all satisfied with how we did it - it was way below our ambitions . "
with the german u17 and u19 teams having won their european titles , this could be the year for germany 's youth teams .
but would it signal a glorious future ahead for the adult german national team ?
probably not .
here today , gone tomorrow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year , before taking his current job , hrubesch won europe with the u19 germany 's footballing reputation is one of solidity and consistency rather than mercurial brilliance so you might expect the national soccer association , the dfb , to bring up players gradually through the various levels .
but the opposite is the case .
goalkeeping legend oliver kahn and super striker miroslav klose never played in the youth ranks , going straight into the main national team .
and while most of the current national squad did take the pitch for the u21s , very few of the real stars - michael ballack , bastian schweinsteiger or lukas podolski , for example - made more than a handful of appearances , before being promoted up to the big league .
the uefa u21 championship has only been in existence in its current form since 1978 , and it took some time for germany to take them seriously .
even into the 1990s the dfb eleven were playing with a sweeper .
as a result , germany have always gone home empty handed while italy have won europe five times , and even england - never a national side known for tournament successes - have hoisted the trophy twice .
ones to watch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany are glad oezil , r , choose to play for them instead of turkey given the german u21s ' history , the players most likely to play roles in the top squad are those who have already been called up by national coach joachim loew .
diminutive forward marko marin has n't been able to make much of a mark in sweden , but leverkusen 's gonzalo castro , stuttgart 's sami khedira and schalke goalkeeper manuel neuer have performed well .
and the star of the show has been mesut oezil , who normally plays on the wing for his club bremen but who has shone in a striker role for hrubesch , setting up both of goals in germany 's 2-nil win over finland in the group stage .
and the breakthrough player of the squad is defender jerome boateng .
boateng usually serves as right back and has struggled to keep a position in the starting line-up for his club hamburg .
but he 's drawn high marks in all his matches for the young germans playing as a central defender - a role for which hamburg might consider him when he returns from sweden .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : castro is part of germany 's multi-cultural squad those names point to an unmistakable trend within the german national team - the growing prominence of players who were born outside germany or who come from an immigrant background .
klose , podolski , both polish born , have established themselves as mainstays in germany adult national team - and they 've recently been joined by piotr trochowski .
in the u21 , eight of the current 24 members of the squad come from multi-national backgrounds .
so if germany continues the tradition of integrating younger players quickly into the main men 's team , some of hrubesch 's charges could play a role at the 2010 world cup in south africa .

torture victims carry the burden of their experiences forever , but one therapy center in cologne seeks to make living with the memories bearable . petek t. * has been a patient at the cologne therapy center for torture victims for two years now , but the memories of her torture during her imprisonment in turkey are still very vivid .
her biggest wish is for something that many people take for granted : sleep .
" during the day , i can distract myself , " she said .
" but at night , i have problems sleeping , and nightmares .
the traumatic experiences always come back . "
petek , now 38 , was 18 when she began her university studies in her hometown of izmir in western turkey .
she wanted to become a journalist , and wrote articles for student organizations criticizing an increase of repression and the authoritarian approach of the turkish government .
she was sent to jail three times for her writing after being convicted or being a member in a forbidden organization .
her most recent imprisonment was from 1994-2002 , but even seven years later , it churns up too many memories for her to talk about .
since her time in a turkish prison , the situation of prisoners there has improved somewhat , she said , but people are still being tortured .
" people are still dying in prison under unclear circumstances , but the government denies that there is systematic torture going on in turkey , " said petek .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in some places , phsychological torture has replaced traditional methods waiting list for torture therapy the cologne therapy center for torture victims was founded in 1985 as a pilot project by the un high commissioner of refugees , and is run as a charitable organization .
uenal hamidye is petek 's therapist at the therapy center , and is familiar with many cases that are similar to hers .
hamidye said torture methods are becoming increasingly psychological , and often leave behind no physical marks .
" for example , someone might come and say ' if you do n't talk , we 're going to get your wife and rape her , " ' she said .
" the people are faced with a dilemma : either they betray their organization or they have to watch as their wives , mothers , or sisters are raped . "
petek is one of many former torture victims who come to the therapy center for help .
the demand on the center 's services is so high that there is often a waiting list .
when she first arrived in germany with her husband in 2004 , petek was told she 'd have to wait one to two years to be admitted .
" a psychological crisis does n't wait , " said petek .
" i saw no more point in my life anymore .
but i had a breakdown and was brought to the clinic where the doctors put me in contact with -lrb- hamidye -rrb- .
that 's why i 'm here , and i 'm very happy about that . "
the therapy center treats between 600 and 800 torture victims each year .
the center offers individual and group therapy sessions , and also gives help in dealing with day to day life , including learning german or completing administrative tasks connected with moving to a different country .
no ' getting back to normal ' for torture victims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un human rights commissioner navanethem pillay has called for the prohibition of torture brigitte brand-wilhelmy , director of the therapy center , said that most of the current patients come from iran , iraq , certain african nations , and particularly from former yugoslavia . " we have women here who lost their entire families in massacres , " brand-wilhelmy said .
" they watched as their siblings and parents were murdered .
we hear stories where it is hard to imagine how people can do such things to one another . "
it takes a lot of time for torture victims to recover from their experiences , and petek is still working through the effects of what was done to her .
it 's not just nightmares , either .
her therapist has told her she is suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder .
she has concentration problems and can not work , which makes it difficult to fully embrace her new home in germany .
" every day is a struggle , " petek said .
" my husband and i do n't have family or friends here , we only have each other .
because of the effects of the torture , it is hard to learn new things ; at the moment , learning german is taking quite a while .
we 'd love to get adjusted to living in germany , but it 's difficult . " * her last name has been withheld for privacy reasons .

the decision was announced friday at the world heritage committee 's annual meeting in seville , spain . germany and the netherlands registered the wadden sea , a tidal wetlands area on their northern coasts , as a contender for the unesco world heritage title at the beginning of 2008 . friday 's announcement makes the nature reserve the first one in germany to be awarded the status .
recently , the wadden sea has been under threat due to the constant flow of shipping traffic and plans for oil and gas drilling .
there is also concern about the effect climate change could have on the area .
visited by thousands of tourists every year , the wadden sea spans more than 10,000 kilometers and borders three countries in total : the netherlands , germany , and denmark .
visitors flock there year-round to enjoy the endless expanse of shallow mud flats , caught between land and sea , and its diverse wildlife .
under protection in 1985 , germany officially declared the wadden sea tidal flats a nature reserve and national park .
parts of it have also been protected under national park status in the netherlands .
environmentalists fear for the wadden sea 's future though as plans to deepen the elbe river , which borders the wadden sea , to accomodate ships en route to the hamburg harbor could have a damaging effect on the nature reserve .
many different species make their home there , including seals , and an estimated 1.5 million birds descend on the wadden sea for food during migratory seasons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wadden sea is home to many different species there has also been concern about the oil and gas drilling platforms planted in the middle of the park . in the german state of schleswig-holstein , it is legal to drill for oil in national parks , however , it goes against the rules of the unesco world heritage committee .
in order to get around a potential barrier to receiving the title , germany and the netherlands cut out the sections of the park used for drilling in their application . there are also long-term concerns about the effect climate change will have on the wetlands , as rising sea levels could cause the area to slowly erode over time .
a unesco world heritage title is the highest honor yet for the wadden sea and advocates say it will help to ensure its conservation . germany boasts a long list of unesco world heritage sites in addition to the wadden sea , including the hanseatic city of lübeck , the cologne cathedral , and the messel pit , one of the world 's most improtant sites for fossils . the unesco world heritage committee will announce their final decision on all new entries by the end of the conference on june 30th. vj dpa / afp / kna editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but in germany 's case , the real stars do n't stick with the team very long .
dw 's jefferson chase explains . when the young german eleven beat italy 1-0 in the semifinals of the event on friday , june 26 , they moved a step closer to making history .
germany may be a soccer powerhouse , but the record of the u21 national team is anything but stellar .
incredibly enough , they 've never won a major tournament - a blot that coach horst hrubesch currently wants to rectify in sweden .
still , after needing a nervy draw against england to qualify for the knock-out stage , hrubesch is n't exactly jumping for joy .
" the only thing i 'm happy about is making the semis , " the coach told dpa news agency after the england match .

the uefa u21 championship has only been in existence in its current form since 1978 , and it took some time for germany to take them seriously .
even into the 1990s the dfb eleven were playing with a sweeper .

and the breakthrough player of the squad is defender jerome boateng .
boateng usually serves as right back and has struggled to keep a position in the starting line-up for his club hamburg .

in the u21 , eight of the current 24 members of the squad come from multi-national backgrounds .

" turkey can not accept the position of germany and france .
a privileged partnership does n't exist in -lrb- european law -rrb- , " erdogan told journalists before attending a forum in brussels , adding that turkey 's goal is full membership and any alternative " is out of the question . "
erdogan said french president nicolas sarkozy had been inconsistent , showing more openness to turkey 's accession in private talks than in public .
" our european friends unfortunately have a unilateral expectation which is rather populist and it saddens us .
i hope we will overcome this , " he said .
ankara launches diplomatic drive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan , left , faces an uphill battle on turkey 's eu entry bid turkey has mounted a diplomatic offensive aimed at boosting its chances of joining the eu , with erdogan visiting brussels twice in the span of three months .
in addition , his foreign minister , ahmet devutoglu , was also in brussels on friday to meet the eu enlargement commissioner , olli rehn , ahead of an accession conference planned for next week .
turkey 's membership was also a campaign issue in this month 's european parliament election , with some right-wing parties making gains after opposing its accession .
" some narrow-minded politicians have used turkey as election material , and we believe this to be very wrong and very populist , " erdogan said .
" we will never give up .
we are patient , we do our homework ... and we continue moving forward . "
changing the constitution erdogan 's comments come just a day after he had told journalists that plans to change the turkish constitution , key to keeping turkey 's bid for eu membership on track , are a " waste of time " as long as opposition parties keep blocking all efforts in parliament . erdogan 's comments were the clearest sign yet that his government could ditch its long standing goal of joining the 27-nation bloc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most europeans oppose turkey 's entry bid because it is a moslem country , poor , and situated mostly in asia erdogan promised after march local elections to renew efforts to revamp the 1982 constitution , drawn up under military rule , which would go a long way towards removing one of the major obstacles in ankara 's eu path . " all parties should be involved in efforts to reform the constitution , but the main opposition party rejects and blocks all efforts .
so as long as we are faced with such an approach these efforts are nothing but a waste of time .
we will have to continue with the present constitution , " erdogan said . sweden supports turkey 's eu bid the eu wants turkey to speed up political and economic reforms , including the removal of curbs on free speech , ensuring more rights for minorities and reducing the influence of the armed forces in government affairs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president sarkozy and german chancellor merkel are vocal opponents of full eu membership for turkey any sign that turkey is throwing in the towel could spell serious trouble for its membership bid and even have negative consequences for the country 's political and economic stability , analysts say .
" we are getting very close to crunch time , " said amanda akcakoca , a specialist on the issue at the european policy center in brussels .
" turkey needs to think out of the box and do something unexpected to impress europe . "
ankara ’ s bid for eu membership does , however , have the support of sweden , which takes over the six-month eu presidency on july 1 .
swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt has said his country will try its best to open a new chapter of european union membership negotiations with turkey when it takes over the rotating eu presidency next week . reinfeldt told the associated press news agency that such negotiations would be of " utmost strategic importance for europe " and pointed out the european union had promised it would negotiate with turkey .
cyprus question the process has also been slowed by ankara 's refusal to recognize eu member cyprus .
on thursday , european commission president jose manuel barroso said cypriots should seize a “ historic chance ” to reunite the mediterranean island .
" there is a unique chance this year to bring an end to this long-running conflict on european soil , " barroso told journalists .
" this chance must be taken . " cyprus was divided in a turkish invasion in 1974 after a brief greek-inspired coup .
turkey 's entry to the european union partly hinges on a peace deal in cyprus , whose greek cypriots represent the island in the bloc .
the eu unanimously began accession talks with turkey in 2005 , but since then , negotiations have slowed to a crawl with the bloc deeply divided about accepting turkey .
adding to the sense of limbo , so far only 10 of the 35 policy areas that candidates must complete have been opened , and eight of these have been frozen over the cyprus dispute. nrt / mrm / afp / ap / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internationals -pipe- 26.06.2009 under 21s provide a mixed picture of germany 's footballing future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these young men are trying to become the most successful german u21 team ever the 2009 u21 european championships are being touted as a chance to see tomorrow 's stars today .
but in germany 's case , the real stars do n't stick with the team very long .
dw 's jefferson chase explains . when the young german eleven beat italy 1-0 in the semifinals of the event on friday , june 26 , they moved a step closer to making history .
germany may be a soccer powerhouse , but the record of the u21 national team is anything but stellar .
incredibly enough , they 've never won a major tournament - a blot that coach horst hrubesch currently wants to rectify in sweden .
still , after needing a nervy draw against england to qualify for the knock-out stage , hrubesch is n't exactly jumping for joy .
" the only thing i 'm happy about is making the semis , " the coach told dpa news agency after the england match .
" i 'm not at all satisfied with how we did it - it was way below our ambitions . "
with the german u17 and u19 teams having won their european titles , this could be the year for germany 's youth teams .
but would it signal a glorious future ahead for the adult german national team ?
probably not .
here today , gone tomorrow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year , before taking his current job , hrubesch won europe with the u19 germany 's footballing reputation is one of solidity and consistency rather than mercurial brilliance so you might expect the national soccer association , the dfb , to bring up players gradually through the various levels .
but the opposite is the case .
goalkeeping legend oliver kahn and super striker miroslav klose never played in the youth ranks , going straight into the main national team .
and while most of the current national squad did take the pitch for the u21s , very few of the real stars - michael ballack , bastian schweinsteiger or lukas podolski , for example - made more than a handful of appearances , before being promoted up to the big league .
the uefa u21 championship has only been in existence in its current form since 1978 , and it took some time for germany to take them seriously .
even into the 1990s the dfb eleven were playing with a sweeper .
as a result , germany have always gone home empty handed while italy have won europe five times , and even england - never a national side known for tournament successes - have hoisted the trophy twice .
ones to watch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany are glad oezil , r , choose to play for them instead of turkey given the german u21s ' history , the players most likely to play roles in the top squad are those who have already been called up by national coach joachim loew .
diminutive forward marko marin has n't been able to make much of a mark in sweden , but leverkusen 's gonzalo castro , stuttgart 's sami khedira and schalke goalkeeper manuel neuer have performed well .
and the star of the show has been mesut oezil , who normally plays on the wing for his club bremen but who has shone in a striker role for hrubesch , setting up both of goals in germany 's 2-nil win over finland in the group stage .
and the breakthrough player of the squad is defender jerome boateng .
boateng usually serves as right back and has struggled to keep a position in the starting line-up for his club hamburg .
but he 's drawn high marks in all his matches for the young germans playing as a central defender - a role for which hamburg might consider him when he returns from sweden .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : castro is part of germany 's multi-cultural squad those names point to an unmistakable trend within the german national team - the growing prominence of players who were born outside germany or who come from an immigrant background .
klose , podolski , both polish born , have established themselves as mainstays in germany adult national team - and they 've recently been joined by piotr trochowski .
in the u21 , eight of the current 24 members of the squad come from multi-national backgrounds .
so if germany continues the tradition of integrating younger players quickly into the main men 's team , some of hrubesch 's charges could play a role at the 2010 world cup in south africa .

the decision was announced friday at the world heritage committee 's annual meeting in seville , spain . germany and the netherlands registered the wadden sea , a tidal wetlands area on their northern coasts , as a contender for the unesco world heritage title at the beginning of 2008 . friday 's announcement makes the nature reserve the first one in germany to be awarded the status .
recently , the wadden sea has been under threat due to the constant flow of shipping traffic and plans for oil and gas drilling .
there is also concern about the effect climate change could have on the area .
visited by thousands of tourists every year , the wadden sea spans more than 10,000 kilometers and borders three countries in total : the netherlands , germany , and denmark .
visitors flock there year-round to enjoy the endless expanse of shallow mud flats , caught between land and sea , and its diverse wildlife .
under protection in 1985 , germany officially declared the wadden sea tidal flats a nature reserve and national park .
parts of it have also been protected under national park status in the netherlands .
environmentalists fear for the wadden sea 's future though as plans to deepen the elbe river , which borders the wadden sea , to accomodate ships en route to the hamburg harbor could have a damaging effect on the nature reserve .
many different species make their home there , including seals , and an estimated 1.5 million birds descend on the wadden sea for food during migratory seasons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wadden sea is home to many different species there has also been concern about the oil and gas drilling platforms planted in the middle of the park . in the german state of schleswig-holstein , it is legal to drill for oil in national parks , however , it goes against the rules of the unesco world heritage committee .
in order to get around a potential barrier to receiving the title , germany and the netherlands cut out the sections of the park used for drilling in their application . there are also long-term concerns about the effect climate change will have on the wetlands , as rising sea levels could cause the area to slowly erode over time .
a unesco world heritage title is the highest honor yet for the wadden sea and advocates say it will help to ensure its conservation . germany boasts a long list of unesco world heritage sites in addition to the wadden sea , including the hanseatic city of lübeck , the cologne cathedral , and the messel pit , one of the world 's most improtant sites for fossils . the unesco world heritage committee will announce their final decision on all new entries by the end of the conference on june 30th. vj dpa / afp / kna editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but in germany 's case , the real stars do n't stick with the team very long .
dw 's jefferson chase explains . when the young german eleven beat italy 1-0 in the semifinals of the event on friday , june 26 , they moved a step closer to making history .
germany may be a soccer powerhouse , but the record of the u21 national team is anything but stellar .
incredibly enough , they 've never won a major tournament - a blot that coach horst hrubesch currently wants to rectify in sweden .
still , after needing a nervy draw against england to qualify for the knock-out stage , hrubesch is n't exactly jumping for joy .
" the only thing i 'm happy about is making the semis , " the coach told dpa news agency after the england match .
" i 'm not at all satisfied with how we did it - it was way below our ambitions . "
with the german u17 and u19 teams having won their european titles , this could be the year for germany 's youth teams .
but would it signal a glorious future ahead for the adult german national team ?
probably not .
here today , gone tomorrow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year , before taking his current job , hrubesch won europe with the u19 germany 's footballing reputation is one of solidity and consistency rather than mercurial brilliance so you might expect the national soccer association , the dfb , to bring up players gradually through the various levels .
but the opposite is the case .
goalkeeping legend oliver kahn and super striker miroslav klose never played in the youth ranks , going straight into the main national team .
and while most of the current national squad did take the pitch for the u21s , very few of the real stars - michael ballack , bastian schweinsteiger or lukas podolski , for example - made more than a handful of appearances , before being promoted up to the big league .
the uefa u21 championship has only been in existence in its current form since 1978 , and it took some time for germany to take them seriously .
even into the 1990s the dfb eleven were playing with a sweeper .
as a result , germany have always gone home empty handed while italy have won europe five times , and even england - never a national side known for tournament successes - have hoisted the trophy twice .
ones to watch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany are glad oezil , r , choose to play for them instead of turkey given the german u21s ' history , the players most likely to play roles in the top squad are those who have already been called up by national coach joachim loew .
diminutive forward marko marin has n't been able to make much of a mark in sweden , but leverkusen 's gonzalo castro , stuttgart 's sami khedira and schalke goalkeeper manuel neuer have performed well .
and the star of the show has been mesut oezil , who normally plays on the wing for his club bremen but who has shone in a striker role for hrubesch , setting up both of goals in germany 's 2-nil win over finland in the group stage .
and the breakthrough player of the squad is defender jerome boateng .

torture victims carry the burden of their experiences forever , but one therapy center in cologne seeks to make living with the memories bearable . petek t. * has been a patient at the cologne therapy center for torture victims for two years now , but the memories of her torture during her imprisonment in turkey are still very vivid .
her biggest wish is for something that many people take for granted : sleep .
" during the day , i can distract myself , " she said .
" but at night , i have problems sleeping , and nightmares .
the traumatic experiences always come back . "
petek , now 38 , was 18 when she began her university studies in her hometown of izmir in western turkey .
she wanted to become a journalist , and wrote articles for student organizations criticizing an increase of repression and the authoritarian approach of the turkish government .
she was sent to jail three times for her writing after being convicted or being a member in a forbidden organization .
her most recent imprisonment was from 1994-2002 , but even seven years later , it churns up too many memories for her to talk about .
since her time in a turkish prison , the situation of prisoners there has improved somewhat , she said , but people are still being tortured .
" people are still dying in prison under unclear circumstances , but the government denies that there is systematic torture going on in turkey , " said petek .

uenal hamidye is petek 's therapist at the therapy center , and is familiar with many cases that are similar to hers .
hamidye said torture methods are becoming increasingly psychological , and often leave behind no physical marks .
" for example , someone might come and say ' if you do n't talk , we 're going to get your wife and rape her , " ' she said .
" the people are faced with a dilemma : either they betray their organization or they have to watch as their wives , mothers , or sisters are raped . "
petek is one of many former torture victims who come to the therapy center for help .
the demand on the center 's services is so high that there is often a waiting list .
when she first arrived in germany with her husband in 2004 , petek was told she 'd have to wait one to two years to be admitted .
" a psychological crisis does n't wait , " said petek .
" i saw no more point in my life anymore .
but i had a breakdown and was brought to the clinic where the doctors put me in contact with -lrb- hamidye -rrb- .
that 's why i 'm here , and i 'm very happy about that . "
the therapy center treats between 600 and 800 torture victims each year .
the center offers individual and group therapy sessions , and also gives help in dealing with day to day life , including learning german or completing administrative tasks connected with moving to a different country .

" they watched as their siblings and parents were murdered .

it takes a lot of time for torture victims to recover from their experiences , and petek is still working through the effects of what was done to her .
it 's not just nightmares , either .
her therapist has told her she is suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder .
she has concentration problems and can not work , which makes it difficult to fully embrace her new home in germany .
" every day is a struggle , " petek said .
" my husband and i do n't have family or friends here , we only have each other .
because of the effects of the torture , it is hard to learn new things ; at the moment , learning german is taking quite a while .

torture victims carry the burden of their experiences forever , but one therapy center in cologne seeks to make living with the memories bearable . petek t. * has been a patient at the cologne therapy center for torture victims for two years now , but the memories of her torture during her imprisonment in turkey are still very vivid .
her biggest wish is for something that many people take for granted : sleep .
" during the day , i can distract myself , " she said .
" but at night , i have problems sleeping , and nightmares .
the traumatic experiences always come back . "
petek , now 38 , was 18 when she began her university studies in her hometown of izmir in western turkey .
she wanted to become a journalist , and wrote articles for student organizations criticizing an increase of repression and the authoritarian approach of the turkish government .
she was sent to jail three times for her writing after being convicted or being a member in a forbidden organization .
her most recent imprisonment was from 1994-2002 , but even seven years later , it churns up too many memories for her to talk about .
since her time in a turkish prison , the situation of prisoners there has improved somewhat , she said , but people are still being tortured .
" people are still dying in prison under unclear circumstances , but the government denies that there is systematic torture going on in turkey , " said petek .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in some places , phsychological torture has replaced traditional methods waiting list for torture therapy the cologne therapy center for torture victims was founded in 1985 as a pilot project by the un high commissioner of refugees , and is run as a charitable organization .
uenal hamidye is petek 's therapist at the therapy center , and is familiar with many cases that are similar to hers .
hamidye said torture methods are becoming increasingly psychological , and often leave behind no physical marks .
" for example , someone might come and say ' if you do n't talk , we 're going to get your wife and rape her , " ' she said .
" the people are faced with a dilemma : either they betray their organization or they have to watch as their wives , mothers , or sisters are raped . "
petek is one of many former torture victims who come to the therapy center for help .
the demand on the center 's services is so high that there is often a waiting list .
when she first arrived in germany with her husband in 2004 , petek was told she 'd have to wait one to two years to be admitted .
" a psychological crisis does n't wait , " said petek .
" i saw no more point in my life anymore .
but i had a breakdown and was brought to the clinic where the doctors put me in contact with -lrb- hamidye -rrb- .
that 's why i 'm here , and i 'm very happy about that . "
the therapy center treats between 600 and 800 torture victims each year .
the center offers individual and group therapy sessions , and also gives help in dealing with day to day life , including learning german or completing administrative tasks connected with moving to a different country .
no ' getting back to normal ' for torture victims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un human rights commissioner navanethem pillay has called for the prohibition of torture brigitte brand-wilhelmy , director of the therapy center , said that most of the current patients come from iran , iraq , certain african nations , and particularly from former yugoslavia . " we have women here who lost their entire families in massacres , " brand-wilhelmy said .
" they watched as their siblings and parents were murdered .
we hear stories where it is hard to imagine how people can do such things to one another . "
it takes a lot of time for torture victims to recover from their experiences , and petek is still working through the effects of what was done to her .
it 's not just nightmares , either .
her therapist has told her she is suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder .
she has concentration problems and can not work , which makes it difficult to fully embrace her new home in germany .
" every day is a struggle , " petek said .
" my husband and i do n't have family or friends here , we only have each other .
because of the effects of the torture , it is hard to learn new things ; at the moment , learning german is taking quite a while .
we 'd love to get adjusted to living in germany , but it 's difficult . " * her last name has been withheld for privacy reasons .

but in germany 's case , the real stars do n't stick with the team very long .
dw 's jefferson chase explains . when the young german eleven beat italy 1-0 in the semifinals of the event on friday , june 26 , they moved a step closer to making history .
germany may be a soccer powerhouse , but the record of the u21 national team is anything but stellar .
incredibly enough , they 've never won a major tournament - a blot that coach horst hrubesch currently wants to rectify in sweden .
still , after needing a nervy draw against england to qualify for the knock-out stage , hrubesch is n't exactly jumping for joy .
" the only thing i 'm happy about is making the semis , " the coach told dpa news agency after the england match .
" i 'm not at all satisfied with how we did it - it was way below our ambitions . "
with the german u17 and u19 teams having won their european titles , this could be the year for germany 's youth teams .
but would it signal a glorious future ahead for the adult german national team ?
probably not .
here today , gone tomorrow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year , before taking his current job , hrubesch won europe with the u19 germany 's footballing reputation is one of solidity and consistency rather than mercurial brilliance so you might expect the national soccer association , the dfb , to bring up players gradually through the various levels .
but the opposite is the case .
goalkeeping legend oliver kahn and super striker miroslav klose never played in the youth ranks , going straight into the main national team .
and while most of the current national squad did take the pitch for the u21s , very few of the real stars - michael ballack , bastian schweinsteiger or lukas podolski , for example - made more than a handful of appearances , before being promoted up to the big league .
the uefa u21 championship has only been in existence in its current form since 1978 , and it took some time for germany to take them seriously .
even into the 1990s the dfb eleven were playing with a sweeper .
as a result , germany have always gone home empty handed while italy have won europe five times , and even england - never a national side known for tournament successes - have hoisted the trophy twice .
ones to watch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany are glad oezil , r , choose to play for them instead of turkey given the german u21s ' history , the players most likely to play roles in the top squad are those who have already been called up by national coach joachim loew .
diminutive forward marko marin has n't been able to make much of a mark in sweden , but leverkusen 's gonzalo castro , stuttgart 's sami khedira and schalke goalkeeper manuel neuer have performed well .
and the star of the show has been mesut oezil , who normally plays on the wing for his club bremen but who has shone in a striker role for hrubesch , setting up both of goals in germany 's 2-nil win over finland in the group stage .
and the breakthrough player of the squad is defender jerome boateng .
boateng usually serves as right back and has struggled to keep a position in the starting line-up for his club hamburg .
but he 's drawn high marks in all his matches for the young germans playing as a central defender - a role for which hamburg might consider him when he returns from sweden .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : castro is part of germany 's multi-cultural squad those names point to an unmistakable trend within the german national team - the growing prominence of players who were born outside germany or who come from an immigrant background .
klose , podolski , both polish born , have established themselves as mainstays in germany adult national team - and they 've recently been joined by piotr trochowski .
in the u21 , eight of the current 24 members of the squad come from multi-national backgrounds .
so if germany continues the tradition of integrating younger players quickly into the main men 's team , some of hrubesch 's charges could play a role at the 2010 world cup in south africa .

but in germany 's case , the real stars do n't stick with the team very long .
dw 's jefferson chase explains . when the young german eleven beat italy 1-0 in the semifinals of the event on friday , june 26 , they moved a step closer to making history .
germany may be a soccer powerhouse , but the record of the u21 national team is anything but stellar .
incredibly enough , they 've never won a major tournament - a blot that coach horst hrubesch currently wants to rectify in sweden .
still , after needing a nervy draw against england to qualify for the knock-out stage , hrubesch is n't exactly jumping for joy .
" the only thing i 'm happy about is making the semis , " the coach told dpa news agency after the england match .
" i 'm not at all satisfied with how we did it - it was way below our ambitions . "
with the german u17 and u19 teams having won their european titles , this could be the year for germany 's youth teams .
but would it signal a glorious future ahead for the adult german national team ?
probably not .
here today , gone tomorrow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year , before taking his current job , hrubesch won europe with the u19 germany 's footballing reputation is one of solidity and consistency rather than mercurial brilliance so you might expect the national soccer association , the dfb , to bring up players gradually through the various levels .
but the opposite is the case .
goalkeeping legend oliver kahn and super striker miroslav klose never played in the youth ranks , going straight into the main national team .
and while most of the current national squad did take the pitch for the u21s , very few of the real stars - michael ballack , bastian schweinsteiger or lukas podolski , for example - made more than a handful of appearances , before being promoted up to the big league .
the uefa u21 championship has only been in existence in its current form since 1978 , and it took some time for germany to take them seriously .
even into the 1990s the dfb eleven were playing with a sweeper .
as a result , germany have always gone home empty handed while italy have won europe five times , and even england - never a national side known for tournament successes - have hoisted the trophy twice .
ones to watch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany are glad oezil , r , choose to play for them instead of turkey given the german u21s ' history , the players most likely to play roles in the top squad are those who have already been called up by national coach joachim loew .
diminutive forward marko marin has n't been able to make much of a mark in sweden , but leverkusen 's gonzalo castro , stuttgart 's sami khedira and schalke goalkeeper manuel neuer have performed well .
and the star of the show has been mesut oezil , who normally plays on the wing for his club bremen but who has shone in a striker role for hrubesch , setting up both of goals in germany 's 2-nil win over finland in the group stage .
and the breakthrough player of the squad is defender jerome boateng .
boateng usually serves as right back and has struggled to keep a position in the starting line-up for his club hamburg .
but he 's drawn high marks in all his matches for the young germans playing as a central defender - a role for which hamburg might consider him when he returns from sweden .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : castro is part of germany 's multi-cultural squad those names point to an unmistakable trend within the german national team - the growing prominence of players who were born outside germany or who come from an immigrant background .
klose , podolski , both polish born , have established themselves as mainstays in germany adult national team - and they 've recently been joined by piotr trochowski .
in the u21 , eight of the current 24 members of the squad come from multi-national backgrounds .
so if germany continues the tradition of integrating younger players quickly into the main men 's team , some of hrubesch 's charges could play a role at the 2010 world cup in south africa .

still , after needing a nervy draw against england to qualify for the knock-out stage , hrubesch is n't exactly jumping for joy .
" the only thing i 'm happy about is making the semis , " the coach told dpa news agency after the england match .
" i 'm not at all satisfied with how we did it - it was way below our ambitions . "
with the german u17 and u19 teams having won their european titles , this could be the year for germany 's youth teams .
but would it signal a glorious future ahead for the adult german national team ?
probably not .
here today , gone tomorrow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year , before taking his current job , hrubesch won europe with the u19 germany 's footballing reputation is one of solidity and consistency rather than mercurial brilliance so you might expect the national soccer association , the dfb , to bring up players gradually through the various levels .
but the opposite is the case .
goalkeeping legend oliver kahn and super striker miroslav klose never played in the youth ranks , going straight into the main national team .
and while most of the current national squad did take the pitch for the u21s , very few of the real stars - michael ballack , bastian schweinsteiger or lukas podolski , for example - made more than a handful of appearances , before being promoted up to the big league .
the uefa u21 championship has only been in existence in its current form since 1978 , and it took some time for germany to take them seriously .
even into the 1990s the dfb eleven were playing with a sweeper .
as a result , germany have always gone home empty handed while italy have won europe five times , and even england - never a national side known for tournament successes - have hoisted the trophy twice .
ones to watch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany are glad oezil , r , choose to play for them instead of turkey given the german u21s ' history , the players most likely to play roles in the top squad are those who have already been called up by national coach joachim loew .
diminutive forward marko marin has n't been able to make much of a mark in sweden , but leverkusen 's gonzalo castro , stuttgart 's sami khedira and schalke goalkeeper manuel neuer have performed well .
and the star of the show has been mesut oezil , who normally plays on the wing for his club bremen but who has shone in a striker role for hrubesch , setting up both of goals in germany 's 2-nil win over finland in the group stage .
and the breakthrough player of the squad is defender jerome boateng .
boateng usually serves as right back and has struggled to keep a position in the starting line-up for his club hamburg .
but he 's drawn high marks in all his matches for the young germans playing as a central defender - a role for which hamburg might consider him when he returns from sweden .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : castro is part of germany 's multi-cultural squad those names point to an unmistakable trend within the german national team - the growing prominence of players who were born outside germany or who come from an immigrant background .
klose , podolski , both polish born , have established themselves as mainstays in germany adult national team - and they 've recently been joined by piotr trochowski .
in the u21 , eight of the current 24 members of the squad come from multi-national backgrounds .
so if germany continues the tradition of integrating younger players quickly into the main men 's team , some of hrubesch 's charges could play a role at the 2010 world cup in south africa .

but in germany 's case , the real stars do n't stick with the team very long .
dw 's jefferson chase explains . when the young german eleven beat italy 1-0 in the semifinals of the event on friday , june 26 , they moved a step closer to making history .
germany may be a soccer powerhouse , but the record of the u21 national team is anything but stellar .

public gay pride demonstrations , known as christopher street day , are held every summer in cities around the world to commemorate the event .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amendments to the constitution are the focus of this year 's christopher street day parades klaus jetz , head of the lesbian and gay federation in germany -lrb- lsvd -rrb- , told deutsche welle that the political focus of this year 's christopher street day parades , which will begin this weekend in berlin , will be on amending article 3 of the german constitution .
" getting the anti-discrimination amendment passed has been an important topic for the organization since our founding in 1990 , " he said . " it is great that we have finally managed to rally support for this topic beyond our own community , within the political sphere . "
this week , the german parliament voted to push for a federal initiative to make additions to article 3 of the constitution , which protects citizens against discrimination based on gender , race , or religion .
they want , among other things , to add sexual orientation to that list .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's mayor klaus wowereit was one of the first politicians to publicly come out of the closet social democrat klaus wowereit , berlin 's openly homosexual mayor , spoke out in favor of the amendment .
in an interview with the german news agency dpa , wowereit said he whole-heartedly supported the initiative .
he called the laws passed to allow homosexual civil partnerships a " milestone , " but said that there was still judicial room for improvement .
same responsibilities , different rights wowereit took the lead from his party colleague , justice minister brigitte zypries .
in an interview with the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , zypries said that changing article 3 and article 6 of the constitution - which protects the institution of marriage and the family - would send " a clear signal " to society .
while german federal law gives homosexuals the right to enter a civil partnership , they do n't enjoy the same rights as heterosexual married couples when it comes to taxes , retirement , civil servant benefits , or adoption law .
zypries said that homosexual couples have the same responsibilities , but not the same rights as heterosexuals .
" i find this to be incredibly unjust , both on human and on judicial grounds , " the newspaper quoted zypries as saying .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civil unions are important for couples but do not grant the same rights as marriage taking a stand klaus jetz from the lesbian and gay federation in germany -lrb- lsvd -rrb- said that although both the european parliament and the european commission have taken a clear stance against discrimination based on sexual orientation , enshrining the same in the german constitution would have tangible advantages for the gay and lesbian community .
" homosexual couples are not able to adopt children in germany .
and ' rainbow families ' - gay and lesbian couples with biological children - do n't get the same tax breaks as heterosexual couples , " jetz said .
support in society growing article 3 of the constitution was amended for the last time in 1995 , to protect the disabled from discrimination .
at the time , there was not enough political backing to include sexual orientation to the list . but that seems to be changing .
on their web site , the lesbian and gay federation in germany lists a slew of supporters , from all walks of life - actors , politicians , even a rabbi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christopher street day is celebrated all over europe three major parties - the social democrats , the greens , and the left party - are in favor of an amendment .
but a two-thirds majority will be necessary to change the constitution and will need to include members of the conservative parties as well .
" we have to get the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- on board , " jetz said .
but the interior minister of the southern state of bavaria , joachim herrmann , has spoken out against the proposal .
the minister who belongs to the arch-conservative csu party , the sister bavarian party of the cdu , says he sees no reason to extend the constitutional protection of the family .
gay rights activists accuse the conservatives of blocking legislation that would give homosexuals more rights .
" we need the conservatives to understand that this is about protecting a minority in the population , " jetz said . " giving us more rights wo n't change anything for them . "

public gay pride demonstrations , known as christopher street day , are held every summer in cities around the world to commemorate the event .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amendments to the constitution are the focus of this year 's christopher street day parades klaus jetz , head of the lesbian and gay federation in germany -lrb- lsvd -rrb- , told deutsche welle that the political focus of this year 's christopher street day parades , which will begin this weekend in berlin , will be on amending article 3 of the german constitution .
" getting the anti-discrimination amendment passed has been an important topic for the organization since our founding in 1990 , " he said . " it is great that we have finally managed to rally support for this topic beyond our own community , within the political sphere . "
this week , the german parliament voted to push for a federal initiative to make additions to article 3 of the constitution , which protects citizens against discrimination based on gender , race , or religion .
they want , among other things , to add sexual orientation to that list .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's mayor klaus wowereit was one of the first politicians to publicly come out of the closet social democrat klaus wowereit , berlin 's openly homosexual mayor , spoke out in favor of the amendment .
in an interview with the german news agency dpa , wowereit said he whole-heartedly supported the initiative .
he called the laws passed to allow homosexual civil partnerships a " milestone , " but said that there was still judicial room for improvement .
same responsibilities , different rights wowereit took the lead from his party colleague , justice minister brigitte zypries .
in an interview with the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , zypries said that changing article 3 and article 6 of the constitution - which protects the institution of marriage and the family - would send " a clear signal " to society .
while german federal law gives homosexuals the right to enter a civil partnership , they do n't enjoy the same rights as heterosexual married couples when it comes to taxes , retirement , civil servant benefits , or adoption law .
zypries said that homosexual couples have the same responsibilities , but not the same rights as heterosexuals .
" i find this to be incredibly unjust , both on human and on judicial grounds , " the newspaper quoted zypries as saying .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civil unions are important for couples but do not grant the same rights as marriage taking a stand klaus jetz from the lesbian and gay federation in germany -lrb- lsvd -rrb- said that although both the european parliament and the european commission have taken a clear stance against discrimination based on sexual orientation , enshrining the same in the german constitution would have tangible advantages for the gay and lesbian community .
" homosexual couples are not able to adopt children in germany .
and ' rainbow families ' - gay and lesbian couples with biological children - do n't get the same tax breaks as heterosexual couples , " jetz said .
support in society growing article 3 of the constitution was amended for the last time in 1995 , to protect the disabled from discrimination .
at the time , there was not enough political backing to include sexual orientation to the list . but that seems to be changing .
on their web site , the lesbian and gay federation in germany lists a slew of supporters , from all walks of life - actors , politicians , even a rabbi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christopher street day is celebrated all over europe three major parties - the social democrats , the greens , and the left party - are in favor of an amendment .
but a two-thirds majority will be necessary to change the constitution and will need to include members of the conservative parties as well .
" we have to get the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- on board , " jetz said .
but the interior minister of the southern state of bavaria , joachim herrmann , has spoken out against the proposal .
the minister who belongs to the arch-conservative csu party , the sister bavarian party of the cdu , says he sees no reason to extend the constitutional protection of the family .
gay rights activists accuse the conservatives of blocking legislation that would give homosexuals more rights .
" we need the conservatives to understand that this is about protecting a minority in the population , " jetz said . " giving us more rights wo n't change anything for them . "

" turkey can not accept the position of germany and france .
a privileged partnership does n't exist in -lrb- european law -rrb- , " erdogan told journalists before attending a forum in brussels , adding that turkey 's goal is full membership and any alternative " is out of the question . "
erdogan said french president nicolas sarkozy had been inconsistent , showing more openness to turkey 's accession in private talks than in public .
" our european friends unfortunately have a unilateral expectation which is rather populist and it saddens us .
i hope we will overcome this , " he said .
ankara launches diplomatic drive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan , left , faces an uphill battle on turkey 's eu entry bid turkey has mounted a diplomatic offensive aimed at boosting its chances of joining the eu , with erdogan visiting brussels twice in the span of three months .
in addition , his foreign minister , ahmet devutoglu , was also in brussels on friday to meet the eu enlargement commissioner , olli rehn , ahead of an accession conference planned for next week .
turkey 's membership was also a campaign issue in this month 's european parliament election , with some right-wing parties making gains after opposing its accession .
" some narrow-minded politicians have used turkey as election material , and we believe this to be very wrong and very populist , " erdogan said .
" we will never give up .
we are patient , we do our homework ... and we continue moving forward . "
changing the constitution erdogan 's comments come just a day after he had told journalists that plans to change the turkish constitution , key to keeping turkey 's bid for eu membership on track , are a " waste of time " as long as opposition parties keep blocking all efforts in parliament . erdogan 's comments were the clearest sign yet that his government could ditch its long standing goal of joining the 27-nation bloc .

" all parties should be involved in efforts to reform the constitution , but the main opposition party rejects and blocks all efforts .

torture victims carry the burden of their experiences forever , but one therapy center in cologne seeks to make living with the memories bearable . petek t. * has been a patient at the cologne therapy center for torture victims for two years now , but the memories of her torture during her imprisonment in turkey are still very vivid .
her biggest wish is for something that many people take for granted : sleep .
" during the day , i can distract myself , " she said .
" but at night , i have problems sleeping , and nightmares .
the traumatic experiences always come back . "
petek , now 38 , was 18 when she began her university studies in her hometown of izmir in western turkey .
she wanted to become a journalist , and wrote articles for student organizations criticizing an increase of repression and the authoritarian approach of the turkish government .
she was sent to jail three times for her writing after being convicted or being a member in a forbidden organization .
her most recent imprisonment was from 1994-2002 , but even seven years later , it churns up too many memories for her to talk about .
since her time in a turkish prison , the situation of prisoners there has improved somewhat , she said , but people are still being tortured .
" people are still dying in prison under unclear circumstances , but the government denies that there is systematic torture going on in turkey , " said petek .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in some places , phsychological torture has replaced traditional methods waiting list for torture therapy the cologne therapy center for torture victims was founded in 1985 as a pilot project by the un high commissioner of refugees , and is run as a charitable organization .
uenal hamidye is petek 's therapist at the therapy center , and is familiar with many cases that are similar to hers .
hamidye said torture methods are becoming increasingly psychological , and often leave behind no physical marks .
" for example , someone might come and say ' if you do n't talk , we 're going to get your wife and rape her , " ' she said .
" the people are faced with a dilemma : either they betray their organization or they have to watch as their wives , mothers , or sisters are raped . "
petek is one of many former torture victims who come to the therapy center for help .
the demand on the center 's services is so high that there is often a waiting list .
when she first arrived in germany with her husband in 2004 , petek was told she 'd have to wait one to two years to be admitted .
" a psychological crisis does n't wait , " said petek .
" i saw no more point in my life anymore .
but i had a breakdown and was brought to the clinic where the doctors put me in contact with -lrb- hamidye -rrb- .
that 's why i 'm here , and i 'm very happy about that . "
the therapy center treats between 600 and 800 torture victims each year .
the center offers individual and group therapy sessions , and also gives help in dealing with day to day life , including learning german or completing administrative tasks connected with moving to a different country .
no ' getting back to normal ' for torture victims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un human rights commissioner navanethem pillay has called for the prohibition of torture brigitte brand-wilhelmy , director of the therapy center , said that most of the current patients come from iran , iraq , certain african nations , and particularly from former yugoslavia . " we have women here who lost their entire families in massacres , " brand-wilhelmy said .
" they watched as their siblings and parents were murdered .
we hear stories where it is hard to imagine how people can do such things to one another . "
it takes a lot of time for torture victims to recover from their experiences , and petek is still working through the effects of what was done to her .
it 's not just nightmares , either .
her therapist has told her she is suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder .
she has concentration problems and can not work , which makes it difficult to fully embrace her new home in germany .
" every day is a struggle , " petek said .
" my husband and i do n't have family or friends here , we only have each other .
because of the effects of the torture , it is hard to learn new things ; at the moment , learning german is taking quite a while .
we 'd love to get adjusted to living in germany , but it 's difficult . " * her last name has been withheld for privacy reasons .

guest commentator susanne neubert says that we have a global responsibility to counter soil degradation and there 's no time to lose . some 70 percent of the world 's arid regions face desertification , and in around 110 countries - most of them poor - desertification threatens an area roughly the size of europe . twenty million tons of grain are lost annually due to desertification and , over the past 40 years , one third of the world 's arable land has been abandoned . even though there is no doubt about the causes of desertification , and the strategies needed to combat it are known , no turnaround is yet in sight .
why is it that neither the un desertification convention nor countless initiatives and programs have managed to halt the ongoing process of desertification ? unsustainable land management bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in many regions water for irrigation is not readily available the principal factors behind desertification are unsustainable land management and climate change .
as far as land management is concerned , incorrect farming practices also play a major role .
these include the cultivation of annual crop species , coupled with management methods that intermittently leave soils uncovered and exposed to erosion . other aspects of " incorrect " farming practices include faulty irrigation and either a total lack of fertilization or lopsided use of mineral fertilisers .
this often leads to soil mineralization , particularly in tropical regions , depriving soils of their capacity to store water .
carbon compounds , previously fixed in the soil in the form of organic matter , are released into the air in the course of the mineralization process .
this reduces the soil 's buffering capacity for drought and flooding , at the same time directly contributing to climate change . a good number of resource problems are closely interlinked : together , deforestation , species loss , climate change , growing scarcity of water resources , and the loss of organic matter in soils are responsible for desertification ; they are both its cause and effect . does this mean that we have no choice but to capitulate ?
no .
what it means is that by developing and using intelligent approaches we can achieve several goals at once .
soil conservation techniques , including erosion control walls , agro-forestry , and organic fertilization , are methods that are both effective and widely known - and these need to be applied on a larger scale . the reason why the picture continues to be dominated by individual measures is not technical in nature , indeed this must be seen as a problem bound up with economic incentives and political interests . incentives to support farmers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protecting trees can counter soil degradation since agriculture is organized primarily along private lines , soil conservation measures need to be carried out mainly by the private sector .
it is essential that incentives be set to ensure that investments in farmland yield returns , and the relatively high prices currently commanded by agricultural goods offer a good opportunity . there is considerable evidence that farmers carry out soil protection measures on their own if they lack more profitable alternatives and if the know-how and cost viability are available .
there is no lack of instructive examples , and german development cooperation offers a good number of them .
it is high time to start providing farmers in desertification-prone regions with appropriate advisory services as well as with the funds they need to transport stones to build erosion control walls , etc . , and to do so not intermittently but as a general rule . however , both agro-industry and institutional conditions also need to be modernized .
one correct and promising approach would be to encourage the agrochemical industry to gear production more to soil substrate additives . moreover , the agricultural policies of developing countries urgently need to be reoriented to reduce the fertilizer subsidies so widespread today and instead to increase the credit available in the agricultural sector .
and land rights need to be modified in such a way as to ensure that farmers have incentives to undertake soil conservation measures . no time to lose bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : modernizing the agro industry is vital in coutering the impact of climate change instead of continuing to generate vast amounts of greenhouse gases by producing and using mineral fertilizers incapable of achieving the hoped-for results on degraded soils , it would make far more sense to engage in organic agriculture keyed chiefly to on-farm resources .
this could serve to enhance soil storage capacity and - in cases where the needed organic matter is unavailable - to regenerate it by using industrially produced soil substrates .
land management of this kind tends to raise yields per unit area to earlier levels , and to do so precisely in arid regions . but is also essential to protect land at the supra-farm level , on state-owned land .
this , though , calls for a huge supply of labor .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internationals -pipe- 26.06.2009 under 21s provide a mixed picture of germany 's footballing future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these young men are trying to become the most successful german u21 team ever the 2009 u21 european championships are being touted as a chance to see tomorrow 's stars today .
but in germany 's case , the real stars do n't stick with the team very long .
dw 's jefferson chase explains . when the young german eleven beat italy 1-0 in the semifinals of the event on friday , june 26 , they moved a step closer to making history .
germany may be a soccer powerhouse , but the record of the u21 national team is anything but stellar .
incredibly enough , they 've never won a major tournament - a blot that coach horst hrubesch currently wants to rectify in sweden .
still , after needing a nervy draw against england to qualify for the knock-out stage , hrubesch is n't exactly jumping for joy .
" the only thing i 'm happy about is making the semis , " the coach told dpa news agency after the england match .
" i 'm not at all satisfied with how we did it - it was way below our ambitions . "
with the german u17 and u19 teams having won their european titles , this could be the year for germany 's youth teams .
but would it signal a glorious future ahead for the adult german national team ?
probably not .
here today , gone tomorrow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year , before taking his current job , hrubesch won europe with the u19 germany 's footballing reputation is one of solidity and consistency rather than mercurial brilliance so you might expect the national soccer association , the dfb , to bring up players gradually through the various levels .
but the opposite is the case .
goalkeeping legend oliver kahn and super striker miroslav klose never played in the youth ranks , going straight into the main national team .
and while most of the current national squad did take the pitch for the u21s , very few of the real stars - michael ballack , bastian schweinsteiger or lukas podolski , for example - made more than a handful of appearances , before being promoted up to the big league .
the uefa u21 championship has only been in existence in its current form since 1978 , and it took some time for germany to take them seriously .
even into the 1990s the dfb eleven were playing with a sweeper .
as a result , germany have always gone home empty handed while italy have won europe five times , and even england - never a national side known for tournament successes - have hoisted the trophy twice .
ones to watch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany are glad oezil , r , choose to play for them instead of turkey given the german u21s ' history , the players most likely to play roles in the top squad are those who have already been called up by national coach joachim loew .
diminutive forward marko marin has n't been able to make much of a mark in sweden , but leverkusen 's gonzalo castro , stuttgart 's sami khedira and schalke goalkeeper manuel neuer have performed well .
and the star of the show has been mesut oezil , who normally plays on the wing for his club bremen but who has shone in a striker role for hrubesch , setting up both of goals in germany 's 2-nil win over finland in the group stage .
and the breakthrough player of the squad is defender jerome boateng .
boateng usually serves as right back and has struggled to keep a position in the starting line-up for his club hamburg .
but he 's drawn high marks in all his matches for the young germans playing as a central defender - a role for which hamburg might consider him when he returns from sweden .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : castro is part of germany 's multi-cultural squad those names point to an unmistakable trend within the german national team - the growing prominence of players who were born outside germany or who come from an immigrant background .
klose , podolski , both polish born , have established themselves as mainstays in germany adult national team - and they 've recently been joined by piotr trochowski .
in the u21 , eight of the current 24 members of the squad come from multi-national backgrounds .
so if germany continues the tradition of integrating younger players quickly into the main men 's team , some of hrubesch 's charges could play a role at the 2010 world cup in south africa .

jackson sold over 750 million albums in his sometimes controversial career . the 50 year-old " king of pop " was rushed to the nearby ucla medical center , and county coroner fred corral said he was unresponsive and pronounced dead soon after .
medical officers are now conducting an autopsy to check for toxicology or other problems - with results set to be published later on friday . fans the world over mourned the pop star as word of his death spread quickly . " michael jackson was weightless - a moonwalker , a transformer , a werewolf , he was n't of this world , " wrote the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung friday .
" as long as he had a handle on his weightlessness and could play with it , it was his biggest capital .
but in the end it 's what killed him . " even moonwalkers ca n't lose contact to earth for very long , " concluded the paper . the descent of a star bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the king of pop announced his comeback tour in march 2009 born in 1958 in gary , indiana , jackson became a child star as a member of the jackson five .
as an adult , jackson moved on to a successful - and often controversial - solo career .
this career peaked with his 1982 record " thriller , " which is the best selling album of all time . in later life jackson struggled with a series of court cases and allegations about his private life , damaging his career and his financial situation , but he remained a popular character with an enormous fan base . the german newsmagazine spiegel online wrote that jackson had two faces : one was " the monster , more alien than human , lifted , pale and in the end as emaciated as a skeleton . " on the other hand , there was " the genius that reinvented pop , sold more albums than anyone else -lrb- … -rrb- and was admired by the masses - in particular by his musical heirs , who never would have existed without his influence and who are now mourning his passing with an unequalled flood of condolence : beyonce , usher , justin timberlake , to name three of many . " at the time of his death he had been preparing for a 50-concert run in london that was meant to rejuvenate his career , and secure his financial future . " a comeback has seldom been as necessary as it was in jackson 's case , " wrote the sueddeutsche . though it 's now too late for a comeback , the troubled pop icon leaves behind a generation that has at some point tried to moonwalk and a legacy of young musicians - like beyonce and timberlake - who are carrying on in his footsteps . bildunterschrift : michael jackson in 1971 , 1977 and 1979 -lrb- from left -rrb- bildunterschrift : michael jackson 1983 , 1987 and 1990 -lrb- from left -rrb- kjb / msh , ap / dpa / afp editor : darren mara send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 3,300-kilometer -lrb- 2,000-mile -rrb- nabucco pipeline is a key energy project which will bring gas from the caspian sea to austria via turkey , bulgaria , romania and hungary .
the nabucco pipeline has been given a high priority in eu energy policy , however differences between the countries has stalled the project .
according to manager magazin , fischer 's most important job will be to keep turkey happy .
" fischer is highly regarded in turkey because he was always open to it joining the eu , " according to the article .
the pipeline 's main goal - and greatest hurdle - is to bypass russia , in a bid to reduce europe 's energy dependence on moscow .
currently , the eu gets about one-third of its energy from russia , through transit countries belarus and ukraine .
nabucco has therefore been a hot political topic between the eu and russia , with moscow doing everything it can to torpedo the process .
high-profile lobbying bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder works for russia 's competing nord stream project the russians , for their part , have been pushing for the nord stream pipeline through the north sea .
they are supported in their efforts by joschka fischer 's former boss and political ally , ex-chancellor gerhard schroeder .
just after he left office in 2005 , schroeder signed a lucrative deal with russian state-run energy giant gazprom to head the advisory board for the company 's nord stream pipeline project .
while still in office , schroeder signed the agreement to build the pipeline with his close friend vladimir putin , the current russian prime minister .
last january , schroeder also joined the board of british-russian oil firm tnk-bp .
fischer and schroeder were the leading two politicians in the seven year social democrat / green coalition government .
fischer withdrew from politics after the greens failed to win enough votes to remain in government in the 2005 elections .
since then , he has lived in the united states , working as a lecturer at princeton university. kj / afp / dpa editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 26.06.2009 there 's no time to lose in combatting desertification , says expert großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huge areas of arable land are lost every year due to soil degradation increasing desertification leads to huge losses of arable land .
guest commentator susanne neubert says that we have a global responsibility to counter soil degradation and there 's no time to lose . some 70 percent of the world 's arid regions face desertification , and in around 110 countries - most of them poor - desertification threatens an area roughly the size of europe . twenty million tons of grain are lost annually due to desertification and , over the past 40 years , one third of the world 's arable land has been abandoned . even though there is no doubt about the causes of desertification , and the strategies needed to combat it are known , no turnaround is yet in sight .
why is it that neither the un desertification convention nor countless initiatives and programs have managed to halt the ongoing process of desertification ? unsustainable land management bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in many regions water for irrigation is not readily available the principal factors behind desertification are unsustainable land management and climate change .
as far as land management is concerned , incorrect farming practices also play a major role .
these include the cultivation of annual crop species , coupled with management methods that intermittently leave soils uncovered and exposed to erosion . other aspects of " incorrect " farming practices include faulty irrigation and either a total lack of fertilization or lopsided use of mineral fertilisers .
this often leads to soil mineralization , particularly in tropical regions , depriving soils of their capacity to store water .
carbon compounds , previously fixed in the soil in the form of organic matter , are released into the air in the course of the mineralization process .
this reduces the soil 's buffering capacity for drought and flooding , at the same time directly contributing to climate change . a good number of resource problems are closely interlinked : together , deforestation , species loss , climate change , growing scarcity of water resources , and the loss of organic matter in soils are responsible for desertification ; they are both its cause and effect . does this mean that we have no choice but to capitulate ?
no .
what it means is that by developing and using intelligent approaches we can achieve several goals at once .
soil conservation techniques , including erosion control walls , agro-forestry , and organic fertilization , are methods that are both effective and widely known - and these need to be applied on a larger scale . the reason why the picture continues to be dominated by individual measures is not technical in nature , indeed this must be seen as a problem bound up with economic incentives and political interests . incentives to support farmers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protecting trees can counter soil degradation since agriculture is organized primarily along private lines , soil conservation measures need to be carried out mainly by the private sector .
it is essential that incentives be set to ensure that investments in farmland yield returns , and the relatively high prices currently commanded by agricultural goods offer a good opportunity . there is considerable evidence that farmers carry out soil protection measures on their own if they lack more profitable alternatives and if the know-how and cost viability are available .
there is no lack of instructive examples , and german development cooperation offers a good number of them .
it is high time to start providing farmers in desertification-prone regions with appropriate advisory services as well as with the funds they need to transport stones to build erosion control walls , etc . , and to do so not intermittently but as a general rule . however , both agro-industry and institutional conditions also need to be modernized .
one correct and promising approach would be to encourage the agrochemical industry to gear production more to soil substrate additives . moreover , the agricultural policies of developing countries urgently need to be reoriented to reduce the fertilizer subsidies so widespread today and instead to increase the credit available in the agricultural sector .
and land rights need to be modified in such a way as to ensure that farmers have incentives to undertake soil conservation measures . no time to lose bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : modernizing the agro industry is vital in coutering the impact of climate change instead of continuing to generate vast amounts of greenhouse gases by producing and using mineral fertilizers incapable of achieving the hoped-for results on degraded soils , it would make far more sense to engage in organic agriculture keyed chiefly to on-farm resources .
this could serve to enhance soil storage capacity and - in cases where the needed organic matter is unavailable - to regenerate it by using industrially produced soil substrates .
land management of this kind tends to raise yields per unit area to earlier levels , and to do so precisely in arid regions . but is also essential to protect land at the supra-farm level , on state-owned land .
this , though , calls for a huge supply of labor .
in keeping with a proposal advanced by the united nations environment program -lrb- unep -rrb- , a " global green new deal " could be used to realize the action plans adopted to implement the un desertification convention , and in times of recession this would at the same time amount to an effective labor market policy . this should also include large-scale projects - like the building of " green walls " in china and the sahel belt - and efforts to link them with the numerous individual participatory measures already in progress , in order to achieve synergy effects . it would be important to implement measures geared at once to conservation and re-cultivation in order to come up with comprehensive measures that serve to reach several goals at the same time : protection of forests , water , climate , and soils .
this is a realistic aim in that the different organizational phases involved basically tend to correlate positively with one another . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neubert says that desertification is partly reversible how much time do we have left ?
the good news is that in many cases desertification is reversible .
the bad new is that this goes hand in hand with declining marginal utility , and when a certain stage of degradation has been reached , re-cultivation proves so labor-intensive that it is more attractive for the population to migrate to urban areas .
in other words , we have no time to lose .

" we have tried our very best and we do n't move , " said the european union agriculture commissioner mariann fischer boel .
" we went to the absolute limit of what was acceptable to the agricultural community .
we wo n't go any further , " echoed french farm minister bruno le maire .
agriculture is one of the most contentious topics at the doha round of the wto talks , which was launched in the gulf state of qatar in 2001 .
rich countries , like the european union and the united states , support their farmers with subsidies , in order for the farmers to be able to make a decent profit from their products .
developing countries like india , china and other smaller countries in africa , asia and south america often produce the same agricultural products .
they can also sell them for less , because it costs them less to produce it .
for example , a farmer in bavaria makes much more than a farmer in hunan province in china .
so , in order for bavarian agricultural products to compete with chinese products , the german government pays the bavarian farmer a certain amount of money so that when the german product is on the shelf in the eu , it costs the same as the chinese product .
it can also restrict the amount of a similar product that the chinese can sell in germany , called quotas , or charge tariffs on those products .
who paid for that jetliner ?

the three major aircraft manufacturers in the world are boeing and lockheed in the us , and airbus in the eu .
recently the us has said that it will respond quickly and swiftly if european nations help airbus financially to launch a new plane , designated the airbus a350 .
the ceo of airbus , tom enders says that airbus needs the 11 billion euros in government financing in order for airbus to compete with boeing .
the doha round of the wto talks are ongoing and there is no resolution in sight , although wto president pascal lamy has said that negotiations are 80 percent complete .
" we must finish next year , " pascal recently told a french radio station .
“ technically , that is feasible .
politically things have taken a turn for the better . ”
in the meantime , the us and the chinese will continue to take their disagreements to the wto , the eu will look for a way to protect its farmers and still sign off on the doha agreement .
and the russians ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 26.06.2009 there 's no time to lose in combatting desertification , says expert großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huge areas of arable land are lost every year due to soil degradation increasing desertification leads to huge losses of arable land .
guest commentator susanne neubert says that we have a global responsibility to counter soil degradation and there 's no time to lose . some 70 percent of the world 's arid regions face desertification , and in around 110 countries - most of them poor - desertification threatens an area roughly the size of europe . twenty million tons of grain are lost annually due to desertification and , over the past 40 years , one third of the world 's arable land has been abandoned . even though there is no doubt about the causes of desertification , and the strategies needed to combat it are known , no turnaround is yet in sight .
why is it that neither the un desertification convention nor countless initiatives and programs have managed to halt the ongoing process of desertification ? unsustainable land management bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in many regions water for irrigation is not readily available the principal factors behind desertification are unsustainable land management and climate change .
as far as land management is concerned , incorrect farming practices also play a major role .
these include the cultivation of annual crop species , coupled with management methods that intermittently leave soils uncovered and exposed to erosion . other aspects of " incorrect " farming practices include faulty irrigation and either a total lack of fertilization or lopsided use of mineral fertilisers .
this often leads to soil mineralization , particularly in tropical regions , depriving soils of their capacity to store water .
carbon compounds , previously fixed in the soil in the form of organic matter , are released into the air in the course of the mineralization process .
this reduces the soil 's buffering capacity for drought and flooding , at the same time directly contributing to climate change . a good number of resource problems are closely interlinked : together , deforestation , species loss , climate change , growing scarcity of water resources , and the loss of organic matter in soils are responsible for desertification ; they are both its cause and effect . does this mean that we have no choice but to capitulate ?
no .
what it means is that by developing and using intelligent approaches we can achieve several goals at once .
soil conservation techniques , including erosion control walls , agro-forestry , and organic fertilization , are methods that are both effective and widely known - and these need to be applied on a larger scale . the reason why the picture continues to be dominated by individual measures is not technical in nature , indeed this must be seen as a problem bound up with economic incentives and political interests . incentives to support farmers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protecting trees can counter soil degradation since agriculture is organized primarily along private lines , soil conservation measures need to be carried out mainly by the private sector .
it is essential that incentives be set to ensure that investments in farmland yield returns , and the relatively high prices currently commanded by agricultural goods offer a good opportunity . there is considerable evidence that farmers carry out soil protection measures on their own if they lack more profitable alternatives and if the know-how and cost viability are available .
there is no lack of instructive examples , and german development cooperation offers a good number of them .
it is high time to start providing farmers in desertification-prone regions with appropriate advisory services as well as with the funds they need to transport stones to build erosion control walls , etc . , and to do so not intermittently but as a general rule . however , both agro-industry and institutional conditions also need to be modernized .
one correct and promising approach would be to encourage the agrochemical industry to gear production more to soil substrate additives . moreover , the agricultural policies of developing countries urgently need to be reoriented to reduce the fertilizer subsidies so widespread today and instead to increase the credit available in the agricultural sector .
and land rights need to be modified in such a way as to ensure that farmers have incentives to undertake soil conservation measures . no time to lose bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : modernizing the agro industry is vital in coutering the impact of climate change instead of continuing to generate vast amounts of greenhouse gases by producing and using mineral fertilizers incapable of achieving the hoped-for results on degraded soils , it would make far more sense to engage in organic agriculture keyed chiefly to on-farm resources .
this could serve to enhance soil storage capacity and - in cases where the needed organic matter is unavailable - to regenerate it by using industrially produced soil substrates .
land management of this kind tends to raise yields per unit area to earlier levels , and to do so precisely in arid regions . but is also essential to protect land at the supra-farm level , on state-owned land .
this , though , calls for a huge supply of labor .
in keeping with a proposal advanced by the united nations environment program -lrb- unep -rrb- , a " global green new deal " could be used to realize the action plans adopted to implement the un desertification convention , and in times of recession this would at the same time amount to an effective labor market policy . this should also include large-scale projects - like the building of " green walls " in china and the sahel belt - and efforts to link them with the numerous individual participatory measures already in progress , in order to achieve synergy effects . it would be important to implement measures geared at once to conservation and re-cultivation in order to come up with comprehensive measures that serve to reach several goals at the same time : protection of forests , water , climate , and soils .
this is a realistic aim in that the different organizational phases involved basically tend to correlate positively with one another . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neubert says that desertification is partly reversible how much time do we have left ?
the good news is that in many cases desertification is reversible .
the bad new is that this goes hand in hand with declining marginal utility , and when a certain stage of degradation has been reached , re-cultivation proves so labor-intensive that it is more attractive for the population to migrate to urban areas .
in other words , we have no time to lose .
this is not a question of " aid " but of global responsibility . author : dr.susanne neubert / -lrb- ara -rrb- editor : kate bowen dr. susanne neubert is a senior researcher at the german development institute -lrb- deutsches institut für entwicklungspolitik - die -rrb- , which is a multi-disciplinary think-tank for german and multilateral development policy .

the 3,300-kilometer -lrb- 2,000-mile -rrb- nabucco pipeline is a key energy project which will bring gas from the caspian sea to austria via turkey , bulgaria , romania and hungary .
the nabucco pipeline has been given a high priority in eu energy policy , however differences between the countries has stalled the project .
according to manager magazin , fischer 's most important job will be to keep turkey happy .
" fischer is highly regarded in turkey because he was always open to it joining the eu , " according to the article .
the pipeline 's main goal - and greatest hurdle - is to bypass russia , in a bid to reduce europe 's energy dependence on moscow .

just after he left office in 2005 , schroeder signed a lucrative deal with russian state-run energy giant gazprom to head the advisory board for the company 's nord stream pipeline project .
while still in office , schroeder signed the agreement to build the pipeline with his close friend vladimir putin , the current russian prime minister .
last january , schroeder also joined the board of british-russian oil firm tnk-bp .
fischer and schroeder were the leading two politicians in the seven year social democrat / green coalition government .

" we have tried our very best and we do n't move , " said the european union agriculture commissioner mariann fischer boel .
" we went to the absolute limit of what was acceptable to the agricultural community .
we wo n't go any further , " echoed french farm minister bruno le maire .
agriculture is one of the most contentious topics at the doha round of the wto talks , which was launched in the gulf state of qatar in 2001 .
rich countries , like the european union and the united states , support their farmers with subsidies , in order for the farmers to be able to make a decent profit from their products .
developing countries like india , china and other smaller countries in africa , asia and south america often produce the same agricultural products .
they can also sell them for less , because it costs them less to produce it .
for example , a farmer in bavaria makes much more than a farmer in hunan province in china .
so , in order for bavarian agricultural products to compete with chinese products , the german government pays the bavarian farmer a certain amount of money so that when the german product is on the shelf in the eu , it costs the same as the chinese product .
it can also restrict the amount of a similar product that the chinese can sell in germany , called quotas , or charge tariffs on those products .
who paid for that jetliner ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus ceo enders says he needs help with a350 tariffs , quotas and subsidies are all controversial ideas in world trade .
take airplanes .
the three major aircraft manufacturers in the world are boeing and lockheed in the us , and airbus in the eu .
recently the us has said that it will respond quickly and swiftly if european nations help airbus financially to launch a new plane , designated the airbus a350 .
the ceo of airbus , tom enders says that airbus needs the 11 billion euros in government financing in order for airbus to compete with boeing .
the doha round of the wto talks are ongoing and there is no resolution in sight , although wto president pascal lamy has said that negotiations are 80 percent complete .
" we must finish next year , " pascal recently told a french radio station .
“ technically , that is feasible .
politically things have taken a turn for the better . ”
in the meantime , the us and the chinese will continue to take their disagreements to the wto , the eu will look for a way to protect its farmers and still sign off on the doha agreement .
and the russians ?
one of the largest economies in the world ?

agriculture is one of the most contentious topics at the doha round of the wto talks , which was launched in the gulf state of qatar in 2001 .
rich countries , like the european union and the united states , support their farmers with subsidies , in order for the farmers to be able to make a decent profit from their products .
developing countries like india , china and other smaller countries in africa , asia and south america often produce the same agricultural products .
they can also sell them for less , because it costs them less to produce it .
for example , a farmer in bavaria makes much more than a farmer in hunan province in china .
so , in order for bavarian agricultural products to compete with chinese products , the german government pays the bavarian farmer a certain amount of money so that when the german product is on the shelf in the eu , it costs the same as the chinese product .
it can also restrict the amount of a similar product that the chinese can sell in germany , called quotas , or charge tariffs on those products .

the three major aircraft manufacturers in the world are boeing and lockheed in the us , and airbus in the eu .
recently the us has said that it will respond quickly and swiftly if european nations help airbus financially to launch a new plane , designated the airbus a350 .
the ceo of airbus , tom enders says that airbus needs the 11 billion euros in government financing in order for airbus to compete with boeing .
the doha round of the wto talks are ongoing and there is no resolution in sight , although wto president pascal lamy has said that negotiations are 80 percent complete .
" we must finish next year , " pascal recently told a french radio station .
“ technically , that is feasible .

the 3,300-kilometer -lrb- 2,000-mile -rrb- nabucco pipeline is a key energy project which will bring gas from the caspian sea to austria via turkey , bulgaria , romania and hungary .
the nabucco pipeline has been given a high priority in eu energy policy , however differences between the countries has stalled the project .
according to manager magazin , fischer 's most important job will be to keep turkey happy .
" fischer is highly regarded in turkey because he was always open to it joining the eu , " according to the article .
the pipeline 's main goal - and greatest hurdle - is to bypass russia , in a bid to reduce europe 's energy dependence on moscow .

just after he left office in 2005 , schroeder signed a lucrative deal with russian state-run energy giant gazprom to head the advisory board for the company 's nord stream pipeline project .
while still in office , schroeder signed the agreement to build the pipeline with his close friend vladimir putin , the current russian prime minister .
last january , schroeder also joined the board of british-russian oil firm tnk-bp .
fischer and schroeder were the leading two politicians in the seven year social democrat / green coalition government .
fischer withdrew from politics after the greens failed to win enough votes to remain in government in the 2005 elections .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 26.06.2009 there 's no time to lose in combatting desertification , says expert großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huge areas of arable land are lost every year due to soil degradation increasing desertification leads to huge losses of arable land .
guest commentator susanne neubert says that we have a global responsibility to counter soil degradation and there 's no time to lose . some 70 percent of the world 's arid regions face desertification , and in around 110 countries - most of them poor - desertification threatens an area roughly the size of europe . twenty million tons of grain are lost annually due to desertification and , over the past 40 years , one third of the world 's arable land has been abandoned . even though there is no doubt about the causes of desertification , and the strategies needed to combat it are known , no turnaround is yet in sight .
why is it that neither the un desertification convention nor countless initiatives and programs have managed to halt the ongoing process of desertification ? unsustainable land management bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in many regions water for irrigation is not readily available the principal factors behind desertification are unsustainable land management and climate change .
as far as land management is concerned , incorrect farming practices also play a major role .
these include the cultivation of annual crop species , coupled with management methods that intermittently leave soils uncovered and exposed to erosion . other aspects of " incorrect " farming practices include faulty irrigation and either a total lack of fertilization or lopsided use of mineral fertilisers .
this often leads to soil mineralization , particularly in tropical regions , depriving soils of their capacity to store water .
carbon compounds , previously fixed in the soil in the form of organic matter , are released into the air in the course of the mineralization process .
this reduces the soil 's buffering capacity for drought and flooding , at the same time directly contributing to climate change . a good number of resource problems are closely interlinked : together , deforestation , species loss , climate change , growing scarcity of water resources , and the loss of organic matter in soils are responsible for desertification ; they are both its cause and effect . does this mean that we have no choice but to capitulate ?
no .
what it means is that by developing and using intelligent approaches we can achieve several goals at once .
soil conservation techniques , including erosion control walls , agro-forestry , and organic fertilization , are methods that are both effective and widely known - and these need to be applied on a larger scale . the reason why the picture continues to be dominated by individual measures is not technical in nature , indeed this must be seen as a problem bound up with economic incentives and political interests . incentives to support farmers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protecting trees can counter soil degradation since agriculture is organized primarily along private lines , soil conservation measures need to be carried out mainly by the private sector .
it is essential that incentives be set to ensure that investments in farmland yield returns , and the relatively high prices currently commanded by agricultural goods offer a good opportunity . there is considerable evidence that farmers carry out soil protection measures on their own if they lack more profitable alternatives and if the know-how and cost viability are available .
there is no lack of instructive examples , and german development cooperation offers a good number of them .
it is high time to start providing farmers in desertification-prone regions with appropriate advisory services as well as with the funds they need to transport stones to build erosion control walls , etc . , and to do so not intermittently but as a general rule . however , both agro-industry and institutional conditions also need to be modernized .
one correct and promising approach would be to encourage the agrochemical industry to gear production more to soil substrate additives . moreover , the agricultural policies of developing countries urgently need to be reoriented to reduce the fertilizer subsidies so widespread today and instead to increase the credit available in the agricultural sector .
and land rights need to be modified in such a way as to ensure that farmers have incentives to undertake soil conservation measures . no time to lose bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : modernizing the agro industry is vital in coutering the impact of climate change instead of continuing to generate vast amounts of greenhouse gases by producing and using mineral fertilizers incapable of achieving the hoped-for results on degraded soils , it would make far more sense to engage in organic agriculture keyed chiefly to on-farm resources .
this could serve to enhance soil storage capacity and - in cases where the needed organic matter is unavailable - to regenerate it by using industrially produced soil substrates .
land management of this kind tends to raise yields per unit area to earlier levels , and to do so precisely in arid regions . but is also essential to protect land at the supra-farm level , on state-owned land .
this , though , calls for a huge supply of labor .
in keeping with a proposal advanced by the united nations environment program -lrb- unep -rrb- , a " global green new deal " could be used to realize the action plans adopted to implement the un desertification convention , and in times of recession this would at the same time amount to an effective labor market policy . this should also include large-scale projects - like the building of " green walls " in china and the sahel belt - and efforts to link them with the numerous individual participatory measures already in progress , in order to achieve synergy effects . it would be important to implement measures geared at once to conservation and re-cultivation in order to come up with comprehensive measures that serve to reach several goals at the same time : protection of forests , water , climate , and soils .
this is a realistic aim in that the different organizational phases involved basically tend to correlate positively with one another . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neubert says that desertification is partly reversible how much time do we have left ?
the good news is that in many cases desertification is reversible .
the bad new is that this goes hand in hand with declining marginal utility , and when a certain stage of degradation has been reached , re-cultivation proves so labor-intensive that it is more attractive for the population to migrate to urban areas .
in other words , we have no time to lose .
this is not a question of " aid " but of global responsibility . author : dr.susanne neubert / -lrb- ara -rrb- editor : kate bowen dr. susanne neubert is a senior researcher at the german development institute -lrb- deutsches institut für entwicklungspolitik - die -rrb- , which is a multi-disciplinary think-tank for german and multilateral development policy .

public gay pride demonstrations , known as christopher street day , are held every summer in cities around the world to commemorate the event .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amendments to the constitution are the focus of this year 's christopher street day parades klaus jetz , head of the lesbian and gay federation in germany -lrb- lsvd -rrb- , told deutsche welle that the political focus of this year 's christopher street day parades , which will begin this weekend in berlin , will be on amending article 3 of the german constitution .
" getting the anti-discrimination amendment passed has been an important topic for the organization since our founding in 1990 , " he said . " it is great that we have finally managed to rally support for this topic beyond our own community , within the political sphere . "
this week , the german parliament voted to push for a federal initiative to make additions to article 3 of the constitution , which protects citizens against discrimination based on gender , race , or religion .
they want , among other things , to add sexual orientation to that list .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's mayor klaus wowereit was one of the first politicians to publicly come out of the closet social democrat klaus wowereit , berlin 's openly homosexual mayor , spoke out in favor of the amendment .
in an interview with the german news agency dpa , wowereit said he whole-heartedly supported the initiative .
he called the laws passed to allow homosexual civil partnerships a " milestone , " but said that there was still judicial room for improvement .
same responsibilities , different rights wowereit took the lead from his party colleague , justice minister brigitte zypries .
in an interview with the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , zypries said that changing article 3 and article 6 of the constitution - which protects the institution of marriage and the family - would send " a clear signal " to society .
while german federal law gives homosexuals the right to enter a civil partnership , they do n't enjoy the same rights as heterosexual married couples when it comes to taxes , retirement , civil servant benefits , or adoption law .
zypries said that homosexual couples have the same responsibilities , but not the same rights as heterosexuals .
" i find this to be incredibly unjust , both on human and on judicial grounds , " the newspaper quoted zypries as saying .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civil unions are important for couples but do not grant the same rights as marriage taking a stand klaus jetz from the lesbian and gay federation in germany -lrb- lsvd -rrb- said that although both the european parliament and the european commission have taken a clear stance against discrimination based on sexual orientation , enshrining the same in the german constitution would have tangible advantages for the gay and lesbian community .
" homosexual couples are not able to adopt children in germany .
and ' rainbow families ' - gay and lesbian couples with biological children - do n't get the same tax breaks as heterosexual couples , " jetz said .
support in society growing article 3 of the constitution was amended for the last time in 1995 , to protect the disabled from discrimination .
at the time , there was not enough political backing to include sexual orientation to the list . but that seems to be changing .
on their web site , the lesbian and gay federation in germany lists a slew of supporters , from all walks of life - actors , politicians , even a rabbi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christopher street day is celebrated all over europe three major parties - the social democrats , the greens , and the left party - are in favor of an amendment .
but a two-thirds majority will be necessary to change the constitution and will need to include members of the conservative parties as well .
" we have to get the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- on board , " jetz said .
but the interior minister of the southern state of bavaria , joachim herrmann , has spoken out against the proposal .
the minister who belongs to the arch-conservative csu party , the sister bavarian party of the cdu , says he sees no reason to extend the constitutional protection of the family .
gay rights activists accuse the conservatives of blocking legislation that would give homosexuals more rights .
" we need the conservatives to understand that this is about protecting a minority in the population , " jetz said . " giving us more rights wo n't change anything for them . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 26.06.2009 there 's no time to lose in combatting desertification , says expert großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huge areas of arable land are lost every year due to soil degradation increasing desertification leads to huge losses of arable land .
guest commentator susanne neubert says that we have a global responsibility to counter soil degradation and there 's no time to lose . some 70 percent of the world 's arid regions face desertification , and in around 110 countries - most of them poor - desertification threatens an area roughly the size of europe . twenty million tons of grain are lost annually due to desertification and , over the past 40 years , one third of the world 's arable land has been abandoned . even though there is no doubt about the causes of desertification , and the strategies needed to combat it are known , no turnaround is yet in sight .
why is it that neither the un desertification convention nor countless initiatives and programs have managed to halt the ongoing process of desertification ? unsustainable land management bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in many regions water for irrigation is not readily available the principal factors behind desertification are unsustainable land management and climate change .
as far as land management is concerned , incorrect farming practices also play a major role .
these include the cultivation of annual crop species , coupled with management methods that intermittently leave soils uncovered and exposed to erosion . other aspects of " incorrect " farming practices include faulty irrigation and either a total lack of fertilization or lopsided use of mineral fertilisers .
this often leads to soil mineralization , particularly in tropical regions , depriving soils of their capacity to store water .
carbon compounds , previously fixed in the soil in the form of organic matter , are released into the air in the course of the mineralization process .
this reduces the soil 's buffering capacity for drought and flooding , at the same time directly contributing to climate change . a good number of resource problems are closely interlinked : together , deforestation , species loss , climate change , growing scarcity of water resources , and the loss of organic matter in soils are responsible for desertification ; they are both its cause and effect . does this mean that we have no choice but to capitulate ?
no .
what it means is that by developing and using intelligent approaches we can achieve several goals at once .
soil conservation techniques , including erosion control walls , agro-forestry , and organic fertilization , are methods that are both effective and widely known - and these need to be applied on a larger scale . the reason why the picture continues to be dominated by individual measures is not technical in nature , indeed this must be seen as a problem bound up with economic incentives and political interests . incentives to support farmers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protecting trees can counter soil degradation since agriculture is organized primarily along private lines , soil conservation measures need to be carried out mainly by the private sector .
it is essential that incentives be set to ensure that investments in farmland yield returns , and the relatively high prices currently commanded by agricultural goods offer a good opportunity . there is considerable evidence that farmers carry out soil protection measures on their own if they lack more profitable alternatives and if the know-how and cost viability are available .
there is no lack of instructive examples , and german development cooperation offers a good number of them .
it is high time to start providing farmers in desertification-prone regions with appropriate advisory services as well as with the funds they need to transport stones to build erosion control walls , etc . , and to do so not intermittently but as a general rule . however , both agro-industry and institutional conditions also need to be modernized .
one correct and promising approach would be to encourage the agrochemical industry to gear production more to soil substrate additives . moreover , the agricultural policies of developing countries urgently need to be reoriented to reduce the fertilizer subsidies so widespread today and instead to increase the credit available in the agricultural sector .
and land rights need to be modified in such a way as to ensure that farmers have incentives to undertake soil conservation measures . no time to lose bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : modernizing the agro industry is vital in coutering the impact of climate change instead of continuing to generate vast amounts of greenhouse gases by producing and using mineral fertilizers incapable of achieving the hoped-for results on degraded soils , it would make far more sense to engage in organic agriculture keyed chiefly to on-farm resources .
this could serve to enhance soil storage capacity and - in cases where the needed organic matter is unavailable - to regenerate it by using industrially produced soil substrates .
land management of this kind tends to raise yields per unit area to earlier levels , and to do so precisely in arid regions . but is also essential to protect land at the supra-farm level , on state-owned land .
this , though , calls for a huge supply of labor .
in keeping with a proposal advanced by the united nations environment program -lrb- unep -rrb- , a " global green new deal " could be used to realize the action plans adopted to implement the un desertification convention , and in times of recession this would at the same time amount to an effective labor market policy . this should also include large-scale projects - like the building of " green walls " in china and the sahel belt - and efforts to link them with the numerous individual participatory measures already in progress , in order to achieve synergy effects . it would be important to implement measures geared at once to conservation and re-cultivation in order to come up with comprehensive measures that serve to reach several goals at the same time : protection of forests , water , climate , and soils .
this is a realistic aim in that the different organizational phases involved basically tend to correlate positively with one another . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neubert says that desertification is partly reversible how much time do we have left ?
the good news is that in many cases desertification is reversible .
the bad new is that this goes hand in hand with declining marginal utility , and when a certain stage of degradation has been reached , re-cultivation proves so labor-intensive that it is more attractive for the population to migrate to urban areas .
in other words , we have no time to lose .
this is not a question of " aid " but of global responsibility . author : dr.susanne neubert / -lrb- ara -rrb- editor : kate bowen dr. susanne neubert is a senior researcher at the german development institute -lrb- deutsches institut für entwicklungspolitik - die -rrb- , which is a multi-disciplinary think-tank for german and multilateral development policy .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amendments to the constitution are the focus of this year 's christopher street day parades klaus jetz , head of the lesbian and gay federation in germany -lrb- lsvd -rrb- , told deutsche welle that the political focus of this year 's christopher street day parades , which will begin this weekend in berlin , will be on amending article 3 of the german constitution .
" getting the anti-discrimination amendment passed has been an important topic for the organization since our founding in 1990 , " he said . " it is great that we have finally managed to rally support for this topic beyond our own community , within the political sphere . "
this week , the german parliament voted to push for a federal initiative to make additions to article 3 of the constitution , which protects citizens against discrimination based on gender , race , or religion .
they want , among other things , to add sexual orientation to that list .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's mayor klaus wowereit was one of the first politicians to publicly come out of the closet social democrat klaus wowereit , berlin 's openly homosexual mayor , spoke out in favor of the amendment .
in an interview with the german news agency dpa , wowereit said he whole-heartedly supported the initiative .
he called the laws passed to allow homosexual civil partnerships a " milestone , " but said that there was still judicial room for improvement .
same responsibilities , different rights wowereit took the lead from his party colleague , justice minister brigitte zypries .
in an interview with the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , zypries said that changing article 3 and article 6 of the constitution - which protects the institution of marriage and the family - would send " a clear signal " to society .
while german federal law gives homosexuals the right to enter a civil partnership , they do n't enjoy the same rights as heterosexual married couples when it comes to taxes , retirement , civil servant benefits , or adoption law .
zypries said that homosexual couples have the same responsibilities , but not the same rights as heterosexuals .
" i find this to be incredibly unjust , both on human and on judicial grounds , " the newspaper quoted zypries as saying .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civil unions are important for couples but do not grant the same rights as marriage taking a stand klaus jetz from the lesbian and gay federation in germany -lrb- lsvd -rrb- said that although both the european parliament and the european commission have taken a clear stance against discrimination based on sexual orientation , enshrining the same in the german constitution would have tangible advantages for the gay and lesbian community .
" homosexual couples are not able to adopt children in germany .
and ' rainbow families ' - gay and lesbian couples with biological children - do n't get the same tax breaks as heterosexual couples , " jetz said .
support in society growing article 3 of the constitution was amended for the last time in 1995 , to protect the disabled from discrimination .
at the time , there was not enough political backing to include sexual orientation to the list . but that seems to be changing .
on their web site , the lesbian and gay federation in germany lists a slew of supporters , from all walks of life - actors , politicians , even a rabbi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christopher street day is celebrated all over europe three major parties - the social democrats , the greens , and the left party - are in favor of an amendment .
but a two-thirds majority will be necessary to change the constitution and will need to include members of the conservative parties as well .
" we have to get the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- on board , " jetz said .
but the interior minister of the southern state of bavaria , joachim herrmann , has spoken out against the proposal .
the minister who belongs to the arch-conservative csu party , the sister bavarian party of the cdu , says he sees no reason to extend the constitutional protection of the family .
gay rights activists accuse the conservatives of blocking legislation that would give homosexuals more rights .
" we need the conservatives to understand that this is about protecting a minority in the population , " jetz said . " giving us more rights wo n't change anything for them . "

public gay pride demonstrations , known as christopher street day , are held every summer in cities around the world to commemorate the event .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amendments to the constitution are the focus of this year 's christopher street day parades klaus jetz , head of the lesbian and gay federation in germany -lrb- lsvd -rrb- , told deutsche welle that the political focus of this year 's christopher street day parades , which will begin this weekend in berlin , will be on amending article 3 of the german constitution .
" getting the anti-discrimination amendment passed has been an important topic for the organization since our founding in 1990 , " he said . " it is great that we have finally managed to rally support for this topic beyond our own community , within the political sphere . "
this week , the german parliament voted to push for a federal initiative to make additions to article 3 of the constitution , which protects citizens against discrimination based on gender , race , or religion .
they want , among other things , to add sexual orientation to that list .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's mayor klaus wowereit was one of the first politicians to publicly come out of the closet social democrat klaus wowereit , berlin 's openly homosexual mayor , spoke out in favor of the amendment .
in an interview with the german news agency dpa , wowereit said he whole-heartedly supported the initiative .
he called the laws passed to allow homosexual civil partnerships a " milestone , " but said that there was still judicial room for improvement .
same responsibilities , different rights wowereit took the lead from his party colleague , justice minister brigitte zypries .
in an interview with the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , zypries said that changing article 3 and article 6 of the constitution - which protects the institution of marriage and the family - would send " a clear signal " to society .
while german federal law gives homosexuals the right to enter a civil partnership , they do n't enjoy the same rights as heterosexual married couples when it comes to taxes , retirement , civil servant benefits , or adoption law .
zypries said that homosexual couples have the same responsibilities , but not the same rights as heterosexuals .
" i find this to be incredibly unjust , both on human and on judicial grounds , " the newspaper quoted zypries as saying .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civil unions are important for couples but do not grant the same rights as marriage taking a stand klaus jetz from the lesbian and gay federation in germany -lrb- lsvd -rrb- said that although both the european parliament and the european commission have taken a clear stance against discrimination based on sexual orientation , enshrining the same in the german constitution would have tangible advantages for the gay and lesbian community .
" homosexual couples are not able to adopt children in germany .
and ' rainbow families ' - gay and lesbian couples with biological children - do n't get the same tax breaks as heterosexual couples , " jetz said .
support in society growing article 3 of the constitution was amended for the last time in 1995 , to protect the disabled from discrimination .
at the time , there was not enough political backing to include sexual orientation to the list . but that seems to be changing .
on their web site , the lesbian and gay federation in germany lists a slew of supporters , from all walks of life - actors , politicians , even a rabbi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christopher street day is celebrated all over europe three major parties - the social democrats , the greens , and the left party - are in favor of an amendment .
but a two-thirds majority will be necessary to change the constitution and will need to include members of the conservative parties as well .
" we have to get the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- on board , " jetz said .
but the interior minister of the southern state of bavaria , joachim herrmann , has spoken out against the proposal .
the minister who belongs to the arch-conservative csu party , the sister bavarian party of the cdu , says he sees no reason to extend the constitutional protection of the family .
gay rights activists accuse the conservatives of blocking legislation that would give homosexuals more rights .
" we need the conservatives to understand that this is about protecting a minority in the population , " jetz said . " giving us more rights wo n't change anything for them . "

guest commentator susanne neubert says that we have a global responsibility to counter soil degradation and there 's no time to lose . some 70 percent of the world 's arid regions face desertification , and in around 110 countries - most of them poor - desertification threatens an area roughly the size of europe . twenty million tons of grain are lost annually due to desertification and , over the past 40 years , one third of the world 's arable land has been abandoned . even though there is no doubt about the causes of desertification , and the strategies needed to combat it are known , no turnaround is yet in sight .
why is it that neither the un desertification convention nor countless initiatives and programs have managed to halt the ongoing process of desertification ? unsustainable land management bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in many regions water for irrigation is not readily available the principal factors behind desertification are unsustainable land management and climate change .
as far as land management is concerned , incorrect farming practices also play a major role .
these include the cultivation of annual crop species , coupled with management methods that intermittently leave soils uncovered and exposed to erosion . other aspects of " incorrect " farming practices include faulty irrigation and either a total lack of fertilization or lopsided use of mineral fertilisers .
this often leads to soil mineralization , particularly in tropical regions , depriving soils of their capacity to store water .
carbon compounds , previously fixed in the soil in the form of organic matter , are released into the air in the course of the mineralization process .
this reduces the soil 's buffering capacity for drought and flooding , at the same time directly contributing to climate change . a good number of resource problems are closely interlinked : together , deforestation , species loss , climate change , growing scarcity of water resources , and the loss of organic matter in soils are responsible for desertification ; they are both its cause and effect . does this mean that we have no choice but to capitulate ?
no .
what it means is that by developing and using intelligent approaches we can achieve several goals at once .
soil conservation techniques , including erosion control walls , agro-forestry , and organic fertilization , are methods that are both effective and widely known - and these need to be applied on a larger scale . the reason why the picture continues to be dominated by individual measures is not technical in nature , indeed this must be seen as a problem bound up with economic incentives and political interests . incentives to support farmers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protecting trees can counter soil degradation since agriculture is organized primarily along private lines , soil conservation measures need to be carried out mainly by the private sector .
it is essential that incentives be set to ensure that investments in farmland yield returns , and the relatively high prices currently commanded by agricultural goods offer a good opportunity . there is considerable evidence that farmers carry out soil protection measures on their own if they lack more profitable alternatives and if the know-how and cost viability are available .
there is no lack of instructive examples , and german development cooperation offers a good number of them .
it is high time to start providing farmers in desertification-prone regions with appropriate advisory services as well as with the funds they need to transport stones to build erosion control walls , etc . , and to do so not intermittently but as a general rule . however , both agro-industry and institutional conditions also need to be modernized .
one correct and promising approach would be to encourage the agrochemical industry to gear production more to soil substrate additives . moreover , the agricultural policies of developing countries urgently need to be reoriented to reduce the fertilizer subsidies so widespread today and instead to increase the credit available in the agricultural sector .
and land rights need to be modified in such a way as to ensure that farmers have incentives to undertake soil conservation measures . no time to lose bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : modernizing the agro industry is vital in coutering the impact of climate change instead of continuing to generate vast amounts of greenhouse gases by producing and using mineral fertilizers incapable of achieving the hoped-for results on degraded soils , it would make far more sense to engage in organic agriculture keyed chiefly to on-farm resources .
this could serve to enhance soil storage capacity and - in cases where the needed organic matter is unavailable - to regenerate it by using industrially produced soil substrates .
land management of this kind tends to raise yields per unit area to earlier levels , and to do so precisely in arid regions . but is also essential to protect land at the supra-farm level , on state-owned land .
this , though , calls for a huge supply of labor .
in keeping with a proposal advanced by the united nations environment program -lrb- unep -rrb- , a " global green new deal " could be used to realize the action plans adopted to implement the un desertification convention , and in times of recession this would at the same time amount to an effective labor market policy . this should also include large-scale projects - like the building of " green walls " in china and the sahel belt - and efforts to link them with the numerous individual participatory measures already in progress , in order to achieve synergy effects . it would be important to implement measures geared at once to conservation and re-cultivation in order to come up with comprehensive measures that serve to reach several goals at the same time : protection of forests , water , climate , and soils .
this is a realistic aim in that the different organizational phases involved basically tend to correlate positively with one another . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neubert says that desertification is partly reversible how much time do we have left ?
the good news is that in many cases desertification is reversible .
the bad new is that this goes hand in hand with declining marginal utility , and when a certain stage of degradation has been reached , re-cultivation proves so labor-intensive that it is more attractive for the population to migrate to urban areas .
in other words , we have no time to lose .
this is not a question of " aid " but of global responsibility . author : dr.susanne neubert / -lrb- ara -rrb- editor : kate bowen dr. susanne neubert is a senior researcher at the german development institute -lrb- deutsches institut für entwicklungspolitik - die -rrb- , which is a multi-disciplinary think-tank for german and multilateral development policy .

the decision was announced friday at the world heritage committee 's annual meeting in seville , spain . germany and the netherlands registered the wadden sea , a tidal wetlands area on their northern coasts , as a contender for the unesco world heritage title at the beginning of 2008 . friday 's announcement makes the nature reserve the first one in germany to be awarded the status .
recently , the wadden sea has been under threat due to the constant flow of shipping traffic and plans for oil and gas drilling .
there is also concern about the effect climate change could have on the area .
visited by thousands of tourists every year , the wadden sea spans more than 10,000 kilometers and borders three countries in total : the netherlands , germany , and denmark .
visitors flock there year-round to enjoy the endless expanse of shallow mud flats , caught between land and sea , and its diverse wildlife .
under protection in 1985 , germany officially declared the wadden sea tidal flats a nature reserve and national park .
parts of it have also been protected under national park status in the netherlands .
environmentalists fear for the wadden sea 's future though as plans to deepen the elbe river , which borders the wadden sea , to accomodate ships en route to the hamburg harbor could have a damaging effect on the nature reserve .
many different species make their home there , including seals , and an estimated 1.5 million birds descend on the wadden sea for food during migratory seasons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wadden sea is home to many different species there has also been concern about the oil and gas drilling platforms planted in the middle of the park . in the german state of schleswig-holstein , it is legal to drill for oil in national parks , however , it goes against the rules of the unesco world heritage committee .
in order to get around a potential barrier to receiving the title , germany and the netherlands cut out the sections of the park used for drilling in their application . there are also long-term concerns about the effect climate change will have on the wetlands , as rising sea levels could cause the area to slowly erode over time .
a unesco world heritage title is the highest honor yet for the wadden sea and advocates say it will help to ensure its conservation . germany boasts a long list of unesco world heritage sites in addition to the wadden sea , including the hanseatic city of lübeck , the cologne cathedral , and the messel pit , one of the world 's most improtant sites for fossils . the unesco world heritage committee will announce their final decision on all new entries by the end of the conference on june 30th. vj dpa / afp / kna editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 26.06.2009 campaign against planned mekong river dams großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mekong river is a lifeline for millions of people in southeast asia plans to build 11 hydropower dams on the lower mekong river have raised fears the projects will threaten food security and the livelihoods of millions of people along the river basin .
civil society groups have been campaigning to bring the issue to the notice of the mekong river governments , asking them to scrap the plans . the 11 dams along the lower mekong river are planned for laos , cambodia and the thai-lao border .
the hydropower generated by them is to meet the increasing demand for electricity across the region .
the 4,800 kilometre mekong river flows from the tibetan plateau through southern china and myanmar before reaching the mekong basin and eventually flowing to the south china sea through southern vietnam .
problems for food security civil society groups groups point to the threat to fish stocks , water access and general food security for the millions of people living in the region if the hydropower dam developments go ahead .
premrudee daoroung is a co-director of the bangkok-based group ' towards ecological recovery and regional alliance ' -lrb- terra -rrb- .
she says because several dams are planned the situation is vastly more complicated than earlier campaigns to halt damming on the mekong .
" compared with the past 20 years , the situation has become pretty critical now – a lot more difficult – in terms of the figures of the dams , because they are not one country ’ s dams anymore .
we have to consider the cross-border issues .
the main reason for our campaign right now is to save the mekong as a whole – which is not comparable to the past . "
postcard campaign civil society groups have combined efforts to present the case to regional governments .
through a postcard petition campaign more than 16,000 people have signed on urging the prime ministers of cambodia , laos , thailand and vietnam to put a stop to the developments .
thai prime minister abhisit vejjajiva said the issue should be raised with the association of south east asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- .
carl middleton from the environmental group ' international rivers ' , says there is now a greater understanding of both the importance of the fishing industry and the wider social impact if the dams go ahead .
" compared to when these dams were first conceived the world ’ s moved on – hydropower is last century ’ s technology .
so these projects in the past , they were stopped by various reasons , including the high environmental and social impact .
but the fact is now there are far better options to meeting energy needs in the region . "
threatening endangered species middleton says the hydropower projects would affect the more than 50 species of migratory fish in one the world ’ s most productive inland fisheries .
the dams would also threaten several endangered species such as the irrawaddy dolphin and the mekong giant catfish .
downstream in vietnam ’ s delta region , agronomists fear the dams will drastically affect the country ’ s rice growing bowl , limiting fresh water flows and leading to more sea water flowing inland .
as a result , soil acidity would increase destroying rice fields and affecting the lives of 17 million people .
the groups have also called for greater action by the mekong river commission or mrc - to take a stronger stance over future developments that affect the river , the lifeblood for so many in the region .

the decision was announced friday at the world heritage committee 's annual meeting in seville , spain . germany and the netherlands registered the wadden sea , a tidal wetlands area on their northern coasts , as a contender for the unesco world heritage title at the beginning of 2008 . friday 's announcement makes the nature reserve the first one in germany to be awarded the status .
recently , the wadden sea has been under threat due to the constant flow of shipping traffic and plans for oil and gas drilling .
there is also concern about the effect climate change could have on the area .
visited by thousands of tourists every year , the wadden sea spans more than 10,000 kilometers and borders three countries in total : the netherlands , germany , and denmark .
visitors flock there year-round to enjoy the endless expanse of shallow mud flats , caught between land and sea , and its diverse wildlife .
under protection in 1985 , germany officially declared the wadden sea tidal flats a nature reserve and national park .
parts of it have also been protected under national park status in the netherlands .
environmentalists fear for the wadden sea 's future though as plans to deepen the elbe river , which borders the wadden sea , to accomodate ships en route to the hamburg harbor could have a damaging effect on the nature reserve .
many different species make their home there , including seals , and an estimated 1.5 million birds descend on the wadden sea for food during migratory seasons .

guest commentator susanne neubert says that we have a global responsibility to counter soil degradation and there 's no time to lose . some 70 percent of the world 's arid regions face desertification , and in around 110 countries - most of them poor - desertification threatens an area roughly the size of europe . twenty million tons of grain are lost annually due to desertification and , over the past 40 years , one third of the world 's arable land has been abandoned . even though there is no doubt about the causes of desertification , and the strategies needed to combat it are known , no turnaround is yet in sight .
why is it that neither the un desertification convention nor countless initiatives and programs have managed to halt the ongoing process of desertification ? unsustainable land management bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in many regions water for irrigation is not readily available the principal factors behind desertification are unsustainable land management and climate change .
as far as land management is concerned , incorrect farming practices also play a major role .
these include the cultivation of annual crop species , coupled with management methods that intermittently leave soils uncovered and exposed to erosion . other aspects of " incorrect " farming practices include faulty irrigation and either a total lack of fertilization or lopsided use of mineral fertilisers .
this often leads to soil mineralization , particularly in tropical regions , depriving soils of their capacity to store water .
carbon compounds , previously fixed in the soil in the form of organic matter , are released into the air in the course of the mineralization process .
this reduces the soil 's buffering capacity for drought and flooding , at the same time directly contributing to climate change . a good number of resource problems are closely interlinked : together , deforestation , species loss , climate change , growing scarcity of water resources , and the loss of organic matter in soils are responsible for desertification ; they are both its cause and effect . does this mean that we have no choice but to capitulate ?
no .
what it means is that by developing and using intelligent approaches we can achieve several goals at once .
soil conservation techniques , including erosion control walls , agro-forestry , and organic fertilization , are methods that are both effective and widely known - and these need to be applied on a larger scale . the reason why the picture continues to be dominated by individual measures is not technical in nature , indeed this must be seen as a problem bound up with economic incentives and political interests . incentives to support farmers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protecting trees can counter soil degradation since agriculture is organized primarily along private lines , soil conservation measures need to be carried out mainly by the private sector .
it is essential that incentives be set to ensure that investments in farmland yield returns , and the relatively high prices currently commanded by agricultural goods offer a good opportunity . there is considerable evidence that farmers carry out soil protection measures on their own if they lack more profitable alternatives and if the know-how and cost viability are available .
there is no lack of instructive examples , and german development cooperation offers a good number of them .
it is high time to start providing farmers in desertification-prone regions with appropriate advisory services as well as with the funds they need to transport stones to build erosion control walls , etc . , and to do so not intermittently but as a general rule . however , both agro-industry and institutional conditions also need to be modernized .
one correct and promising approach would be to encourage the agrochemical industry to gear production more to soil substrate additives . moreover , the agricultural policies of developing countries urgently need to be reoriented to reduce the fertilizer subsidies so widespread today and instead to increase the credit available in the agricultural sector .
and land rights need to be modified in such a way as to ensure that farmers have incentives to undertake soil conservation measures . no time to lose bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : modernizing the agro industry is vital in coutering the impact of climate change instead of continuing to generate vast amounts of greenhouse gases by producing and using mineral fertilizers incapable of achieving the hoped-for results on degraded soils , it would make far more sense to engage in organic agriculture keyed chiefly to on-farm resources .
this could serve to enhance soil storage capacity and - in cases where the needed organic matter is unavailable - to regenerate it by using industrially produced soil substrates .
land management of this kind tends to raise yields per unit area to earlier levels , and to do so precisely in arid regions . but is also essential to protect land at the supra-farm level , on state-owned land .
this , though , calls for a huge supply of labor .
in keeping with a proposal advanced by the united nations environment program -lrb- unep -rrb- , a " global green new deal " could be used to realize the action plans adopted to implement the un desertification convention , and in times of recession this would at the same time amount to an effective labor market policy . this should also include large-scale projects - like the building of " green walls " in china and the sahel belt - and efforts to link them with the numerous individual participatory measures already in progress , in order to achieve synergy effects . it would be important to implement measures geared at once to conservation and re-cultivation in order to come up with comprehensive measures that serve to reach several goals at the same time : protection of forests , water , climate , and soils .
this is a realistic aim in that the different organizational phases involved basically tend to correlate positively with one another . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neubert says that desertification is partly reversible how much time do we have left ?
the good news is that in many cases desertification is reversible .
the bad new is that this goes hand in hand with declining marginal utility , and when a certain stage of degradation has been reached , re-cultivation proves so labor-intensive that it is more attractive for the population to migrate to urban areas .
in other words , we have no time to lose .
this is not a question of " aid " but of global responsibility . author : dr.susanne neubert / -lrb- ara -rrb- editor : kate bowen dr. susanne neubert is a senior researcher at the german development institute -lrb- deutsches institut für entwicklungspolitik - die -rrb- , which is a multi-disciplinary think-tank for german and multilateral development policy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 26.06.2009 cologne therapy center helps torture victims get their lives back großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : torture is carried out in prisons and detention centers in many countries june 26 is the un international day in support of victims of torture .
torture victims carry the burden of their experiences forever , but one therapy center in cologne seeks to make living with the memories bearable . petek t. * has been a patient at the cologne therapy center for torture victims for two years now , but the memories of her torture during her imprisonment in turkey are still very vivid .
her biggest wish is for something that many people take for granted : sleep .
" during the day , i can distract myself , " she said .
" but at night , i have problems sleeping , and nightmares .
the traumatic experiences always come back . "
petek , now 38 , was 18 when she began her university studies in her hometown of izmir in western turkey .
she wanted to become a journalist , and wrote articles for student organizations criticizing an increase of repression and the authoritarian approach of the turkish government .
she was sent to jail three times for her writing after being convicted or being a member in a forbidden organization .
her most recent imprisonment was from 1994-2002 , but even seven years later , it churns up too many memories for her to talk about .
since her time in a turkish prison , the situation of prisoners there has improved somewhat , she said , but people are still being tortured .
" people are still dying in prison under unclear circumstances , but the government denies that there is systematic torture going on in turkey , " said petek .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in some places , phsychological torture has replaced traditional methods waiting list for torture therapy the cologne therapy center for torture victims was founded in 1985 as a pilot project by the un high commissioner of refugees , and is run as a charitable organization .
uenal hamidye is petek 's therapist at the therapy center , and is familiar with many cases that are similar to hers .
hamidye said torture methods are becoming increasingly psychological , and often leave behind no physical marks .
" for example , someone might come and say ' if you do n't talk , we 're going to get your wife and rape her , " ' she said .
" the people are faced with a dilemma : either they betray their organization or they have to watch as their wives , mothers , or sisters are raped . "
petek is one of many former torture victims who come to the therapy center for help .
the demand on the center 's services is so high that there is often a waiting list .
when she first arrived in germany with her husband in 2004 , petek was told she 'd have to wait one to two years to be admitted .
" a psychological crisis does n't wait , " said petek .
" i saw no more point in my life anymore .
but i had a breakdown and was brought to the clinic where the doctors put me in contact with -lrb- hamidye -rrb- .
that 's why i 'm here , and i 'm very happy about that . "
the therapy center treats between 600 and 800 torture victims each year .
the center offers individual and group therapy sessions , and also gives help in dealing with day to day life , including learning german or completing administrative tasks connected with moving to a different country .
no ' getting back to normal ' for torture victims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un human rights commissioner navanethem pillay has called for the prohibition of torture brigitte brand-wilhelmy , director of the therapy center , said that most of the current patients come from iran , iraq , certain african nations , and particularly from former yugoslavia . " we have women here who lost their entire families in massacres , " brand-wilhelmy said .
" they watched as their siblings and parents were murdered .
we hear stories where it is hard to imagine how people can do such things to one another . "
it takes a lot of time for torture victims to recover from their experiences , and petek is still working through the effects of what was done to her .
it 's not just nightmares , either .
her therapist has told her she is suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder .
she has concentration problems and can not work , which makes it difficult to fully embrace her new home in germany .
" every day is a struggle , " petek said .
" my husband and i do n't have family or friends here , we only have each other .
because of the effects of the torture , it is hard to learn new things ; at the moment , learning german is taking quite a while .
we 'd love to get adjusted to living in germany , but it 's difficult . " * her last name has been withheld for privacy reasons .

the 3,300-kilometer -lrb- 2,000-mile -rrb- nabucco pipeline is a key energy project which will bring gas from the caspian sea to austria via turkey , bulgaria , romania and hungary .
the nabucco pipeline has been given a high priority in eu energy policy , however differences between the countries has stalled the project .
according to manager magazin , fischer 's most important job will be to keep turkey happy .
" fischer is highly regarded in turkey because he was always open to it joining the eu , " according to the article .
the pipeline 's main goal - and greatest hurdle - is to bypass russia , in a bid to reduce europe 's energy dependence on moscow .
currently , the eu gets about one-third of its energy from russia , through transit countries belarus and ukraine .
nabucco has therefore been a hot political topic between the eu and russia , with moscow doing everything it can to torpedo the process .
high-profile lobbying bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder works for russia 's competing nord stream project the russians , for their part , have been pushing for the nord stream pipeline through the north sea .
they are supported in their efforts by joschka fischer 's former boss and political ally , ex-chancellor gerhard schroeder .
just after he left office in 2005 , schroeder signed a lucrative deal with russian state-run energy giant gazprom to head the advisory board for the company 's nord stream pipeline project .
while still in office , schroeder signed the agreement to build the pipeline with his close friend vladimir putin , the current russian prime minister .
last january , schroeder also joined the board of british-russian oil firm tnk-bp .
fischer and schroeder were the leading two politicians in the seven year social democrat / green coalition government .
fischer withdrew from politics after the greens failed to win enough votes to remain in government in the 2005 elections .
since then , he has lived in the united states , working as a lecturer at princeton university. kj / afp / dpa editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the decision was announced friday at the world heritage committee 's annual meeting in seville , spain . germany and the netherlands registered the wadden sea , a tidal wetlands area on their northern coasts , as a contender for the unesco world heritage title at the beginning of 2008 . friday 's announcement makes the nature reserve the first one in germany to be awarded the status .
recently , the wadden sea has been under threat due to the constant flow of shipping traffic and plans for oil and gas drilling .
there is also concern about the effect climate change could have on the area .
visited by thousands of tourists every year , the wadden sea spans more than 10,000 kilometers and borders three countries in total : the netherlands , germany , and denmark .
visitors flock there year-round to enjoy the endless expanse of shallow mud flats , caught between land and sea , and its diverse wildlife .
under protection in 1985 , germany officially declared the wadden sea tidal flats a nature reserve and national park .
parts of it have also been protected under national park status in the netherlands .
environmentalists fear for the wadden sea 's future though as plans to deepen the elbe river , which borders the wadden sea , to accomodate ships en route to the hamburg harbor could have a damaging effect on the nature reserve .
many different species make their home there , including seals , and an estimated 1.5 million birds descend on the wadden sea for food during migratory seasons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wadden sea is home to many different species there has also been concern about the oil and gas drilling platforms planted in the middle of the park . in the german state of schleswig-holstein , it is legal to drill for oil in national parks , however , it goes against the rules of the unesco world heritage committee .
in order to get around a potential barrier to receiving the title , germany and the netherlands cut out the sections of the park used for drilling in their application . there are also long-term concerns about the effect climate change will have on the wetlands , as rising sea levels could cause the area to slowly erode over time .
a unesco world heritage title is the highest honor yet for the wadden sea and advocates say it will help to ensure its conservation . germany boasts a long list of unesco world heritage sites in addition to the wadden sea , including the hanseatic city of lübeck , the cologne cathedral , and the messel pit , one of the world 's most improtant sites for fossils . the unesco world heritage committee will announce their final decision on all new entries by the end of the conference on june 30th. vj dpa / afp / kna editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but in germany 's case , the real stars do n't stick with the team very long .
dw 's jefferson chase explains . when the young german eleven beat italy 1-0 in the semifinals of the event on friday , june 26 , they moved a step closer to making history .
germany may be a soccer powerhouse , but the record of the u21 national team is anything but stellar .
incredibly enough , they 've never won a major tournament - a blot that coach horst hrubesch currently wants to rectify in sweden .
still , after needing a nervy draw against england to qualify for the knock-out stage , hrubesch is n't exactly jumping for joy .
" the only thing i 'm happy about is making the semis , " the coach told dpa news agency after the england match .
" i 'm not at all satisfied with how we did it - it was way below our ambitions . "
with the german u17 and u19 teams having won their european titles , this could be the year for germany 's youth teams .
but would it signal a glorious future ahead for the adult german national team ?
probably not .
here today , gone tomorrow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year , before taking his current job , hrubesch won europe with the u19 germany 's footballing reputation is one of solidity and consistency rather than mercurial brilliance so you might expect the national soccer association , the dfb , to bring up players gradually through the various levels .
but the opposite is the case .
goalkeeping legend oliver kahn and super striker miroslav klose never played in the youth ranks , going straight into the main national team .
and while most of the current national squad did take the pitch for the u21s , very few of the real stars - michael ballack , bastian schweinsteiger or lukas podolski , for example - made more than a handful of appearances , before being promoted up to the big league .
the uefa u21 championship has only been in existence in its current form since 1978 , and it took some time for germany to take them seriously .
even into the 1990s the dfb eleven were playing with a sweeper .
as a result , germany have always gone home empty handed while italy have won europe five times , and even england - never a national side known for tournament successes - have hoisted the trophy twice .
ones to watch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany are glad oezil , r , choose to play for them instead of turkey given the german u21s ' history , the players most likely to play roles in the top squad are those who have already been called up by national coach joachim loew .
diminutive forward marko marin has n't been able to make much of a mark in sweden , but leverkusen 's gonzalo castro , stuttgart 's sami khedira and schalke goalkeeper manuel neuer have performed well .
and the star of the show has been mesut oezil , who normally plays on the wing for his club bremen but who has shone in a striker role for hrubesch , setting up both of goals in germany 's 2-nil win over finland in the group stage .
and the breakthrough player of the squad is defender jerome boateng .
boateng usually serves as right back and has struggled to keep a position in the starting line-up for his club hamburg .
but he 's drawn high marks in all his matches for the young germans playing as a central defender - a role for which hamburg might consider him when he returns from sweden .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : castro is part of germany 's multi-cultural squad those names point to an unmistakable trend within the german national team - the growing prominence of players who were born outside germany or who come from an immigrant background .
klose , podolski , both polish born , have established themselves as mainstays in germany adult national team - and they 've recently been joined by piotr trochowski .
in the u21 , eight of the current 24 members of the squad come from multi-national backgrounds .
so if germany continues the tradition of integrating younger players quickly into the main men 's team , some of hrubesch 's charges could play a role at the 2010 world cup in south africa .

guest commentator susanne neubert says that we have a global responsibility to counter soil degradation and there 's no time to lose . some 70 percent of the world 's arid regions face desertification , and in around 110 countries - most of them poor - desertification threatens an area roughly the size of europe . twenty million tons of grain are lost annually due to desertification and , over the past 40 years , one third of the world 's arable land has been abandoned . even though there is no doubt about the causes of desertification , and the strategies needed to combat it are known , no turnaround is yet in sight .
why is it that neither the un desertification convention nor countless initiatives and programs have managed to halt the ongoing process of desertification ? unsustainable land management bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in many regions water for irrigation is not readily available the principal factors behind desertification are unsustainable land management and climate change .
as far as land management is concerned , incorrect farming practices also play a major role .
these include the cultivation of annual crop species , coupled with management methods that intermittently leave soils uncovered and exposed to erosion . other aspects of " incorrect " farming practices include faulty irrigation and either a total lack of fertilization or lopsided use of mineral fertilisers .
this often leads to soil mineralization , particularly in tropical regions , depriving soils of their capacity to store water .
carbon compounds , previously fixed in the soil in the form of organic matter , are released into the air in the course of the mineralization process .
this reduces the soil 's buffering capacity for drought and flooding , at the same time directly contributing to climate change . a good number of resource problems are closely interlinked : together , deforestation , species loss , climate change , growing scarcity of water resources , and the loss of organic matter in soils are responsible for desertification ; they are both its cause and effect . does this mean that we have no choice but to capitulate ?
no .
what it means is that by developing and using intelligent approaches we can achieve several goals at once .
soil conservation techniques , including erosion control walls , agro-forestry , and organic fertilization , are methods that are both effective and widely known - and these need to be applied on a larger scale . the reason why the picture continues to be dominated by individual measures is not technical in nature , indeed this must be seen as a problem bound up with economic incentives and political interests . incentives to support farmers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protecting trees can counter soil degradation since agriculture is organized primarily along private lines , soil conservation measures need to be carried out mainly by the private sector .
it is essential that incentives be set to ensure that investments in farmland yield returns , and the relatively high prices currently commanded by agricultural goods offer a good opportunity . there is considerable evidence that farmers carry out soil protection measures on their own if they lack more profitable alternatives and if the know-how and cost viability are available .
there is no lack of instructive examples , and german development cooperation offers a good number of them .
it is high time to start providing farmers in desertification-prone regions with appropriate advisory services as well as with the funds they need to transport stones to build erosion control walls , etc . , and to do so not intermittently but as a general rule . however , both agro-industry and institutional conditions also need to be modernized .
one correct and promising approach would be to encourage the agrochemical industry to gear production more to soil substrate additives . moreover , the agricultural policies of developing countries urgently need to be reoriented to reduce the fertilizer subsidies so widespread today and instead to increase the credit available in the agricultural sector .
and land rights need to be modified in such a way as to ensure that farmers have incentives to undertake soil conservation measures . no time to lose bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : modernizing the agro industry is vital in coutering the impact of climate change instead of continuing to generate vast amounts of greenhouse gases by producing and using mineral fertilizers incapable of achieving the hoped-for results on degraded soils , it would make far more sense to engage in organic agriculture keyed chiefly to on-farm resources .
this could serve to enhance soil storage capacity and - in cases where the needed organic matter is unavailable - to regenerate it by using industrially produced soil substrates .
land management of this kind tends to raise yields per unit area to earlier levels , and to do so precisely in arid regions . but is also essential to protect land at the supra-farm level , on state-owned land .
this , though , calls for a huge supply of labor .
in keeping with a proposal advanced by the united nations environment program -lrb- unep -rrb- , a " global green new deal " could be used to realize the action plans adopted to implement the un desertification convention , and in times of recession this would at the same time amount to an effective labor market policy . this should also include large-scale projects - like the building of " green walls " in china and the sahel belt - and efforts to link them with the numerous individual participatory measures already in progress , in order to achieve synergy effects . it would be important to implement measures geared at once to conservation and re-cultivation in order to come up with comprehensive measures that serve to reach several goals at the same time : protection of forests , water , climate , and soils .
this is a realistic aim in that the different organizational phases involved basically tend to correlate positively with one another . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neubert says that desertification is partly reversible how much time do we have left ?
the good news is that in many cases desertification is reversible .
the bad new is that this goes hand in hand with declining marginal utility , and when a certain stage of degradation has been reached , re-cultivation proves so labor-intensive that it is more attractive for the population to migrate to urban areas .
in other words , we have no time to lose .
this is not a question of " aid " but of global responsibility . author : dr.susanne neubert / -lrb- ara -rrb- editor : kate bowen dr. susanne neubert is a senior researcher at the german development institute -lrb- deutsches institut für entwicklungspolitik - die -rrb- , which is a multi-disciplinary think-tank for german and multilateral development policy .

but in germany 's case , the real stars do n't stick with the team very long .
dw 's jefferson chase explains . when the young german eleven beat italy 1-0 in the semifinals of the event on friday , june 26 , they moved a step closer to making history .
germany may be a soccer powerhouse , but the record of the u21 national team is anything but stellar .
incredibly enough , they 've never won a major tournament - a blot that coach horst hrubesch currently wants to rectify in sweden .
still , after needing a nervy draw against england to qualify for the knock-out stage , hrubesch is n't exactly jumping for joy .
" the only thing i 'm happy about is making the semis , " the coach told dpa news agency after the england match .
" i 'm not at all satisfied with how we did it - it was way below our ambitions . "
with the german u17 and u19 teams having won their european titles , this could be the year for germany 's youth teams .
but would it signal a glorious future ahead for the adult german national team ?
probably not .
here today , gone tomorrow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year , before taking his current job , hrubesch won europe with the u19 germany 's footballing reputation is one of solidity and consistency rather than mercurial brilliance so you might expect the national soccer association , the dfb , to bring up players gradually through the various levels .
but the opposite is the case .
goalkeeping legend oliver kahn and super striker miroslav klose never played in the youth ranks , going straight into the main national team .
and while most of the current national squad did take the pitch for the u21s , very few of the real stars - michael ballack , bastian schweinsteiger or lukas podolski , for example - made more than a handful of appearances , before being promoted up to the big league .
the uefa u21 championship has only been in existence in its current form since 1978 , and it took some time for germany to take them seriously .
even into the 1990s the dfb eleven were playing with a sweeper .
as a result , germany have always gone home empty handed while italy have won europe five times , and even england - never a national side known for tournament successes - have hoisted the trophy twice .
ones to watch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany are glad oezil , r , choose to play for them instead of turkey given the german u21s ' history , the players most likely to play roles in the top squad are those who have already been called up by national coach joachim loew .
diminutive forward marko marin has n't been able to make much of a mark in sweden , but leverkusen 's gonzalo castro , stuttgart 's sami khedira and schalke goalkeeper manuel neuer have performed well .
and the star of the show has been mesut oezil , who normally plays on the wing for his club bremen but who has shone in a striker role for hrubesch , setting up both of goals in germany 's 2-nil win over finland in the group stage .
and the breakthrough player of the squad is defender jerome boateng .
boateng usually serves as right back and has struggled to keep a position in the starting line-up for his club hamburg .
but he 's drawn high marks in all his matches for the young germans playing as a central defender - a role for which hamburg might consider him when he returns from sweden .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : castro is part of germany 's multi-cultural squad those names point to an unmistakable trend within the german national team - the growing prominence of players who were born outside germany or who come from an immigrant background .
klose , podolski , both polish born , have established themselves as mainstays in germany adult national team - and they 've recently been joined by piotr trochowski .
in the u21 , eight of the current 24 members of the squad come from multi-national backgrounds .
so if germany continues the tradition of integrating younger players quickly into the main men 's team , some of hrubesch 's charges could play a role at the 2010 world cup in south africa .

the decision was announced friday at the world heritage committee 's annual meeting in seville , spain . germany and the netherlands registered the wadden sea , a tidal wetlands area on their northern coasts , as a contender for the unesco world heritage title at the beginning of 2008 . friday 's announcement makes the nature reserve the first one in germany to be awarded the status .
recently , the wadden sea has been under threat due to the constant flow of shipping traffic and plans for oil and gas drilling .
there is also concern about the effect climate change could have on the area .
visited by thousands of tourists every year , the wadden sea spans more than 10,000 kilometers and borders three countries in total : the netherlands , germany , and denmark .
visitors flock there year-round to enjoy the endless expanse of shallow mud flats , caught between land and sea , and its diverse wildlife .
under protection in 1985 , germany officially declared the wadden sea tidal flats a nature reserve and national park .
parts of it have also been protected under national park status in the netherlands .
environmentalists fear for the wadden sea 's future though as plans to deepen the elbe river , which borders the wadden sea , to accomodate ships en route to the hamburg harbor could have a damaging effect on the nature reserve .
many different species make their home there , including seals , and an estimated 1.5 million birds descend on the wadden sea for food during migratory seasons .

" turkey can not accept the position of germany and france .
a privileged partnership does n't exist in -lrb- european law -rrb- , " erdogan told journalists before attending a forum in brussels , adding that turkey 's goal is full membership and any alternative " is out of the question . "
erdogan said french president nicolas sarkozy had been inconsistent , showing more openness to turkey 's accession in private talks than in public .
" our european friends unfortunately have a unilateral expectation which is rather populist and it saddens us .
i hope we will overcome this , " he said .
ankara launches diplomatic drive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan , left , faces an uphill battle on turkey 's eu entry bid turkey has mounted a diplomatic offensive aimed at boosting its chances of joining the eu , with erdogan visiting brussels twice in the span of three months .
in addition , his foreign minister , ahmet devutoglu , was also in brussels on friday to meet the eu enlargement commissioner , olli rehn , ahead of an accession conference planned for next week .
turkey 's membership was also a campaign issue in this month 's european parliament election , with some right-wing parties making gains after opposing its accession .
" some narrow-minded politicians have used turkey as election material , and we believe this to be very wrong and very populist , " erdogan said .
" we will never give up .
we are patient , we do our homework ... and we continue moving forward . "
changing the constitution erdogan 's comments come just a day after he had told journalists that plans to change the turkish constitution , key to keeping turkey 's bid for eu membership on track , are a " waste of time " as long as opposition parties keep blocking all efforts in parliament . erdogan 's comments were the clearest sign yet that his government could ditch its long standing goal of joining the 27-nation bloc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most europeans oppose turkey 's entry bid because it is a moslem country , poor , and situated mostly in asia erdogan promised after march local elections to renew efforts to revamp the 1982 constitution , drawn up under military rule , which would go a long way towards removing one of the major obstacles in ankara 's eu path . " all parties should be involved in efforts to reform the constitution , but the main opposition party rejects and blocks all efforts .
so as long as we are faced with such an approach these efforts are nothing but a waste of time .
we will have to continue with the present constitution , " erdogan said . sweden supports turkey 's eu bid the eu wants turkey to speed up political and economic reforms , including the removal of curbs on free speech , ensuring more rights for minorities and reducing the influence of the armed forces in government affairs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president sarkozy and german chancellor merkel are vocal opponents of full eu membership for turkey any sign that turkey is throwing in the towel could spell serious trouble for its membership bid and even have negative consequences for the country 's political and economic stability , analysts say .
" we are getting very close to crunch time , " said amanda akcakoca , a specialist on the issue at the european policy center in brussels .
" turkey needs to think out of the box and do something unexpected to impress europe . "
ankara ’ s bid for eu membership does , however , have the support of sweden , which takes over the six-month eu presidency on july 1 .
swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt has said his country will try its best to open a new chapter of european union membership negotiations with turkey when it takes over the rotating eu presidency next week . reinfeldt told the associated press news agency that such negotiations would be of " utmost strategic importance for europe " and pointed out the european union had promised it would negotiate with turkey .
cyprus question the process has also been slowed by ankara 's refusal to recognize eu member cyprus .
on thursday , european commission president jose manuel barroso said cypriots should seize a “ historic chance ” to reunite the mediterranean island .
" there is a unique chance this year to bring an end to this long-running conflict on european soil , " barroso told journalists .
" this chance must be taken . " cyprus was divided in a turkish invasion in 1974 after a brief greek-inspired coup .
turkey 's entry to the european union partly hinges on a peace deal in cyprus , whose greek cypriots represent the island in the bloc .
the eu unanimously began accession talks with turkey in 2005 , but since then , negotiations have slowed to a crawl with the bloc deeply divided about accepting turkey .
adding to the sense of limbo , so far only 10 of the 35 policy areas that candidates must complete have been opened , and eight of these have been frozen over the cyprus dispute. nrt / mrm / afp / ap / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 26.06.2009 cologne therapy center helps torture victims get their lives back großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : torture is carried out in prisons and detention centers in many countries june 26 is the un international day in support of victims of torture .
torture victims carry the burden of their experiences forever , but one therapy center in cologne seeks to make living with the memories bearable . petek t. * has been a patient at the cologne therapy center for torture victims for two years now , but the memories of her torture during her imprisonment in turkey are still very vivid .
her biggest wish is for something that many people take for granted : sleep .
" during the day , i can distract myself , " she said .
" but at night , i have problems sleeping , and nightmares .
the traumatic experiences always come back . "
petek , now 38 , was 18 when she began her university studies in her hometown of izmir in western turkey .
she wanted to become a journalist , and wrote articles for student organizations criticizing an increase of repression and the authoritarian approach of the turkish government .
she was sent to jail three times for her writing after being convicted or being a member in a forbidden organization .
her most recent imprisonment was from 1994-2002 , but even seven years later , it churns up too many memories for her to talk about .
since her time in a turkish prison , the situation of prisoners there has improved somewhat , she said , but people are still being tortured .
" people are still dying in prison under unclear circumstances , but the government denies that there is systematic torture going on in turkey , " said petek .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in some places , phsychological torture has replaced traditional methods waiting list for torture therapy the cologne therapy center for torture victims was founded in 1985 as a pilot project by the un high commissioner of refugees , and is run as a charitable organization .
uenal hamidye is petek 's therapist at the therapy center , and is familiar with many cases that are similar to hers .
hamidye said torture methods are becoming increasingly psychological , and often leave behind no physical marks .
" for example , someone might come and say ' if you do n't talk , we 're going to get your wife and rape her , " ' she said .
" the people are faced with a dilemma : either they betray their organization or they have to watch as their wives , mothers , or sisters are raped . "
petek is one of many former torture victims who come to the therapy center for help .
the demand on the center 's services is so high that there is often a waiting list .
when she first arrived in germany with her husband in 2004 , petek was told she 'd have to wait one to two years to be admitted .
" a psychological crisis does n't wait , " said petek .
" i saw no more point in my life anymore .
but i had a breakdown and was brought to the clinic where the doctors put me in contact with -lrb- hamidye -rrb- .
that 's why i 'm here , and i 'm very happy about that . "
the therapy center treats between 600 and 800 torture victims each year .
the center offers individual and group therapy sessions , and also gives help in dealing with day to day life , including learning german or completing administrative tasks connected with moving to a different country .
no ' getting back to normal ' for torture victims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un human rights commissioner navanethem pillay has called for the prohibition of torture brigitte brand-wilhelmy , director of the therapy center , said that most of the current patients come from iran , iraq , certain african nations , and particularly from former yugoslavia . " we have women here who lost their entire families in massacres , " brand-wilhelmy said .
" they watched as their siblings and parents were murdered .
we hear stories where it is hard to imagine how people can do such things to one another . "
it takes a lot of time for torture victims to recover from their experiences , and petek is still working through the effects of what was done to her .
it 's not just nightmares , either .
her therapist has told her she is suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder .
she has concentration problems and can not work , which makes it difficult to fully embrace her new home in germany .
" every day is a struggle , " petek said .
" my husband and i do n't have family or friends here , we only have each other .
because of the effects of the torture , it is hard to learn new things ; at the moment , learning german is taking quite a while .
we 'd love to get adjusted to living in germany , but it 's difficult . " * her last name has been withheld for privacy reasons .

torture victims carry the burden of their experiences forever , but one therapy center in cologne seeks to make living with the memories bearable . petek t. * has been a patient at the cologne therapy center for torture victims for two years now , but the memories of her torture during her imprisonment in turkey are still very vivid .
her biggest wish is for something that many people take for granted : sleep .
" during the day , i can distract myself , " she said .
" but at night , i have problems sleeping , and nightmares .
the traumatic experiences always come back . "
petek , now 38 , was 18 when she began her university studies in her hometown of izmir in western turkey .
she wanted to become a journalist , and wrote articles for student organizations criticizing an increase of repression and the authoritarian approach of the turkish government .
she was sent to jail three times for her writing after being convicted or being a member in a forbidden organization .
her most recent imprisonment was from 1994-2002 , but even seven years later , it churns up too many memories for her to talk about .

the decision was announced friday at the world heritage committee 's annual meeting in seville , spain . germany and the netherlands registered the wadden sea , a tidal wetlands area on their northern coasts , as a contender for the unesco world heritage title at the beginning of 2008 . friday 's announcement makes the nature reserve the first one in germany to be awarded the status .
recently , the wadden sea has been under threat due to the constant flow of shipping traffic and plans for oil and gas drilling .
there is also concern about the effect climate change could have on the area .
visited by thousands of tourists every year , the wadden sea spans more than 10,000 kilometers and borders three countries in total : the netherlands , germany , and denmark .
visitors flock there year-round to enjoy the endless expanse of shallow mud flats , caught between land and sea , and its diverse wildlife .
under protection in 1985 , germany officially declared the wadden sea tidal flats a nature reserve and national park .
parts of it have also been protected under national park status in the netherlands .
environmentalists fear for the wadden sea 's future though as plans to deepen the elbe river , which borders the wadden sea , to accomodate ships en route to the hamburg harbor could have a damaging effect on the nature reserve .
many different species make their home there , including seals , and an estimated 1.5 million birds descend on the wadden sea for food during migratory seasons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wadden sea is home to many different species there has also been concern about the oil and gas drilling platforms planted in the middle of the park . in the german state of schleswig-holstein , it is legal to drill for oil in national parks , however , it goes against the rules of the unesco world heritage committee .
in order to get around a potential barrier to receiving the title , germany and the netherlands cut out the sections of the park used for drilling in their application . there are also long-term concerns about the effect climate change will have on the wetlands , as rising sea levels could cause the area to slowly erode over time .
a unesco world heritage title is the highest honor yet for the wadden sea and advocates say it will help to ensure its conservation . germany boasts a long list of unesco world heritage sites in addition to the wadden sea , including the hanseatic city of lübeck , the cologne cathedral , and the messel pit , one of the world 's most improtant sites for fossils . the unesco world heritage committee will announce their final decision on all new entries by the end of the conference on june 30th. vj dpa / afp / kna editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

jackson sold over 750 million albums in his sometimes controversial career . the 50 year-old " king of pop " was rushed to the nearby ucla medical center , and county coroner fred corral said he was unresponsive and pronounced dead soon after .
medical officers are now conducting an autopsy to check for toxicology or other problems - with results set to be published later on friday . fans the world over mourned the pop star as word of his death spread quickly . " michael jackson was weightless - a moonwalker , a transformer , a werewolf , he was n't of this world , " wrote the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung friday .
" as long as he had a handle on his weightlessness and could play with it , it was his biggest capital .

as an adult , jackson moved on to a successful - and often controversial - solo career .
this career peaked with his 1982 record " thriller , " which is the best selling album of all time . in later life jackson struggled with a series of court cases and allegations about his private life , damaging his career and his financial situation , but he remained a popular character with an enormous fan base . the german newsmagazine spiegel online wrote that jackson had two faces : one was " the monster , more alien than human , lifted , pale and in the end as emaciated as a skeleton . " on the other hand , there was " the genius that reinvented pop , sold more albums than anyone else -lrb- … -rrb- and was admired by the masses - in particular by his musical heirs , who never would have existed without his influence and who are now mourning his passing with an unequalled flood of condolence : beyonce , usher , justin timberlake , to name three of many . " at the time of his death he had been preparing for a 50-concert run in london that was meant to rejuvenate his career , and secure his financial future . " a comeback has seldom been as necessary as it was in jackson 's case , " wrote the sueddeutsche . though it 's now too late for a comeback , the troubled pop icon leaves behind a generation that has at some point tried to moonwalk and a legacy of young musicians - like beyonce and timberlake - who are carrying on in his footsteps . bildunterschrift : michael jackson in 1971 , 1977 and 1979 -lrb- from left -rrb- bildunterschrift : michael jackson 1983 , 1987 and 1990 -lrb- from left -rrb- kjb / msh , ap / dpa / afp editor : darren mara send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" turkey can not accept the position of germany and france .
a privileged partnership does n't exist in -lrb- european law -rrb- , " erdogan told journalists before attending a forum in brussels , adding that turkey 's goal is full membership and any alternative " is out of the question . "
erdogan said french president nicolas sarkozy had been inconsistent , showing more openness to turkey 's accession in private talks than in public .
" our european friends unfortunately have a unilateral expectation which is rather populist and it saddens us .
i hope we will overcome this , " he said .
ankara launches diplomatic drive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan , left , faces an uphill battle on turkey 's eu entry bid turkey has mounted a diplomatic offensive aimed at boosting its chances of joining the eu , with erdogan visiting brussels twice in the span of three months .
in addition , his foreign minister , ahmet devutoglu , was also in brussels on friday to meet the eu enlargement commissioner , olli rehn , ahead of an accession conference planned for next week .
turkey 's membership was also a campaign issue in this month 's european parliament election , with some right-wing parties making gains after opposing its accession .
" some narrow-minded politicians have used turkey as election material , and we believe this to be very wrong and very populist , " erdogan said .
" we will never give up .
we are patient , we do our homework ... and we continue moving forward . "
changing the constitution erdogan 's comments come just a day after he had told journalists that plans to change the turkish constitution , key to keeping turkey 's bid for eu membership on track , are a " waste of time " as long as opposition parties keep blocking all efforts in parliament . erdogan 's comments were the clearest sign yet that his government could ditch its long standing goal of joining the 27-nation bloc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most europeans oppose turkey 's entry bid because it is a moslem country , poor , and situated mostly in asia erdogan promised after march local elections to renew efforts to revamp the 1982 constitution , drawn up under military rule , which would go a long way towards removing one of the major obstacles in ankara 's eu path . " all parties should be involved in efforts to reform the constitution , but the main opposition party rejects and blocks all efforts .
so as long as we are faced with such an approach these efforts are nothing but a waste of time .
we will have to continue with the present constitution , " erdogan said . sweden supports turkey 's eu bid the eu wants turkey to speed up political and economic reforms , including the removal of curbs on free speech , ensuring more rights for minorities and reducing the influence of the armed forces in government affairs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president sarkozy and german chancellor merkel are vocal opponents of full eu membership for turkey any sign that turkey is throwing in the towel could spell serious trouble for its membership bid and even have negative consequences for the country 's political and economic stability , analysts say .
" we are getting very close to crunch time , " said amanda akcakoca , a specialist on the issue at the european policy center in brussels .
" turkey needs to think out of the box and do something unexpected to impress europe . "
ankara ’ s bid for eu membership does , however , have the support of sweden , which takes over the six-month eu presidency on july 1 .
swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt has said his country will try its best to open a new chapter of european union membership negotiations with turkey when it takes over the rotating eu presidency next week . reinfeldt told the associated press news agency that such negotiations would be of " utmost strategic importance for europe " and pointed out the european union had promised it would negotiate with turkey .
cyprus question the process has also been slowed by ankara 's refusal to recognize eu member cyprus .
on thursday , european commission president jose manuel barroso said cypriots should seize a “ historic chance ” to reunite the mediterranean island .
" there is a unique chance this year to bring an end to this long-running conflict on european soil , " barroso told journalists .
" this chance must be taken . " cyprus was divided in a turkish invasion in 1974 after a brief greek-inspired coup .
turkey 's entry to the european union partly hinges on a peace deal in cyprus , whose greek cypriots represent the island in the bloc .
the eu unanimously began accession talks with turkey in 2005 , but since then , negotiations have slowed to a crawl with the bloc deeply divided about accepting turkey .
adding to the sense of limbo , so far only 10 of the 35 policy areas that candidates must complete have been opened , and eight of these have been frozen over the cyprus dispute. nrt / mrm / afp / ap / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 3,300-kilometer -lrb- 2,000-mile -rrb- nabucco pipeline is a key energy project which will bring gas from the caspian sea to austria via turkey , bulgaria , romania and hungary .
the nabucco pipeline has been given a high priority in eu energy policy , however differences between the countries has stalled the project .
according to manager magazin , fischer 's most important job will be to keep turkey happy .
" fischer is highly regarded in turkey because he was always open to it joining the eu , " according to the article .
the pipeline 's main goal - and greatest hurdle - is to bypass russia , in a bid to reduce europe 's energy dependence on moscow .
currently , the eu gets about one-third of its energy from russia , through transit countries belarus and ukraine .
nabucco has therefore been a hot political topic between the eu and russia , with moscow doing everything it can to torpedo the process .

they are supported in their efforts by joschka fischer 's former boss and political ally , ex-chancellor gerhard schroeder .
just after he left office in 2005 , schroeder signed a lucrative deal with russian state-run energy giant gazprom to head the advisory board for the company 's nord stream pipeline project .
while still in office , schroeder signed the agreement to build the pipeline with his close friend vladimir putin , the current russian prime minister .
last january , schroeder also joined the board of british-russian oil firm tnk-bp .
fischer and schroeder were the leading two politicians in the seven year social democrat / green coalition government .
fischer withdrew from politics after the greens failed to win enough votes to remain in government in the 2005 elections .

the 3,300-kilometer -lrb- 2,000-mile -rrb- nabucco pipeline is a key energy project which will bring gas from the caspian sea to austria via turkey , bulgaria , romania and hungary .
the nabucco pipeline has been given a high priority in eu energy policy , however differences between the countries has stalled the project .
according to manager magazin , fischer 's most important job will be to keep turkey happy .
" fischer is highly regarded in turkey because he was always open to it joining the eu , " according to the article .
the pipeline 's main goal - and greatest hurdle - is to bypass russia , in a bid to reduce europe 's energy dependence on moscow .
currently , the eu gets about one-third of its energy from russia , through transit countries belarus and ukraine .
nabucco has therefore been a hot political topic between the eu and russia , with moscow doing everything it can to torpedo the process .
high-profile lobbying bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder works for russia 's competing nord stream project the russians , for their part , have been pushing for the nord stream pipeline through the north sea .
they are supported in their efforts by joschka fischer 's former boss and political ally , ex-chancellor gerhard schroeder .
just after he left office in 2005 , schroeder signed a lucrative deal with russian state-run energy giant gazprom to head the advisory board for the company 's nord stream pipeline project .
while still in office , schroeder signed the agreement to build the pipeline with his close friend vladimir putin , the current russian prime minister .
last january , schroeder also joined the board of british-russian oil firm tnk-bp .
fischer and schroeder were the leading two politicians in the seven year social democrat / green coalition government .
fischer withdrew from politics after the greens failed to win enough votes to remain in government in the 2005 elections .
since then , he has lived in the united states , working as a lecturer at princeton university. kj / afp / dpa editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we have tried our very best and we do n't move , " said the european union agriculture commissioner mariann fischer boel .
" we went to the absolute limit of what was acceptable to the agricultural community .
we wo n't go any further , " echoed french farm minister bruno le maire .
agriculture is one of the most contentious topics at the doha round of the wto talks , which was launched in the gulf state of qatar in 2001 .
rich countries , like the european union and the united states , support their farmers with subsidies , in order for the farmers to be able to make a decent profit from their products .
developing countries like india , china and other smaller countries in africa , asia and south america often produce the same agricultural products .
they can also sell them for less , because it costs them less to produce it .
for example , a farmer in bavaria makes much more than a farmer in hunan province in china .
so , in order for bavarian agricultural products to compete with chinese products , the german government pays the bavarian farmer a certain amount of money so that when the german product is on the shelf in the eu , it costs the same as the chinese product .
it can also restrict the amount of a similar product that the chinese can sell in germany , called quotas , or charge tariffs on those products .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internationals -pipe- 26.06.2009 under 21s provide a mixed picture of germany 's footballing future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these young men are trying to become the most successful german u21 team ever the 2009 u21 european championships are being touted as a chance to see tomorrow 's stars today .
but in germany 's case , the real stars do n't stick with the team very long .
dw 's jefferson chase explains . when the young german eleven beat italy 1-0 in the semifinals of the event on friday , june 26 , they moved a step closer to making history .
germany may be a soccer powerhouse , but the record of the u21 national team is anything but stellar .
incredibly enough , they 've never won a major tournament - a blot that coach horst hrubesch currently wants to rectify in sweden .
still , after needing a nervy draw against england to qualify for the knock-out stage , hrubesch is n't exactly jumping for joy .
" the only thing i 'm happy about is making the semis , " the coach told dpa news agency after the england match .
" i 'm not at all satisfied with how we did it - it was way below our ambitions . "
with the german u17 and u19 teams having won their european titles , this could be the year for germany 's youth teams .
but would it signal a glorious future ahead for the adult german national team ?
probably not .
here today , gone tomorrow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year , before taking his current job , hrubesch won europe with the u19 germany 's footballing reputation is one of solidity and consistency rather than mercurial brilliance so you might expect the national soccer association , the dfb , to bring up players gradually through the various levels .
but the opposite is the case .
goalkeeping legend oliver kahn and super striker miroslav klose never played in the youth ranks , going straight into the main national team .
and while most of the current national squad did take the pitch for the u21s , very few of the real stars - michael ballack , bastian schweinsteiger or lukas podolski , for example - made more than a handful of appearances , before being promoted up to the big league .
the uefa u21 championship has only been in existence in its current form since 1978 , and it took some time for germany to take them seriously .
even into the 1990s the dfb eleven were playing with a sweeper .
as a result , germany have always gone home empty handed while italy have won europe five times , and even england - never a national side known for tournament successes - have hoisted the trophy twice .
ones to watch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany are glad oezil , r , choose to play for them instead of turkey given the german u21s ' history , the players most likely to play roles in the top squad are those who have already been called up by national coach joachim loew .
diminutive forward marko marin has n't been able to make much of a mark in sweden , but leverkusen 's gonzalo castro , stuttgart 's sami khedira and schalke goalkeeper manuel neuer have performed well .
and the star of the show has been mesut oezil , who normally plays on the wing for his club bremen but who has shone in a striker role for hrubesch , setting up both of goals in germany 's 2-nil win over finland in the group stage .
and the breakthrough player of the squad is defender jerome boateng .
boateng usually serves as right back and has struggled to keep a position in the starting line-up for his club hamburg .
but he 's drawn high marks in all his matches for the young germans playing as a central defender - a role for which hamburg might consider him when he returns from sweden .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : castro is part of germany 's multi-cultural squad those names point to an unmistakable trend within the german national team - the growing prominence of players who were born outside germany or who come from an immigrant background .
klose , podolski , both polish born , have established themselves as mainstays in germany adult national team - and they 've recently been joined by piotr trochowski .
in the u21 , eight of the current 24 members of the squad come from multi-national backgrounds .
so if germany continues the tradition of integrating younger players quickly into the main men 's team , some of hrubesch 's charges could play a role at the 2010 world cup in south africa .

but in germany 's case , the real stars do n't stick with the team very long .
dw 's jefferson chase explains . when the young german eleven beat italy 1-0 in the semifinals of the event on friday , june 26 , they moved a step closer to making history .
germany may be a soccer powerhouse , but the record of the u21 national team is anything but stellar .
incredibly enough , they 've never won a major tournament - a blot that coach horst hrubesch currently wants to rectify in sweden .
still , after needing a nervy draw against england to qualify for the knock-out stage , hrubesch is n't exactly jumping for joy .
" the only thing i 'm happy about is making the semis , " the coach told dpa news agency after the england match .
" i 'm not at all satisfied with how we did it - it was way below our ambitions . "
with the german u17 and u19 teams having won their european titles , this could be the year for germany 's youth teams .
but would it signal a glorious future ahead for the adult german national team ?
probably not .
here today , gone tomorrow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year , before taking his current job , hrubesch won europe with the u19 germany 's footballing reputation is one of solidity and consistency rather than mercurial brilliance so you might expect the national soccer association , the dfb , to bring up players gradually through the various levels .
but the opposite is the case .
goalkeeping legend oliver kahn and super striker miroslav klose never played in the youth ranks , going straight into the main national team .
and while most of the current national squad did take the pitch for the u21s , very few of the real stars - michael ballack , bastian schweinsteiger or lukas podolski , for example - made more than a handful of appearances , before being promoted up to the big league .
the uefa u21 championship has only been in existence in its current form since 1978 , and it took some time for germany to take them seriously .
even into the 1990s the dfb eleven were playing with a sweeper .
as a result , germany have always gone home empty handed while italy have won europe five times , and even england - never a national side known for tournament successes - have hoisted the trophy twice .
ones to watch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany are glad oezil , r , choose to play for them instead of turkey given the german u21s ' history , the players most likely to play roles in the top squad are those who have already been called up by national coach joachim loew .
diminutive forward marko marin has n't been able to make much of a mark in sweden , but leverkusen 's gonzalo castro , stuttgart 's sami khedira and schalke goalkeeper manuel neuer have performed well .
and the star of the show has been mesut oezil , who normally plays on the wing for his club bremen but who has shone in a striker role for hrubesch , setting up both of goals in germany 's 2-nil win over finland in the group stage .
and the breakthrough player of the squad is defender jerome boateng .
boateng usually serves as right back and has struggled to keep a position in the starting line-up for his club hamburg .
but he 's drawn high marks in all his matches for the young germans playing as a central defender - a role for which hamburg might consider him when he returns from sweden .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : castro is part of germany 's multi-cultural squad those names point to an unmistakable trend within the german national team - the growing prominence of players who were born outside germany or who come from an immigrant background .
klose , podolski , both polish born , have established themselves as mainstays in germany adult national team - and they 've recently been joined by piotr trochowski .
in the u21 , eight of the current 24 members of the squad come from multi-national backgrounds .
so if germany continues the tradition of integrating younger players quickly into the main men 's team , some of hrubesch 's charges could play a role at the 2010 world cup in south africa .

the 3,300-kilometer -lrb- 2,000-mile -rrb- nabucco pipeline is a key energy project which will bring gas from the caspian sea to austria via turkey , bulgaria , romania and hungary .
the nabucco pipeline has been given a high priority in eu energy policy , however differences between the countries has stalled the project .
according to manager magazin , fischer 's most important job will be to keep turkey happy .
" fischer is highly regarded in turkey because he was always open to it joining the eu , " according to the article .
the pipeline 's main goal - and greatest hurdle - is to bypass russia , in a bid to reduce europe 's energy dependence on moscow .
currently , the eu gets about one-third of its energy from russia , through transit countries belarus and ukraine .
nabucco has therefore been a hot political topic between the eu and russia , with moscow doing everything it can to torpedo the process .
high-profile lobbying bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder works for russia 's competing nord stream project the russians , for their part , have been pushing for the nord stream pipeline through the north sea .
they are supported in their efforts by joschka fischer 's former boss and political ally , ex-chancellor gerhard schroeder .
just after he left office in 2005 , schroeder signed a lucrative deal with russian state-run energy giant gazprom to head the advisory board for the company 's nord stream pipeline project .
while still in office , schroeder signed the agreement to build the pipeline with his close friend vladimir putin , the current russian prime minister .
last january , schroeder also joined the board of british-russian oil firm tnk-bp .
fischer and schroeder were the leading two politicians in the seven year social democrat / green coalition government .
fischer withdrew from politics after the greens failed to win enough votes to remain in government in the 2005 elections .
since then , he has lived in the united states , working as a lecturer at princeton university. kj / afp / dpa editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 26.06.2009 there 's no time to lose in combatting desertification , says expert großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huge areas of arable land are lost every year due to soil degradation increasing desertification leads to huge losses of arable land .
guest commentator susanne neubert says that we have a global responsibility to counter soil degradation and there 's no time to lose . some 70 percent of the world 's arid regions face desertification , and in around 110 countries - most of them poor - desertification threatens an area roughly the size of europe . twenty million tons of grain are lost annually due to desertification and , over the past 40 years , one third of the world 's arable land has been abandoned . even though there is no doubt about the causes of desertification , and the strategies needed to combat it are known , no turnaround is yet in sight .
why is it that neither the un desertification convention nor countless initiatives and programs have managed to halt the ongoing process of desertification ? unsustainable land management bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in many regions water for irrigation is not readily available the principal factors behind desertification are unsustainable land management and climate change .
as far as land management is concerned , incorrect farming practices also play a major role .
these include the cultivation of annual crop species , coupled with management methods that intermittently leave soils uncovered and exposed to erosion . other aspects of " incorrect " farming practices include faulty irrigation and either a total lack of fertilization or lopsided use of mineral fertilisers .
this often leads to soil mineralization , particularly in tropical regions , depriving soils of their capacity to store water .
carbon compounds , previously fixed in the soil in the form of organic matter , are released into the air in the course of the mineralization process .
this reduces the soil 's buffering capacity for drought and flooding , at the same time directly contributing to climate change . a good number of resource problems are closely interlinked : together , deforestation , species loss , climate change , growing scarcity of water resources , and the loss of organic matter in soils are responsible for desertification ; they are both its cause and effect . does this mean that we have no choice but to capitulate ?
no .
what it means is that by developing and using intelligent approaches we can achieve several goals at once .
soil conservation techniques , including erosion control walls , agro-forestry , and organic fertilization , are methods that are both effective and widely known - and these need to be applied on a larger scale . the reason why the picture continues to be dominated by individual measures is not technical in nature , indeed this must be seen as a problem bound up with economic incentives and political interests . incentives to support farmers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protecting trees can counter soil degradation since agriculture is organized primarily along private lines , soil conservation measures need to be carried out mainly by the private sector .
it is essential that incentives be set to ensure that investments in farmland yield returns , and the relatively high prices currently commanded by agricultural goods offer a good opportunity . there is considerable evidence that farmers carry out soil protection measures on their own if they lack more profitable alternatives and if the know-how and cost viability are available .
there is no lack of instructive examples , and german development cooperation offers a good number of them .
it is high time to start providing farmers in desertification-prone regions with appropriate advisory services as well as with the funds they need to transport stones to build erosion control walls , etc . , and to do so not intermittently but as a general rule . however , both agro-industry and institutional conditions also need to be modernized .
one correct and promising approach would be to encourage the agrochemical industry to gear production more to soil substrate additives . moreover , the agricultural policies of developing countries urgently need to be reoriented to reduce the fertilizer subsidies so widespread today and instead to increase the credit available in the agricultural sector .
and land rights need to be modified in such a way as to ensure that farmers have incentives to undertake soil conservation measures . no time to lose bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : modernizing the agro industry is vital in coutering the impact of climate change instead of continuing to generate vast amounts of greenhouse gases by producing and using mineral fertilizers incapable of achieving the hoped-for results on degraded soils , it would make far more sense to engage in organic agriculture keyed chiefly to on-farm resources .
this could serve to enhance soil storage capacity and - in cases where the needed organic matter is unavailable - to regenerate it by using industrially produced soil substrates .
land management of this kind tends to raise yields per unit area to earlier levels , and to do so precisely in arid regions . but is also essential to protect land at the supra-farm level , on state-owned land .
this , though , calls for a huge supply of labor .
in keeping with a proposal advanced by the united nations environment program -lrb- unep -rrb- , a " global green new deal " could be used to realize the action plans adopted to implement the un desertification convention , and in times of recession this would at the same time amount to an effective labor market policy . this should also include large-scale projects - like the building of " green walls " in china and the sahel belt - and efforts to link them with the numerous individual participatory measures already in progress , in order to achieve synergy effects . it would be important to implement measures geared at once to conservation and re-cultivation in order to come up with comprehensive measures that serve to reach several goals at the same time : protection of forests , water , climate , and soils .
this is a realistic aim in that the different organizational phases involved basically tend to correlate positively with one another . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neubert says that desertification is partly reversible how much time do we have left ?
the good news is that in many cases desertification is reversible .
the bad new is that this goes hand in hand with declining marginal utility , and when a certain stage of degradation has been reached , re-cultivation proves so labor-intensive that it is more attractive for the population to migrate to urban areas .
in other words , we have no time to lose .
this is not a question of " aid " but of global responsibility . author : dr.susanne neubert / -lrb- ara -rrb- editor : kate bowen dr. susanne neubert is a senior researcher at the german development institute -lrb- deutsches institut für entwicklungspolitik - die -rrb- , which is a multi-disciplinary think-tank for german and multilateral development policy .

guest commentator susanne neubert says that we have a global responsibility to counter soil degradation and there 's no time to lose . some 70 percent of the world 's arid regions face desertification , and in around 110 countries - most of them poor - desertification threatens an area roughly the size of europe . twenty million tons of grain are lost annually due to desertification and , over the past 40 years , one third of the world 's arable land has been abandoned . even though there is no doubt about the causes of desertification , and the strategies needed to combat it are known , no turnaround is yet in sight .
why is it that neither the un desertification convention nor countless initiatives and programs have managed to halt the ongoing process of desertification ? unsustainable land management bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in many regions water for irrigation is not readily available the principal factors behind desertification are unsustainable land management and climate change .
as far as land management is concerned , incorrect farming practices also play a major role .
these include the cultivation of annual crop species , coupled with management methods that intermittently leave soils uncovered and exposed to erosion . other aspects of " incorrect " farming practices include faulty irrigation and either a total lack of fertilization or lopsided use of mineral fertilisers .
this often leads to soil mineralization , particularly in tropical regions , depriving soils of their capacity to store water .
carbon compounds , previously fixed in the soil in the form of organic matter , are released into the air in the course of the mineralization process .
this reduces the soil 's buffering capacity for drought and flooding , at the same time directly contributing to climate change . a good number of resource problems are closely interlinked : together , deforestation , species loss , climate change , growing scarcity of water resources , and the loss of organic matter in soils are responsible for desertification ; they are both its cause and effect . does this mean that we have no choice but to capitulate ?
no .
what it means is that by developing and using intelligent approaches we can achieve several goals at once .
soil conservation techniques , including erosion control walls , agro-forestry , and organic fertilization , are methods that are both effective and widely known - and these need to be applied on a larger scale . the reason why the picture continues to be dominated by individual measures is not technical in nature , indeed this must be seen as a problem bound up with economic incentives and political interests . incentives to support farmers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protecting trees can counter soil degradation since agriculture is organized primarily along private lines , soil conservation measures need to be carried out mainly by the private sector .
it is essential that incentives be set to ensure that investments in farmland yield returns , and the relatively high prices currently commanded by agricultural goods offer a good opportunity . there is considerable evidence that farmers carry out soil protection measures on their own if they lack more profitable alternatives and if the know-how and cost viability are available .
there is no lack of instructive examples , and german development cooperation offers a good number of them .
it is high time to start providing farmers in desertification-prone regions with appropriate advisory services as well as with the funds they need to transport stones to build erosion control walls , etc . , and to do so not intermittently but as a general rule . however , both agro-industry and institutional conditions also need to be modernized .
one correct and promising approach would be to encourage the agrochemical industry to gear production more to soil substrate additives . moreover , the agricultural policies of developing countries urgently need to be reoriented to reduce the fertilizer subsidies so widespread today and instead to increase the credit available in the agricultural sector .
and land rights need to be modified in such a way as to ensure that farmers have incentives to undertake soil conservation measures . no time to lose bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : modernizing the agro industry is vital in coutering the impact of climate change instead of continuing to generate vast amounts of greenhouse gases by producing and using mineral fertilizers incapable of achieving the hoped-for results on degraded soils , it would make far more sense to engage in organic agriculture keyed chiefly to on-farm resources .
this could serve to enhance soil storage capacity and - in cases where the needed organic matter is unavailable - to regenerate it by using industrially produced soil substrates .
land management of this kind tends to raise yields per unit area to earlier levels , and to do so precisely in arid regions . but is also essential to protect land at the supra-farm level , on state-owned land .
this , though , calls for a huge supply of labor .
in keeping with a proposal advanced by the united nations environment program -lrb- unep -rrb- , a " global green new deal " could be used to realize the action plans adopted to implement the un desertification convention , and in times of recession this would at the same time amount to an effective labor market policy . this should also include large-scale projects - like the building of " green walls " in china and the sahel belt - and efforts to link them with the numerous individual participatory measures already in progress , in order to achieve synergy effects . it would be important to implement measures geared at once to conservation and re-cultivation in order to come up with comprehensive measures that serve to reach several goals at the same time : protection of forests , water , climate , and soils .
this is a realistic aim in that the different organizational phases involved basically tend to correlate positively with one another . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neubert says that desertification is partly reversible how much time do we have left ?
the good news is that in many cases desertification is reversible .
the bad new is that this goes hand in hand with declining marginal utility , and when a certain stage of degradation has been reached , re-cultivation proves so labor-intensive that it is more attractive for the population to migrate to urban areas .
in other words , we have no time to lose .
this is not a question of " aid " but of global responsibility . author : dr.susanne neubert / -lrb- ara -rrb- editor : kate bowen dr. susanne neubert is a senior researcher at the german development institute -lrb- deutsches institut für entwicklungspolitik - die -rrb- , which is a multi-disciplinary think-tank for german and multilateral development policy .

the 3,300-kilometer -lrb- 2,000-mile -rrb- nabucco pipeline is a key energy project which will bring gas from the caspian sea to austria via turkey , bulgaria , romania and hungary .
the nabucco pipeline has been given a high priority in eu energy policy , however differences between the countries has stalled the project .
according to manager magazin , fischer 's most important job will be to keep turkey happy .
" fischer is highly regarded in turkey because he was always open to it joining the eu , " according to the article .
the pipeline 's main goal - and greatest hurdle - is to bypass russia , in a bid to reduce europe 's energy dependence on moscow .
currently , the eu gets about one-third of its energy from russia , through transit countries belarus and ukraine .
nabucco has therefore been a hot political topic between the eu and russia , with moscow doing everything it can to torpedo the process .
high-profile lobbying bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder works for russia 's competing nord stream project the russians , for their part , have been pushing for the nord stream pipeline through the north sea .
they are supported in their efforts by joschka fischer 's former boss and political ally , ex-chancellor gerhard schroeder .
just after he left office in 2005 , schroeder signed a lucrative deal with russian state-run energy giant gazprom to head the advisory board for the company 's nord stream pipeline project .
while still in office , schroeder signed the agreement to build the pipeline with his close friend vladimir putin , the current russian prime minister .
last january , schroeder also joined the board of british-russian oil firm tnk-bp .
fischer and schroeder were the leading two politicians in the seven year social democrat / green coalition government .
fischer withdrew from politics after the greens failed to win enough votes to remain in government in the 2005 elections .
since then , he has lived in the united states , working as a lecturer at princeton university. kj / afp / dpa editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

agriculture is one of the most contentious topics at the doha round of the wto talks , which was launched in the gulf state of qatar in 2001 .
rich countries , like the european union and the united states , support their farmers with subsidies , in order for the farmers to be able to make a decent profit from their products .
developing countries like india , china and other smaller countries in africa , asia and south america often produce the same agricultural products .
they can also sell them for less , because it costs them less to produce it .
for example , a farmer in bavaria makes much more than a farmer in hunan province in china .
so , in order for bavarian agricultural products to compete with chinese products , the german government pays the bavarian farmer a certain amount of money so that when the german product is on the shelf in the eu , it costs the same as the chinese product .
it can also restrict the amount of a similar product that the chinese can sell in germany , called quotas , or charge tariffs on those products .

" turkey can not accept the position of germany and france .
a privileged partnership does n't exist in -lrb- european law -rrb- , " erdogan told journalists before attending a forum in brussels , adding that turkey 's goal is full membership and any alternative " is out of the question . "
erdogan said french president nicolas sarkozy had been inconsistent , showing more openness to turkey 's accession in private talks than in public .
" our european friends unfortunately have a unilateral expectation which is rather populist and it saddens us .
i hope we will overcome this , " he said .
ankara launches diplomatic drive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan , left , faces an uphill battle on turkey 's eu entry bid turkey has mounted a diplomatic offensive aimed at boosting its chances of joining the eu , with erdogan visiting brussels twice in the span of three months .
in addition , his foreign minister , ahmet devutoglu , was also in brussels on friday to meet the eu enlargement commissioner , olli rehn , ahead of an accession conference planned for next week .
turkey 's membership was also a campaign issue in this month 's european parliament election , with some right-wing parties making gains after opposing its accession .
" some narrow-minded politicians have used turkey as election material , and we believe this to be very wrong and very populist , " erdogan said .
" we will never give up .
we are patient , we do our homework ... and we continue moving forward . "
changing the constitution erdogan 's comments come just a day after he had told journalists that plans to change the turkish constitution , key to keeping turkey 's bid for eu membership on track , are a " waste of time " as long as opposition parties keep blocking all efforts in parliament . erdogan 's comments were the clearest sign yet that his government could ditch its long standing goal of joining the 27-nation bloc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most europeans oppose turkey 's entry bid because it is a moslem country , poor , and situated mostly in asia erdogan promised after march local elections to renew efforts to revamp the 1982 constitution , drawn up under military rule , which would go a long way towards removing one of the major obstacles in ankara 's eu path . " all parties should be involved in efforts to reform the constitution , but the main opposition party rejects and blocks all efforts .
so as long as we are faced with such an approach these efforts are nothing but a waste of time .
we will have to continue with the present constitution , " erdogan said . sweden supports turkey 's eu bid the eu wants turkey to speed up political and economic reforms , including the removal of curbs on free speech , ensuring more rights for minorities and reducing the influence of the armed forces in government affairs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president sarkozy and german chancellor merkel are vocal opponents of full eu membership for turkey any sign that turkey is throwing in the towel could spell serious trouble for its membership bid and even have negative consequences for the country 's political and economic stability , analysts say .
" we are getting very close to crunch time , " said amanda akcakoca , a specialist on the issue at the european policy center in brussels .
" turkey needs to think out of the box and do something unexpected to impress europe . "
ankara ’ s bid for eu membership does , however , have the support of sweden , which takes over the six-month eu presidency on july 1 .
swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt has said his country will try its best to open a new chapter of european union membership negotiations with turkey when it takes over the rotating eu presidency next week . reinfeldt told the associated press news agency that such negotiations would be of " utmost strategic importance for europe " and pointed out the european union had promised it would negotiate with turkey .
cyprus question the process has also been slowed by ankara 's refusal to recognize eu member cyprus .
on thursday , european commission president jose manuel barroso said cypriots should seize a “ historic chance ” to reunite the mediterranean island .
" there is a unique chance this year to bring an end to this long-running conflict on european soil , " barroso told journalists .
" this chance must be taken . " cyprus was divided in a turkish invasion in 1974 after a brief greek-inspired coup .
turkey 's entry to the european union partly hinges on a peace deal in cyprus , whose greek cypriots represent the island in the bloc .
the eu unanimously began accession talks with turkey in 2005 , but since then , negotiations have slowed to a crawl with the bloc deeply divided about accepting turkey .
adding to the sense of limbo , so far only 10 of the 35 policy areas that candidates must complete have been opened , and eight of these have been frozen over the cyprus dispute. nrt / mrm / afp / ap / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

public gay pride demonstrations , known as christopher street day , are held every summer in cities around the world to commemorate the event .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amendments to the constitution are the focus of this year 's christopher street day parades klaus jetz , head of the lesbian and gay federation in germany -lrb- lsvd -rrb- , told deutsche welle that the political focus of this year 's christopher street day parades , which will begin this weekend in berlin , will be on amending article 3 of the german constitution .
" getting the anti-discrimination amendment passed has been an important topic for the organization since our founding in 1990 , " he said . " it is great that we have finally managed to rally support for this topic beyond our own community , within the political sphere . "
this week , the german parliament voted to push for a federal initiative to make additions to article 3 of the constitution , which protects citizens against discrimination based on gender , race , or religion .
they want , among other things , to add sexual orientation to that list .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's mayor klaus wowereit was one of the first politicians to publicly come out of the closet social democrat klaus wowereit , berlin 's openly homosexual mayor , spoke out in favor of the amendment .
in an interview with the german news agency dpa , wowereit said he whole-heartedly supported the initiative .
he called the laws passed to allow homosexual civil partnerships a " milestone , " but said that there was still judicial room for improvement .
same responsibilities , different rights wowereit took the lead from his party colleague , justice minister brigitte zypries .
in an interview with the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , zypries said that changing article 3 and article 6 of the constitution - which protects the institution of marriage and the family - would send " a clear signal " to society .
while german federal law gives homosexuals the right to enter a civil partnership , they do n't enjoy the same rights as heterosexual married couples when it comes to taxes , retirement , civil servant benefits , or adoption law .
zypries said that homosexual couples have the same responsibilities , but not the same rights as heterosexuals .
" i find this to be incredibly unjust , both on human and on judicial grounds , " the newspaper quoted zypries as saying .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civil unions are important for couples but do not grant the same rights as marriage taking a stand klaus jetz from the lesbian and gay federation in germany -lrb- lsvd -rrb- said that although both the european parliament and the european commission have taken a clear stance against discrimination based on sexual orientation , enshrining the same in the german constitution would have tangible advantages for the gay and lesbian community .
" homosexual couples are not able to adopt children in germany .
and ' rainbow families ' - gay and lesbian couples with biological children - do n't get the same tax breaks as heterosexual couples , " jetz said .
support in society growing article 3 of the constitution was amended for the last time in 1995 , to protect the disabled from discrimination .
at the time , there was not enough political backing to include sexual orientation to the list . but that seems to be changing .
on their web site , the lesbian and gay federation in germany lists a slew of supporters , from all walks of life - actors , politicians , even a rabbi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christopher street day is celebrated all over europe three major parties - the social democrats , the greens , and the left party - are in favor of an amendment .
but a two-thirds majority will be necessary to change the constitution and will need to include members of the conservative parties as well .
" we have to get the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- on board , " jetz said .
but the interior minister of the southern state of bavaria , joachim herrmann , has spoken out against the proposal .
the minister who belongs to the arch-conservative csu party , the sister bavarian party of the cdu , says he sees no reason to extend the constitutional protection of the family .
gay rights activists accuse the conservatives of blocking legislation that would give homosexuals more rights .
" we need the conservatives to understand that this is about protecting a minority in the population , " jetz said . " giving us more rights wo n't change anything for them . "

public gay pride demonstrations , known as christopher street day , are held every summer in cities around the world to commemorate the event .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amendments to the constitution are the focus of this year 's christopher street day parades klaus jetz , head of the lesbian and gay federation in germany -lrb- lsvd -rrb- , told deutsche welle that the political focus of this year 's christopher street day parades , which will begin this weekend in berlin , will be on amending article 3 of the german constitution .
" getting the anti-discrimination amendment passed has been an important topic for the organization since our founding in 1990 , " he said . " it is great that we have finally managed to rally support for this topic beyond our own community , within the political sphere . "
this week , the german parliament voted to push for a federal initiative to make additions to article 3 of the constitution , which protects citizens against discrimination based on gender , race , or religion .
they want , among other things , to add sexual orientation to that list .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's mayor klaus wowereit was one of the first politicians to publicly come out of the closet social democrat klaus wowereit , berlin 's openly homosexual mayor , spoke out in favor of the amendment .
in an interview with the german news agency dpa , wowereit said he whole-heartedly supported the initiative .
he called the laws passed to allow homosexual civil partnerships a " milestone , " but said that there was still judicial room for improvement .
same responsibilities , different rights wowereit took the lead from his party colleague , justice minister brigitte zypries .
in an interview with the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , zypries said that changing article 3 and article 6 of the constitution - which protects the institution of marriage and the family - would send " a clear signal " to society .
while german federal law gives homosexuals the right to enter a civil partnership , they do n't enjoy the same rights as heterosexual married couples when it comes to taxes , retirement , civil servant benefits , or adoption law .
zypries said that homosexual couples have the same responsibilities , but not the same rights as heterosexuals .
" i find this to be incredibly unjust , both on human and on judicial grounds , " the newspaper quoted zypries as saying .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civil unions are important for couples but do not grant the same rights as marriage taking a stand klaus jetz from the lesbian and gay federation in germany -lrb- lsvd -rrb- said that although both the european parliament and the european commission have taken a clear stance against discrimination based on sexual orientation , enshrining the same in the german constitution would have tangible advantages for the gay and lesbian community .
" homosexual couples are not able to adopt children in germany .
and ' rainbow families ' - gay and lesbian couples with biological children - do n't get the same tax breaks as heterosexual couples , " jetz said .
support in society growing article 3 of the constitution was amended for the last time in 1995 , to protect the disabled from discrimination .
at the time , there was not enough political backing to include sexual orientation to the list . but that seems to be changing .
on their web site , the lesbian and gay federation in germany lists a slew of supporters , from all walks of life - actors , politicians , even a rabbi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christopher street day is celebrated all over europe three major parties - the social democrats , the greens , and the left party - are in favor of an amendment .
but a two-thirds majority will be necessary to change the constitution and will need to include members of the conservative parties as well .
" we have to get the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- on board , " jetz said .
but the interior minister of the southern state of bavaria , joachim herrmann , has spoken out against the proposal .
the minister who belongs to the arch-conservative csu party , the sister bavarian party of the cdu , says he sees no reason to extend the constitutional protection of the family .
gay rights activists accuse the conservatives of blocking legislation that would give homosexuals more rights .
" we need the conservatives to understand that this is about protecting a minority in the population , " jetz said . " giving us more rights wo n't change anything for them . "

public gay pride demonstrations , known as christopher street day , are held every summer in cities around the world to commemorate the event .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amendments to the constitution are the focus of this year 's christopher street day parades klaus jetz , head of the lesbian and gay federation in germany -lrb- lsvd -rrb- , told deutsche welle that the political focus of this year 's christopher street day parades , which will begin this weekend in berlin , will be on amending article 3 of the german constitution .
" getting the anti-discrimination amendment passed has been an important topic for the organization since our founding in 1990 , " he said . " it is great that we have finally managed to rally support for this topic beyond our own community , within the political sphere . "
this week , the german parliament voted to push for a federal initiative to make additions to article 3 of the constitution , which protects citizens against discrimination based on gender , race , or religion .
they want , among other things , to add sexual orientation to that list .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's mayor klaus wowereit was one of the first politicians to publicly come out of the closet social democrat klaus wowereit , berlin 's openly homosexual mayor , spoke out in favor of the amendment .
in an interview with the german news agency dpa , wowereit said he whole-heartedly supported the initiative .
he called the laws passed to allow homosexual civil partnerships a " milestone , " but said that there was still judicial room for improvement .
same responsibilities , different rights wowereit took the lead from his party colleague , justice minister brigitte zypries .
in an interview with the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , zypries said that changing article 3 and article 6 of the constitution - which protects the institution of marriage and the family - would send " a clear signal " to society .
while german federal law gives homosexuals the right to enter a civil partnership , they do n't enjoy the same rights as heterosexual married couples when it comes to taxes , retirement , civil servant benefits , or adoption law .
zypries said that homosexual couples have the same responsibilities , but not the same rights as heterosexuals .
" i find this to be incredibly unjust , both on human and on judicial grounds , " the newspaper quoted zypries as saying .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civil unions are important for couples but do not grant the same rights as marriage taking a stand klaus jetz from the lesbian and gay federation in germany -lrb- lsvd -rrb- said that although both the european parliament and the european commission have taken a clear stance against discrimination based on sexual orientation , enshrining the same in the german constitution would have tangible advantages for the gay and lesbian community .
" homosexual couples are not able to adopt children in germany .
and ' rainbow families ' - gay and lesbian couples with biological children - do n't get the same tax breaks as heterosexual couples , " jetz said .
support in society growing article 3 of the constitution was amended for the last time in 1995 , to protect the disabled from discrimination .
at the time , there was not enough political backing to include sexual orientation to the list . but that seems to be changing .
on their web site , the lesbian and gay federation in germany lists a slew of supporters , from all walks of life - actors , politicians , even a rabbi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christopher street day is celebrated all over europe three major parties - the social democrats , the greens , and the left party - are in favor of an amendment .
but a two-thirds majority will be necessary to change the constitution and will need to include members of the conservative parties as well .
" we have to get the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- on board , " jetz said .
but the interior minister of the southern state of bavaria , joachim herrmann , has spoken out against the proposal .
the minister who belongs to the arch-conservative csu party , the sister bavarian party of the cdu , says he sees no reason to extend the constitutional protection of the family .
gay rights activists accuse the conservatives of blocking legislation that would give homosexuals more rights .
" we need the conservatives to understand that this is about protecting a minority in the population , " jetz said . " giving us more rights wo n't change anything for them . "

civil society groups have been campaigning to bring the issue to the notice of the mekong river governments , asking them to scrap the plans . the 11 dams along the lower mekong river are planned for laos , cambodia and the thai-lao border .
the hydropower generated by them is to meet the increasing demand for electricity across the region .
the 4,800 kilometre mekong river flows from the tibetan plateau through southern china and myanmar before reaching the mekong basin and eventually flowing to the south china sea through southern vietnam .
problems for food security civil society groups groups point to the threat to fish stocks , water access and general food security for the millions of people living in the region if the hydropower dam developments go ahead .
premrudee daoroung is a co-director of the bangkok-based group ' towards ecological recovery and regional alliance ' -lrb- terra -rrb- .
she says because several dams are planned the situation is vastly more complicated than earlier campaigns to halt damming on the mekong .
" compared with the past 20 years , the situation has become pretty critical now – a lot more difficult – in terms of the figures of the dams , because they are not one country ’ s dams anymore .
we have to consider the cross-border issues .
the main reason for our campaign right now is to save the mekong as a whole – which is not comparable to the past . "
postcard campaign civil society groups have combined efforts to present the case to regional governments .
through a postcard petition campaign more than 16,000 people have signed on urging the prime ministers of cambodia , laos , thailand and vietnam to put a stop to the developments .
thai prime minister abhisit vejjajiva said the issue should be raised with the association of south east asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- .
carl middleton from the environmental group ' international rivers ' , says there is now a greater understanding of both the importance of the fishing industry and the wider social impact if the dams go ahead .
" compared to when these dams were first conceived the world ’ s moved on – hydropower is last century ’ s technology .
so these projects in the past , they were stopped by various reasons , including the high environmental and social impact .
but the fact is now there are far better options to meeting energy needs in the region . "
threatening endangered species middleton says the hydropower projects would affect the more than 50 species of migratory fish in one the world ’ s most productive inland fisheries .
the dams would also threaten several endangered species such as the irrawaddy dolphin and the mekong giant catfish .
downstream in vietnam ’ s delta region , agronomists fear the dams will drastically affect the country ’ s rice growing bowl , limiting fresh water flows and leading to more sea water flowing inland .
as a result , soil acidity would increase destroying rice fields and affecting the lives of 17 million people .
the groups have also called for greater action by the mekong river commission or mrc - to take a stronger stance over future developments that affect the river , the lifeblood for so many in the region .

civil society groups have been campaigning to bring the issue to the notice of the mekong river governments , asking them to scrap the plans . the 11 dams along the lower mekong river are planned for laos , cambodia and the thai-lao border .
the hydropower generated by them is to meet the increasing demand for electricity across the region .
the 4,800 kilometre mekong river flows from the tibetan plateau through southern china and myanmar before reaching the mekong basin and eventually flowing to the south china sea through southern vietnam .
problems for food security civil society groups groups point to the threat to fish stocks , water access and general food security for the millions of people living in the region if the hydropower dam developments go ahead .
premrudee daoroung is a co-director of the bangkok-based group ' towards ecological recovery and regional alliance ' -lrb- terra -rrb- .
she says because several dams are planned the situation is vastly more complicated than earlier campaigns to halt damming on the mekong .
" compared with the past 20 years , the situation has become pretty critical now – a lot more difficult – in terms of the figures of the dams , because they are not one country ’ s dams anymore .
we have to consider the cross-border issues .
the main reason for our campaign right now is to save the mekong as a whole – which is not comparable to the past . "
postcard campaign civil society groups have combined efforts to present the case to regional governments .
through a postcard petition campaign more than 16,000 people have signed on urging the prime ministers of cambodia , laos , thailand and vietnam to put a stop to the developments .
thai prime minister abhisit vejjajiva said the issue should be raised with the association of south east asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- .
carl middleton from the environmental group ' international rivers ' , says there is now a greater understanding of both the importance of the fishing industry and the wider social impact if the dams go ahead .
" compared to when these dams were first conceived the world ’ s moved on – hydropower is last century ’ s technology .
so these projects in the past , they were stopped by various reasons , including the high environmental and social impact .
but the fact is now there are far better options to meeting energy needs in the region . "
threatening endangered species middleton says the hydropower projects would affect the more than 50 species of migratory fish in one the world ’ s most productive inland fisheries .
the dams would also threaten several endangered species such as the irrawaddy dolphin and the mekong giant catfish .
downstream in vietnam ’ s delta region , agronomists fear the dams will drastically affect the country ’ s rice growing bowl , limiting fresh water flows and leading to more sea water flowing inland .
as a result , soil acidity would increase destroying rice fields and affecting the lives of 17 million people .
the groups have also called for greater action by the mekong river commission or mrc - to take a stronger stance over future developments that affect the river , the lifeblood for so many in the region .

" turkey can not accept the position of germany and france .
a privileged partnership does n't exist in -lrb- european law -rrb- , " erdogan told journalists before attending a forum in brussels , adding that turkey 's goal is full membership and any alternative " is out of the question . "
erdogan said french president nicolas sarkozy had been inconsistent , showing more openness to turkey 's accession in private talks than in public .
" our european friends unfortunately have a unilateral expectation which is rather populist and it saddens us .
i hope we will overcome this , " he said .
ankara launches diplomatic drive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan , left , faces an uphill battle on turkey 's eu entry bid turkey has mounted a diplomatic offensive aimed at boosting its chances of joining the eu , with erdogan visiting brussels twice in the span of three months .
in addition , his foreign minister , ahmet devutoglu , was also in brussels on friday to meet the eu enlargement commissioner , olli rehn , ahead of an accession conference planned for next week .
turkey 's membership was also a campaign issue in this month 's european parliament election , with some right-wing parties making gains after opposing its accession .
" some narrow-minded politicians have used turkey as election material , and we believe this to be very wrong and very populist , " erdogan said .
" we will never give up .
we are patient , we do our homework ... and we continue moving forward . "
changing the constitution erdogan 's comments come just a day after he had told journalists that plans to change the turkish constitution , key to keeping turkey 's bid for eu membership on track , are a " waste of time " as long as opposition parties keep blocking all efforts in parliament . erdogan 's comments were the clearest sign yet that his government could ditch its long standing goal of joining the 27-nation bloc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most europeans oppose turkey 's entry bid because it is a moslem country , poor , and situated mostly in asia erdogan promised after march local elections to renew efforts to revamp the 1982 constitution , drawn up under military rule , which would go a long way towards removing one of the major obstacles in ankara 's eu path . " all parties should be involved in efforts to reform the constitution , but the main opposition party rejects and blocks all efforts .
so as long as we are faced with such an approach these efforts are nothing but a waste of time .
we will have to continue with the present constitution , " erdogan said . sweden supports turkey 's eu bid the eu wants turkey to speed up political and economic reforms , including the removal of curbs on free speech , ensuring more rights for minorities and reducing the influence of the armed forces in government affairs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president sarkozy and german chancellor merkel are vocal opponents of full eu membership for turkey any sign that turkey is throwing in the towel could spell serious trouble for its membership bid and even have negative consequences for the country 's political and economic stability , analysts say .
" we are getting very close to crunch time , " said amanda akcakoca , a specialist on the issue at the european policy center in brussels .
" turkey needs to think out of the box and do something unexpected to impress europe . "
ankara ’ s bid for eu membership does , however , have the support of sweden , which takes over the six-month eu presidency on july 1 .
swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt has said his country will try its best to open a new chapter of european union membership negotiations with turkey when it takes over the rotating eu presidency next week . reinfeldt told the associated press news agency that such negotiations would be of " utmost strategic importance for europe " and pointed out the european union had promised it would negotiate with turkey .
cyprus question the process has also been slowed by ankara 's refusal to recognize eu member cyprus .
on thursday , european commission president jose manuel barroso said cypriots should seize a “ historic chance ” to reunite the mediterranean island .
" there is a unique chance this year to bring an end to this long-running conflict on european soil , " barroso told journalists .
" this chance must be taken . " cyprus was divided in a turkish invasion in 1974 after a brief greek-inspired coup .
turkey 's entry to the european union partly hinges on a peace deal in cyprus , whose greek cypriots represent the island in the bloc .
the eu unanimously began accession talks with turkey in 2005 , but since then , negotiations have slowed to a crawl with the bloc deeply divided about accepting turkey .
adding to the sense of limbo , so far only 10 of the 35 policy areas that candidates must complete have been opened , and eight of these have been frozen over the cyprus dispute. nrt / mrm / afp / ap / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but in germany 's case , the real stars do n't stick with the team very long .
dw 's jefferson chase explains . when the young german eleven beat italy 1-0 in the semifinals of the event on friday , june 26 , they moved a step closer to making history .
germany may be a soccer powerhouse , but the record of the u21 national team is anything but stellar .
incredibly enough , they 've never won a major tournament - a blot that coach horst hrubesch currently wants to rectify in sweden .
still , after needing a nervy draw against england to qualify for the knock-out stage , hrubesch is n't exactly jumping for joy .
" the only thing i 'm happy about is making the semis , " the coach told dpa news agency after the england match .
" i 'm not at all satisfied with how we did it - it was way below our ambitions . "
with the german u17 and u19 teams having won their european titles , this could be the year for germany 's youth teams .
but would it signal a glorious future ahead for the adult german national team ?
probably not .
here today , gone tomorrow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year , before taking his current job , hrubesch won europe with the u19 germany 's footballing reputation is one of solidity and consistency rather than mercurial brilliance so you might expect the national soccer association , the dfb , to bring up players gradually through the various levels .
but the opposite is the case .
goalkeeping legend oliver kahn and super striker miroslav klose never played in the youth ranks , going straight into the main national team .
and while most of the current national squad did take the pitch for the u21s , very few of the real stars - michael ballack , bastian schweinsteiger or lukas podolski , for example - made more than a handful of appearances , before being promoted up to the big league .
the uefa u21 championship has only been in existence in its current form since 1978 , and it took some time for germany to take them seriously .
even into the 1990s the dfb eleven were playing with a sweeper .
as a result , germany have always gone home empty handed while italy have won europe five times , and even england - never a national side known for tournament successes - have hoisted the trophy twice .
ones to watch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany are glad oezil , r , choose to play for them instead of turkey given the german u21s ' history , the players most likely to play roles in the top squad are those who have already been called up by national coach joachim loew .
diminutive forward marko marin has n't been able to make much of a mark in sweden , but leverkusen 's gonzalo castro , stuttgart 's sami khedira and schalke goalkeeper manuel neuer have performed well .
and the star of the show has been mesut oezil , who normally plays on the wing for his club bremen but who has shone in a striker role for hrubesch , setting up both of goals in germany 's 2-nil win over finland in the group stage .
and the breakthrough player of the squad is defender jerome boateng .
boateng usually serves as right back and has struggled to keep a position in the starting line-up for his club hamburg .
but he 's drawn high marks in all his matches for the young germans playing as a central defender - a role for which hamburg might consider him when he returns from sweden .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : castro is part of germany 's multi-cultural squad those names point to an unmistakable trend within the german national team - the growing prominence of players who were born outside germany or who come from an immigrant background .
klose , podolski , both polish born , have established themselves as mainstays in germany adult national team - and they 've recently been joined by piotr trochowski .
in the u21 , eight of the current 24 members of the squad come from multi-national backgrounds .
so if germany continues the tradition of integrating younger players quickly into the main men 's team , some of hrubesch 's charges could play a role at the 2010 world cup in south africa .

advertisement call for secure parking for bikes a lack of secure cycle parking is holding back mayor of london boris johnson 's aim of doubling the number of cyclists , a new report has claimed .
a survey of more than 450 cyclists by the london assembly found that 77 % rated bike parking facilities as poor .
the authors said this contributes to the 70,000 estimated bike thefts in london each year - and dissuades people from abandoning the car for two wheels .
transport for london -lrb- tfl -rrb- said it would consider the report 's advice .
the researchers found that although tfl has installed 53,000 cycle parking spaces since 2000 , the number of daily bicycle trips has doubled over the same period .
' soaring demand ' mr johnson has said he hopes bicycle usage will double again by 2025 .
but the london assembly 's transport committee , which commissioned the report , warned the £ 2m he has earmarked for parking is not enough .
labour assembly member joanne mccartney , who led the investigation , said : " in virtually every area , from new residential developments to mainline stations , the situation was the same .
" there is not enough secure cycle parking in the right places to meet the soaring demand in london . "
i have cycled all over london and i 've never had any problems andreas kambanis she added : " boroughs , tfl and the private sector need to work together to find solutions - or the wheels will come off the mayor 's commendable aspirations to encourage more londoners to cycle . "
however andreas kambanis , author of the independent london cyclist blog , disagreed with the findings and said : " i am quite surprised because i thought it was fine .
" i would rate london as one of the better cities for cycle parking .
" i have cycled all over london and i 've never had any problems . "
a tfl spokeswoman said : " we welcome the assembly 's report and will carefully consider their recommendations .
" since 2005 , we have invested more than £ 10m in installing new cycle parking spaces across the capital .
" we plan to install 66,000 new cycle parking spaces in london by 2012 on top of the 70,000 we have installed since 2000 . "
boris johnson and conservative party leader david cameron are among the politicians who have had a bicycle stolen in london .

bbc news -pipe- entertainment -pipe- michael jackson : the music bbc news / entertainment graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- entertainment contents : arts & culture 06:21 gmt , friday , 26 june 2009 07:21 uk michael jackson : the music by mark savage entertainment reporter , bbc news michael jackson was a towering presence in the world of popular music - a giant who could stand shoulder to shoulder with the likes of elvis , the beatles and frank sinatra .
his skills as a singer , composer and arranger were often overshadowed by his showmanship and eccentricity , but his legacy will undoubtedly be the songs he recorded .
here are a selection of the most memorable records he made .
i want you back - 1969 jackson 's first chart hit came when he was just 11 , with this motown classic recorded alongside his brothers in the jackson five .
the youngster 's pyrotechnic vocal performance was a revelation - yelping and screaming with boyish intensity as he pleaded with an ex-girlfriend to give him " one more chance " .
in 2004 , it was ranked 120 in rolling stone magazine 's 500 greatest songs of all time list .
billie jean - 1982 bizarrely , this era-defining funk track was not the first single to be released from the thriller album - an honour which went instead to the saccharine paul mccartney duet the girl is mine .
the song is recognisable from the very first thud of the kick drum , something that was very much intended - producer quincy jones told his audio engineer to create a drum sound no-one had ever heard before .
jackson 's writing is a masterclass in musical economy - the entire track comprising little more than a dirty , fuzztone bassline , that drumbeat and the star 's staccato , almost mournful delivery .
the lyrics , by the way , refer to a real-life experience jackson had with a fan who claimed he had fathered her twin sons .
the insanity surrounding his music was to become a more and more common feature in later years .
beat it - 1983 but before then michael jackson would break a few more musical boundaries .
the shimmering pop melody and heavy rock riffing on beat it now seems an obvious combination .
but for a black r & b artist to collaborate with rock god eddie van halen in 1983 was nothing short of a revolution .
" i wanted to write a song , the type of song that i would buy if i were to buy a rock song , " jackson said later .
" that is how i approached it and i wanted the kids to really enjoy it - the school kids as well as the college kids . "
twenty-six years later , the influence of jackson 's melting pot approach can be heard in the rap-rock crossovers of linkin park and the heavy , crunching guitars used by pop acts like katy perry .
thriller - 1984 considered to be one of jackson 's signature songs , thriller was in fact written by british musician rod temperton .
nonetheless , the subject matter was a perfect fit the 24-year-old star .
not only was he obsessed with the hyper-real movie horror of an american werewolf in london , but the lyrics hinted at a period of turbulence in the star 's life .
jackson 's parents were threatening to separate , his media profile was higher than ever and he had been involved in a paternity claim .
when he sings " they 're out to get you " , he means it .
although the song is best remembered for its music video , it is also one of jackson 's most sonically inventive tracks - from the creepy b-movie sound effects to vincent price 's spooky graveside rap .
man in the mirror - 1988 " i 'm starting with the man in the mirror / i 'm asking him to change his ways / and no message could have been any clearer / if you wanna make the world a better place / take a look at yourself , and then make a change . "
another song that seemed to comment on jackson 's state of mind , man in the mirror was also one of his most critically-acclaimed singles .
jackson 's voice is little more than a whisper as the music starts .
he seems vulnerable , broken and unsure as he tells himself " i 'm going to make a change " .
but as the music builds , so does his resolve .
by the end of the track , he is backed by a gospel choir , screaming his mantra at the top of his voice as a snare drum cracks like the whip .
black or white - 1991 described by jackson 's record company as " a rock ' n ' roll dance song about racial harmony " , black or white was one of the biggest radio hits of the 1990s .
this was no mean feat in an increasingly formatted radio market , and was a tribute to the star 's ability to combine musical genres - in this case hard rock , dance , pop and rap .
the lyrics are perhaps less thought-provoking than jackson intended - " if you 're thinking of being my baby it do n't matter if you 're black or white " is hardly up there with martin luther king 's " i have a dream " - but they gave jackson another opportunity to poke fun at critics ' comments about his skin tone .
his willingness to appropriate hip-hop beats also put him ahead of many of his contemporaries , who were increasingly left behind by the likes of public enemy and nwa .
earth song - 1995 jackson 's last uk hit to really cross over to the mainstream was a christmas number one in 1995 .
written as a protest against environmental destruction , the song 's simple , wordless hook is a plaintive howl of despair - with none of the promise of redemption jackson saw in man in the mirror .
as it builds to its catastrophic climax , the choir is no longer there for moral support - they are harbingers of doom summoned from the seventh circle of hell .
for those who said jackson had lost the passion of his early work , this was a stunning riposte .
but the loss of hope , and the sprawling running time , hinted at the turmoil and lack of control that were to mark the king of pop 's final years .

jackson 's first chart hit came when he was just 11 , with this motown classic recorded alongside his brothers in the jackson five .
the youngster 's pyrotechnic vocal performance was a revelation - yelping and screaming with boyish intensity as he pleaded with an ex-girlfriend to give him " one more chance " .
in 2004 , it was ranked 120 in rolling stone magazine 's 500 greatest songs of all time list .

bizarrely , this era-defining funk track was not the first single to be released from the thriller album - an honour which went instead to the saccharine paul mccartney duet the girl is mine .
the song is recognisable from the very first thud of the kick drum , something that was very much intended - producer quincy jones told his audio engineer to create a drum sound no-one had ever heard before .
jackson 's writing is a masterclass in musical economy - the entire track comprising little more than a dirty , fuzztone bassline , that drumbeat and the star 's staccato , almost mournful delivery .
the lyrics , by the way , refer to a real-life experience jackson had with a fan who claimed he had fathered her twin sons .
the insanity surrounding his music was to become a more and more common feature in later years .

but the president vetoed some of the most contentious clauses that would have enabled absentee landlords and companies to benefit from the measure .
smaller parcels of public land will be handed over for free , and larger ones at reduced or market rates .
critics say it will amount to an amnesty for illegal land-grabbers .
the law is intended to end the chaotic state of land occupation in the amazon .
hundreds of thousands of farmers have no legal title over their land , with claims often dating back decades .
president lula vetoed changes to the bill made during its passage through congress , which he claims would have altered the original aim to benefit smaller farmers .
but he has left in a clause that allows larger properties to be sold on within three years , instead of requiring the new owner to hold on to the land for at least a decade .

one man has reported having to " zigzag like a drunk " to avoid being hit when attacked in the street four times .
the gull , which has two chicks , has nested on a house chimney opposite the library in newtown , powys .
library assistant kerry thomas , said : " she 's a regular .
she used to sit on the lamppost outside and dive-bomb people from there . "
the gull is targeting pedestrians and library users at the junction of new road and park street .
several people have complained of being dive-bombed by the gulls . "
we 've had someone come in who has been dive-bombed and someone who has seen someone being dive-bombed " kerry jones , library assistant one man told bbc wales : " i was just walking round from the library along the pavement when one of the gulls swooped down just over the top of my head , making a pecking attempt .
" i carried on down the road and it made three other attempts to dive bomb me .
i was zig-zagging across the pavement like a drunken man .
" it 's a little unusual to have this so far inland .
it 's certainly unusual here . "
but library assistant kerry jones said the bird seems to have made the area her home .
' dive-bombed ' she said : " we 've had it before .
it 's quite a regular occurrence .
it 's only in the last couple of days that we 've had people complaining about it .
" we 've had someone come in who has been dive-bombed and someone who has seen someone being dive-bombed .
" we had a lot of people comment on the chicks .
she 's got two chicks right on top of the chimney .
we can see them . "
ms jones said the gull later seemed " a bit tired after all the attention and has stopped dive-bombing for now " .
rspb cymru said it was " not unsympathetic " to the problems gulls could cause but favoured " non-lethal solutions " such as netting to stop them roosting on buildings .
dana thomas said : " by choosing to live with us they do become very bold and as they are quite large birds they can be very intimidating .
" they will only dive-bomb people if they feel threatened , or if they feel the need to protect their young which could be the case in mid wales .
' food litter ' " if they are breeding and have young chicks then it is in their instinct to protect their young .
sometimes this type of behaviour can lead to injury .
" the numbers of herring gulls and black-backed gulls are increasing in urban areas , however both species have declined dramatically across the uk with herring gulls now on the red list of birds of conservation concern -lrb- 2009 -rrb- . "
the assembly government said in a statement : " action to control seagulls is the responsibility of individual local authorities , for which the welsh assembly government can provide licences under the wildlife and countryside act 1981 .
" in order to minimise the disruption caused by seagulls the public are advised to control food litter and feeding .
large birds of prey can be an effective means of control in urban areas and this again would be a matter for local authorities .
" if this course of action were to be taken , either the local authority or the person flying the bird would require a licence which can be obtained from the welsh assembly government , as killing by using a bird of prey is an offence unless licensed . "

the gull is targeting pedestrians and library users at the junction of new road and park street .
several people have complained of being dive-bombed by the gulls .
we 've had someone come in who has been dive-bombed and someone who has seen someone being dive-bombed kerry jones , library assistant one man told bbc wales : " i was just walking round from the library along the pavement when one of the gulls swooped down just over the top of my head , making a pecking attempt .
" i carried on down the road and it made three other attempts to dive bomb me .
i was zig-zagging across the pavement like a drunken man .
" it 's a little unusual to have this so far inland .
it 's certainly unusual here . "
but library assistant kerry jones said the bird seems to have made the area her home .
' dive-bombed ' she said : " we 've had it before .
it 's quite a regular occurrence .
it 's only in the last couple of days that we 've had people complaining about it .
" we 've had someone come in who has been dive-bombed and someone who has seen someone being dive-bombed .
" we had a lot of people comment on the chicks .
she 's got two chicks right on top of the chimney .
we can see them . "
ms jones said the gull later seemed " a bit tired after all the attention and has stopped dive-bombing for now " .
rspb cymru said it was " not unsympathetic " to the problems gulls could cause but favoured " non-lethal solutions " such as netting to stop them roosting on buildings .
dana thomas said : " by choosing to live with us they do become very bold and as they are quite large birds they can be very intimidating .
" they will only dive-bomb people if they feel threatened , or if they feel the need to protect their young which could be the case in mid wales .
' food litter ' " if they are breeding and have young chicks then it is in their instinct to protect their young .
sometimes this type of behaviour can lead to injury .
" the numbers of herring gulls and black-backed gulls are increasing in urban areas , however both species have declined dramatically across the uk with herring gulls now on the red list of birds of conservation concern -lrb- 2009 -rrb- . "
the assembly government said in a statement : " action to control seagulls is the responsibility of individual local authorities , for which the welsh assembly government can provide licences under the wildlife and countryside act 1981 .
" in order to minimise the disruption caused by seagulls the public are advised to control food litter and feeding .
large birds of prey can be an effective means of control in urban areas and this again would be a matter for local authorities .
" if this course of action were to be taken , either the local authority or the person flying the bird would require a licence which can be obtained from the welsh assembly government , as killing by using a bird of prey is an offence unless licensed . "
