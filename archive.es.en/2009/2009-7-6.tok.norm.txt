the justice ministry in saxony has confirmed the report , making this the second such case in recent years . according to the report , two inmates aged 15 and 24 years tortured another inmate at the regis-breitingen juvenile detention center , located near leipzig in the eastern state of saxony . the state of saxony has pressed charges of attempted murder against the inmates , though it is still unclear when the trial will take place . neo-nazi inspired torture according to the report , the two stand accused of trying to get the 18-year-old to commit suicide by beating him with a broomstick and pouring boiling water on him . out of fear , the attacked inmate attempted to hang himself in his cell but was unsuccessful .
after seeing that he survived the attempted suicide , the attackers then attempted to strangle him with a belt but failed in their attempts .
the victim was able to escape and alert the guards . before the beatings , the inmates , at this point together with other inmates , allegedly painted swastikas on their victim . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the incident in saxony recalls a similarly heinous case in siegburg in 2006 not the first case of juvenile torture in germany this latest case , which allegedly happened in may 2008 , is similar to a brutal murder that took place inside a juvenile prison in 2006 .
in that case , three inmates at the siegburg detention center near the western city of bonn tortured a fellow inmate for hours , raping and beating him unconscious .
the three then hung their victim , in an attempt to make it appear as if the victim had taken his own life . the state of north rhine-westphalia found all three inmates guilty , with the main attacker receiving a further ten years in a maximum security prison .
the other attackers both received 10 years in prison . critique of the inmate " re-socialization " process this latest case of juvenile inmate torture has aroused debate in germany , particularly with regard to the question of how to deal with juvenile delinquents effectively . klaus bartl , a speaker for the left party , says the heinous nature of this crime is a sign that the current system is n't working . " this horrible incident is yet further evidence that the juvenile prison in saxony does n't help its inmates .
it does the opposite of what it says it should , which is to " re-socialize " them and stop them from using so much violence . " the regis-breitingen juvenile detention center is the most modern of its kind in saxony .
the prison has room for almost 400 inmates and was opened on october 5th , 2007 . less than one month after its opening , one of its inmates , a 21-year-old charged with murder , committed suicide in his cell . glb / dpa / ap editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the win , kaymer ’ s third on the pga european tour , is his most important . the young german needed only one extra hole to beat westwood , after the former european number one found the water with his approach to the difficult 18th . the botched extra hole came after a solid final round , however , in which westwood carded a sterling 7-under 65 to force the playoff . after 72 holes of regulation play , both players were at 13-under-par , three strokes better than third place ian poulter . putting key to victory kaymer was off to a fast start at le golf national in st. quentin-en-yvelines , france , after he tied the course record with a 62 on thursday .
rounds of 72 and 69 on friday and saturday left kaymer one back heading into sunday , and a 68 was enough to get into the playoff with westwood . a myriad of long putts , the longest an 84-footer on the eighth , proved the key to kaymer 's third european tour victory , who comes from the western german city of dusseldorf . " my putting was great all week , " kaymer told reporters .
" i made so many putts from everywhere . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many say kaymer is the next bernhard langer significant win with the victory kaymer took home the $ 930,000 top prize , which brings him to fifth on the european order of merit .
more importantly , however , the win is sure to bring kaymer into the top 20 in the world golf rankings . " the world ranking is the important thing to me , " kaymer said .
" i 've never been this high before . " this is the first time a german has won the french open in 25 years .
two-time masters champion bernhard langer was the last to the lift the trophy , when he won at the st. cloud golf club in paris in 1984 . for kaymer , who many say is walking in the footsteps of langer , germany ’ s most dominant player in the 20th century , the french open is his third international victory . he also triumphed in abu dhabi and at the bmw international last year . glb / dpa / reuters editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? dw-tv europe live euromaxx - leben und kultur in europa we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

"
the incident at the kruemmel plant in northern germany switched off the majority of traffic lights across the city of hamburg and affected thousands of private homes .
the power station 's operator , vattenfall , says the short-circuit was reminiscent of an accident two years ago when a fire put the station out of action for two years .
it came back into service just two weeks ago . vatenfall says it is too early to say when the reactor will be restarted .
anti-nuclear campaigners gathered outside the plant at the weekend to protest its continued use .
but vattenfall has said it plans to generate power from kruemmel for another nine years .
there are seventeen nuclear power plants across germany. tkw / dpa / ap editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

still , who could blame it ?
for the small-time club formerly known as ssv markranstaedt on the quiet outskirts of leipzig , the corporate reference is hardly an onerous price to pay for a shot at the major league .
" a global company as a sponsor , what could be better , " ssv markranstaedt manager holger nussbaum told the local leipziger volkszeitung .
the regional football association has given its approval , the contracts have been signed , and details of the venture are being worked out .

eight new players , together with coaches tino vogel , lars weissenberger , and goalie coach perry braeutigam , are expected to manage the leap from fifth to first division .

the energy debate heats up ahead of elections germany 's social democrats have appealed to chancellor angela merkel to consider an alternative to nuclear fuel .
the calls followed technical problems that bumped a northern plant from the national grid . social democrat environment minister sigmar gabriel called on merkel and economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg to give up their nuclear course in order to preserve " the security of german citizens . "
in an interview with berlin 's tagesspiegel daily , gabriel said " the recent incidents in krümmel prove we can not justify the protracted use of older power plants . "
indeed the kruemmel reactor in the northern state of schleswig holstein only roared back to life at the end of june after a fire in 2007 forced its closure for two full years .
and in the few days since its reopening , the plant has twice been removed from the national grid . action not investigation the plant 's swedish operators , vattenfall , say the latest shutdown , which put out the majority of traffic lights across hamburg and left thousands of homes in the region with a reduced electricity supply , was the result of a short-circuit .
they say they are investigating the cause , and have not indicated when normal operations might resume .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not quite business as usual at the krümmel plant but social democrat gabriel wants more than an investigation .
speaking to ard television on monday morning , he said the oldest eight of germany 's seventeen nuclear reactors should be removed from the national grid immediately .
he also called for a tightening of nuclear phase-out laws in order to make it possible for newer , more reliable plants to fulfil the remit of the older ones he wishes to see closed .
electorate to decide both the social democrats and the greens have seized on the latest kruemmel shutdown as an election campaign opportunity .
" on september 27th , germany will decide if this , and seven other reactors , should remain in operation as the cdu and chancellor merkel suggest , " gabriel , whose spd is currently in a coalition with the cdu , told the ard . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clean energy sources ca n't supply a whole nation .
yet .
renate kuenast , leading green party candidate , described kruemmel 's two malfunctions in as many weeks as dilettantism on the part of vattenfall .
she said voters held the key to the future of germany 's power generation .
" whoever wants to see scrap reactors like kruemmel closed down has to fight with us against a black-yellow coalition , " she told the tagesspiegel , referring to the possibility of a coalition between the " black " christian democrats and the " yellow " free democrats .
merkel 's christian democrats are in favor of extending the operational lives of germany 's nuclear plants , which , under a law passed by the former spd / green coalition , are currently due to be phased out by the year 2021 .
bridging a gap to a cleaner energy future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fire put krümmel out of action in 2007 gabriel said that to close the oldest reactors now rather would not , as some suggest , pose a supply problem , as germany currently produces more than it uses .
but the christian democratic bavarian environment minister , markus söder , said it was illusionary to think that bavaria - which is 60-70 percent reliant on nuclear energy - could switch to alternative energy sources from one day to the next .
he told bavarian public radio that germany needed nuclear fuel " until we can replace it entirely with regenerative energy . "

the energy debate heats up ahead of elections germany 's social democrats have appealed to chancellor angela merkel to consider an alternative to nuclear fuel .
the calls followed technical problems that bumped a northern plant from the national grid . social democrat environment minister sigmar gabriel called on merkel and economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg to give up their nuclear course in order to preserve " the security of german citizens . "
in an interview with berlin 's tagesspiegel daily , gabriel said " the recent incidents in krümmel prove we can not justify the protracted use of older power plants . "
indeed the kruemmel reactor in the northern state of schleswig holstein only roared back to life at the end of june after a fire in 2007 forced its closure for two full years .
and in the few days since its reopening , the plant has twice been removed from the national grid . action not investigation the plant 's swedish operators , vattenfall , say the latest shutdown , which put out the majority of traffic lights across hamburg and left thousands of homes in the region with a reduced electricity supply , was the result of a short-circuit .
they say they are investigating the cause , and have not indicated when normal operations might resume .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not quite business as usual at the krümmel plant but social democrat gabriel wants more than an investigation .
speaking to ard television on monday morning , he said the oldest eight of germany 's seventeen nuclear reactors should be removed from the national grid immediately .
he also called for a tightening of nuclear phase-out laws in order to make it possible for newer , more reliable plants to fulfil the remit of the older ones he wishes to see closed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 06.07.2009 russia 's security strategy considers new and old challenges großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia sees many of its future security concerns being home grown security is on the agenda during talks between the kremlin and barack obama in moscow over the next two days .
russia released a new security strategy in may , taking another look at threats , both old and new . us president obama has said the us needs to reset its relationship with russia , which faces a series of challenges , including a public suspicious of us motives , a kremlin with two men at the helm and hard feelings on a variety of issues . russia is also talking about improving ties with its former adversary , and has been doing some resetting of its own , primarily regarding its security doctrine .
russian president dmitry medvedev signed a decree in may on the country 's national security strategy , which is meant to be a general guide for russian domestic and foreign policy until 2020 . that policy still mentions threats dating from the cold war era .
but for the first time in recent russian history , the country 's national security is not perceived as being threatened primarily by dangers from outside or being dependent on its own defensive capabilities . " the most important tasks and , at the same time , the most serious dangers are to be found inside the country , " said dmitry suslov , the deputy research director of the moscow-based council for foreign and defense policy .
" that means there 's a need for modernization , a more effective system of state intervention , fighting corruption , and so on . " the transition from perceived external threats to a new look at home-grown dangers is a natural development , especially as the new us administration has worked to diffuse some of the tensions that had grown over recent years between the old cold war sparring partners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president dmitry medvedev chaired a national security council meeting discussing russia 's security strategy " it 's a normal development , because -lrb- russia 's -rrb- relations with the west have improved over the last weeks or months since obama took office , " said alexander rahr , russia analyst at the german council on foreign relations . the new security document largely puts the focus on economic and social categories , for example , economic growth , health care , science , education , culture and quality of life .
it lays out the ambitious goal , especially given the state of today 's russia , of becoming a world leader in these areas .
one particular threat for national security is unemployment , the widening gap between rich and poor , population decreases and rising domestic prices . energy security the issue of russia 's energy future and security is also emphasized in the document .
moscow predicts that the international quest for access to energy sources will become more intense - in the barents sea , around the antarctic , the caspian region and in central asia . since russia considers military intervention possibly being used in the struggle for energy , it also sees an additional threat to russia 's borders . the kremlin openly describes its own enormous energy reserves as a way to bring the country closer to its ultimate goal - regaining its status as a superpower . old foes despite the change in focus , some security concerns have stayed the same , especially regarding foreign policy .
the asia-pacific region is almost a blank spot on the map for russia , despite its border with an ever-more powerful china . the foreign threat scenarios often concern the " usual suspects , " the us and nato , although they are not mentioned by name .
this might well be a topic of conversation between medvedev and obama . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : america 's planned missile defense system has been a bone of contention between washington and moscow the security document complains of the absence of a robust international security architecture and the quest for military superiority .
besides the modernization of nuclear arsenals , the document mentions the development of high-tech weapons , the militarization of outer space , strategic armaments in non-nuclear areas , the creation of a missile defense system partly stationed in eastern europe . the list is clearly referring to the us , which russia still sees as the principle threat to its security . " regarding foreign policy everything is being repeated which was said in the past , " said rahr .
" russia is against the eastern expansion of nato , and therefore certain western countries - unnamed - which would challenge russia on its western border , are being heavily criticized . " nato fears while the document says nato expansion to russia 's borders is not acceptable , almost in the same breath moscow names nato as a strategic partner necessary for the maintenance of international security . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow is suspicious of nato but needs it as an strategic partner " the -lrb- nato -rrb- block is a partner for russia since it is working on solving problems that are essential for russia 's security , such as afghanistan , " said analyst suslov .

russia released a new security strategy in may , taking another look at threats , both old and new . us president obama has said the us needs to reset its relationship with russia , which faces a series of challenges , including a public suspicious of us motives , a kremlin with two men at the helm and hard feelings on a variety of issues . russia is also talking about improving ties with its former adversary , and has been doing some resetting of its own , primarily regarding its security doctrine .
russian president dmitry medvedev signed a decree in may on the country 's national security strategy , which is meant to be a general guide for russian domestic and foreign policy until 2020 . that policy still mentions threats dating from the cold war era .
but for the first time in recent russian history , the country 's national security is not perceived as being threatened primarily by dangers from outside or being dependent on its own defensive capabilities . " the most important tasks and , at the same time , the most serious dangers are to be found inside the country , " said dmitry suslov , the deputy research director of the moscow-based council for foreign and defense policy .
" that means there 's a need for modernization , a more effective system of state intervention , fighting corruption , and so on . " the transition from perceived external threats to a new look at home-grown dangers is a natural development , especially as the new us administration has worked to diffuse some of the tensions that had grown over recent years between the old cold war sparring partners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president dmitry medvedev chaired a national security council meeting discussing russia 's security strategy " it 's a normal development , because -lrb- russia 's -rrb- relations with the west have improved over the last weeks or months since obama took office , " said alexander rahr , russia analyst at the german council on foreign relations . the new security document largely puts the focus on economic and social categories , for example , economic growth , health care , science , education , culture and quality of life .
it lays out the ambitious goal , especially given the state of today 's russia , of becoming a world leader in these areas .
one particular threat for national security is unemployment , the widening gap between rich and poor , population decreases and rising domestic prices . energy security the issue of russia 's energy future and security is also emphasized in the document .
moscow predicts that the international quest for access to energy sources will become more intense - in the barents sea , around the antarctic , the caspian region and in central asia . since russia considers military intervention possibly being used in the struggle for energy , it also sees an additional threat to russia 's borders . the kremlin openly describes its own enormous energy reserves as a way to bring the country closer to its ultimate goal - regaining its status as a superpower . old foes despite the change in focus , some security concerns have stayed the same , especially regarding foreign policy .
the asia-pacific region is almost a blank spot on the map for russia , despite its border with an ever-more powerful china . the foreign threat scenarios often concern the " usual suspects , " the us and nato , although they are not mentioned by name .
this might well be a topic of conversation between medvedev and obama . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : america 's planned missile defense system has been a bone of contention between washington and moscow the security document complains of the absence of a robust international security architecture and the quest for military superiority .
besides the modernization of nuclear arsenals , the document mentions the development of high-tech weapons , the militarization of outer space , strategic armaments in non-nuclear areas , the creation of a missile defense system partly stationed in eastern europe . the list is clearly referring to the us , which russia still sees as the principle threat to its security . " regarding foreign policy everything is being repeated which was said in the past , " said rahr .
" russia is against the eastern expansion of nato , and therefore certain western countries - unnamed - which would challenge russia on its western border , are being heavily criticized . " nato fears while the document says nato expansion to russia 's borders is not acceptable , almost in the same breath moscow names nato as a strategic partner necessary for the maintenance of international security . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow is suspicious of nato but needs it as an strategic partner " the -lrb- nato -rrb- block is a partner for russia since it is working on solving problems that are essential for russia 's security , such as afghanistan , " said analyst suslov .

russia released a new security strategy in may , taking another look at threats , both old and new . us president obama has said the us needs to reset its relationship with russia , which faces a series of challenges , including a public suspicious of us motives , a kremlin with two men at the helm and hard feelings on a variety of issues . russia is also talking about improving ties with its former adversary , and has been doing some resetting of its own , primarily regarding its security doctrine .
russian president dmitry medvedev signed a decree in may on the country 's national security strategy , which is meant to be a general guide for russian domestic and foreign policy until 2020 . that policy still mentions threats dating from the cold war era .
but for the first time in recent russian history , the country 's national security is not perceived as being threatened primarily by dangers from outside or being dependent on its own defensive capabilities . " the most important tasks and , at the same time , the most serious dangers are to be found inside the country , " said dmitry suslov , the deputy research director of the moscow-based council for foreign and defense policy .
" that means there 's a need for modernization , a more effective system of state intervention , fighting corruption , and so on . " the transition from perceived external threats to a new look at home-grown dangers is a natural development , especially as the new us administration has worked to diffuse some of the tensions that had grown over recent years between the old cold war sparring partners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president dmitry medvedev chaired a national security council meeting discussing russia 's security strategy " it 's a normal development , because -lrb- russia 's -rrb- relations with the west have improved over the last weeks or months since obama took office , " said alexander rahr , russia analyst at the german council on foreign relations . the new security document largely puts the focus on economic and social categories , for example , economic growth , health care , science , education , culture and quality of life .
it lays out the ambitious goal , especially given the state of today 's russia , of becoming a world leader in these areas .
one particular threat for national security is unemployment , the widening gap between rich and poor , population decreases and rising domestic prices . energy security the issue of russia 's energy future and security is also emphasized in the document .
moscow predicts that the international quest for access to energy sources will become more intense - in the barents sea , around the antarctic , the caspian region and in central asia . since russia considers military intervention possibly being used in the struggle for energy , it also sees an additional threat to russia 's borders . the kremlin openly describes its own enormous energy reserves as a way to bring the country closer to its ultimate goal - regaining its status as a superpower . old foes despite the change in focus , some security concerns have stayed the same , especially regarding foreign policy .
the asia-pacific region is almost a blank spot on the map for russia , despite its border with an ever-more powerful china . the foreign threat scenarios often concern the " usual suspects , " the us and nato , although they are not mentioned by name .
this might well be a topic of conversation between medvedev and obama . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : america 's planned missile defense system has been a bone of contention between washington and moscow the security document complains of the absence of a robust international security architecture and the quest for military superiority .
besides the modernization of nuclear arsenals , the document mentions the development of high-tech weapons , the militarization of outer space , strategic armaments in non-nuclear areas , the creation of a missile defense system partly stationed in eastern europe . the list is clearly referring to the us , which russia still sees as the principle threat to its security . " regarding foreign policy everything is being repeated which was said in the past , " said rahr .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 06.07.2009 " iceland has been dealt with in a very rough manner " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eva joly will lead the investigation into iceland 's banking collapse iceland 's economy suffered a near total collapse when its banks were laid low by the global credit crunch .
the public lost their jobs and savings and now the government wants to know why . in an effort to thoroughly investigate the economic collapse and related crimes , the icelandic government has sought help from a prominent european figure . newly elected mep eva joly , the norwegian-born french magistrate who became famous as the lead judge in the elf aquitaine corruption scandal , acts as special adviser to iceland ‘ s authorities .
deutsche welle : ms joly , how would you compare this investigation with the elf aquitaine affair ?
eva joly : this is much huger , much much more important .
this bankruptcy is much bigger than enron , involving a lot of people , involving other banks , and really the investigation is huge .
what about the time and costs involved ?
it will probably be expensive .
i calculated that in order to pay for people and experts from abroad – and we need highly trained experts – we will need some three million euros a year .
and it will take a long time , it 's impossible to say how long at the moment .
that will depend on what kind of cooperation we will get from abroad and how far we will go .
but i think that we can reasonably say that within two or three years , we should have some cases ready to go to court .
if i judge by the elf case we could even spend up to seven years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people in iceland lost their savings when the banks collapsed why is it so important to spend time and money chasing " white collar criminals " ?
i think it is of the utmost important for iceland to carry out this investigation for the social contract to function .
for people to have the courage to go on to live here because what we see today is that people are full of despair and many of them are moving away .
they are taking jobs in norway and that must not happen .
people must stay , they must fight , they must fight for their culture and for justice , and i think here , like in all the nordic countries , the feeling of justice is very important - and today there is a total feeling of injustice .
we have a huge responsibility to show that the institutions are able to carry out this inquiry and that the culprits will be convicted .
only a couple of weeks ago you threatened to step down from your post .
what was the problem ?
well , you know , here in iceland it 's a very small country .
there are only 300.000 inhabitants and people are closely linked .
you always meet the wife of somebody , or the cousin , or the uncle .
so it happens that the state prosecutor 's son is involved in the inquiry , so he is inhabile and he did n't resign from his office and i was very much afraid of that because that could jeopardize the investigation .
so i asked for his resignation and i asked for more money to do the investigation and for more people .
i do not want to be an alibi .
because i am here , people think that this investigation is serious , so i must always ensure that things are done correctly .
extra staff will now be made available for you , including three independent prosecutors .
what about the state prosecutor , who will obviously have to stay out of the investigation ?
he does n't want to step down because he 's protected by law , you see , and this is normal in a democracy .
but this situation has not been foreseen by any law .

the public lost their jobs and savings and now the government wants to know why . in an effort to thoroughly investigate the economic collapse and related crimes , the icelandic government has sought help from a prominent european figure . newly elected mep eva joly , the norwegian-born french magistrate who became famous as the lead judge in the elf aquitaine corruption scandal , acts as special adviser to iceland ‘ s authorities .
deutsche welle : ms joly , how would you compare this investigation with the elf aquitaine affair ?
eva joly : this is much huger , much much more important .
this bankruptcy is much bigger than enron , involving a lot of people , involving other banks , and really the investigation is huge .
what about the time and costs involved ?
it will probably be expensive .
i calculated that in order to pay for people and experts from abroad – and we need highly trained experts – we will need some three million euros a year .
and it will take a long time , it 's impossible to say how long at the moment .
that will depend on what kind of cooperation we will get from abroad and how far we will go .
but i think that we can reasonably say that within two or three years , we should have some cases ready to go to court .
if i judge by the elf case we could even spend up to seven years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people in iceland lost their savings when the banks collapsed why is it so important to spend time and money chasing " white collar criminals " ?
i think it is of the utmost important for iceland to carry out this investigation for the social contract to function .
for people to have the courage to go on to live here because what we see today is that people are full of despair and many of them are moving away .
they are taking jobs in norway and that must not happen .
people must stay , they must fight , they must fight for their culture and for justice , and i think here , like in all the nordic countries , the feeling of justice is very important - and today there is a total feeling of injustice .
we have a huge responsibility to show that the institutions are able to carry out this inquiry and that the culprits will be convicted .
only a couple of weeks ago you threatened to step down from your post .
what was the problem ?
well , you know , here in iceland it 's a very small country .
there are only 300.000 inhabitants and people are closely linked .
you always meet the wife of somebody , or the cousin , or the uncle .
so it happens that the state prosecutor 's son is involved in the inquiry , so he is inhabile and he did n't resign from his office and i was very much afraid of that because that could jeopardize the investigation .
so i asked for his resignation and i asked for more money to do the investigation and for more people .
i do not want to be an alibi .
because i am here , people think that this investigation is serious , so i must always ensure that things are done correctly .
extra staff will now be made available for you , including three independent prosecutors .
what about the state prosecutor , who will obviously have to stay out of the investigation ?
he does n't want to step down because he 's protected by law , you see , and this is normal in a democracy .
but this situation has not been foreseen by any law .

it 's a very old civilization and they have solid democratic traditions that would reinforce the nordic culture of transparency and good governance .

the public lost their jobs and savings and now the government wants to know why . in an effort to thoroughly investigate the economic collapse and related crimes , the icelandic government has sought help from a prominent european figure . newly elected mep eva joly , the norwegian-born french magistrate who became famous as the lead judge in the elf aquitaine corruption scandal , acts as special adviser to iceland ‘ s authorities .
deutsche welle : ms joly , how would you compare this investigation with the elf aquitaine affair ?
eva joly : this is much huger , much much more important .
this bankruptcy is much bigger than enron , involving a lot of people , involving other banks , and really the investigation is huge .
what about the time and costs involved ?
it will probably be expensive .
i calculated that in order to pay for people and experts from abroad – and we need highly trained experts – we will need some three million euros a year .
and it will take a long time , it 's impossible to say how long at the moment .
that will depend on what kind of cooperation we will get from abroad and how far we will go .
but i think that we can reasonably say that within two or three years , we should have some cases ready to go to court .
if i judge by the elf case we could even spend up to seven years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people in iceland lost their savings when the banks collapsed why is it so important to spend time and money chasing " white collar criminals " ?
i think it is of the utmost important for iceland to carry out this investigation for the social contract to function .
for people to have the courage to go on to live here because what we see today is that people are full of despair and many of them are moving away .
they are taking jobs in norway and that must not happen .
people must stay , they must fight , they must fight for their culture and for justice , and i think here , like in all the nordic countries , the feeling of justice is very important - and today there is a total feeling of injustice .
we have a huge responsibility to show that the institutions are able to carry out this inquiry and that the culprits will be convicted .
only a couple of weeks ago you threatened to step down from your post .
what was the problem ?
well , you know , here in iceland it 's a very small country .
there are only 300.000 inhabitants and people are closely linked .
you always meet the wife of somebody , or the cousin , or the uncle .
so it happens that the state prosecutor 's son is involved in the inquiry , so he is inhabile and he did n't resign from his office and i was very much afraid of that because that could jeopardize the investigation .
so i asked for his resignation and i asked for more money to do the investigation and for more people .
i do not want to be an alibi .
because i am here , people think that this investigation is serious , so i must always ensure that things are done correctly .
extra staff will now be made available for you , including three independent prosecutors .
what about the state prosecutor , who will obviously have to stay out of the investigation ?
he does n't want to step down because he 's protected by law , you see , and this is normal in a democracy .
but this situation has not been foreseen by any law .
i think the possibility to have an ad hoc state prosecutor is meant for small cases , when one of your relatives is involved in stealing a little motorbike for instance that could be the case .
but when it is the whole economic system , all the institutions in the country are involved .
what sense does it have to say i will stay state prosecutor and be isolated and not be able to participate in the most important debates ?
how do you feel the european community has reacted to iceland 's financial collapse iceland has been dealt with in a very rough manner .
i think it was a european issue .
iceland is a member of the european economic community and it was our common bank system that was involved , the common regulators were involved and i think we could have sought a european solution for iceland !

the issue is a political priority for us president barack obama , who gave a speech in prague in april in which he outlined his vision of a world free of nuclear weapons . for russia on the other hand , bilateral arms-reduction talks are one of the few issues around which moscow feels its clout and cold war history makes it an equal to its one-time rival . for some time , both times have , regarding the numbers at least , made significant progress in arms reduction .
in the mid-1960s , the us had more then 30,000 warheads in its arsenal ; the russians , 20 years later , had some 40,000 .

this followed summit talks at the kremlin on monday to " reset " bilateral relations . us president barack obama and his russian counterpart , dmitry medvedev , signed a " joint understanding " aimed at reducing the number of nuclear warheads held by each of their countries to between 1,500 and 1,675 , compared with the maximum 2,200 the existing strategic arms reduction treaty -lrb- start -rrb- between their two countries allows . the two sides are also to aim to reduce the number of missiles capable of delivering the warheads from the current maximum of 1,600 allowed for each side to between 500 and 1,100 .
at a press conference following their summit talks at the kremlin on monday , medvedev said moscow wanted a " fresh start ” in relations with washington despite persisting differences .
admitting that relations between the two sides were not at an optimal level , he said " our countries are aiming at cooperation commensurate with the 21st century . " agreeing to forge ahead with disarmament talks , the russian leader said showed that russia and the united states were facing up to their superpower responsibilities .
for his part , obama praised what he called russia 's contribution in stemming nuclear threats to the world .
“ we resolved to reset us-russian relations , ” he said at the joint press conference .
he stressed the joint efforts being made towards a follow-up to the start treaty , saying the two countries aimed to " lead by example " in cutting back their nuclear weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skepticism persists in both countries over what can be achieved building on recent progress while admitting that some of the differences between the two sides were not likely to simply fade away , the two leaders sought to highlight progress made in recent months .
" we are confident that we can continue to build on the excellent discussions that we had in london , ” obama said , adding : “ and that on a whole host of issues - including security issues , economic issues , energy issues , environmental issues - that the united states and russia have more in common than they have differences . ”
the two countries have agreed to set up a joint commission on some of these issues .
more notably , military cooperation , which suffered in the aftermath of the russia-georgia conflict last august , is to recommence .
obama said if the two sides were to continue to hard work in the next few days , they could make “ extraordinary progress that would benefit the people of both countries . "
echoing those sentiments , medvedev said not just their two countries but the rest of the world too would gain from better us-russian relations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korea continues its provocative actions security cooperation the us president also said that he and medvedev shared concerns over nuclear proliferation and related developments in countries like north korea and iran .

this followed summit talks at the kremlin on monday to " reset " bilateral relations . us president barack obama and his russian counterpart , dmitry medvedev , signed a " joint understanding " aimed at reducing the number of nuclear warheads held by each of their countries to between 1,500 and 1,675 , compared with the maximum 2,200 the existing strategic arms reduction treaty -lrb- start -rrb- between their two countries allows . the two sides are also to aim to reduce the number of missiles capable of delivering the warheads from the current maximum of 1,600 allowed for each side to between 500 and 1,100 .
at a press conference following their summit talks at the kremlin on monday , medvedev said moscow wanted a " fresh start ” in relations with washington despite persisting differences .
admitting that relations between the two sides were not at an optimal level , he said " our countries are aiming at cooperation commensurate with the 21st century . " agreeing to forge ahead with disarmament talks , the russian leader said showed that russia and the united states were facing up to their superpower responsibilities .
for his part , obama praised what he called russia 's contribution in stemming nuclear threats to the world .
“ we resolved to reset us-russian relations , ” he said at the joint press conference .
he stressed the joint efforts being made towards a follow-up to the start treaty , saying the two countries aimed to " lead by example " in cutting back their nuclear weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skepticism persists in both countries over what can be achieved building on recent progress while admitting that some of the differences between the two sides were not likely to simply fade away , the two leaders sought to highlight progress made in recent months .
" we are confident that we can continue to build on the excellent discussions that we had in london , ” obama said , adding : “ and that on a whole host of issues - including security issues , economic issues , energy issues , environmental issues - that the united states and russia have more in common than they have differences . ”
the two countries have agreed to set up a joint commission on some of these issues .
more notably , military cooperation , which suffered in the aftermath of the russia-georgia conflict last august , is to recommence .
obama said if the two sides were to continue to hard work in the next few days , they could make “ extraordinary progress that would benefit the people of both countries . "
echoing those sentiments , medvedev said not just their two countries but the rest of the world too would gain from better us-russian relations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korea continues its provocative actions security cooperation the us president also said that he and medvedev shared concerns over nuclear proliferation and related developments in countries like north korea and iran .
he said that the two sides had taken “ important steps forward to strengthen our security through greater cooperation , " adding that he and his russian counterpart agreed on the “ need to combat the threat of violent extremism , particularly from al-qaeda " .
in an important sign of growing security cooperation , moscow has agreed to allow us military planes to fly over russian territory to afghanistan , which in obama 's words , is a “ substantial contribution ” that will save the us “ time and resources ” in its afghanistan mission .
problems persist medvedev said he saw clear progress in talks with the us on missile defence as the obama administration was prepared to listen to russian concerns .
he described monday 's summit as a “ first but very important step ” toward revitalizing relations between the former cold war foes .

" a global company as a sponsor , what could be better , " ssv markranstaedt manager holger nussbaum told the local leipziger volkszeitung .
the regional football association has given its approval , the contracts have been signed , and details of the venture are being worked out .
practice is set to begin any day .
" in the long run , we are aiming for the german premier league .
as a rule , we reach our goals , so that is what we are hoping for in leipzig as well , " says red bull founder , dietrich mateschitz .
mateschitz is going even further than dietmar hopp , who funded small-town team tsv hoffenheim and helped it reach the bundesliga .
he , at least , was a local businessman , but the only link that mateschitz has with rb leipzig is the initials of his product .
lofty goals a sponsor for many different sports , red bull already owns a football club in austria , the red bull salzburg team , as well as the us team red bull new york .
the energy drink firm funds soccer schools in ghana and brazil , and owns red bull racing , the former ford jaguar racing formula one team . “ we want to help give soccer in the region the significance it deserves , ” says red bull soccer manager markus egger . ” red bull is not coming to leipzig to take anything away - on the contrary . ”
two of rb leipzig 's arch rivals had hoped to win red bull as a sponsor for themselves .
but in the end , fc sachsen and 1 .
fc lokomotive leipzig lost out to markranstaedt because the former faces insolvency and the latter is known for provoking match riots .
for the time being , red bull 's new soccer team will play in the " stadion am bad " -lrb- capacity : 5,500 spectators -rrb- in markranstaedt – but the club has aspirations to sail through the divisions as soon as possible , and move into the world cup stadium in leipzig , which seats 45,000 people .
eight new players , together with coaches tino vogel , lars weissenberger , and goalie coach perry braeutigam , are expected to manage the leap from fifth to first division .
as far as money is concerned , the sky is the limit , says red bull soccer chief egger .

at a press conference following their summit talks at the kremlin on monday , medvedev said moscow wanted a " fresh start ” in relations with washington despite persisting differences .
admitting that relations between the two sides were not at an optimal level , he said " our countries are aiming at cooperation commensurate with the 21st century . " agreeing to forge ahead with disarmament talks , the russian leader said showed that russia and the united states were facing up to their superpower responsibilities .
for his part , obama praised what he called russia 's contribution in stemming nuclear threats to the world .
“ we resolved to reset us-russian relations , ” he said at the joint press conference .
he stressed the joint efforts being made towards a follow-up to the start treaty , saying the two countries aimed to " lead by example " in cutting back their nuclear weapons .

the two countries have agreed to set up a joint commission on some of these issues .
more notably , military cooperation , which suffered in the aftermath of the russia-georgia conflict last august , is to recommence .
obama said if the two sides were to continue to hard work in the next few days , they could make “ extraordinary progress that would benefit the people of both countries . "

he said that the two sides had taken “ important steps forward to strengthen our security through greater cooperation , " adding that he and his russian counterpart agreed on the “ need to combat the threat of violent extremism , particularly from al-qaeda " .
in an important sign of growing security cooperation , moscow has agreed to allow us military planes to fly over russian territory to afghanistan , which in obama 's words , is a “ substantial contribution ” that will save the us “ time and resources ” in its afghanistan mission .
problems persist medvedev said he saw clear progress in talks with the us on missile defence as the obama administration was prepared to listen to russian concerns .
he described monday 's summit as a “ first but very important step ” toward revitalizing relations between the former cold war foes .

the justice ministry in saxony has confirmed the report , making this the second such case in recent years . according to the report , two inmates aged 15 and 24 years tortured another inmate at the regis-breitingen juvenile detention center , located near leipzig in the eastern state of saxony . the state of saxony has pressed charges of attempted murder against the inmates , though it is still unclear when the trial will take place . neo-nazi inspired torture according to the report , the two stand accused of trying to get the 18-year-old to commit suicide by beating him with a broomstick and pouring boiling water on him . out of fear , the attacked inmate attempted to hang himself in his cell but was unsuccessful .
after seeing that he survived the attempted suicide , the attackers then attempted to strangle him with a belt but failed in their attempts .
the victim was able to escape and alert the guards . before the beatings , the inmates , at this point together with other inmates , allegedly painted swastikas on their victim . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the incident in saxony recalls a similarly heinous case in siegburg in 2006 not the first case of juvenile torture in germany this latest case , which allegedly happened in may 2008 , is similar to a brutal murder that took place inside a juvenile prison in 2006 .
in that case , three inmates at the siegburg detention center near the western city of bonn tortured a fellow inmate for hours , raping and beating him unconscious .
the three then hung their victim , in an attempt to make it appear as if the victim had taken his own life . the state of north rhine-westphalia found all three inmates guilty , with the main attacker receiving a further ten years in a maximum security prison .
the other attackers both received 10 years in prison . critique of the inmate " re-socialization " process this latest case of juvenile inmate torture has aroused debate in germany , particularly with regard to the question of how to deal with juvenile delinquents effectively . klaus bartl , a speaker for the left party , says the heinous nature of this crime is a sign that the current system is n't working . " this horrible incident is yet further evidence that the juvenile prison in saxony does n't help its inmates .
it does the opposite of what it says it should , which is to " re-socialize " them and stop them from using so much violence . " the regis-breitingen juvenile detention center is the most modern of its kind in saxony .
the prison has room for almost 400 inmates and was opened on october 5th , 2007 . less than one month after its opening , one of its inmates , a 21-year-old charged with murder , committed suicide in his cell . glb / dpa / ap editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russian president dmitry medvedev signed a decree in may on the country 's national security strategy , which is meant to be a general guide for russian domestic and foreign policy until 2020 . that policy still mentions threats dating from the cold war era .
but for the first time in recent russian history , the country 's national security is not perceived as being threatened primarily by dangers from outside or being dependent on its own defensive capabilities .

russia released a new security strategy in may , taking another look at threats , both old and new . us president obama has said the us needs to reset its relationship with russia , which faces a series of challenges , including a public suspicious of us motives , a kremlin with two men at the helm and hard feelings on a variety of issues . russia is also talking about improving ties with its former adversary , and has been doing some resetting of its own , primarily regarding its security doctrine .
russian president dmitry medvedev signed a decree in may on the country 's national security strategy , which is meant to be a general guide for russian domestic and foreign policy until 2020 . that policy still mentions threats dating from the cold war era .

the energy debate heats up ahead of elections germany 's social democrats have appealed to chancellor angela merkel to consider an alternative to nuclear fuel .
the calls followed technical problems that bumped a northern plant from the national grid . social democrat environment minister sigmar gabriel called on merkel and economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg to give up their nuclear course in order to preserve " the security of german citizens . "
in an interview with berlin 's tagesspiegel daily , gabriel said " the recent incidents in krümmel prove we can not justify the protracted use of older power plants . "
indeed the kruemmel reactor in the northern state of schleswig holstein only roared back to life at the end of june after a fire in 2007 forced its closure for two full years .
and in the few days since its reopening , the plant has twice been removed from the national grid . action not investigation the plant 's swedish operators , vattenfall , say the latest shutdown , which put out the majority of traffic lights across hamburg and left thousands of homes in the region with a reduced electricity supply , was the result of a short-circuit .
they say they are investigating the cause , and have not indicated when normal operations might resume .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not quite business as usual at the krümmel plant but social democrat gabriel wants more than an investigation .
speaking to ard television on monday morning , he said the oldest eight of germany 's seventeen nuclear reactors should be removed from the national grid immediately .
he also called for a tightening of nuclear phase-out laws in order to make it possible for newer , more reliable plants to fulfil the remit of the older ones he wishes to see closed .
electorate to decide both the social democrats and the greens have seized on the latest kruemmel shutdown as an election campaign opportunity .
" on september 27th , germany will decide if this , and seven other reactors , should remain in operation as the cdu and chancellor merkel suggest , " gabriel , whose spd is currently in a coalition with the cdu , told the ard . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clean energy sources ca n't supply a whole nation .
yet .
renate kuenast , leading green party candidate , described kruemmel 's two malfunctions in as many weeks as dilettantism on the part of vattenfall .
she said voters held the key to the future of germany 's power generation .
" whoever wants to see scrap reactors like kruemmel closed down has to fight with us against a black-yellow coalition , " she told the tagesspiegel , referring to the possibility of a coalition between the " black " christian democrats and the " yellow " free democrats .
merkel 's christian democrats are in favor of extending the operational lives of germany 's nuclear plants , which , under a law passed by the former spd / green coalition , are currently due to be phased out by the year 2021 .
bridging a gap to a cleaner energy future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fire put krümmel out of action in 2007 gabriel said that to close the oldest reactors now rather would not , as some suggest , pose a supply problem , as germany currently produces more than it uses .
but the christian democratic bavarian environment minister , markus söder , said it was illusionary to think that bavaria - which is 60-70 percent reliant on nuclear energy - could switch to alternative energy sources from one day to the next .
he told bavarian public radio that germany needed nuclear fuel " until we can replace it entirely with regenerative energy . "
kruemmel has often been cited in connection with a relatively high incidence of leukemia in the region , but there has never been any proof that the reactor is to blame. tkw / ap / reuters / dpa editor : michael lawton tkw / ap / reuters / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

around one fifth of the imams who preach in german mosques tend toward conservative fundamentalism , concluded a current study by social scientist rauf ceylan of duisburg . many of the imams who are active in germany are convinced that an acceptable imam must have been educated in the home country 's muslim community . according to ceylan 's study , integration is n't yet a high priority for the majority of muslim leaders in germany . author : michael hollenbach -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 06.07.2009 russia 's security strategy considers new and old challenges großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia sees many of its future security concerns being home grown security is on the agenda during talks between the kremlin and barack obama in moscow over the next two days .
russia released a new security strategy in may , taking another look at threats , both old and new . us president obama has said the us needs to reset its relationship with russia , which faces a series of challenges , including a public suspicious of us motives , a kremlin with two men at the helm and hard feelings on a variety of issues . russia is also talking about improving ties with its former adversary , and has been doing some resetting of its own , primarily regarding its security doctrine .
russian president dmitry medvedev signed a decree in may on the country 's national security strategy , which is meant to be a general guide for russian domestic and foreign policy until 2020 . that policy still mentions threats dating from the cold war era .
but for the first time in recent russian history , the country 's national security is not perceived as being threatened primarily by dangers from outside or being dependent on its own defensive capabilities . " the most important tasks and , at the same time , the most serious dangers are to be found inside the country , " said dmitry suslov , the deputy research director of the moscow-based council for foreign and defense policy .
" that means there 's a need for modernization , a more effective system of state intervention , fighting corruption , and so on . " the transition from perceived external threats to a new look at home-grown dangers is a natural development , especially as the new us administration has worked to diffuse some of the tensions that had grown over recent years between the old cold war sparring partners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president dmitry medvedev chaired a national security council meeting discussing russia 's security strategy " it 's a normal development , because -lrb- russia 's -rrb- relations with the west have improved over the last weeks or months since obama took office , " said alexander rahr , russia analyst at the german council on foreign relations . the new security document largely puts the focus on economic and social categories , for example , economic growth , health care , science , education , culture and quality of life .
it lays out the ambitious goal , especially given the state of today 's russia , of becoming a world leader in these areas .
one particular threat for national security is unemployment , the widening gap between rich and poor , population decreases and rising domestic prices . energy security the issue of russia 's energy future and security is also emphasized in the document .
moscow predicts that the international quest for access to energy sources will become more intense - in the barents sea , around the antarctic , the caspian region and in central asia . since russia considers military intervention possibly being used in the struggle for energy , it also sees an additional threat to russia 's borders . the kremlin openly describes its own enormous energy reserves as a way to bring the country closer to its ultimate goal - regaining its status as a superpower . old foes despite the change in focus , some security concerns have stayed the same , especially regarding foreign policy .
the asia-pacific region is almost a blank spot on the map for russia , despite its border with an ever-more powerful china . the foreign threat scenarios often concern the " usual suspects , " the us and nato , although they are not mentioned by name .
this might well be a topic of conversation between medvedev and obama . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : america 's planned missile defense system has been a bone of contention between washington and moscow the security document complains of the absence of a robust international security architecture and the quest for military superiority .
besides the modernization of nuclear arsenals , the document mentions the development of high-tech weapons , the militarization of outer space , strategic armaments in non-nuclear areas , the creation of a missile defense system partly stationed in eastern europe . the list is clearly referring to the us , which russia still sees as the principle threat to its security . " regarding foreign policy everything is being repeated which was said in the past , " said rahr .
" russia is against the eastern expansion of nato , and therefore certain western countries - unnamed - which would challenge russia on its western border , are being heavily criticized . " nato fears while the document says nato expansion to russia 's borders is not acceptable , almost in the same breath moscow names nato as a strategic partner necessary for the maintenance of international security . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow is suspicious of nato but needs it as an strategic partner " the -lrb- nato -rrb- block is a partner for russia since it is working on solving problems that are essential for russia 's security , such as afghanistan , " said analyst suslov .
" furthermore , nato is a central pillar of euro-atlantic security apparatus , whether russia likes it or not .
if russia wants to participate in such a system , it will have to work on its relations with nato . " the relationship with the us is similarly paradoxical .
although america is seen as a threat , russia is also seeking a strategic partnership of equals and wants to cooperate on the fight against terrorism and non-proliferation . " dmitry medvedev has to position himself on a foreign policy level , " said rahr .
" he wants to show that he has the situation under control , and that he has the capability to modernize the country domestically without disturbances from outside .

the justice ministry in saxony has confirmed the report , making this the second such case in recent years . according to the report , two inmates aged 15 and 24 years tortured another inmate at the regis-breitingen juvenile detention center , located near leipzig in the eastern state of saxony . the state of saxony has pressed charges of attempted murder against the inmates , though it is still unclear when the trial will take place . neo-nazi inspired torture according to the report , the two stand accused of trying to get the 18-year-old to commit suicide by beating him with a broomstick and pouring boiling water on him . out of fear , the attacked inmate attempted to hang himself in his cell but was unsuccessful .
after seeing that he survived the attempted suicide , the attackers then attempted to strangle him with a belt but failed in their attempts .
the victim was able to escape and alert the guards . before the beatings , the inmates , at this point together with other inmates , allegedly painted swastikas on their victim . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the incident in saxony recalls a similarly heinous case in siegburg in 2006 not the first case of juvenile torture in germany this latest case , which allegedly happened in may 2008 , is similar to a brutal murder that took place inside a juvenile prison in 2006 .
in that case , three inmates at the siegburg detention center near the western city of bonn tortured a fellow inmate for hours , raping and beating him unconscious .
the three then hung their victim , in an attempt to make it appear as if the victim had taken his own life . the state of north rhine-westphalia found all three inmates guilty , with the main attacker receiving a further ten years in a maximum security prison .
the other attackers both received 10 years in prison . critique of the inmate " re-socialization " process this latest case of juvenile inmate torture has aroused debate in germany , particularly with regard to the question of how to deal with juvenile delinquents effectively . klaus bartl , a speaker for the left party , says the heinous nature of this crime is a sign that the current system is n't working . " this horrible incident is yet further evidence that the juvenile prison in saxony does n't help its inmates .
it does the opposite of what it says it should , which is to " re-socialize " them and stop them from using so much violence . " the regis-breitingen juvenile detention center is the most modern of its kind in saxony .
the prison has room for almost 400 inmates and was opened on october 5th , 2007 . less than one month after its opening , one of its inmates , a 21-year-old charged with murder , committed suicide in his cell . glb / dpa / ap editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the win , kaymer ’ s third on the pga european tour , is his most important . the young german needed only one extra hole to beat westwood , after the former european number one found the water with his approach to the difficult 18th . the botched extra hole came after a solid final round , however , in which westwood carded a sterling 7-under 65 to force the playoff . after 72 holes of regulation play , both players were at 13-under-par , three strokes better than third place ian poulter . putting key to victory kaymer was off to a fast start at le golf national in st. quentin-en-yvelines , france , after he tied the course record with a 62 on thursday .
rounds of 72 and 69 on friday and saturday left kaymer one back heading into sunday , and a 68 was enough to get into the playoff with westwood . a myriad of long putts , the longest an 84-footer on the eighth , proved the key to kaymer 's third european tour victory , who comes from the western german city of dusseldorf . " my putting was great all week , " kaymer told reporters .
" i made so many putts from everywhere . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many say kaymer is the next bernhard langer significant win with the victory kaymer took home the $ 930,000 top prize , which brings him to fifth on the european order of merit .
more importantly , however , the win is sure to bring kaymer into the top 20 in the world golf rankings . " the world ranking is the important thing to me , " kaymer said .
" i 've never been this high before . " this is the first time a german has won the french open in 25 years .
two-time masters champion bernhard langer was the last to the lift the trophy , when he won at the st. cloud golf club in paris in 1984 . for kaymer , who many say is walking in the footsteps of langer , germany ’ s most dominant player in the 20th century , the french open is his third international victory . he also triumphed in abu dhabi and at the bmw international last year . glb / dpa / reuters editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the win , kaymer ’ s third on the pga european tour , is his most important . the young german needed only one extra hole to beat westwood , after the former european number one found the water with his approach to the difficult 18th . the botched extra hole came after a solid final round , however , in which westwood carded a sterling 7-under 65 to force the playoff . after 72 holes of regulation play , both players were at 13-under-par , three strokes better than third place ian poulter . putting key to victory kaymer was off to a fast start at le golf national in st. quentin-en-yvelines , france , after he tied the course record with a 62 on thursday .
rounds of 72 and 69 on friday and saturday left kaymer one back heading into sunday , and a 68 was enough to get into the playoff with westwood . a myriad of long putts , the longest an 84-footer on the eighth , proved the key to kaymer 's third european tour victory , who comes from the western german city of dusseldorf . " my putting was great all week , " kaymer told reporters .
" i made so many putts from everywhere . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many say kaymer is the next bernhard langer significant win with the victory kaymer took home the $ 930,000 top prize , which brings him to fifth on the european order of merit .

two-time masters champion bernhard langer was the last to the lift the trophy , when he won at the st. cloud golf club in paris in 1984 . for kaymer , who many say is walking in the footsteps of langer , germany ’ s most dominant player in the 20th century , the french open is his third international victory . he also triumphed in abu dhabi and at the bmw international last year . glb / dpa / reuters editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9799 dw-tv europe live journal - nachrichten mit die woche we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

the justice ministry in saxony has confirmed the report , making this the second such case in recent years . according to the report , two inmates aged 15 and 24 years tortured another inmate at the regis-breitingen juvenile detention center , located near leipzig in the eastern state of saxony . the state of saxony has pressed charges of attempted murder against the inmates , though it is still unclear when the trial will take place . neo-nazi inspired torture according to the report , the two stand accused of trying to get the 18-year-old to commit suicide by beating him with a broomstick and pouring boiling water on him . out of fear , the attacked inmate attempted to hang himself in his cell but was unsuccessful .
after seeing that he survived the attempted suicide , the attackers then attempted to strangle him with a belt but failed in their attempts .
the victim was able to escape and alert the guards . before the beatings , the inmates , at this point together with other inmates , allegedly painted swastikas on their victim . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the incident in saxony recalls a similarly heinous case in siegburg in 2006 not the first case of juvenile torture in germany this latest case , which allegedly happened in may 2008 , is similar to a brutal murder that took place inside a juvenile prison in 2006 .
in that case , three inmates at the siegburg detention center near the western city of bonn tortured a fellow inmate for hours , raping and beating him unconscious .
the three then hung their victim , in an attempt to make it appear as if the victim had taken his own life . the state of north rhine-westphalia found all three inmates guilty , with the main attacker receiving a further ten years in a maximum security prison .
the other attackers both received 10 years in prison . critique of the inmate " re-socialization " process this latest case of juvenile inmate torture has aroused debate in germany , particularly with regard to the question of how to deal with juvenile delinquents effectively . klaus bartl , a speaker for the left party , says the heinous nature of this crime is a sign that the current system is n't working . " this horrible incident is yet further evidence that the juvenile prison in saxony does n't help its inmates .
it does the opposite of what it says it should , which is to " re-socialize " them and stop them from using so much violence . " the regis-breitingen juvenile detention center is the most modern of its kind in saxony .
the prison has room for almost 400 inmates and was opened on october 5th , 2007 . less than one month after its opening , one of its inmates , a 21-year-old charged with murder , committed suicide in his cell . glb / dpa / ap editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 06.07.2009 russia 's security strategy considers new and old challenges großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia sees many of its future security concerns being home grown security is on the agenda during talks between the kremlin and barack obama in moscow over the next two days .
russia released a new security strategy in may , taking another look at threats , both old and new . us president obama has said the us needs to reset its relationship with russia , which faces a series of challenges , including a public suspicious of us motives , a kremlin with two men at the helm and hard feelings on a variety of issues . russia is also talking about improving ties with its former adversary , and has been doing some resetting of its own , primarily regarding its security doctrine .
russian president dmitry medvedev signed a decree in may on the country 's national security strategy , which is meant to be a general guide for russian domestic and foreign policy until 2020 . that policy still mentions threats dating from the cold war era .
but for the first time in recent russian history , the country 's national security is not perceived as being threatened primarily by dangers from outside or being dependent on its own defensive capabilities . " the most important tasks and , at the same time , the most serious dangers are to be found inside the country , " said dmitry suslov , the deputy research director of the moscow-based council for foreign and defense policy .
" that means there 's a need for modernization , a more effective system of state intervention , fighting corruption , and so on . " the transition from perceived external threats to a new look at home-grown dangers is a natural development , especially as the new us administration has worked to diffuse some of the tensions that had grown over recent years between the old cold war sparring partners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president dmitry medvedev chaired a national security council meeting discussing russia 's security strategy " it 's a normal development , because -lrb- russia 's -rrb- relations with the west have improved over the last weeks or months since obama took office , " said alexander rahr , russia analyst at the german council on foreign relations . the new security document largely puts the focus on economic and social categories , for example , economic growth , health care , science , education , culture and quality of life .
it lays out the ambitious goal , especially given the state of today 's russia , of becoming a world leader in these areas .
one particular threat for national security is unemployment , the widening gap between rich and poor , population decreases and rising domestic prices . energy security the issue of russia 's energy future and security is also emphasized in the document .
moscow predicts that the international quest for access to energy sources will become more intense - in the barents sea , around the antarctic , the caspian region and in central asia . since russia considers military intervention possibly being used in the struggle for energy , it also sees an additional threat to russia 's borders . the kremlin openly describes its own enormous energy reserves as a way to bring the country closer to its ultimate goal - regaining its status as a superpower . old foes despite the change in focus , some security concerns have stayed the same , especially regarding foreign policy .
the asia-pacific region is almost a blank spot on the map for russia , despite its border with an ever-more powerful china . the foreign threat scenarios often concern the " usual suspects , " the us and nato , although they are not mentioned by name .
this might well be a topic of conversation between medvedev and obama . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : america 's planned missile defense system has been a bone of contention between washington and moscow the security document complains of the absence of a robust international security architecture and the quest for military superiority .
besides the modernization of nuclear arsenals , the document mentions the development of high-tech weapons , the militarization of outer space , strategic armaments in non-nuclear areas , the creation of a missile defense system partly stationed in eastern europe . the list is clearly referring to the us , which russia still sees as the principle threat to its security . " regarding foreign policy everything is being repeated which was said in the past , " said rahr .
" russia is against the eastern expansion of nato , and therefore certain western countries - unnamed - which would challenge russia on its western border , are being heavily criticized . " nato fears while the document says nato expansion to russia 's borders is not acceptable , almost in the same breath moscow names nato as a strategic partner necessary for the maintenance of international security . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow is suspicious of nato but needs it as an strategic partner " the -lrb- nato -rrb- block is a partner for russia since it is working on solving problems that are essential for russia 's security , such as afghanistan , " said analyst suslov .
" furthermore , nato is a central pillar of euro-atlantic security apparatus , whether russia likes it or not .
if russia wants to participate in such a system , it will have to work on its relations with nato . " the relationship with the us is similarly paradoxical .
although america is seen as a threat , russia is also seeking a strategic partnership of equals and wants to cooperate on the fight against terrorism and non-proliferation . " dmitry medvedev has to position himself on a foreign policy level , " said rahr .
" he wants to show that he has the situation under control , and that he has the capability to modernize the country domestically without disturbances from outside .

the energy debate heats up ahead of elections germany 's social democrats have appealed to chancellor angela merkel to consider an alternative to nuclear fuel .
the calls followed technical problems that bumped a northern plant from the national grid . social democrat environment minister sigmar gabriel called on merkel and economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg to give up their nuclear course in order to preserve " the security of german citizens . "
in an interview with berlin 's tagesspiegel daily , gabriel said " the recent incidents in krümmel prove we can not justify the protracted use of older power plants . "
indeed the kruemmel reactor in the northern state of schleswig holstein only roared back to life at the end of june after a fire in 2007 forced its closure for two full years .
and in the few days since its reopening , the plant has twice been removed from the national grid . action not investigation the plant 's swedish operators , vattenfall , say the latest shutdown , which put out the majority of traffic lights across hamburg and left thousands of homes in the region with a reduced electricity supply , was the result of a short-circuit .
they say they are investigating the cause , and have not indicated when normal operations might resume .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not quite business as usual at the krümmel plant but social democrat gabriel wants more than an investigation .
speaking to ard television on monday morning , he said the oldest eight of germany 's seventeen nuclear reactors should be removed from the national grid immediately .
he also called for a tightening of nuclear phase-out laws in order to make it possible for newer , more reliable plants to fulfil the remit of the older ones he wishes to see closed .
electorate to decide both the social democrats and the greens have seized on the latest kruemmel shutdown as an election campaign opportunity .
" on september 27th , germany will decide if this , and seven other reactors , should remain in operation as the cdu and chancellor merkel suggest , " gabriel , whose spd is currently in a coalition with the cdu , told the ard . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clean energy sources ca n't supply a whole nation .
yet .
renate kuenast , leading green party candidate , described kruemmel 's two malfunctions in as many weeks as dilettantism on the part of vattenfall .
she said voters held the key to the future of germany 's power generation .
" whoever wants to see scrap reactors like kruemmel closed down has to fight with us against a black-yellow coalition , " she told the tagesspiegel , referring to the possibility of a coalition between the " black " christian democrats and the " yellow " free democrats .
merkel 's christian democrats are in favor of extending the operational lives of germany 's nuclear plants , which , under a law passed by the former spd / green coalition , are currently due to be phased out by the year 2021 .
bridging a gap to a cleaner energy future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fire put krümmel out of action in 2007 gabriel said that to close the oldest reactors now rather would not , as some suggest , pose a supply problem , as germany currently produces more than it uses .
but the christian democratic bavarian environment minister , markus söder , said it was illusionary to think that bavaria - which is 60-70 percent reliant on nuclear energy - could switch to alternative energy sources from one day to the next .
he told bavarian public radio that germany needed nuclear fuel " until we can replace it entirely with regenerative energy . "
kruemmel has often been cited in connection with a relatively high incidence of leukemia in the region , but there has never been any proof that the reactor is to blame. tkw / ap / reuters / dpa editor : michael lawton tkw / ap / reuters / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the energy debate heats up ahead of elections germany 's social democrats have appealed to chancellor angela merkel to consider an alternative to nuclear fuel .
the calls followed technical problems that bumped a northern plant from the national grid . social democrat environment minister sigmar gabriel called on merkel and economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg to give up their nuclear course in order to preserve " the security of german citizens . "
in an interview with berlin 's tagesspiegel daily , gabriel said " the recent incidents in krümmel prove we can not justify the protracted use of older power plants . "
indeed the kruemmel reactor in the northern state of schleswig holstein only roared back to life at the end of june after a fire in 2007 forced its closure for two full years .
and in the few days since its reopening , the plant has twice been removed from the national grid . action not investigation the plant 's swedish operators , vattenfall , say the latest shutdown , which put out the majority of traffic lights across hamburg and left thousands of homes in the region with a reduced electricity supply , was the result of a short-circuit .
they say they are investigating the cause , and have not indicated when normal operations might resume .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not quite business as usual at the krümmel plant but social democrat gabriel wants more than an investigation .
speaking to ard television on monday morning , he said the oldest eight of germany 's seventeen nuclear reactors should be removed from the national grid immediately .
he also called for a tightening of nuclear phase-out laws in order to make it possible for newer , more reliable plants to fulfil the remit of the older ones he wishes to see closed .
electorate to decide both the social democrats and the greens have seized on the latest kruemmel shutdown as an election campaign opportunity .
" on september 27th , germany will decide if this , and seven other reactors , should remain in operation as the cdu and chancellor merkel suggest , " gabriel , whose spd is currently in a coalition with the cdu , told the ard . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clean energy sources ca n't supply a whole nation .
yet .
renate kuenast , leading green party candidate , described kruemmel 's two malfunctions in as many weeks as dilettantism on the part of vattenfall .
she said voters held the key to the future of germany 's power generation .
" whoever wants to see scrap reactors like kruemmel closed down has to fight with us against a black-yellow coalition , " she told the tagesspiegel , referring to the possibility of a coalition between the " black " christian democrats and the " yellow " free democrats .
merkel 's christian democrats are in favor of extending the operational lives of germany 's nuclear plants , which , under a law passed by the former spd / green coalition , are currently due to be phased out by the year 2021 .
bridging a gap to a cleaner energy future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fire put krümmel out of action in 2007 gabriel said that to close the oldest reactors now rather would not , as some suggest , pose a supply problem , as germany currently produces more than it uses .
but the christian democratic bavarian environment minister , markus söder , said it was illusionary to think that bavaria - which is 60-70 percent reliant on nuclear energy - could switch to alternative energy sources from one day to the next .
he told bavarian public radio that germany needed nuclear fuel " until we can replace it entirely with regenerative energy . "

as he went into the meeting , held at peres ' private residence , steinmeier said he had high hopes of the new us administration in the context of the middle east .
" i hope we are on the verge of a fresh start , " he said , " a fresh start that has been made possible by the initiative of the us president – a decisive , fervent call for a two-state solution made not only to israel and the palestinians but also to their arab neighbors . "
he said it was crucial to encourage " moderate arab states " to work together to secure peace in the region , adding that germany and europe would do everything they could to support the goal .

the justice ministry in saxony has confirmed the report , making this the second such case in recent years . according to the report , two inmates aged 15 and 24 years tortured another inmate at the regis-breitingen juvenile detention center , located near leipzig in the eastern state of saxony . the state of saxony has pressed charges of attempted murder against the inmates , though it is still unclear when the trial will take place . neo-nazi inspired torture according to the report , the two stand accused of trying to get the 18-year-old to commit suicide by beating him with a broomstick and pouring boiling water on him . out of fear , the attacked inmate attempted to hang himself in his cell but was unsuccessful .
after seeing that he survived the attempted suicide , the attackers then attempted to strangle him with a belt but failed in their attempts .
the victim was able to escape and alert the guards . before the beatings , the inmates , at this point together with other inmates , allegedly painted swastikas on their victim . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the incident in saxony recalls a similarly heinous case in siegburg in 2006 not the first case of juvenile torture in germany this latest case , which allegedly happened in may 2008 , is similar to a brutal murder that took place inside a juvenile prison in 2006 .
in that case , three inmates at the siegburg detention center near the western city of bonn tortured a fellow inmate for hours , raping and beating him unconscious .
the three then hung their victim , in an attempt to make it appear as if the victim had taken his own life . the state of north rhine-westphalia found all three inmates guilty , with the main attacker receiving a further ten years in a maximum security prison .
the other attackers both received 10 years in prison . critique of the inmate " re-socialization " process this latest case of juvenile inmate torture has aroused debate in germany , particularly with regard to the question of how to deal with juvenile delinquents effectively . klaus bartl , a speaker for the left party , says the heinous nature of this crime is a sign that the current system is n't working . " this horrible incident is yet further evidence that the juvenile prison in saxony does n't help its inmates .
it does the opposite of what it says it should , which is to " re-socialize " them and stop them from using so much violence . " the regis-breitingen juvenile detention center is the most modern of its kind in saxony .
the prison has room for almost 400 inmates and was opened on october 5th , 2007 . less than one month after its opening , one of its inmates , a 21-year-old charged with murder , committed suicide in his cell . glb / dpa / ap editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the energy debate heats up ahead of elections germany 's social democrats have appealed to chancellor angela merkel to consider an alternative to nuclear fuel .
the calls followed technical problems that bumped a northern plant from the national grid . social democrat environment minister sigmar gabriel called on merkel and economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg to give up their nuclear course in order to preserve " the security of german citizens . "
in an interview with berlin 's tagesspiegel daily , gabriel said " the recent incidents in krümmel prove we can not justify the protracted use of older power plants . "
indeed the kruemmel reactor in the northern state of schleswig holstein only roared back to life at the end of june after a fire in 2007 forced its closure for two full years .
and in the few days since its reopening , the plant has twice been removed from the national grid . action not investigation the plant 's swedish operators , vattenfall , say the latest shutdown , which put out the majority of traffic lights across hamburg and left thousands of homes in the region with a reduced electricity supply , was the result of a short-circuit .
they say they are investigating the cause , and have not indicated when normal operations might resume .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not quite business as usual at the krümmel plant but social democrat gabriel wants more than an investigation .
speaking to ard television on monday morning , he said the oldest eight of germany 's seventeen nuclear reactors should be removed from the national grid immediately .
he also called for a tightening of nuclear phase-out laws in order to make it possible for newer , more reliable plants to fulfil the remit of the older ones he wishes to see closed .
electorate to decide both the social democrats and the greens have seized on the latest kruemmel shutdown as an election campaign opportunity .
" on september 27th , germany will decide if this , and seven other reactors , should remain in operation as the cdu and chancellor merkel suggest , " gabriel , whose spd is currently in a coalition with the cdu , told the ard . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clean energy sources ca n't supply a whole nation .
yet .
renate kuenast , leading green party candidate , described kruemmel 's two malfunctions in as many weeks as dilettantism on the part of vattenfall .
she said voters held the key to the future of germany 's power generation .
" whoever wants to see scrap reactors like kruemmel closed down has to fight with us against a black-yellow coalition , " she told the tagesspiegel , referring to the possibility of a coalition between the " black " christian democrats and the " yellow " free democrats .
merkel 's christian democrats are in favor of extending the operational lives of germany 's nuclear plants , which , under a law passed by the former spd / green coalition , are currently due to be phased out by the year 2021 .
bridging a gap to a cleaner energy future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fire put krümmel out of action in 2007 gabriel said that to close the oldest reactors now rather would not , as some suggest , pose a supply problem , as germany currently produces more than it uses .
but the christian democratic bavarian environment minister , markus söder , said it was illusionary to think that bavaria - which is 60-70 percent reliant on nuclear energy - could switch to alternative energy sources from one day to the next .

"
the incident at the kruemmel plant in northern germany switched off the majority of traffic lights across the city of hamburg and affected thousands of private homes .
the power station 's operator , vattenfall , says the short-circuit was reminiscent of an accident two years ago when a fire put the station out of action for two years .
it came back into service just two weeks ago . vatenfall says it is too early to say when the reactor will be restarted .
anti-nuclear campaigners gathered outside the plant at the weekend to protest its continued use .
but vattenfall has said it plans to generate power from kruemmel for another nine years .

german is rarely heard . " we have 2,600 mosques in germany and i do n't know a single imam who has a european education , " said political scientist bassam tibi , a professing muslim .
" how can they show the muslim who live here how to live ?
these imams would probably tell me i should n't integrate . " bulent ucar , professor for islamic studies at the university of osnabrueck , said that it 's crucial to the authentic development of islam in germany and europe that imams are educated on the continent . " only then can we have religious leaders who are informed about the country and the people and are aware of the cultural sensibilities here in germany and can act accordingly in their work in the mosque , " he added . to address the issue , the interior minister of lower saxony , uwe schuenemann , who is also the state 's integration minister , has announced a new education initiative for imams . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the university of osnabrueck was founded in 1668 " a continuing education program should be offered very soon , " said schuenemann .
" imams from turkey will be able to take courses in the teaching of religion , civic education and german . " the first batch of german-educated imams is set to graduate in osnabrueck in three years . job prospects for new imams in the past , imams have taken a reverse path : even german muslims with turkish roots have returned to turkey to complete their training . now schuenemann wants to work together with schura , a state-wide umbrella organizations for muslim groups , and ditib , the national association of turkish muslim congregations , to establish an imam training program in germany . " there are plans later on to add a masters program to the new bachelors program , " said schuenemann , " so that these imams can also teach courses in the muslim religion in schools .

protesters and troops have clashed in tegucigalpa , the capital of honduras .
unconfirmed reports say that at least two protesters have been shot dead and several wounded . riot police also fired teargas to try and disperse thousands of supporters of ousted honduras president manuel zelaya , who had gathered at the airport in tegucigalpa . when protestors pushed through barricades at the airport , at least one soldier opened fire , killing two , including a ten-year-old boy , and wounding several other people . the crowd broke and ran . eye witnesses reported that some miltary officers began taking rifles away from junior soldiers , as ambulances tried to get through . zelaya , the country 's democratically elected president , was due to arrive at approximately 23:00 gmt , but honduran airport authorities refused the plane permission to land . at least half a dozen military vehicles blocked the only runway at the airport in tegucigalpa . interim president roberto micheletti , installed after last week 's coup , had said that he would not allow zelaya to return and had vowed to arrest the ousted president if he did reach honduran territory . zelaya was underway on a private plane with miguel d 'escoto , a nicaraguan diplomat and president of the un general assembly .
the ousted president spoke to tv station telesur from the plane and his comments were broadcast live across honduras . zelaya 's plane has now landed at managua in nicaragua , but he has vowed to try again on monday or tuesday . the nightly curfew is to be brought forward three hours , to 7pm , as the military attempts to disperse the large crowds still waiting near the airport . a small crowd of demonstrators have refused to leave the place where the shootings occurred . a back-up delegation headed by jose miguel insulza , secretary-general of the organization of american states -lrb- oas -rrb- , with presidents cristina fernandez de kirchner of argentina , rafael correa of ecuador and fernando lugo of paraguay was due to fly to el salvador later on sunday , to monitor the situation in honduras . meanwhile , interim leader roberto micheletti ramped up tensions by claiming that nicaraguan troops were moving toward their joint border , a claim nicaraguan military immediately denied . ch / afp / reuters editor : michael durrie send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russia released a new security strategy in may , taking another look at threats , both old and new . us president obama has said the us needs to reset its relationship with russia , which faces a series of challenges , including a public suspicious of us motives , a kremlin with two men at the helm and hard feelings on a variety of issues . russia is also talking about improving ties with its former adversary , and has been doing some resetting of its own , primarily regarding its security doctrine .
russian president dmitry medvedev signed a decree in may on the country 's national security strategy , which is meant to be a general guide for russian domestic and foreign policy until 2020 . that policy still mentions threats dating from the cold war era .
but for the first time in recent russian history , the country 's national security is not perceived as being threatened primarily by dangers from outside or being dependent on its own defensive capabilities . " the most important tasks and , at the same time , the most serious dangers are to be found inside the country , " said dmitry suslov , the deputy research director of the moscow-based council for foreign and defense policy .
" that means there 's a need for modernization , a more effective system of state intervention , fighting corruption , and so on . " the transition from perceived external threats to a new look at home-grown dangers is a natural development , especially as the new us administration has worked to diffuse some of the tensions that had grown over recent years between the old cold war sparring partners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president dmitry medvedev chaired a national security council meeting discussing russia 's security strategy " it 's a normal development , because -lrb- russia 's -rrb- relations with the west have improved over the last weeks or months since obama took office , " said alexander rahr , russia analyst at the german council on foreign relations . the new security document largely puts the focus on economic and social categories , for example , economic growth , health care , science , education , culture and quality of life .
it lays out the ambitious goal , especially given the state of today 's russia , of becoming a world leader in these areas .
one particular threat for national security is unemployment , the widening gap between rich and poor , population decreases and rising domestic prices . energy security the issue of russia 's energy future and security is also emphasized in the document .
moscow predicts that the international quest for access to energy sources will become more intense - in the barents sea , around the antarctic , the caspian region and in central asia . since russia considers military intervention possibly being used in the struggle for energy , it also sees an additional threat to russia 's borders . the kremlin openly describes its own enormous energy reserves as a way to bring the country closer to its ultimate goal - regaining its status as a superpower . old foes despite the change in focus , some security concerns have stayed the same , especially regarding foreign policy .
the asia-pacific region is almost a blank spot on the map for russia , despite its border with an ever-more powerful china . the foreign threat scenarios often concern the " usual suspects , " the us and nato , although they are not mentioned by name .
this might well be a topic of conversation between medvedev and obama . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : america 's planned missile defense system has been a bone of contention between washington and moscow the security document complains of the absence of a robust international security architecture and the quest for military superiority .
besides the modernization of nuclear arsenals , the document mentions the development of high-tech weapons , the militarization of outer space , strategic armaments in non-nuclear areas , the creation of a missile defense system partly stationed in eastern europe . the list is clearly referring to the us , which russia still sees as the principle threat to its security . " regarding foreign policy everything is being repeated which was said in the past , " said rahr .
" russia is against the eastern expansion of nato , and therefore certain western countries - unnamed - which would challenge russia on its western border , are being heavily criticized . " nato fears while the document says nato expansion to russia 's borders is not acceptable , almost in the same breath moscow names nato as a strategic partner necessary for the maintenance of international security . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow is suspicious of nato but needs it as an strategic partner " the -lrb- nato -rrb- block is a partner for russia since it is working on solving problems that are essential for russia 's security , such as afghanistan , " said analyst suslov .

" the transition from perceived external threats to a new look at home-grown dangers is a natural development , especially as the new us administration has worked to diffuse some of the tensions that had grown over recent years between the old cold war sparring partners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president dmitry medvedev chaired a national security council meeting discussing russia 's security strategy " it 's a normal development , because -lrb- russia 's -rrb- relations with the west have improved over the last weeks or months since obama took office , " said alexander rahr , russia analyst at the german council on foreign relations . the new security document largely puts the focus on economic and social categories , for example , economic growth , health care , science , education , culture and quality of life .
it lays out the ambitious goal , especially given the state of today 's russia , of becoming a world leader in these areas .
one particular threat for national security is unemployment , the widening gap between rich and poor , population decreases and rising domestic prices . energy security the issue of russia 's energy future and security is also emphasized in the document .
moscow predicts that the international quest for access to energy sources will become more intense - in the barents sea , around the antarctic , the caspian region and in central asia . since russia considers military intervention possibly being used in the struggle for energy , it also sees an additional threat to russia 's borders . the kremlin openly describes its own enormous energy reserves as a way to bring the country closer to its ultimate goal - regaining its status as a superpower . old foes despite the change in focus , some security concerns have stayed the same , especially regarding foreign policy .
the asia-pacific region is almost a blank spot on the map for russia , despite its border with an ever-more powerful china . the foreign threat scenarios often concern the " usual suspects , " the us and nato , although they are not mentioned by name .
this might well be a topic of conversation between medvedev and obama . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : america 's planned missile defense system has been a bone of contention between washington and moscow the security document complains of the absence of a robust international security architecture and the quest for military superiority .
besides the modernization of nuclear arsenals , the document mentions the development of high-tech weapons , the militarization of outer space , strategic armaments in non-nuclear areas , the creation of a missile defense system partly stationed in eastern europe . the list is clearly referring to the us , which russia still sees as the principle threat to its security . " regarding foreign policy everything is being repeated which was said in the past , " said rahr .
" russia is against the eastern expansion of nato , and therefore certain western countries - unnamed - which would challenge russia on its western border , are being heavily criticized . " nato fears while the document says nato expansion to russia 's borders is not acceptable , almost in the same breath moscow names nato as a strategic partner necessary for the maintenance of international security . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow is suspicious of nato but needs it as an strategic partner " the -lrb- nato -rrb- block is a partner for russia since it is working on solving problems that are essential for russia 's security , such as afghanistan , " said analyst suslov .
" furthermore , nato is a central pillar of euro-atlantic security apparatus , whether russia likes it or not .
if russia wants to participate in such a system , it will have to work on its relations with nato . " the relationship with the us is similarly paradoxical .
although america is seen as a threat , russia is also seeking a strategic partnership of equals and wants to cooperate on the fight against terrorism and non-proliferation . " dmitry medvedev has to position himself on a foreign policy level , " said rahr .
" he wants to show that he has the situation under control , and that he has the capability to modernize the country domestically without disturbances from outside .

dw looks back at a series of events surrounding the facility . shut down after a fire in june 2007 and only back online since june 19 , 2009 , the kruemmel nuclear power plant in northern germany was automatically brought to a standstill on saturday . run by vattenfall , ownership of the kruemmel plant is split with half of the plant belonging to the swedish energy giant and the other half owned by germany 's eon .
the two companies also jointly own the brunsbuettel nuclear power plant , with two-thirds in vattenfall 's hands , and share ownership of the brokdorf nuclear power plant , which is operated by eon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a pair of vattenfall-run nuclear power plants were shut down on june 28 , 2007 june 28 , 2007 : vattenfall announces that the kruemmel power plant was taken offline after a fire occurred in a transformer outside the reactor building .
shortly before the announcement , the company also said that , in a separate incident , a short-circuit led to the temporary shut-down of its nuclear power plant in brunsbuettel . june 30 , 2007 : vattenfall officials say neither of the incidents was connected to the parts of the plants responsible for nuclear power production . july 1 , 2007 : brunsbuettel goes back online but is put on stand-by after two weeks due to a transformer problem . july 3 , 2007 : the energy company says the quick shutdown in kruemmel caused a pump malfunction . july 6 , 2007 : a state nuclear regulatory agency releases information showing that smoke from the kruemmel fire clouded the control room , the plant 's internal energy supply was temporarily affected and not all relevant computer files regarding the incident were saved .
in its first press conference after the failures occurred , vattenfall admits errors were made and says misunderstandings among personnel caused the mistakes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vattenfall was criticized for not quickly sharing information about the failures july 8 , 2007 : contrary to company reports , the regulatory agency says breakdowns occurred when the brunsbuettel plant was powered back up at the beginning of the month . july 14 , 2007 : in a preliminary report , vattenfall says it should have been more open with information about the fires .
two days later , the head of the company 's nuclear division is relieved of his duties and the company 's spokesman resigns . july 18 , 2007 : vattenfall europe head klaus rauscher also resigns . july 21 , 2007 : incorrectly installed wall anchors at the brunsbuettel plant lead to the facility 's complete shutdown . feb .
4 , 2008 : a smoldering fire in the kruemmel reactor 's ventilation system is extinguished immediately after starting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the brunsbuettel facility went into operation in 1976 feb .
20 , 2008 : a defective electronic card leads to a transformer in the brunsbuettel emergency power system to shut down . may 18 , 2009 : a diesel motor in the brunsbuettel plant malfunctions during planned maintenance .
a leak is also found in the cooling system . june 19 , 2009 : after nearly two years off the power grid , the kruemmel plant is put back online .
the company says many improvements had been made to the plant 's transformers to prevent short circuits and minimize their impact should they occur . july 1 , 2009 : a malfunction in one of two transformators responsible for connecting the power plant to the grid leads to the kruemmel facility 's automatic shutdown .
the plant is put back online in a matter of hours and expected to be back at full power production by july 5 .
human error is reported to be responsible for the break down . july 4 , 2009 : kruemmel undergoes a quick shutdown after a short circuit in a transformator . july 5 , 2009 : vattenfall apologizes for not informing the state regulatory agency as required and says " safety must always come before speed " in deciding when the kruemmel plant will be turned back on .
the company adds that it is unsure what caused the short circuit or when the plant could be put back online . sms / dpa / afp editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 06.07.2009 " iceland has been dealt with in a very rough manner " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eva joly will lead the investigation into iceland 's banking collapse iceland 's economy suffered a near total collapse when its banks were laid low by the global credit crunch .
the public lost their jobs and savings and now the government wants to know why . in an effort to thoroughly investigate the economic collapse and related crimes , the icelandic government has sought help from a prominent european figure . newly elected mep eva joly , the norwegian-born french magistrate who became famous as the lead judge in the elf aquitaine corruption scandal , acts as special adviser to iceland ‘ s authorities .
deutsche welle : ms joly , how would you compare this investigation with the elf aquitaine affair ?
eva joly : this is much huger , much much more important .
this bankruptcy is much bigger than enron , involving a lot of people , involving other banks , and really the investigation is huge .
what about the time and costs involved ?
it will probably be expensive .
i calculated that in order to pay for people and experts from abroad – and we need highly trained experts – we will need some three million euros a year .
and it will take a long time , it 's impossible to say how long at the moment .
that will depend on what kind of cooperation we will get from abroad and how far we will go .
but i think that we can reasonably say that within two or three years , we should have some cases ready to go to court .
if i judge by the elf case we could even spend up to seven years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people in iceland lost their savings when the banks collapsed why is it so important to spend time and money chasing " white collar criminals " ?
i think it is of the utmost important for iceland to carry out this investigation for the social contract to function .
for people to have the courage to go on to live here because what we see today is that people are full of despair and many of them are moving away .
they are taking jobs in norway and that must not happen .
people must stay , they must fight , they must fight for their culture and for justice , and i think here , like in all the nordic countries , the feeling of justice is very important - and today there is a total feeling of injustice .
we have a huge responsibility to show that the institutions are able to carry out this inquiry and that the culprits will be convicted .
only a couple of weeks ago you threatened to step down from your post .
what was the problem ?
well , you know , here in iceland it 's a very small country .
there are only 300.000 inhabitants and people are closely linked .
you always meet the wife of somebody , or the cousin , or the uncle .
so it happens that the state prosecutor 's son is involved in the inquiry , so he is inhabile and he did n't resign from his office and i was very much afraid of that because that could jeopardize the investigation .
so i asked for his resignation and i asked for more money to do the investigation and for more people .
i do not want to be an alibi .
because i am here , people think that this investigation is serious , so i must always ensure that things are done correctly .
extra staff will now be made available for you , including three independent prosecutors .
what about the state prosecutor , who will obviously have to stay out of the investigation ?
he does n't want to step down because he 's protected by law , you see , and this is normal in a democracy .
but this situation has not been foreseen by any law .
i think the possibility to have an ad hoc state prosecutor is meant for small cases , when one of your relatives is involved in stealing a little motorbike for instance that could be the case .
but when it is the whole economic system , all the institutions in the country are involved .
what sense does it have to say i will stay state prosecutor and be isolated and not be able to participate in the most important debates ?
how do you feel the european community has reacted to iceland 's financial collapse iceland has been dealt with in a very rough manner .
i think it was a european issue .
iceland is a member of the european economic community and it was our common bank system that was involved , the common regulators were involved and i think we could have sought a european solution for iceland !
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joining the eu could restore some calm to iceland what are your thoughts on eu membership for iceland ?
i think from the eu point of view that it would be very interesting for us to have iceland on board .
it 's a very old civilization and they have solid democratic traditions that would reinforce the nordic culture of transparency and good governance .
and they also have resources that are important for europe like energy and fish .
so i think it would be very nice for us - and also for them - to be part of the european union .

borisov , whose citizens for european development of bulgaria party -lrb- gerb -rrb- won just under half of the 240 seats up for grabs in sunday 's elections , says he wants to form a coalition that will prioritise the fight against corruption and boost the ailing economy .
gerb is widely expected to enter negotiations with the blue coalition , a group of rightist parties that collectively picked up 16 seats .
‘ batman ' borisov has also pledged to work towards the eradication of ethnic tensions in bulgaria .
" we want equality for christians and muslims and all ethnic groups living in bulgaria , " he said , adding that " anyone who raises the question of bulgaria 's ethnic map is working against democracy and the bulgarian citizens . "

" this decision -lsb- to lift the suspension -rsb- is a strong incentive for bulgaria to strengthen its efforts in all areas where funds are still suspended .
we need a future system that protects eu funding from any improper use . "
analysts say the new government must also quickly tackle economic policy issues to attract investors , many of whom fled this year , in part because of the global financial crisis .

at a press conference following their summit talks at the kremlin on monday , medvedev said moscow wanted a " fresh start ” in relations with washington despite persisting differences .
admitting that relations between the two sides were not at an optimal level , he said " our countries are aiming at cooperation commensurate with the 21st century .

borisov , whose citizens for european development of bulgaria party -lrb- gerb -rrb- won just under half of the 240 seats up for grabs in sunday 's elections , says he wants to form a coalition that will prioritise the fight against corruption and boost the ailing economy .
gerb is widely expected to enter negotiations with the blue coalition , a group of rightist parties that collectively picked up 16 seats .
‘ batman ' borisov has also pledged to work towards the eradication of ethnic tensions in bulgaria .
" we want equality for christians and muslims and all ethnic groups living in bulgaria , " he said , adding that " anyone who raises the question of bulgaria 's ethnic map is working against democracy and the bulgarian citizens . "
improving european relations besides dealing with pressing domestic issues , the incoming premier has plenty of work to do in improving strained relations with the european union . last year the eu froze 500 million euros -lrb- $ 700 million -rrb- in aid for the balkan nation amid concerns over rampant corruption .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels wants to know exactly how sofia is going to spend eu money although the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , has since granted sofia 115 million euros for a highway project and technical assistance , the commissioner for regional policy , danuta hubner , says bulgaria still has to a lot of work to do before it can access the remaining aid funds .
" this decision -lsb- to lift the suspension -rsb- is a strong incentive for bulgaria to strengthen its efforts in all areas where funds are still suspended .
we need a future system that protects eu funding from any improper use . "
analysts say the new government must also quickly tackle economic policy issues to attract investors , many of whom fled this year , in part because of the global financial crisis .

this followed summit talks at the kremlin on monday to " reset " bilateral relations . us president barack obama and his russian counterpart , dmitry medvedev , signed a " joint understanding " aimed at reducing the number of nuclear warheads held by each of their countries to between 1,500 and 1,675 , compared with the maximum 2,200 the existing strategic arms reduction treaty -lrb- start -rrb- between their two countries allows . the two sides are also to aim to reduce the number of missiles capable of delivering the warheads from the current maximum of 1,600 allowed for each side to between 500 and 1,100 .
at a press conference following their summit talks at the kremlin on monday , medvedev said moscow wanted a " fresh start ” in relations with washington despite persisting differences .
admitting that relations between the two sides were not at an optimal level , he said " our countries are aiming at cooperation commensurate with the 21st century . " agreeing to forge ahead with disarmament talks , the russian leader said showed that russia and the united states were facing up to their superpower responsibilities .
for his part , obama praised what he called russia 's contribution in stemming nuclear threats to the world .
“ we resolved to reset us-russian relations , ” he said at the joint press conference .
he stressed the joint efforts being made towards a follow-up to the start treaty , saying the two countries aimed to " lead by example " in cutting back their nuclear weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skepticism persists in both countries over what can be achieved building on recent progress while admitting that some of the differences between the two sides were not likely to simply fade away , the two leaders sought to highlight progress made in recent months .
" we are confident that we can continue to build on the excellent discussions that we had in london , ” obama said , adding : “ and that on a whole host of issues - including security issues , economic issues , energy issues , environmental issues - that the united states and russia have more in common than they have differences . ”
the two countries have agreed to set up a joint commission on some of these issues .
more notably , military cooperation , which suffered in the aftermath of the russia-georgia conflict last august , is to recommence .
obama said if the two sides were to continue to hard work in the next few days , they could make “ extraordinary progress that would benefit the people of both countries . "
echoing those sentiments , medvedev said not just their two countries but the rest of the world too would gain from better us-russian relations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korea continues its provocative actions security cooperation the us president also said that he and medvedev shared concerns over nuclear proliferation and related developments in countries like north korea and iran .
he said that the two sides had taken “ important steps forward to strengthen our security through greater cooperation , " adding that he and his russian counterpart agreed on the “ need to combat the threat of violent extremism , particularly from al-qaeda " .
in an important sign of growing security cooperation , moscow has agreed to allow us military planes to fly over russian territory to afghanistan , which in obama 's words , is a “ substantial contribution ” that will save the us “ time and resources ” in its afghanistan mission .
problems persist medvedev said he saw clear progress in talks with the us on missile defence as the obama administration was prepared to listen to russian concerns .
he described monday 's summit as a “ first but very important step ” toward revitalizing relations between the former cold war foes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama says the us is keen on talking to both russian leaders despite positive talk on both sides , even president medvedev admitted to the existence of some serious glitches .
us plans to install a missile defence system in poland and the czech republic which the previous bush administration said was aimed at countering threats from so-called “ rogue states ” like iran .
however , moscow is opposed to the plan and has urged obama to abandon it .

authorities say the initially peaceful protest turned violent when police attempted to break it up . hans-gert poettering , president of the european parliament , has expressed grave concern about the bloody clashes in xinjiang .
in a statement released by his office , poettering described reports about how the protests had been handled as " deeply disturbing . "
he called on both sides to exercise calm and restraint and urged the chinese authorities to fully respect human rights , " especially the right to freedom of expression and peaceful demonstration . "
in an interview with dw-tv , german human rights commissioner guenther nooke on monday also spoke out against the eruption of violence between china and uighurs in the xinjiang province .
deutsche welle : how does the german government view the events in the xinjiang province ?
guenther nooke : we have not been in a position to come to an official assessment because not enough information has been made available yet , but of course we know that there have been ongoing problems with the uighurs because they are seen by the leaders in beijing , and by the chinese in general , as suspected terrorists .
this has led to tensions between the han chinese and the uighurs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guenther nooke , germany 's human rights commissioner what sort of influence can the german government exercise ?
i think we have to call on the beijing leadership to act in accordance with the rule of law , even if there are grey areas , and properly investigate situations like the one in the toy factory in southern china , which seems to have sparked the unrest , and that they refrain from reacting with disproportionate force .
that is unacceptable , no matter what factors may have contributed to it , including the possibility that demonstrators committed acts of violence .

borisov , whose citizens for european development of bulgaria party -lrb- gerb -rrb- won just under half of the 240 seats up for grabs in sunday 's elections , says he wants to form a coalition that will prioritise the fight against corruption and boost the ailing economy .
gerb is widely expected to enter negotiations with the blue coalition , a group of rightist parties that collectively picked up 16 seats .
‘ batman ' borisov has also pledged to work towards the eradication of ethnic tensions in bulgaria .
" we want equality for christians and muslims and all ethnic groups living in bulgaria , " he said , adding that " anyone who raises the question of bulgaria 's ethnic map is working against democracy and the bulgarian citizens . "
improving european relations besides dealing with pressing domestic issues , the incoming premier has plenty of work to do in improving strained relations with the european union . last year the eu froze 500 million euros -lrb- $ 700 million -rrb- in aid for the balkan nation amid concerns over rampant corruption .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels wants to know exactly how sofia is going to spend eu money although the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , has since granted sofia 115 million euros for a highway project and technical assistance , the commissioner for regional policy , danuta hubner , says bulgaria still has to a lot of work to do before it can access the remaining aid funds .
" this decision -lsb- to lift the suspension -rsb- is a strong incentive for bulgaria to strengthen its efforts in all areas where funds are still suspended .
we need a future system that protects eu funding from any improper use . "
analysts say the new government must also quickly tackle economic policy issues to attract investors , many of whom fled this year , in part because of the global financial crisis .

barack obama wants talks in moscow to lead toward reductions . nuclear arms reduction has a prominent place on the agenda of the two-day summit in moscow between russia and the united states .
the issue is a political priority for us president barack obama , who gave a speech in prague in april in which he outlined his vision of a world free of nuclear weapons . for russia on the other hand , bilateral arms-reduction talks are one of the few issues around which moscow feels its clout and cold war history makes it an equal to its one-time rival . for some time , both times have , regarding the numbers at least , made significant progress in arms reduction .
in the mid-1960s , the us had more then 30,000 warheads in its arsenal ; the russians , 20 years later , had some 40,000 .
since then , the numbers on both sides have fallen to around 5,000 . most of these warheads have a explosive force of from 10 to 30 times that of the atomic bomb that was dropped on hiroshima in 1945 . start treaty at the end of this year , the most comprehensive nuclear reduction treaty ever signed , the 1991 start treaty , will expire .

borisov , whose citizens for european development of bulgaria party -lrb- gerb -rrb- won just under half of the 240 seats up for grabs in sunday 's elections , says he wants to form a coalition that will prioritise the fight against corruption and boost the ailing economy .
gerb is widely expected to enter negotiations with the blue coalition , a group of rightist parties that collectively picked up 16 seats .
‘ batman ' borisov has also pledged to work towards the eradication of ethnic tensions in bulgaria .
" we want equality for christians and muslims and all ethnic groups living in bulgaria , " he said , adding that " anyone who raises the question of bulgaria 's ethnic map is working against democracy and the bulgarian citizens . "
improving european relations besides dealing with pressing domestic issues , the incoming premier has plenty of work to do in improving strained relations with the european union . last year the eu froze 500 million euros -lrb- $ 700 million -rrb- in aid for the balkan nation amid concerns over rampant corruption .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels wants to know exactly how sofia is going to spend eu money although the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , has since granted sofia 115 million euros for a highway project and technical assistance , the commissioner for regional policy , danuta hubner , says bulgaria still has to a lot of work to do before it can access the remaining aid funds .
" this decision -lsb- to lift the suspension -rsb- is a strong incentive for bulgaria to strengthen its efforts in all areas where funds are still suspended .
we need a future system that protects eu funding from any improper use . "
analysts say the new government must also quickly tackle economic policy issues to attract investors , many of whom fled this year , in part because of the global financial crisis .

the public lost their jobs and savings and now the government wants to know why . in an effort to thoroughly investigate the economic collapse and related crimes , the icelandic government has sought help from a prominent european figure . newly elected mep eva joly , the norwegian-born french magistrate who became famous as the lead judge in the elf aquitaine corruption scandal , acts as special adviser to iceland ‘ s authorities .
deutsche welle : ms joly , how would you compare this investigation with the elf aquitaine affair ?
eva joly : this is much huger , much much more important .
this bankruptcy is much bigger than enron , involving a lot of people , involving other banks , and really the investigation is huge .
what about the time and costs involved ?
it will probably be expensive .
i calculated that in order to pay for people and experts from abroad – and we need highly trained experts – we will need some three million euros a year .
and it will take a long time , it 's impossible to say how long at the moment .
that will depend on what kind of cooperation we will get from abroad and how far we will go .
but i think that we can reasonably say that within two or three years , we should have some cases ready to go to court .
if i judge by the elf case we could even spend up to seven years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people in iceland lost their savings when the banks collapsed why is it so important to spend time and money chasing " white collar criminals " ?
i think it is of the utmost important for iceland to carry out this investigation for the social contract to function .
for people to have the courage to go on to live here because what we see today is that people are full of despair and many of them are moving away .
they are taking jobs in norway and that must not happen .
people must stay , they must fight , they must fight for their culture and for justice , and i think here , like in all the nordic countries , the feeling of justice is very important - and today there is a total feeling of injustice .
we have a huge responsibility to show that the institutions are able to carry out this inquiry and that the culprits will be convicted .
only a couple of weeks ago you threatened to step down from your post .
what was the problem ?
well , you know , here in iceland it 's a very small country .
there are only 300.000 inhabitants and people are closely linked .
you always meet the wife of somebody , or the cousin , or the uncle .
so it happens that the state prosecutor 's son is involved in the inquiry , so he is inhabile and he did n't resign from his office and i was very much afraid of that because that could jeopardize the investigation .
so i asked for his resignation and i asked for more money to do the investigation and for more people .
i do not want to be an alibi .
because i am here , people think that this investigation is serious , so i must always ensure that things are done correctly .
extra staff will now be made available for you , including three independent prosecutors .
what about the state prosecutor , who will obviously have to stay out of the investigation ?
he does n't want to step down because he 's protected by law , you see , and this is normal in a democracy .
but this situation has not been foreseen by any law .
i think the possibility to have an ad hoc state prosecutor is meant for small cases , when one of your relatives is involved in stealing a little motorbike for instance that could be the case .
but when it is the whole economic system , all the institutions in the country are involved .
what sense does it have to say i will stay state prosecutor and be isolated and not be able to participate in the most important debates ?
how do you feel the european community has reacted to iceland 's financial collapse iceland has been dealt with in a very rough manner .
i think it was a european issue .
iceland is a member of the european economic community and it was our common bank system that was involved , the common regulators were involved and i think we could have sought a european solution for iceland !
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joining the eu could restore some calm to iceland what are your thoughts on eu membership for iceland ?
i think from the eu point of view that it would be very interesting for us to have iceland on board .
it 's a very old civilization and they have solid democratic traditions that would reinforce the nordic culture of transparency and good governance .
and they also have resources that are important for europe like energy and fish .
so i think it would be very nice for us - and also for them - to be part of the european union .

only a couple of weeks ago you threatened to step down from your post .
what was the problem ?
well , you know , here in iceland it 's a very small country .
there are only 300.000 inhabitants and people are closely linked .
you always meet the wife of somebody , or the cousin , or the uncle .
so it happens that the state prosecutor 's son is involved in the inquiry , so he is inhabile and he did n't resign from his office and i was very much afraid of that because that could jeopardize the investigation .
so i asked for his resignation and i asked for more money to do the investigation and for more people .
i do not want to be an alibi .
because i am here , people think that this investigation is serious , so i must always ensure that things are done correctly .
extra staff will now be made available for you , including three independent prosecutors .
what about the state prosecutor , who will obviously have to stay out of the investigation ?
he does n't want to step down because he 's protected by law , you see , and this is normal in a democracy .
but this situation has not been foreseen by any law .
i think the possibility to have an ad hoc state prosecutor is meant for small cases , when one of your relatives is involved in stealing a little motorbike for instance that could be the case .
but when it is the whole economic system , all the institutions in the country are involved .
what sense does it have to say i will stay state prosecutor and be isolated and not be able to participate in the most important debates ?
how do you feel the european community has reacted to iceland 's financial collapse iceland has been dealt with in a very rough manner .
i think it was a european issue .
iceland is a member of the european economic community and it was our common bank system that was involved , the common regulators were involved and i think we could have sought a european solution for iceland !
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joining the eu could restore some calm to iceland what are your thoughts on eu membership for iceland ?
i think from the eu point of view that it would be very interesting for us to have iceland on board .
it 's a very old civilization and they have solid democratic traditions that would reinforce the nordic culture of transparency and good governance .
and they also have resources that are important for europe like energy and fish .
so i think it would be very nice for us - and also for them - to be part of the european union .

the public lost their jobs and savings and now the government wants to know why . in an effort to thoroughly investigate the economic collapse and related crimes , the icelandic government has sought help from a prominent european figure . newly elected mep eva joly , the norwegian-born french magistrate who became famous as the lead judge in the elf aquitaine corruption scandal , acts as special adviser to iceland ‘ s authorities .
deutsche welle : ms joly , how would you compare this investigation with the elf aquitaine affair ?
eva joly : this is much huger , much much more important .
this bankruptcy is much bigger than enron , involving a lot of people , involving other banks , and really the investigation is huge .
what about the time and costs involved ?
it will probably be expensive .
i calculated that in order to pay for people and experts from abroad – and we need highly trained experts – we will need some three million euros a year .
and it will take a long time , it 's impossible to say how long at the moment .
that will depend on what kind of cooperation we will get from abroad and how far we will go .
but i think that we can reasonably say that within two or three years , we should have some cases ready to go to court .
if i judge by the elf case we could even spend up to seven years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people in iceland lost their savings when the banks collapsed why is it so important to spend time and money chasing " white collar criminals " ?
i think it is of the utmost important for iceland to carry out this investigation for the social contract to function .
for people to have the courage to go on to live here because what we see today is that people are full of despair and many of them are moving away .
they are taking jobs in norway and that must not happen .
people must stay , they must fight , they must fight for their culture and for justice , and i think here , like in all the nordic countries , the feeling of justice is very important - and today there is a total feeling of injustice .

barack obama wants talks in moscow to lead toward reductions . nuclear arms reduction has a prominent place on the agenda of the two-day summit in moscow between russia and the united states .
the issue is a political priority for us president barack obama , who gave a speech in prague in april in which he outlined his vision of a world free of nuclear weapons . for russia on the other hand , bilateral arms-reduction talks are one of the few issues around which moscow feels its clout and cold war history makes it an equal to its one-time rival . for some time , both times have , regarding the numbers at least , made significant progress in arms reduction .
in the mid-1960s , the us had more then 30,000 warheads in its arsenal ; the russians , 20 years later , had some 40,000 .

barack obama wants talks in moscow to lead toward reductions . nuclear arms reduction has a prominent place on the agenda of the two-day summit in moscow between russia and the united states .
the issue is a political priority for us president barack obama , who gave a speech in prague in april in which he outlined his vision of a world free of nuclear weapons . for russia on the other hand , bilateral arms-reduction talks are one of the few issues around which moscow feels its clout and cold war history makes it an equal to its one-time rival . for some time , both times have , regarding the numbers at least , made significant progress in arms reduction .
in the mid-1960s , the us had more then 30,000 warheads in its arsenal ; the russians , 20 years later , had some 40,000 .
since then , the numbers on both sides have fallen to around 5,000 . most of these warheads have a explosive force of from 10 to 30 times that of the atomic bomb that was dropped on hiroshima in 1945 . start treaty at the end of this year , the most comprehensive nuclear reduction treaty ever signed , the 1991 start treaty , will expire .
start -lrb- later renamed start i -rrb- put an upper limit of 6,000 battle-ready nuclear warheads and some 1,600 launching systems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president george bush and soviet president gorbachev at the signing of start in 1991 in addition to start , both sides signed off on the " treaty of moscow " in 2002 .
it sees a further reduction on both sides to 1,700 to 2,000 operational strategic warheads . however , the moscow document calls on verification of the agreements to be based on the procedures outlined in start , which is considered impractical by both the us and russia .
in addition , it says nothing about the development of new missiles with multiple warheads . in order to move forward with nuclear disarmament , a new version or an extension of the start treaty is necessary . by the numbers the american nuclear arsenal has , according to recent figures put out by the american " bulletin of the atomic scientists , " already reached the upper limit of 2,200 set by the treaty of moscow .
half of us launch systems are intercontinental missiles stationed on submarines , one-fourth are land-based intercontinental missiles and another one-fourth are long-range bombers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president obama in prague calling for a nuclear weapon-free world us scientists count some 2,500 warheads in america 's active reserve , as well as 500 non-strategic nuclear weapons , mostly found in us bases in europe .

the public lost their jobs and savings and now the government wants to know why . in an effort to thoroughly investigate the economic collapse and related crimes , the icelandic government has sought help from a prominent european figure . newly elected mep eva joly , the norwegian-born french magistrate who became famous as the lead judge in the elf aquitaine corruption scandal , acts as special adviser to iceland ‘ s authorities .
deutsche welle : ms joly , how would you compare this investigation with the elf aquitaine affair ?
eva joly : this is much huger , much much more important .
this bankruptcy is much bigger than enron , involving a lot of people , involving other banks , and really the investigation is huge .
what about the time and costs involved ?
it will probably be expensive .
i calculated that in order to pay for people and experts from abroad – and we need highly trained experts – we will need some three million euros a year .
and it will take a long time , it 's impossible to say how long at the moment .
that will depend on what kind of cooperation we will get from abroad and how far we will go .
but i think that we can reasonably say that within two or three years , we should have some cases ready to go to court .
if i judge by the elf case we could even spend up to seven years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people in iceland lost their savings when the banks collapsed why is it so important to spend time and money chasing " white collar criminals " ?
i think it is of the utmost important for iceland to carry out this investigation for the social contract to function .
for people to have the courage to go on to live here because what we see today is that people are full of despair and many of them are moving away .
they are taking jobs in norway and that must not happen .
people must stay , they must fight , they must fight for their culture and for justice , and i think here , like in all the nordic countries , the feeling of justice is very important - and today there is a total feeling of injustice .
we have a huge responsibility to show that the institutions are able to carry out this inquiry and that the culprits will be convicted .
only a couple of weeks ago you threatened to step down from your post .
what was the problem ?
well , you know , here in iceland it 's a very small country .
there are only 300.000 inhabitants and people are closely linked .
you always meet the wife of somebody , or the cousin , or the uncle .
so it happens that the state prosecutor 's son is involved in the inquiry , so he is inhabile and he did n't resign from his office and i was very much afraid of that because that could jeopardize the investigation .
so i asked for his resignation and i asked for more money to do the investigation and for more people .
i do not want to be an alibi .
because i am here , people think that this investigation is serious , so i must always ensure that things are done correctly .
extra staff will now be made available for you , including three independent prosecutors .
what about the state prosecutor , who will obviously have to stay out of the investigation ?
he does n't want to step down because he 's protected by law , you see , and this is normal in a democracy .
but this situation has not been foreseen by any law .
i think the possibility to have an ad hoc state prosecutor is meant for small cases , when one of your relatives is involved in stealing a little motorbike for instance that could be the case .
but when it is the whole economic system , all the institutions in the country are involved .
what sense does it have to say i will stay state prosecutor and be isolated and not be able to participate in the most important debates ?
how do you feel the european community has reacted to iceland 's financial collapse iceland has been dealt with in a very rough manner .
i think it was a european issue .
iceland is a member of the european economic community and it was our common bank system that was involved , the common regulators were involved and i think we could have sought a european solution for iceland !
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joining the eu could restore some calm to iceland what are your thoughts on eu membership for iceland ?
i think from the eu point of view that it would be very interesting for us to have iceland on board .
it 's a very old civilization and they have solid democratic traditions that would reinforce the nordic culture of transparency and good governance .
and they also have resources that are important for europe like energy and fish .
so i think it would be very nice for us - and also for them - to be part of the european union .

russia released a new security strategy in may , taking another look at threats , both old and new . us president obama has said the us needs to reset its relationship with russia , which faces a series of challenges , including a public suspicious of us motives , a kremlin with two men at the helm and hard feelings on a variety of issues . russia is also talking about improving ties with its former adversary , and has been doing some resetting of its own , primarily regarding its security doctrine .
russian president dmitry medvedev signed a decree in may on the country 's national security strategy , which is meant to be a general guide for russian domestic and foreign policy until 2020 . that policy still mentions threats dating from the cold war era .
but for the first time in recent russian history , the country 's national security is not perceived as being threatened primarily by dangers from outside or being dependent on its own defensive capabilities . " the most important tasks and , at the same time , the most serious dangers are to be found inside the country , " said dmitry suslov , the deputy research director of the moscow-based council for foreign and defense policy .
" that means there 's a need for modernization , a more effective system of state intervention , fighting corruption , and so on . " the transition from perceived external threats to a new look at home-grown dangers is a natural development , especially as the new us administration has worked to diffuse some of the tensions that had grown over recent years between the old cold war sparring partners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president dmitry medvedev chaired a national security council meeting discussing russia 's security strategy " it 's a normal development , because -lrb- russia 's -rrb- relations with the west have improved over the last weeks or months since obama took office , " said alexander rahr , russia analyst at the german council on foreign relations . the new security document largely puts the focus on economic and social categories , for example , economic growth , health care , science , education , culture and quality of life .
it lays out the ambitious goal , especially given the state of today 's russia , of becoming a world leader in these areas .
one particular threat for national security is unemployment , the widening gap between rich and poor , population decreases and rising domestic prices . energy security the issue of russia 's energy future and security is also emphasized in the document .
moscow predicts that the international quest for access to energy sources will become more intense - in the barents sea , around the antarctic , the caspian region and in central asia . since russia considers military intervention possibly being used in the struggle for energy , it also sees an additional threat to russia 's borders . the kremlin openly describes its own enormous energy reserves as a way to bring the country closer to its ultimate goal - regaining its status as a superpower . old foes despite the change in focus , some security concerns have stayed the same , especially regarding foreign policy .
the asia-pacific region is almost a blank spot on the map for russia , despite its border with an ever-more powerful china . the foreign threat scenarios often concern the " usual suspects , " the us and nato , although they are not mentioned by name .
this might well be a topic of conversation between medvedev and obama . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : america 's planned missile defense system has been a bone of contention between washington and moscow the security document complains of the absence of a robust international security architecture and the quest for military superiority .
besides the modernization of nuclear arsenals , the document mentions the development of high-tech weapons , the militarization of outer space , strategic armaments in non-nuclear areas , the creation of a missile defense system partly stationed in eastern europe . the list is clearly referring to the us , which russia still sees as the principle threat to its security . " regarding foreign policy everything is being repeated which was said in the past , " said rahr .
" russia is against the eastern expansion of nato , and therefore certain western countries - unnamed - which would challenge russia on its western border , are being heavily criticized . " nato fears while the document says nato expansion to russia 's borders is not acceptable , almost in the same breath moscow names nato as a strategic partner necessary for the maintenance of international security . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow is suspicious of nato but needs it as an strategic partner " the -lrb- nato -rrb- block is a partner for russia since it is working on solving problems that are essential for russia 's security , such as afghanistan , " said analyst suslov .
" furthermore , nato is a central pillar of euro-atlantic security apparatus , whether russia likes it or not .
if russia wants to participate in such a system , it will have to work on its relations with nato . " the relationship with the us is similarly paradoxical .
although america is seen as a threat , russia is also seeking a strategic partnership of equals and wants to cooperate on the fight against terrorism and non-proliferation . " dmitry medvedev has to position himself on a foreign policy level , " said rahr .

the public lost their jobs and savings and now the government wants to know why . in an effort to thoroughly investigate the economic collapse and related crimes , the icelandic government has sought help from a prominent european figure . newly elected mep eva joly , the norwegian-born french magistrate who became famous as the lead judge in the elf aquitaine corruption scandal , acts as special adviser to iceland ‘ s authorities .
deutsche welle : ms joly , how would you compare this investigation with the elf aquitaine affair ?
eva joly : this is much huger , much much more important .
this bankruptcy is much bigger than enron , involving a lot of people , involving other banks , and really the investigation is huge .
what about the time and costs involved ?
it will probably be expensive .
i calculated that in order to pay for people and experts from abroad – and we need highly trained experts – we will need some three million euros a year .
and it will take a long time , it 's impossible to say how long at the moment .
that will depend on what kind of cooperation we will get from abroad and how far we will go .
but i think that we can reasonably say that within two or three years , we should have some cases ready to go to court .
if i judge by the elf case we could even spend up to seven years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people in iceland lost their savings when the banks collapsed why is it so important to spend time and money chasing " white collar criminals " ?
i think it is of the utmost important for iceland to carry out this investigation for the social contract to function .
for people to have the courage to go on to live here because what we see today is that people are full of despair and many of them are moving away .
they are taking jobs in norway and that must not happen .
people must stay , they must fight , they must fight for their culture and for justice , and i think here , like in all the nordic countries , the feeling of justice is very important - and today there is a total feeling of injustice .
we have a huge responsibility to show that the institutions are able to carry out this inquiry and that the culprits will be convicted .
only a couple of weeks ago you threatened to step down from your post .
what was the problem ?
well , you know , here in iceland it 's a very small country .
there are only 300.000 inhabitants and people are closely linked .
you always meet the wife of somebody , or the cousin , or the uncle .
so it happens that the state prosecutor 's son is involved in the inquiry , so he is inhabile and he did n't resign from his office and i was very much afraid of that because that could jeopardize the investigation .
so i asked for his resignation and i asked for more money to do the investigation and for more people .
i do not want to be an alibi .
because i am here , people think that this investigation is serious , so i must always ensure that things are done correctly .
extra staff will now be made available for you , including three independent prosecutors .
what about the state prosecutor , who will obviously have to stay out of the investigation ?
he does n't want to step down because he 's protected by law , you see , and this is normal in a democracy .
but this situation has not been foreseen by any law .
i think the possibility to have an ad hoc state prosecutor is meant for small cases , when one of your relatives is involved in stealing a little motorbike for instance that could be the case .
but when it is the whole economic system , all the institutions in the country are involved .
what sense does it have to say i will stay state prosecutor and be isolated and not be able to participate in the most important debates ?
how do you feel the european community has reacted to iceland 's financial collapse iceland has been dealt with in a very rough manner .
i think it was a european issue .
iceland is a member of the european economic community and it was our common bank system that was involved , the common regulators were involved and i think we could have sought a european solution for iceland !
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joining the eu could restore some calm to iceland what are your thoughts on eu membership for iceland ?
i think from the eu point of view that it would be very interesting for us to have iceland on board .
it 's a very old civilization and they have solid democratic traditions that would reinforce the nordic culture of transparency and good governance .
and they also have resources that are important for europe like energy and fish .
so i think it would be very nice for us - and also for them - to be part of the european union .

as he went into the meeting , held at peres ' private residence , steinmeier said he had high hopes of the new us administration in the context of the middle east .
" i hope we are on the verge of a fresh start , " he said , " a fresh start that has been made possible by the initiative of the us president – a decisive , fervent call for a two-state solution made not only to israel and the palestinians but also to their arab neighbors . "
he said it was crucial to encourage " moderate arab states " to work together to secure peace in the region , adding that germany and europe would do everything they could to support the goal .
" i will continue to press for israel 's difficult neighbors – in syria and in lebanon – to participate constructively in these efforts towards a two-state solution , " he told reporters .
security a pre-requisite for peace steinmeier stressed that israel would need to stop settlement construction in the palestinian territories in order to move its arab neighbors to support the initiative for regional peace , but also said the security of the israeli people was a " clear pre-condition " for all talks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier met the israeli president shimon peres on his arrival in israel steinmeier has been among world leaders who have criticized israeli settlement building programs in east jerusalem and the west bank .
some observers say germany is aware that it does not have the influence to broker middle east peace on its own , but that steinmeier clearly wants to be part of the obama administration 's efforts in that direction .
whistle-stop meetings the foreign minister , who is also deputy chancellor , was originally scheduled to visit the west bank town of ramallah , but the appointment was cancelled after palestinian president mahmoud abbas was called away to jordan on short notice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel 's prime minister , benjamin netanyahu will meet steinmeier later today later on monday , steinmeier was to meet with israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu , foreign minister avigdor lieberman and opposition leader tzipi livni .
on tuesday he is to travel to syria and lebanon .
steinmeier 's trip comes ahead of next week 's g8 summit in italy .
chancellor angela merkel indicated last week that the middle east conflict would figure prominently in those talks .
she said " concessions from all sides are necessary , " for the peace process to succeed .
calling for a halt to the construction of israeli settlements , merkel said " there has to be a freeze .
otherwise i am convinced we will not achieve the two-state solution that we urgently need - a jewish state of israel and a palestinian state that can live in security .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 06.07.2009 " iceland has been dealt with in a very rough manner " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eva joly will lead the investigation into iceland 's banking collapse iceland 's economy suffered a near total collapse when its banks were laid low by the global credit crunch .
the public lost their jobs and savings and now the government wants to know why . in an effort to thoroughly investigate the economic collapse and related crimes , the icelandic government has sought help from a prominent european figure . newly elected mep eva joly , the norwegian-born french magistrate who became famous as the lead judge in the elf aquitaine corruption scandal , acts as special adviser to iceland ‘ s authorities .
deutsche welle : ms joly , how would you compare this investigation with the elf aquitaine affair ?
eva joly : this is much huger , much much more important .
this bankruptcy is much bigger than enron , involving a lot of people , involving other banks , and really the investigation is huge .
what about the time and costs involved ?
it will probably be expensive .
i calculated that in order to pay for people and experts from abroad – and we need highly trained experts – we will need some three million euros a year .
and it will take a long time , it 's impossible to say how long at the moment .
that will depend on what kind of cooperation we will get from abroad and how far we will go .
but i think that we can reasonably say that within two or three years , we should have some cases ready to go to court .
if i judge by the elf case we could even spend up to seven years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people in iceland lost their savings when the banks collapsed why is it so important to spend time and money chasing " white collar criminals " ?
i think it is of the utmost important for iceland to carry out this investigation for the social contract to function .
for people to have the courage to go on to live here because what we see today is that people are full of despair and many of them are moving away .
they are taking jobs in norway and that must not happen .
people must stay , they must fight , they must fight for their culture and for justice , and i think here , like in all the nordic countries , the feeling of justice is very important - and today there is a total feeling of injustice .
we have a huge responsibility to show that the institutions are able to carry out this inquiry and that the culprits will be convicted .
only a couple of weeks ago you threatened to step down from your post .
what was the problem ?
well , you know , here in iceland it 's a very small country .
there are only 300.000 inhabitants and people are closely linked .
you always meet the wife of somebody , or the cousin , or the uncle .
so it happens that the state prosecutor 's son is involved in the inquiry , so he is inhabile and he did n't resign from his office and i was very much afraid of that because that could jeopardize the investigation .
so i asked for his resignation and i asked for more money to do the investigation and for more people .
i do not want to be an alibi .
because i am here , people think that this investigation is serious , so i must always ensure that things are done correctly .
extra staff will now be made available for you , including three independent prosecutors .
what about the state prosecutor , who will obviously have to stay out of the investigation ?
he does n't want to step down because he 's protected by law , you see , and this is normal in a democracy .
but this situation has not been foreseen by any law .
i think the possibility to have an ad hoc state prosecutor is meant for small cases , when one of your relatives is involved in stealing a little motorbike for instance that could be the case .
but when it is the whole economic system , all the institutions in the country are involved .
what sense does it have to say i will stay state prosecutor and be isolated and not be able to participate in the most important debates ?
how do you feel the european community has reacted to iceland 's financial collapse iceland has been dealt with in a very rough manner .
i think it was a european issue .
iceland is a member of the european economic community and it was our common bank system that was involved , the common regulators were involved and i think we could have sought a european solution for iceland !
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joining the eu could restore some calm to iceland what are your thoughts on eu membership for iceland ?
i think from the eu point of view that it would be very interesting for us to have iceland on board .
it 's a very old civilization and they have solid democratic traditions that would reinforce the nordic culture of transparency and good governance .
and they also have resources that are important for europe like energy and fish .
so i think it would be very nice for us - and also for them - to be part of the european union .

dw looks back at a series of events surrounding the facility . shut down after a fire in june 2007 and only back online since june 19 , 2009 , the kruemmel nuclear power plant in northern germany was automatically brought to a standstill on saturday . run by vattenfall , ownership of the kruemmel plant is split with half of the plant belonging to the swedish energy giant and the other half owned by germany 's eon .
the two companies also jointly own the brunsbuettel nuclear power plant , with two-thirds in vattenfall 's hands , and share ownership of the brokdorf nuclear power plant , which is operated by eon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a pair of vattenfall-run nuclear power plants were shut down on june 28 , 2007 june 28 , 2007 : vattenfall announces that the kruemmel power plant was taken offline after a fire occurred in a transformer outside the reactor building .
shortly before the announcement , the company also said that , in a separate incident , a short-circuit led to the temporary shut-down of its nuclear power plant in brunsbuettel . june 30 , 2007 : vattenfall officials say neither of the incidents was connected to the parts of the plants responsible for nuclear power production . july 1 , 2007 : brunsbuettel goes back online but is put on stand-by after two weeks due to a transformer problem . july 3 , 2007 : the energy company says the quick shutdown in kruemmel caused a pump malfunction . july 6 , 2007 : a state nuclear regulatory agency releases information showing that smoke from the kruemmel fire clouded the control room , the plant 's internal energy supply was temporarily affected and not all relevant computer files regarding the incident were saved .
in its first press conference after the failures occurred , vattenfall admits errors were made and says misunderstandings among personnel caused the mistakes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vattenfall was criticized for not quickly sharing information about the failures july 8 , 2007 : contrary to company reports , the regulatory agency says breakdowns occurred when the brunsbuettel plant was powered back up at the beginning of the month . july 14 , 2007 : in a preliminary report , vattenfall says it should have been more open with information about the fires .
two days later , the head of the company 's nuclear division is relieved of his duties and the company 's spokesman resigns . july 18 , 2007 : vattenfall europe head klaus rauscher also resigns . july 21 , 2007 : incorrectly installed wall anchors at the brunsbuettel plant lead to the facility 's complete shutdown . feb .
4 , 2008 : a smoldering fire in the kruemmel reactor 's ventilation system is extinguished immediately after starting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the brunsbuettel facility went into operation in 1976 feb .
20 , 2008 : a defective electronic card leads to a transformer in the brunsbuettel emergency power system to shut down . may 18 , 2009 : a diesel motor in the brunsbuettel plant malfunctions during planned maintenance .
a leak is also found in the cooling system . june 19 , 2009 : after nearly two years off the power grid , the kruemmel plant is put back online .
the company says many improvements had been made to the plant 's transformers to prevent short circuits and minimize their impact should they occur . july 1 , 2009 : a malfunction in one of two transformators responsible for connecting the power plant to the grid leads to the kruemmel facility 's automatic shutdown .
the plant is put back online in a matter of hours and expected to be back at full power production by july 5 .
human error is reported to be responsible for the break down . july 4 , 2009 : kruemmel undergoes a quick shutdown after a short circuit in a transformator . july 5 , 2009 : vattenfall apologizes for not informing the state regulatory agency as required and says " safety must always come before speed " in deciding when the kruemmel plant will be turned back on .
the company adds that it is unsure what caused the short circuit or when the plant could be put back online . sms / dpa / afp editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 06.07.2009 " iceland has been dealt with in a very rough manner " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eva joly will lead the investigation into iceland 's banking collapse iceland 's economy suffered a near total collapse when its banks were laid low by the global credit crunch .
the public lost their jobs and savings and now the government wants to know why . in an effort to thoroughly investigate the economic collapse and related crimes , the icelandic government has sought help from a prominent european figure . newly elected mep eva joly , the norwegian-born french magistrate who became famous as the lead judge in the elf aquitaine corruption scandal , acts as special adviser to iceland ‘ s authorities .
deutsche welle : ms joly , how would you compare this investigation with the elf aquitaine affair ?
eva joly : this is much huger , much much more important .
this bankruptcy is much bigger than enron , involving a lot of people , involving other banks , and really the investigation is huge .
what about the time and costs involved ?
it will probably be expensive .
i calculated that in order to pay for people and experts from abroad – and we need highly trained experts – we will need some three million euros a year .
and it will take a long time , it 's impossible to say how long at the moment .
that will depend on what kind of cooperation we will get from abroad and how far we will go .
but i think that we can reasonably say that within two or three years , we should have some cases ready to go to court .
if i judge by the elf case we could even spend up to seven years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people in iceland lost their savings when the banks collapsed why is it so important to spend time and money chasing " white collar criminals " ?
i think it is of the utmost important for iceland to carry out this investigation for the social contract to function .
for people to have the courage to go on to live here because what we see today is that people are full of despair and many of them are moving away .
they are taking jobs in norway and that must not happen .
people must stay , they must fight , they must fight for their culture and for justice , and i think here , like in all the nordic countries , the feeling of justice is very important - and today there is a total feeling of injustice .
we have a huge responsibility to show that the institutions are able to carry out this inquiry and that the culprits will be convicted .
only a couple of weeks ago you threatened to step down from your post .
what was the problem ?
well , you know , here in iceland it 's a very small country .
there are only 300.000 inhabitants and people are closely linked .
you always meet the wife of somebody , or the cousin , or the uncle .
so it happens that the state prosecutor 's son is involved in the inquiry , so he is inhabile and he did n't resign from his office and i was very much afraid of that because that could jeopardize the investigation .
so i asked for his resignation and i asked for more money to do the investigation and for more people .
i do not want to be an alibi .
because i am here , people think that this investigation is serious , so i must always ensure that things are done correctly .
extra staff will now be made available for you , including three independent prosecutors .
what about the state prosecutor , who will obviously have to stay out of the investigation ?
he does n't want to step down because he 's protected by law , you see , and this is normal in a democracy .
but this situation has not been foreseen by any law .
i think the possibility to have an ad hoc state prosecutor is meant for small cases , when one of your relatives is involved in stealing a little motorbike for instance that could be the case .
but when it is the whole economic system , all the institutions in the country are involved .
what sense does it have to say i will stay state prosecutor and be isolated and not be able to participate in the most important debates ?
how do you feel the european community has reacted to iceland 's financial collapse iceland has been dealt with in a very rough manner .
i think it was a european issue .
iceland is a member of the european economic community and it was our common bank system that was involved , the common regulators were involved and i think we could have sought a european solution for iceland !
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joining the eu could restore some calm to iceland what are your thoughts on eu membership for iceland ?
i think from the eu point of view that it would be very interesting for us to have iceland on board .
it 's a very old civilization and they have solid democratic traditions that would reinforce the nordic culture of transparency and good governance .
and they also have resources that are important for europe like energy and fish .
so i think it would be very nice for us - and also for them - to be part of the european union .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 06.07.2009 us-russian arms control deal on agenda in moscow großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear stockpile numbers in both the us and russia have fallen greatly from cold war heights the us and russia have far fewer nuclear warheads than they did at the height of the cold war , but the two countries still have large arsenals .
barack obama wants talks in moscow to lead toward reductions . nuclear arms reduction has a prominent place on the agenda of the two-day summit in moscow between russia and the united states .
the issue is a political priority for us president barack obama , who gave a speech in prague in april in which he outlined his vision of a world free of nuclear weapons . for russia on the other hand , bilateral arms-reduction talks are one of the few issues around which moscow feels its clout and cold war history makes it an equal to its one-time rival . for some time , both times have , regarding the numbers at least , made significant progress in arms reduction .
in the mid-1960s , the us had more then 30,000 warheads in its arsenal ; the russians , 20 years later , had some 40,000 .
since then , the numbers on both sides have fallen to around 5,000 . most of these warheads have a explosive force of from 10 to 30 times that of the atomic bomb that was dropped on hiroshima in 1945 . start treaty at the end of this year , the most comprehensive nuclear reduction treaty ever signed , the 1991 start treaty , will expire .
start -lrb- later renamed start i -rrb- put an upper limit of 6,000 battle-ready nuclear warheads and some 1,600 launching systems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president george bush and soviet president gorbachev at the signing of start in 1991 in addition to start , both sides signed off on the " treaty of moscow " in 2002 .
it sees a further reduction on both sides to 1,700 to 2,000 operational strategic warheads . however , the moscow document calls on verification of the agreements to be based on the procedures outlined in start , which is considered impractical by both the us and russia .
in addition , it says nothing about the development of new missiles with multiple warheads . in order to move forward with nuclear disarmament , a new version or an extension of the start treaty is necessary . by the numbers the american nuclear arsenal has , according to recent figures put out by the american " bulletin of the atomic scientists , " already reached the upper limit of 2,200 set by the treaty of moscow .
half of us launch systems are intercontinental missiles stationed on submarines , one-fourth are land-based intercontinental missiles and another one-fourth are long-range bombers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president obama in prague calling for a nuclear weapon-free world us scientists count some 2,500 warheads in america 's active reserve , as well as 500 non-strategic nuclear weapons , mostly found in us bases in europe .
the total : around 5,200 nuclear warheads .
more than 4,000 additional ones are on a waiting list to be decommissioned . the russian nuclear stockpile contains just under 2,800 strategic operational warheads , of which half are on land-based intercontinental missiles .
the other half are on long-range bombers and submarines . in addition , russia possesses 2,000 non-strategic nuclear weapons , mostly missile and anti-aircraft systems as well as tactical atomic weapons such as guided missiles .
another 8,000 warheads are held in reserve or are candidates for decommissioning . missile shield hurdle despite the reductions in their nuclear arsenals by both the us and russia , an agreement on a new arms control treaty mandating further cuts -down to 1,500 warheads - will not be easily attained . besides details such as how launch systems would be included in the equation , the biggest hurdle is the new missile-shield project planned by the us in eastern europe . bildunterschrift : the 2008 signing of an agreement to base missile interceptors in poland was not to russia 's liking the plans were developed under obama 's predecessor , george w. bush .
according to the us , the system would be designed to intercept the small number of missiles that might be launched from countries such as iran or north korea . moscow , however , considers the planned missile and radar facilities close to its western border as a threat to its security and as something that would undermine its own nuclear deterrent potential . if the us does not abandon its plans for missile facilities in poland and the czech republic , moscow signaled as recently as this past weekend , the kremlin would not sign off on any successor to the start treaty . author : hans spross -lrb- jam -rrb- editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this followed summit talks at the kremlin on monday to " reset " bilateral relations . us president barack obama and his russian counterpart , dmitry medvedev , signed a " joint understanding " aimed at reducing the number of nuclear warheads held by each of their countries to between 1,500 and 1,675 , compared with the maximum 2,200 the existing strategic arms reduction treaty -lrb- start -rrb- between their two countries allows . the two sides are also to aim to reduce the number of missiles capable of delivering the warheads from the current maximum of 1,600 allowed for each side to between 500 and 1,100 .
at a press conference following their summit talks at the kremlin on monday , medvedev said moscow wanted a " fresh start ” in relations with washington despite persisting differences .
admitting that relations between the two sides were not at an optimal level , he said " our countries are aiming at cooperation commensurate with the 21st century . " agreeing to forge ahead with disarmament talks , the russian leader said showed that russia and the united states were facing up to their superpower responsibilities .
for his part , obama praised what he called russia 's contribution in stemming nuclear threats to the world .
“ we resolved to reset us-russian relations , ” he said at the joint press conference .
he stressed the joint efforts being made towards a follow-up to the start treaty , saying the two countries aimed to " lead by example " in cutting back their nuclear weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skepticism persists in both countries over what can be achieved building on recent progress while admitting that some of the differences between the two sides were not likely to simply fade away , the two leaders sought to highlight progress made in recent months .
" we are confident that we can continue to build on the excellent discussions that we had in london , ” obama said , adding : “ and that on a whole host of issues - including security issues , economic issues , energy issues , environmental issues - that the united states and russia have more in common than they have differences . ”
the two countries have agreed to set up a joint commission on some of these issues .
more notably , military cooperation , which suffered in the aftermath of the russia-georgia conflict last august , is to recommence .
obama said if the two sides were to continue to hard work in the next few days , they could make “ extraordinary progress that would benefit the people of both countries . "
echoing those sentiments , medvedev said not just their two countries but the rest of the world too would gain from better us-russian relations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korea continues its provocative actions security cooperation the us president also said that he and medvedev shared concerns over nuclear proliferation and related developments in countries like north korea and iran .
he said that the two sides had taken “ important steps forward to strengthen our security through greater cooperation , " adding that he and his russian counterpart agreed on the “ need to combat the threat of violent extremism , particularly from al-qaeda " .
in an important sign of growing security cooperation , moscow has agreed to allow us military planes to fly over russian territory to afghanistan , which in obama 's words , is a “ substantial contribution ” that will save the us “ time and resources ” in its afghanistan mission .
problems persist medvedev said he saw clear progress in talks with the us on missile defence as the obama administration was prepared to listen to russian concerns .
he described monday 's summit as a “ first but very important step ” toward revitalizing relations between the former cold war foes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama says the us is keen on talking to both russian leaders despite positive talk on both sides , even president medvedev admitted to the existence of some serious glitches .
us plans to install a missile defence system in poland and the czech republic which the previous bush administration said was aimed at countering threats from so-called “ rogue states ” like iran .
however , moscow is opposed to the plan and has urged obama to abandon it .

admitting that relations between the two sides were not at an optimal level , he said " our countries are aiming at cooperation commensurate with the 21st century . " agreeing to forge ahead with disarmament talks , the russian leader said showed that russia and the united states were facing up to their superpower responsibilities .
for his part , obama praised what he called russia 's contribution in stemming nuclear threats to the world .

the two countries have agreed to set up a joint commission on some of these issues .
more notably , military cooperation , which suffered in the aftermath of the russia-georgia conflict last august , is to recommence .
obama said if the two sides were to continue to hard work in the next few days , they could make “ extraordinary progress that would benefit the people of both countries . "

admitting that relations between the two sides were not at an optimal level , he said " our countries are aiming at cooperation commensurate with the 21st century . " agreeing to forge ahead with disarmament talks , the russian leader said showed that russia and the united states were facing up to their superpower responsibilities .
for his part , obama praised what he called russia 's contribution in stemming nuclear threats to the world .
“ we resolved to reset us-russian relations , ” he said at the joint press conference .
he stressed the joint efforts being made towards a follow-up to the start treaty , saying the two countries aimed to " lead by example " in cutting back their nuclear weapons .

" we are confident that we can continue to build on the excellent discussions that we had in london , ” obama said , adding : “ and that on a whole host of issues - including security issues , economic issues , energy issues , environmental issues - that the united states and russia have more in common than they have differences . ”
the two countries have agreed to set up a joint commission on some of these issues .
more notably , military cooperation , which suffered in the aftermath of the russia-georgia conflict last august , is to recommence .
obama said if the two sides were to continue to hard work in the next few days , they could make “ extraordinary progress that would benefit the people of both countries . "
echoing those sentiments , medvedev said not just their two countries but the rest of the world too would gain from better us-russian relations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korea continues its provocative actions security cooperation the us president also said that he and medvedev shared concerns over nuclear proliferation and related developments in countries like north korea and iran .
he said that the two sides had taken “ important steps forward to strengthen our security through greater cooperation , " adding that he and his russian counterpart agreed on the “ need to combat the threat of violent extremism , particularly from al-qaeda " .
in an important sign of growing security cooperation , moscow has agreed to allow us military planes to fly over russian territory to afghanistan , which in obama 's words , is a “ substantial contribution ” that will save the us “ time and resources ” in its afghanistan mission .
problems persist medvedev said he saw clear progress in talks with the us on missile defence as the obama administration was prepared to listen to russian concerns .
he described monday 's summit as a “ first but very important step ” toward revitalizing relations between the former cold war foes .

russia released a new security strategy in may , taking another look at threats , both old and new . us president obama has said the us needs to reset its relationship with russia , which faces a series of challenges , including a public suspicious of us motives , a kremlin with two men at the helm and hard feelings on a variety of issues . russia is also talking about improving ties with its former adversary , and has been doing some resetting of its own , primarily regarding its security doctrine .
russian president dmitry medvedev signed a decree in may on the country 's national security strategy , which is meant to be a general guide for russian domestic and foreign policy until 2020 . that policy still mentions threats dating from the cold war era .
but for the first time in recent russian history , the country 's national security is not perceived as being threatened primarily by dangers from outside or being dependent on its own defensive capabilities . " the most important tasks and , at the same time , the most serious dangers are to be found inside the country , " said dmitry suslov , the deputy research director of the moscow-based council for foreign and defense policy .
" that means there 's a need for modernization , a more effective system of state intervention , fighting corruption , and so on . " the transition from perceived external threats to a new look at home-grown dangers is a natural development , especially as the new us administration has worked to diffuse some of the tensions that had grown over recent years between the old cold war sparring partners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president dmitry medvedev chaired a national security council meeting discussing russia 's security strategy " it 's a normal development , because -lrb- russia 's -rrb- relations with the west have improved over the last weeks or months since obama took office , " said alexander rahr , russia analyst at the german council on foreign relations . the new security document largely puts the focus on economic and social categories , for example , economic growth , health care , science , education , culture and quality of life .
it lays out the ambitious goal , especially given the state of today 's russia , of becoming a world leader in these areas .
one particular threat for national security is unemployment , the widening gap between rich and poor , population decreases and rising domestic prices . energy security the issue of russia 's energy future and security is also emphasized in the document .
moscow predicts that the international quest for access to energy sources will become more intense - in the barents sea , around the antarctic , the caspian region and in central asia . since russia considers military intervention possibly being used in the struggle for energy , it also sees an additional threat to russia 's borders . the kremlin openly describes its own enormous energy reserves as a way to bring the country closer to its ultimate goal - regaining its status as a superpower . old foes despite the change in focus , some security concerns have stayed the same , especially regarding foreign policy .
the asia-pacific region is almost a blank spot on the map for russia , despite its border with an ever-more powerful china . the foreign threat scenarios often concern the " usual suspects , " the us and nato , although they are not mentioned by name .
this might well be a topic of conversation between medvedev and obama . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : america 's planned missile defense system has been a bone of contention between washington and moscow the security document complains of the absence of a robust international security architecture and the quest for military superiority .
besides the modernization of nuclear arsenals , the document mentions the development of high-tech weapons , the militarization of outer space , strategic armaments in non-nuclear areas , the creation of a missile defense system partly stationed in eastern europe . the list is clearly referring to the us , which russia still sees as the principle threat to its security . " regarding foreign policy everything is being repeated which was said in the past , " said rahr .
" russia is against the eastern expansion of nato , and therefore certain western countries - unnamed - which would challenge russia on its western border , are being heavily criticized . " nato fears while the document says nato expansion to russia 's borders is not acceptable , almost in the same breath moscow names nato as a strategic partner necessary for the maintenance of international security . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow is suspicious of nato but needs it as an strategic partner " the -lrb- nato -rrb- block is a partner for russia since it is working on solving problems that are essential for russia 's security , such as afghanistan , " said analyst suslov .

but for the first time in recent russian history , the country 's national security is not perceived as being threatened primarily by dangers from outside or being dependent on its own defensive capabilities . " the most important tasks and , at the same time , the most serious dangers are to be found inside the country , " said dmitry suslov , the deputy research director of the moscow-based council for foreign and defense policy .
" that means there 's a need for modernization , a more effective system of state intervention , fighting corruption , and so on . " the transition from perceived external threats to a new look at home-grown dangers is a natural development , especially as the new us administration has worked to diffuse some of the tensions that had grown over recent years between the old cold war sparring partners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president dmitry medvedev chaired a national security council meeting discussing russia 's security strategy " it 's a normal development , because -lrb- russia 's -rrb- relations with the west have improved over the last weeks or months since obama took office , " said alexander rahr , russia analyst at the german council on foreign relations . the new security document largely puts the focus on economic and social categories , for example , economic growth , health care , science , education , culture and quality of life .
it lays out the ambitious goal , especially given the state of today 's russia , of becoming a world leader in these areas .
one particular threat for national security is unemployment , the widening gap between rich and poor , population decreases and rising domestic prices . energy security the issue of russia 's energy future and security is also emphasized in the document .
moscow predicts that the international quest for access to energy sources will become more intense - in the barents sea , around the antarctic , the caspian region and in central asia . since russia considers military intervention possibly being used in the struggle for energy , it also sees an additional threat to russia 's borders . the kremlin openly describes its own enormous energy reserves as a way to bring the country closer to its ultimate goal - regaining its status as a superpower . old foes despite the change in focus , some security concerns have stayed the same , especially regarding foreign policy .
the asia-pacific region is almost a blank spot on the map for russia , despite its border with an ever-more powerful china . the foreign threat scenarios often concern the " usual suspects , " the us and nato , although they are not mentioned by name .
this might well be a topic of conversation between medvedev and obama . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : america 's planned missile defense system has been a bone of contention between washington and moscow the security document complains of the absence of a robust international security architecture and the quest for military superiority .
besides the modernization of nuclear arsenals , the document mentions the development of high-tech weapons , the militarization of outer space , strategic armaments in non-nuclear areas , the creation of a missile defense system partly stationed in eastern europe . the list is clearly referring to the us , which russia still sees as the principle threat to its security . " regarding foreign policy everything is being repeated which was said in the past , " said rahr .
" russia is against the eastern expansion of nato , and therefore certain western countries - unnamed - which would challenge russia on its western border , are being heavily criticized . " nato fears while the document says nato expansion to russia 's borders is not acceptable , almost in the same breath moscow names nato as a strategic partner necessary for the maintenance of international security . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow is suspicious of nato but needs it as an strategic partner " the -lrb- nato -rrb- block is a partner for russia since it is working on solving problems that are essential for russia 's security , such as afghanistan , " said analyst suslov .

german is rarely heard . " we have 2,600 mosques in germany and i do n't know a single imam who has a european education , " said political scientist bassam tibi , a professing muslim .
" how can they show the muslim who live here how to live ?
these imams would probably tell me i should n't integrate . " bulent ucar , professor for islamic studies at the university of osnabrueck , said that it 's crucial to the authentic development of islam in germany and europe that imams are educated on the continent . " only then can we have religious leaders who are informed about the country and the people and are aware of the cultural sensibilities here in germany and can act accordingly in their work in the mosque , " he added . to address the issue , the interior minister of lower saxony , uwe schuenemann , who is also the state 's integration minister , has announced a new education initiative for imams . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the university of osnabrueck was founded in 1668 " a continuing education program should be offered very soon , " said schuenemann .
" imams from turkey will be able to take courses in the teaching of religion , civic education and german . " the first batch of german-educated imams is set to graduate in osnabrueck in three years . job prospects for new imams in the past , imams have taken a reverse path : even german muslims with turkish roots have returned to turkey to complete their training . now schuenemann wants to work together with schura , a state-wide umbrella organizations for muslim groups , and ditib , the national association of turkish muslim congregations , to establish an imam training program in germany . " there are plans later on to add a masters program to the new bachelors program , " said schuenemann , " so that these imams can also teach courses in the muslim religion in schools . " in germany , elementary and high schools offer - generally catholic or protestant - religion courses .
alternatively , students can choose to take ethics .
recognized courses in islam were approved by the german government earlier this year , but have not yet been implemented in schools . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schuenemann is state minister for interior affairs , sport and integration hiring the imam graduates as part-time public school teachers would give them a secure income , said the interior minister .
otherwise , imams in germany are often subsidized by the turkish state because the mosques can not afford to pay their complete salaries . strong ties to muslim countries while other german states are looking to lower saxony as a possible trailblazer in the integration project , the state 's plan has not been particularly well received by religious leaders in the muslim community .
around one fifth of the imams who preach in german mosques tend toward conservative fundamentalism , concluded a current study by social scientist rauf ceylan of duisburg . many of the imams who are active in germany are convinced that an acceptable imam must have been educated in the home country 's muslim community . according to ceylan 's study , integration is n't yet a high priority for the majority of muslim leaders in germany . author : michael hollenbach -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german is rarely heard . " we have 2,600 mosques in germany and i do n't know a single imam who has a european education , " said political scientist bassam tibi , a professing muslim .
" how can they show the muslim who live here how to live ?
these imams would probably tell me i should n't integrate . " bulent ucar , professor for islamic studies at the university of osnabrueck , said that it 's crucial to the authentic development of islam in germany and europe that imams are educated on the continent . " only then can we have religious leaders who are informed about the country and the people and are aware of the cultural sensibilities here in germany and can act accordingly in their work in the mosque , " he added . to address the issue , the interior minister of lower saxony , uwe schuenemann , who is also the state 's integration minister , has announced a new education initiative for imams . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the university of osnabrueck was founded in 1668 " a continuing education program should be offered very soon , " said schuenemann .
" imams from turkey will be able to take courses in the teaching of religion , civic education and german . " the first batch of german-educated imams is set to graduate in osnabrueck in three years . job prospects for new imams in the past , imams have taken a reverse path : even german muslims with turkish roots have returned to turkey to complete their training . now schuenemann wants to work together with schura , a state-wide umbrella organizations for muslim groups , and ditib , the national association of turkish muslim congregations , to establish an imam training program in germany . " there are plans later on to add a masters program to the new bachelors program , " said schuenemann , " so that these imams can also teach courses in the muslim religion in schools . " in germany , elementary and high schools offer - generally catholic or protestant - religion courses .
alternatively , students can choose to take ethics .
recognized courses in islam were approved by the german government earlier this year , but have not yet been implemented in schools . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schuenemann is state minister for interior affairs , sport and integration hiring the imam graduates as part-time public school teachers would give them a secure income , said the interior minister .
otherwise , imams in germany are often subsidized by the turkish state because the mosques can not afford to pay their complete salaries . strong ties to muslim countries while other german states are looking to lower saxony as a possible trailblazer in the integration project , the state 's plan has not been particularly well received by religious leaders in the muslim community .
around one fifth of the imams who preach in german mosques tend toward conservative fundamentalism , concluded a current study by social scientist rauf ceylan of duisburg . many of the imams who are active in germany are convinced that an acceptable imam must have been educated in the home country 's muslim community . according to ceylan 's study , integration is n't yet a high priority for the majority of muslim leaders in germany . author : michael hollenbach -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the energy debate heats up ahead of elections germany 's social democrats have appealed to chancellor angela merkel to consider an alternative to nuclear fuel .
the calls followed technical problems that bumped a northern plant from the national grid . social democrat environment minister sigmar gabriel called on merkel and economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg to give up their nuclear course in order to preserve " the security of german citizens . "
in an interview with berlin 's tagesspiegel daily , gabriel said " the recent incidents in krümmel prove we can not justify the protracted use of older power plants . "
indeed the kruemmel reactor in the northern state of schleswig holstein only roared back to life at the end of june after a fire in 2007 forced its closure for two full years .
and in the few days since its reopening , the plant has twice been removed from the national grid . action not investigation the plant 's swedish operators , vattenfall , say the latest shutdown , which put out the majority of traffic lights across hamburg and left thousands of homes in the region with a reduced electricity supply , was the result of a short-circuit .
they say they are investigating the cause , and have not indicated when normal operations might resume .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not quite business as usual at the krümmel plant but social democrat gabriel wants more than an investigation .
speaking to ard television on monday morning , he said the oldest eight of germany 's seventeen nuclear reactors should be removed from the national grid immediately .
he also called for a tightening of nuclear phase-out laws in order to make it possible for newer , more reliable plants to fulfil the remit of the older ones he wishes to see closed .
electorate to decide both the social democrats and the greens have seized on the latest kruemmel shutdown as an election campaign opportunity .
" on september 27th , germany will decide if this , and seven other reactors , should remain in operation as the cdu and chancellor merkel suggest , " gabriel , whose spd is currently in a coalition with the cdu , told the ard . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clean energy sources ca n't supply a whole nation .
yet .
renate kuenast , leading green party candidate , described kruemmel 's two malfunctions in as many weeks as dilettantism on the part of vattenfall .
she said voters held the key to the future of germany 's power generation .
" whoever wants to see scrap reactors like kruemmel closed down has to fight with us against a black-yellow coalition , " she told the tagesspiegel , referring to the possibility of a coalition between the " black " christian democrats and the " yellow " free democrats .
merkel 's christian democrats are in favor of extending the operational lives of germany 's nuclear plants , which , under a law passed by the former spd / green coalition , are currently due to be phased out by the year 2021 .
bridging a gap to a cleaner energy future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fire put krümmel out of action in 2007 gabriel said that to close the oldest reactors now rather would not , as some suggest , pose a supply problem , as germany currently produces more than it uses .
but the christian democratic bavarian environment minister , markus söder , said it was illusionary to think that bavaria - which is 60-70 percent reliant on nuclear energy - could switch to alternative energy sources from one day to the next .
he told bavarian public radio that germany needed nuclear fuel " until we can replace it entirely with regenerative energy . "

" whoever wants to see scrap reactors like kruemmel closed down has to fight with us against a black-yellow coalition , " she told the tagesspiegel , referring to the possibility of a coalition between the " black " christian democrats and the " yellow " free democrats .
merkel 's christian democrats are in favor of extending the operational lives of germany 's nuclear plants , which , under a law passed by the former spd / green coalition , are currently due to be phased out by the year 2021 .
bridging a gap to a cleaner energy future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fire put krümmel out of action in 2007 gabriel said that to close the oldest reactors now rather would not , as some suggest , pose a supply problem , as germany currently produces more than it uses .
but the christian democratic bavarian environment minister , markus söder , said it was illusionary to think that bavaria - which is 60-70 percent reliant on nuclear energy - could switch to alternative energy sources from one day to the next .
he told bavarian public radio that germany needed nuclear fuel " until we can replace it entirely with regenerative energy . "
kruemmel has often been cited in connection with a relatively high incidence of leukemia in the region , but there has never been any proof that the reactor is to blame. tkw / ap / reuters / dpa editor : michael lawton tkw / ap / reuters / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the austrian billionaire 's new fifth league team is named rasenballsport -lrb- rb -rrb- leipzig , and he wants it in the bundesliga . no prizes for guessing what you are meant to associate with the team 's new initials .
still , who could blame it ?
for the small-time club formerly known as ssv markranstaedt on the quiet outskirts of leipzig , the corporate reference is hardly an onerous price to pay for a shot at the major league .
" a global company as a sponsor , what could be better , " ssv markranstaedt manager holger nussbaum told the local leipziger volkszeitung .
the regional football association has given its approval , the contracts have been signed , and details of the venture are being worked out .
practice is set to begin any day .
" in the long run , we are aiming for the german premier league .
as a rule , we reach our goals , so that is what we are hoping for in leipzig as well , " says red bull founder , dietrich mateschitz .
mateschitz is going even further than dietmar hopp , who funded small-town team tsv hoffenheim and helped it reach the bundesliga .
he , at least , was a local businessman , but the only link that mateschitz has with rb leipzig is the initials of his product .
lofty goals a sponsor for many different sports , red bull already owns a football club in austria , the red bull salzburg team , as well as the us team red bull new york .
the energy drink firm funds soccer schools in ghana and brazil , and owns red bull racing , the former ford jaguar racing formula one team . “ we want to help give soccer in the region the significance it deserves , ” says red bull soccer manager markus egger . ” red bull is not coming to leipzig to take anything away - on the contrary . ”
two of rb leipzig 's arch rivals had hoped to win red bull as a sponsor for themselves .
but in the end , fc sachsen and 1 .
fc lokomotive leipzig lost out to markranstaedt because the former faces insolvency and the latter is known for provoking match riots .
for the time being , red bull 's new soccer team will play in the " stadion am bad " -lrb- capacity : 5,500 spectators -rrb- in markranstaedt – but the club has aspirations to sail through the divisions as soon as possible , and move into the world cup stadium in leipzig , which seats 45,000 people .
eight new players , together with coaches tino vogel , lars weissenberger , and goalie coach perry braeutigam , are expected to manage the leap from fifth to first division .
as far as money is concerned , the sky is the limit , says red bull soccer chief egger .

the win , kaymer ’ s third on the pga european tour , is his most important . the young german needed only one extra hole to beat westwood , after the former european number one found the water with his approach to the difficult 18th . the botched extra hole came after a solid final round , however , in which westwood carded a sterling 7-under 65 to force the playoff . after 72 holes of regulation play , both players were at 13-under-par , three strokes better than third place ian poulter . putting key to victory kaymer was off to a fast start at le golf national in st. quentin-en-yvelines , france , after he tied the course record with a 62 on thursday .
rounds of 72 and 69 on friday and saturday left kaymer one back heading into sunday , and a 68 was enough to get into the playoff with westwood . a myriad of long putts , the longest an 84-footer on the eighth , proved the key to kaymer 's third european tour victory , who comes from the western german city of dusseldorf . " my putting was great all week , " kaymer told reporters .
" i made so many putts from everywhere . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many say kaymer is the next bernhard langer significant win with the victory kaymer took home the $ 930,000 top prize , which brings him to fifth on the european order of merit .
more importantly , however , the win is sure to bring kaymer into the top 20 in the world golf rankings . " the world ranking is the important thing to me , " kaymer said .
" i 've never been this high before . " this is the first time a german has won the french open in 25 years .
two-time masters champion bernhard langer was the last to the lift the trophy , when he won at the st. cloud golf club in paris in 1984 . for kaymer , who many say is walking in the footsteps of langer , germany ’ s most dominant player in the 20th century , the french open is his third international victory . he also triumphed in abu dhabi and at the bmw international last year . glb / dpa / reuters editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 06.07.2009 german state to introduce college training for muslim imams großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most imams in germany completed their training in their home countries one german state is hoping to improve the integration of its muslim community by offering imam training programs at university . in most mosques in germany , prayers are said in arabic and the sermon is usually given in turkish .
german is rarely heard . " we have 2,600 mosques in germany and i do n't know a single imam who has a european education , " said political scientist bassam tibi , a professing muslim .
" how can they show the muslim who live here how to live ?
these imams would probably tell me i should n't integrate . " bulent ucar , professor for islamic studies at the university of osnabrueck , said that it 's crucial to the authentic development of islam in germany and europe that imams are educated on the continent . " only then can we have religious leaders who are informed about the country and the people and are aware of the cultural sensibilities here in germany and can act accordingly in their work in the mosque , " he added . to address the issue , the interior minister of lower saxony , uwe schuenemann , who is also the state 's integration minister , has announced a new education initiative for imams . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the university of osnabrueck was founded in 1668 " a continuing education program should be offered very soon , " said schuenemann .
" imams from turkey will be able to take courses in the teaching of religion , civic education and german . " the first batch of german-educated imams is set to graduate in osnabrueck in three years . job prospects for new imams in the past , imams have taken a reverse path : even german muslims with turkish roots have returned to turkey to complete their training . now schuenemann wants to work together with schura , a state-wide umbrella organizations for muslim groups , and ditib , the national association of turkish muslim congregations , to establish an imam training program in germany . " there are plans later on to add a masters program to the new bachelors program , " said schuenemann , " so that these imams can also teach courses in the muslim religion in schools . " in germany , elementary and high schools offer - generally catholic or protestant - religion courses .
alternatively , students can choose to take ethics .
recognized courses in islam were approved by the german government earlier this year , but have not yet been implemented in schools . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schuenemann is state minister for interior affairs , sport and integration hiring the imam graduates as part-time public school teachers would give them a secure income , said the interior minister .
otherwise , imams in germany are often subsidized by the turkish state because the mosques can not afford to pay their complete salaries . strong ties to muslim countries while other german states are looking to lower saxony as a possible trailblazer in the integration project , the state 's plan has not been particularly well received by religious leaders in the muslim community .
around one fifth of the imams who preach in german mosques tend toward conservative fundamentalism , concluded a current study by social scientist rauf ceylan of duisburg . many of the imams who are active in germany are convinced that an acceptable imam must have been educated in the home country 's muslim community . according to ceylan 's study , integration is n't yet a high priority for the majority of muslim leaders in germany . author : michael hollenbach -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de germany 's muslim community larger than thought a report by the interior ministry shows that germany 's muslim community is larger and more diverse than previously estimated .
-lrb- 24.06.2009 -rrb- german military draws on expertise from female muslim soldiers since the german armed forces , the bundeswehr , opened its doors to women in 2001 , their ranks have grown to a modest , yet proud seven percent .
but of the 13,000-strong female force , very few are muslims .
-lrb- 13.06.2009 -rrb- survey says 31 percent of muslims in europe suffer discrimination a survey of ethnic minorities in europe says 31 percent of muslims across the eu feel they were discriminated against in 2008 and many fail to report racist incidents because of a lack of trust in the authorities .
-lrb- 28.05.2009 -rrb- german primary schoolers get textbook on islam " my book about islam " is the first schoolbook on the muslim faith to be approved for young children in germany .

the energy debate heats up ahead of elections germany 's social democrats have appealed to chancellor angela merkel to consider an alternative to nuclear fuel .
the calls followed technical problems that bumped a northern plant from the national grid . social democrat environment minister sigmar gabriel called on merkel and economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg to give up their nuclear course in order to preserve " the security of german citizens . "
in an interview with berlin 's tagesspiegel daily , gabriel said " the recent incidents in krümmel prove we can not justify the protracted use of older power plants . "
indeed the kruemmel reactor in the northern state of schleswig holstein only roared back to life at the end of june after a fire in 2007 forced its closure for two full years .
and in the few days since its reopening , the plant has twice been removed from the national grid . action not investigation the plant 's swedish operators , vattenfall , say the latest shutdown , which put out the majority of traffic lights across hamburg and left thousands of homes in the region with a reduced electricity supply , was the result of a short-circuit .
they say they are investigating the cause , and have not indicated when normal operations might resume .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not quite business as usual at the krümmel plant but social democrat gabriel wants more than an investigation .
speaking to ard television on monday morning , he said the oldest eight of germany 's seventeen nuclear reactors should be removed from the national grid immediately .
he also called for a tightening of nuclear phase-out laws in order to make it possible for newer , more reliable plants to fulfil the remit of the older ones he wishes to see closed .
electorate to decide both the social democrats and the greens have seized on the latest kruemmel shutdown as an election campaign opportunity .
" on september 27th , germany will decide if this , and seven other reactors , should remain in operation as the cdu and chancellor merkel suggest , " gabriel , whose spd is currently in a coalition with the cdu , told the ard . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clean energy sources ca n't supply a whole nation .
yet .
renate kuenast , leading green party candidate , described kruemmel 's two malfunctions in as many weeks as dilettantism on the part of vattenfall .
she said voters held the key to the future of germany 's power generation .
" whoever wants to see scrap reactors like kruemmel closed down has to fight with us against a black-yellow coalition , " she told the tagesspiegel , referring to the possibility of a coalition between the " black " christian democrats and the " yellow " free democrats .
merkel 's christian democrats are in favor of extending the operational lives of germany 's nuclear plants , which , under a law passed by the former spd / green coalition , are currently due to be phased out by the year 2021 .
bridging a gap to a cleaner energy future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fire put krümmel out of action in 2007 gabriel said that to close the oldest reactors now rather would not , as some suggest , pose a supply problem , as germany currently produces more than it uses .
but the christian democratic bavarian environment minister , markus söder , said it was illusionary to think that bavaria - which is 60-70 percent reliant on nuclear energy - could switch to alternative energy sources from one day to the next .
he told bavarian public radio that germany needed nuclear fuel " until we can replace it entirely with regenerative energy . "
kruemmel has often been cited in connection with a relatively high incidence of leukemia in the region , but there has never been any proof that the reactor is to blame. tkw / ap / reuters / dpa editor : michael lawton tkw / ap / reuters / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german is rarely heard . " we have 2,600 mosques in germany and i do n't know a single imam who has a european education , " said political scientist bassam tibi , a professing muslim .
" how can they show the muslim who live here how to live ?
these imams would probably tell me i should n't integrate . " bulent ucar , professor for islamic studies at the university of osnabrueck , said that it 's crucial to the authentic development of islam in germany and europe that imams are educated on the continent . " only then can we have religious leaders who are informed about the country and the people and are aware of the cultural sensibilities here in germany and can act accordingly in their work in the mosque , " he added . to address the issue , the interior minister of lower saxony , uwe schuenemann , who is also the state 's integration minister , has announced a new education initiative for imams . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the university of osnabrueck was founded in 1668 " a continuing education program should be offered very soon , " said schuenemann .
" imams from turkey will be able to take courses in the teaching of religion , civic education and german . " the first batch of german-educated imams is set to graduate in osnabrueck in three years . job prospects for new imams in the past , imams have taken a reverse path : even german muslims with turkish roots have returned to turkey to complete their training . now schuenemann wants to work together with schura , a state-wide umbrella organizations for muslim groups , and ditib , the national association of turkish muslim congregations , to establish an imam training program in germany . " there are plans later on to add a masters program to the new bachelors program , " said schuenemann , " so that these imams can also teach courses in the muslim religion in schools . " in germany , elementary and high schools offer - generally catholic or protestant - religion courses .
alternatively , students can choose to take ethics .
recognized courses in islam were approved by the german government earlier this year , but have not yet been implemented in schools . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schuenemann is state minister for interior affairs , sport and integration hiring the imam graduates as part-time public school teachers would give them a secure income , said the interior minister .
otherwise , imams in germany are often subsidized by the turkish state because the mosques can not afford to pay their complete salaries . strong ties to muslim countries while other german states are looking to lower saxony as a possible trailblazer in the integration project , the state 's plan has not been particularly well received by religious leaders in the muslim community .
around one fifth of the imams who preach in german mosques tend toward conservative fundamentalism , concluded a current study by social scientist rauf ceylan of duisburg . many of the imams who are active in germany are convinced that an acceptable imam must have been educated in the home country 's muslim community . according to ceylan 's study , integration is n't yet a high priority for the majority of muslim leaders in germany . author : michael hollenbach -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german is rarely heard . " we have 2,600 mosques in germany and i do n't know a single imam who has a european education , " said political scientist bassam tibi , a professing muslim .
" how can they show the muslim who live here how to live ?
these imams would probably tell me i should n't integrate . " bulent ucar , professor for islamic studies at the university of osnabrueck , said that it 's crucial to the authentic development of islam in germany and europe that imams are educated on the continent . " only then can we have religious leaders who are informed about the country and the people and are aware of the cultural sensibilities here in germany and can act accordingly in their work in the mosque , " he added . to address the issue , the interior minister of lower saxony , uwe schuenemann , who is also the state 's integration minister , has announced a new education initiative for imams . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the university of osnabrueck was founded in 1668 " a continuing education program should be offered very soon , " said schuenemann .
" imams from turkey will be able to take courses in the teaching of religion , civic education and german . " the first batch of german-educated imams is set to graduate in osnabrueck in three years . job prospects for new imams in the past , imams have taken a reverse path : even german muslims with turkish roots have returned to turkey to complete their training . now schuenemann wants to work together with schura , a state-wide umbrella organizations for muslim groups , and ditib , the national association of turkish muslim congregations , to establish an imam training program in germany . " there are plans later on to add a masters program to the new bachelors program , " said schuenemann , " so that these imams can also teach courses in the muslim religion in schools . " in germany , elementary and high schools offer - generally catholic or protestant - religion courses .
alternatively , students can choose to take ethics .
recognized courses in islam were approved by the german government earlier this year , but have not yet been implemented in schools . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schuenemann is state minister for interior affairs , sport and integration hiring the imam graduates as part-time public school teachers would give them a secure income , said the interior minister .
otherwise , imams in germany are often subsidized by the turkish state because the mosques can not afford to pay their complete salaries . strong ties to muslim countries while other german states are looking to lower saxony as a possible trailblazer in the integration project , the state 's plan has not been particularly well received by religious leaders in the muslim community .
around one fifth of the imams who preach in german mosques tend toward conservative fundamentalism , concluded a current study by social scientist rauf ceylan of duisburg . many of the imams who are active in germany are convinced that an acceptable imam must have been educated in the home country 's muslim community . according to ceylan 's study , integration is n't yet a high priority for the majority of muslim leaders in germany . author : michael hollenbach -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the energy debate heats up ahead of elections germany 's social democrats have appealed to chancellor angela merkel to consider an alternative to nuclear fuel .
the calls followed technical problems that bumped a northern plant from the national grid . social democrat environment minister sigmar gabriel called on merkel and economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg to give up their nuclear course in order to preserve " the security of german citizens . "
in an interview with berlin 's tagesspiegel daily , gabriel said " the recent incidents in krümmel prove we can not justify the protracted use of older power plants . "
indeed the kruemmel reactor in the northern state of schleswig holstein only roared back to life at the end of june after a fire in 2007 forced its closure for two full years .
and in the few days since its reopening , the plant has twice been removed from the national grid . action not investigation the plant 's swedish operators , vattenfall , say the latest shutdown , which put out the majority of traffic lights across hamburg and left thousands of homes in the region with a reduced electricity supply , was the result of a short-circuit .
they say they are investigating the cause , and have not indicated when normal operations might resume .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not quite business as usual at the krümmel plant but social democrat gabriel wants more than an investigation .
speaking to ard television on monday morning , he said the oldest eight of germany 's seventeen nuclear reactors should be removed from the national grid immediately .
he also called for a tightening of nuclear phase-out laws in order to make it possible for newer , more reliable plants to fulfil the remit of the older ones he wishes to see closed .
electorate to decide both the social democrats and the greens have seized on the latest kruemmel shutdown as an election campaign opportunity .
" on september 27th , germany will decide if this , and seven other reactors , should remain in operation as the cdu and chancellor merkel suggest , " gabriel , whose spd is currently in a coalition with the cdu , told the ard . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clean energy sources ca n't supply a whole nation .
yet .
renate kuenast , leading green party candidate , described kruemmel 's two malfunctions in as many weeks as dilettantism on the part of vattenfall .
she said voters held the key to the future of germany 's power generation .
" whoever wants to see scrap reactors like kruemmel closed down has to fight with us against a black-yellow coalition , " she told the tagesspiegel , referring to the possibility of a coalition between the " black " christian democrats and the " yellow " free democrats .
merkel 's christian democrats are in favor of extending the operational lives of germany 's nuclear plants , which , under a law passed by the former spd / green coalition , are currently due to be phased out by the year 2021 .
bridging a gap to a cleaner energy future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fire put krümmel out of action in 2007 gabriel said that to close the oldest reactors now rather would not , as some suggest , pose a supply problem , as germany currently produces more than it uses .
but the christian democratic bavarian environment minister , markus söder , said it was illusionary to think that bavaria - which is 60-70 percent reliant on nuclear energy - could switch to alternative energy sources from one day to the next .
he told bavarian public radio that germany needed nuclear fuel " until we can replace it entirely with regenerative energy . "
kruemmel has often been cited in connection with a relatively high incidence of leukemia in the region , but there has never been any proof that the reactor is to blame. tkw / ap / reuters / dpa editor : michael lawton tkw / ap / reuters / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the win , kaymer ’ s third on the pga european tour , is his most important . the young german needed only one extra hole to beat westwood , after the former european number one found the water with his approach to the difficult 18th . the botched extra hole came after a solid final round , however , in which westwood carded a sterling 7-under 65 to force the playoff . after 72 holes of regulation play , both players were at 13-under-par , three strokes better than third place ian poulter . putting key to victory kaymer was off to a fast start at le golf national in st. quentin-en-yvelines , france , after he tied the course record with a 62 on thursday .
rounds of 72 and 69 on friday and saturday left kaymer one back heading into sunday , and a 68 was enough to get into the playoff with westwood . a myriad of long putts , the longest an 84-footer on the eighth , proved the key to kaymer 's third european tour victory , who comes from the western german city of dusseldorf . " my putting was great all week , " kaymer told reporters .
" i made so many putts from everywhere . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many say kaymer is the next bernhard langer significant win with the victory kaymer took home the $ 930,000 top prize , which brings him to fifth on the european order of merit .
more importantly , however , the win is sure to bring kaymer into the top 20 in the world golf rankings . " the world ranking is the important thing to me , " kaymer said .
" i 've never been this high before . " this is the first time a german has won the french open in 25 years .
two-time masters champion bernhard langer was the last to the lift the trophy , when he won at the st. cloud golf club in paris in 1984 . for kaymer , who many say is walking in the footsteps of langer , germany ’ s most dominant player in the 20th century , the french open is his third international victory . he also triumphed in abu dhabi and at the bmw international last year . glb / dpa / reuters editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 05 dw-tv europe live typisch deutsch - leben in deutschland we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

" this decision -lsb- to lift the suspension -rsb- is a strong incentive for bulgaria to strengthen its efforts in all areas where funds are still suspended .
we need a future system that protects eu funding from any improper use . "
analysts say the new government must also quickly tackle economic policy issues to attract investors , many of whom fled this year , in part because of the global financial crisis .

this followed summit talks at the kremlin on monday to " reset " bilateral relations . us president barack obama and his russian counterpart , dmitry medvedev , signed a " joint understanding " aimed at reducing the number of nuclear warheads held by each of their countries to between 1,500 and 1,675 , compared with the maximum 2,200 the existing strategic arms reduction treaty -lrb- start -rrb- between their two countries allows . the two sides are also to aim to reduce the number of missiles capable of delivering the warheads from the current maximum of 1,600 allowed for each side to between 500 and 1,100 .
at a press conference following their summit talks at the kremlin on monday , medvedev said moscow wanted a " fresh start ” in relations with washington despite persisting differences .
admitting that relations between the two sides were not at an optimal level , he said " our countries are aiming at cooperation commensurate with the 21st century . " agreeing to forge ahead with disarmament talks , the russian leader said showed that russia and the united states were facing up to their superpower responsibilities .
for his part , obama praised what he called russia 's contribution in stemming nuclear threats to the world .
“ we resolved to reset us-russian relations , ” he said at the joint press conference .
he stressed the joint efforts being made towards a follow-up to the start treaty , saying the two countries aimed to " lead by example " in cutting back their nuclear weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skepticism persists in both countries over what can be achieved building on recent progress while admitting that some of the differences between the two sides were not likely to simply fade away , the two leaders sought to highlight progress made in recent months .
" we are confident that we can continue to build on the excellent discussions that we had in london , ” obama said , adding : “ and that on a whole host of issues - including security issues , economic issues , energy issues , environmental issues - that the united states and russia have more in common than they have differences . ”
the two countries have agreed to set up a joint commission on some of these issues .
more notably , military cooperation , which suffered in the aftermath of the russia-georgia conflict last august , is to recommence .
obama said if the two sides were to continue to hard work in the next few days , they could make “ extraordinary progress that would benefit the people of both countries . "
echoing those sentiments , medvedev said not just their two countries but the rest of the world too would gain from better us-russian relations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korea continues its provocative actions security cooperation the us president also said that he and medvedev shared concerns over nuclear proliferation and related developments in countries like north korea and iran .
he said that the two sides had taken “ important steps forward to strengthen our security through greater cooperation , " adding that he and his russian counterpart agreed on the “ need to combat the threat of violent extremism , particularly from al-qaeda " .
in an important sign of growing security cooperation , moscow has agreed to allow us military planes to fly over russian territory to afghanistan , which in obama 's words , is a “ substantial contribution ” that will save the us “ time and resources ” in its afghanistan mission .
problems persist medvedev said he saw clear progress in talks with the us on missile defence as the obama administration was prepared to listen to russian concerns .
he described monday 's summit as a “ first but very important step ” toward revitalizing relations between the former cold war foes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama says the us is keen on talking to both russian leaders despite positive talk on both sides , even president medvedev admitted to the existence of some serious glitches .
us plans to install a missile defence system in poland and the czech republic which the previous bush administration said was aimed at countering threats from so-called “ rogue states ” like iran .
however , moscow is opposed to the plan and has urged obama to abandon it .
just last week , russian prime minister vladimir putin urged washington to drop plans for a missile defence shield .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 06.07.2009 " iceland has been dealt with in a very rough manner " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eva joly will lead the investigation into iceland 's banking collapse iceland 's economy suffered a near total collapse when its banks were laid low by the global credit crunch .
the public lost their jobs and savings and now the government wants to know why . in an effort to thoroughly investigate the economic collapse and related crimes , the icelandic government has sought help from a prominent european figure . newly elected mep eva joly , the norwegian-born french magistrate who became famous as the lead judge in the elf aquitaine corruption scandal , acts as special adviser to iceland ‘ s authorities .
deutsche welle : ms joly , how would you compare this investigation with the elf aquitaine affair ?
eva joly : this is much huger , much much more important .
this bankruptcy is much bigger than enron , involving a lot of people , involving other banks , and really the investigation is huge .
what about the time and costs involved ?
it will probably be expensive .
i calculated that in order to pay for people and experts from abroad – and we need highly trained experts – we will need some three million euros a year .
and it will take a long time , it 's impossible to say how long at the moment .
that will depend on what kind of cooperation we will get from abroad and how far we will go .
but i think that we can reasonably say that within two or three years , we should have some cases ready to go to court .
if i judge by the elf case we could even spend up to seven years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people in iceland lost their savings when the banks collapsed why is it so important to spend time and money chasing " white collar criminals " ?
i think it is of the utmost important for iceland to carry out this investigation for the social contract to function .
for people to have the courage to go on to live here because what we see today is that people are full of despair and many of them are moving away .
they are taking jobs in norway and that must not happen .
people must stay , they must fight , they must fight for their culture and for justice , and i think here , like in all the nordic countries , the feeling of justice is very important - and today there is a total feeling of injustice .
we have a huge responsibility to show that the institutions are able to carry out this inquiry and that the culprits will be convicted .
only a couple of weeks ago you threatened to step down from your post .
what was the problem ?
well , you know , here in iceland it 's a very small country .
there are only 300.000 inhabitants and people are closely linked .
you always meet the wife of somebody , or the cousin , or the uncle .
so it happens that the state prosecutor 's son is involved in the inquiry , so he is inhabile and he did n't resign from his office and i was very much afraid of that because that could jeopardize the investigation .
so i asked for his resignation and i asked for more money to do the investigation and for more people .
i do not want to be an alibi .
because i am here , people think that this investigation is serious , so i must always ensure that things are done correctly .
extra staff will now be made available for you , including three independent prosecutors .
what about the state prosecutor , who will obviously have to stay out of the investigation ?
he does n't want to step down because he 's protected by law , you see , and this is normal in a democracy .
but this situation has not been foreseen by any law .
i think the possibility to have an ad hoc state prosecutor is meant for small cases , when one of your relatives is involved in stealing a little motorbike for instance that could be the case .
but when it is the whole economic system , all the institutions in the country are involved .
what sense does it have to say i will stay state prosecutor and be isolated and not be able to participate in the most important debates ?
how do you feel the european community has reacted to iceland 's financial collapse iceland has been dealt with in a very rough manner .
i think it was a european issue .
iceland is a member of the european economic community and it was our common bank system that was involved , the common regulators were involved and i think we could have sought a european solution for iceland !
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joining the eu could restore some calm to iceland what are your thoughts on eu membership for iceland ?
i think from the eu point of view that it would be very interesting for us to have iceland on board .
it 's a very old civilization and they have solid democratic traditions that would reinforce the nordic culture of transparency and good governance .
and they also have resources that are important for europe like energy and fish .
so i think it would be very nice for us - and also for them - to be part of the european union .

russian president dmitry medvedev signed a decree in may on the country 's national security strategy , which is meant to be a general guide for russian domestic and foreign policy until 2020 . that policy still mentions threats dating from the cold war era .
but for the first time in recent russian history , the country 's national security is not perceived as being threatened primarily by dangers from outside or being dependent on its own defensive capabilities . " the most important tasks and , at the same time , the most serious dangers are to be found inside the country , " said dmitry suslov , the deputy research director of the moscow-based council for foreign and defense policy .
" that means there 's a need for modernization , a more effective system of state intervention , fighting corruption , and so on . " the transition from perceived external threats to a new look at home-grown dangers is a natural development , especially as the new us administration has worked to diffuse some of the tensions that had grown over recent years between the old cold war sparring partners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president dmitry medvedev chaired a national security council meeting discussing russia 's security strategy " it 's a normal development , because -lrb- russia 's -rrb- relations with the west have improved over the last weeks or months since obama took office , " said alexander rahr , russia analyst at the german council on foreign relations . the new security document largely puts the focus on economic and social categories , for example , economic growth , health care , science , education , culture and quality of life .
it lays out the ambitious goal , especially given the state of today 's russia , of becoming a world leader in these areas .
one particular threat for national security is unemployment , the widening gap between rich and poor , population decreases and rising domestic prices . energy security the issue of russia 's energy future and security is also emphasized in the document .
moscow predicts that the international quest for access to energy sources will become more intense - in the barents sea , around the antarctic , the caspian region and in central asia . since russia considers military intervention possibly being used in the struggle for energy , it also sees an additional threat to russia 's borders . the kremlin openly describes its own enormous energy reserves as a way to bring the country closer to its ultimate goal - regaining its status as a superpower . old foes despite the change in focus , some security concerns have stayed the same , especially regarding foreign policy .
the asia-pacific region is almost a blank spot on the map for russia , despite its border with an ever-more powerful china . the foreign threat scenarios often concern the " usual suspects , " the us and nato , although they are not mentioned by name .

" regarding foreign policy everything is being repeated which was said in the past , " said rahr .
" russia is against the eastern expansion of nato , and therefore certain western countries - unnamed - which would challenge russia on its western border , are being heavily criticized . " nato fears while the document says nato expansion to russia 's borders is not acceptable , almost in the same breath moscow names nato as a strategic partner necessary for the maintenance of international security . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow is suspicious of nato but needs it as an strategic partner " the -lrb- nato -rrb- block is a partner for russia since it is working on solving problems that are essential for russia 's security , such as afghanistan , " said analyst suslov .
" furthermore , nato is a central pillar of euro-atlantic security apparatus , whether russia likes it or not .
if russia wants to participate in such a system , it will have to work on its relations with nato . " the relationship with the us is similarly paradoxical .
although america is seen as a threat , russia is also seeking a strategic partnership of equals and wants to cooperate on the fight against terrorism and non-proliferation . " dmitry medvedev has to position himself on a foreign policy level , " said rahr .

russia released a new security strategy in may , taking another look at threats , both old and new . us president obama has said the us needs to reset its relationship with russia , which faces a series of challenges , including a public suspicious of us motives , a kremlin with two men at the helm and hard feelings on a variety of issues . russia is also talking about improving ties with its former adversary , and has been doing some resetting of its own , primarily regarding its security doctrine .
russian president dmitry medvedev signed a decree in may on the country 's national security strategy , which is meant to be a general guide for russian domestic and foreign policy until 2020 . that policy still mentions threats dating from the cold war era .
but for the first time in recent russian history , the country 's national security is not perceived as being threatened primarily by dangers from outside or being dependent on its own defensive capabilities . " the most important tasks and , at the same time , the most serious dangers are to be found inside the country , " said dmitry suslov , the deputy research director of the moscow-based council for foreign and defense policy .
" that means there 's a need for modernization , a more effective system of state intervention , fighting corruption , and so on . " the transition from perceived external threats to a new look at home-grown dangers is a natural development , especially as the new us administration has worked to diffuse some of the tensions that had grown over recent years between the old cold war sparring partners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president dmitry medvedev chaired a national security council meeting discussing russia 's security strategy " it 's a normal development , because -lrb- russia 's -rrb- relations with the west have improved over the last weeks or months since obama took office , " said alexander rahr , russia analyst at the german council on foreign relations . the new security document largely puts the focus on economic and social categories , for example , economic growth , health care , science , education , culture and quality of life .
it lays out the ambitious goal , especially given the state of today 's russia , of becoming a world leader in these areas .
one particular threat for national security is unemployment , the widening gap between rich and poor , population decreases and rising domestic prices . energy security the issue of russia 's energy future and security is also emphasized in the document .
moscow predicts that the international quest for access to energy sources will become more intense - in the barents sea , around the antarctic , the caspian region and in central asia . since russia considers military intervention possibly being used in the struggle for energy , it also sees an additional threat to russia 's borders . the kremlin openly describes its own enormous energy reserves as a way to bring the country closer to its ultimate goal - regaining its status as a superpower . old foes despite the change in focus , some security concerns have stayed the same , especially regarding foreign policy .
the asia-pacific region is almost a blank spot on the map for russia , despite its border with an ever-more powerful china . the foreign threat scenarios often concern the " usual suspects , " the us and nato , although they are not mentioned by name .
this might well be a topic of conversation between medvedev and obama . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : america 's planned missile defense system has been a bone of contention between washington and moscow the security document complains of the absence of a robust international security architecture and the quest for military superiority .
besides the modernization of nuclear arsenals , the document mentions the development of high-tech weapons , the militarization of outer space , strategic armaments in non-nuclear areas , the creation of a missile defense system partly stationed in eastern europe . the list is clearly referring to the us , which russia still sees as the principle threat to its security . " regarding foreign policy everything is being repeated which was said in the past , " said rahr .
" russia is against the eastern expansion of nato , and therefore certain western countries - unnamed - which would challenge russia on its western border , are being heavily criticized . " nato fears while the document says nato expansion to russia 's borders is not acceptable , almost in the same breath moscow names nato as a strategic partner necessary for the maintenance of international security . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow is suspicious of nato but needs it as an strategic partner " the -lrb- nato -rrb- block is a partner for russia since it is working on solving problems that are essential for russia 's security , such as afghanistan , " said analyst suslov .

‘ batman ' borisov has also pledged to work towards the eradication of ethnic tensions in bulgaria .

barack obama wants talks in moscow to lead toward reductions . nuclear arms reduction has a prominent place on the agenda of the two-day summit in moscow between russia and the united states .
the issue is a political priority for us president barack obama , who gave a speech in prague in april in which he outlined his vision of a world free of nuclear weapons . for russia on the other hand , bilateral arms-reduction talks are one of the few issues around which moscow feels its clout and cold war history makes it an equal to its one-time rival . for some time , both times have , regarding the numbers at least , made significant progress in arms reduction .
in the mid-1960s , the us had more then 30,000 warheads in its arsenal ; the russians , 20 years later , had some 40,000 .
since then , the numbers on both sides have fallen to around 5,000 . most of these warheads have a explosive force of from 10 to 30 times that of the atomic bomb that was dropped on hiroshima in 1945 . start treaty at the end of this year , the most comprehensive nuclear reduction treaty ever signed , the 1991 start treaty , will expire .
start -lrb- later renamed start i -rrb- put an upper limit of 6,000 battle-ready nuclear warheads and some 1,600 launching systems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president george bush and soviet president gorbachev at the signing of start in 1991 in addition to start , both sides signed off on the " treaty of moscow " in 2002 .
it sees a further reduction on both sides to 1,700 to 2,000 operational strategic warheads . however , the moscow document calls on verification of the agreements to be based on the procedures outlined in start , which is considered impractical by both the us and russia .
in addition , it says nothing about the development of new missiles with multiple warheads . in order to move forward with nuclear disarmament , a new version or an extension of the start treaty is necessary . by the numbers the american nuclear arsenal has , according to recent figures put out by the american " bulletin of the atomic scientists , " already reached the upper limit of 2,200 set by the treaty of moscow .
half of us launch systems are intercontinental missiles stationed on submarines , one-fourth are land-based intercontinental missiles and another one-fourth are long-range bombers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president obama in prague calling for a nuclear weapon-free world us scientists count some 2,500 warheads in america 's active reserve , as well as 500 non-strategic nuclear weapons , mostly found in us bases in europe .
the total : around 5,200 nuclear warheads .
more than 4,000 additional ones are on a waiting list to be decommissioned . the russian nuclear stockpile contains just under 2,800 strategic operational warheads , of which half are on land-based intercontinental missiles .
the other half are on long-range bombers and submarines . in addition , russia possesses 2,000 non-strategic nuclear weapons , mostly missile and anti-aircraft systems as well as tactical atomic weapons such as guided missiles .
another 8,000 warheads are held in reserve or are candidates for decommissioning . missile shield hurdle despite the reductions in their nuclear arsenals by both the us and russia , an agreement on a new arms control treaty mandating further cuts -down to 1,500 warheads - will not be easily attained . besides details such as how launch systems would be included in the equation , the biggest hurdle is the new missile-shield project planned by the us in eastern europe . bildunterschrift : the 2008 signing of an agreement to base missile interceptors in poland was not to russia 's liking the plans were developed under obama 's predecessor , george w. bush .
according to the us , the system would be designed to intercept the small number of missiles that might be launched from countries such as iran or north korea . moscow , however , considers the planned missile and radar facilities close to its western border as a threat to its security and as something that would undermine its own nuclear deterrent potential . if the us does not abandon its plans for missile facilities in poland and the czech republic , moscow signaled as recently as this past weekend , the kremlin would not sign off on any successor to the start treaty . author : hans spross -lrb- jam -rrb- editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" a global company as a sponsor , what could be better , " ssv markranstaedt manager holger nussbaum told the local leipziger volkszeitung .
the regional football association has given its approval , the contracts have been signed , and details of the venture are being worked out .
practice is set to begin any day .
" in the long run , we are aiming for the german premier league .
as a rule , we reach our goals , so that is what we are hoping for in leipzig as well , " says red bull founder , dietrich mateschitz .
mateschitz is going even further than dietmar hopp , who funded small-town team tsv hoffenheim and helped it reach the bundesliga .
he , at least , was a local businessman , but the only link that mateschitz has with rb leipzig is the initials of his product .
lofty goals a sponsor for many different sports , red bull already owns a football club in austria , the red bull salzburg team , as well as the us team red bull new york .
the energy drink firm funds soccer schools in ghana and brazil , and owns red bull racing , the former ford jaguar racing formula one team . “ we want to help give soccer in the region the significance it deserves , ” says red bull soccer manager markus egger . ” red bull is not coming to leipzig to take anything away - on the contrary . ”
two of rb leipzig 's arch rivals had hoped to win red bull as a sponsor for themselves .
but in the end , fc sachsen and 1 .
fc lokomotive leipzig lost out to markranstaedt because the former faces insolvency and the latter is known for provoking match riots .
for the time being , red bull 's new soccer team will play in the " stadion am bad " -lrb- capacity : 5,500 spectators -rrb- in markranstaedt – but the club has aspirations to sail through the divisions as soon as possible , and move into the world cup stadium in leipzig , which seats 45,000 people .
eight new players , together with coaches tino vogel , lars weissenberger , and goalie coach perry braeutigam , are expected to manage the leap from fifth to first division .
as far as money is concerned , the sky is the limit , says red bull soccer chief egger .
“ we will provide the funds that are necessary , there is no upper limit . ” db / dpa / sid editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the justice ministry in saxony has confirmed the report , making this the second such case in recent years . according to the report , two inmates aged 15 and 24 years tortured another inmate at the regis-breitingen juvenile detention center , located near leipzig in the eastern state of saxony . the state of saxony has pressed charges of attempted murder against the inmates , though it is still unclear when the trial will take place . neo-nazi inspired torture according to the report , the two stand accused of trying to get the 18-year-old to commit suicide by beating him with a broomstick and pouring boiling water on him . out of fear , the attacked inmate attempted to hang himself in his cell but was unsuccessful .
after seeing that he survived the attempted suicide , the attackers then attempted to strangle him with a belt but failed in their attempts .
the victim was able to escape and alert the guards . before the beatings , the inmates , at this point together with other inmates , allegedly painted swastikas on their victim . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the incident in saxony recalls a similarly heinous case in siegburg in 2006 not the first case of juvenile torture in germany this latest case , which allegedly happened in may 2008 , is similar to a brutal murder that took place inside a juvenile prison in 2006 .
in that case , three inmates at the siegburg detention center near the western city of bonn tortured a fellow inmate for hours , raping and beating him unconscious .
the three then hung their victim , in an attempt to make it appear as if the victim had taken his own life . the state of north rhine-westphalia found all three inmates guilty , with the main attacker receiving a further ten years in a maximum security prison .
the other attackers both received 10 years in prison . critique of the inmate " re-socialization " process this latest case of juvenile inmate torture has aroused debate in germany , particularly with regard to the question of how to deal with juvenile delinquents effectively . klaus bartl , a speaker for the left party , says the heinous nature of this crime is a sign that the current system is n't working . " this horrible incident is yet further evidence that the juvenile prison in saxony does n't help its inmates .
it does the opposite of what it says it should , which is to " re-socialize " them and stop them from using so much violence . " the regis-breitingen juvenile detention center is the most modern of its kind in saxony .
the prison has room for almost 400 inmates and was opened on october 5th , 2007 . less than one month after its opening , one of its inmates , a 21-year-old charged with murder , committed suicide in his cell . glb / dpa / ap editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw looks back at a series of events surrounding the facility . shut down after a fire in june 2007 and only back online since june 19 , 2009 , the kruemmel nuclear power plant in northern germany was automatically brought to a standstill on saturday . run by vattenfall , ownership of the kruemmel plant is split with half of the plant belonging to the swedish energy giant and the other half owned by germany 's eon .
the two companies also jointly own the brunsbuettel nuclear power plant , with two-thirds in vattenfall 's hands , and share ownership of the brokdorf nuclear power plant , which is operated by eon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a pair of vattenfall-run nuclear power plants were shut down on june 28 , 2007 june 28 , 2007 : vattenfall announces that the kruemmel power plant was taken offline after a fire occurred in a transformer outside the reactor building .
shortly before the announcement , the company also said that , in a separate incident , a short-circuit led to the temporary shut-down of its nuclear power plant in brunsbuettel . june 30 , 2007 : vattenfall officials say neither of the incidents was connected to the parts of the plants responsible for nuclear power production . july 1 , 2007 : brunsbuettel goes back online but is put on stand-by after two weeks due to a transformer problem . july 3 , 2007 : the energy company says the quick shutdown in kruemmel caused a pump malfunction . july 6 , 2007 : a state nuclear regulatory agency releases information showing that smoke from the kruemmel fire clouded the control room , the plant 's internal energy supply was temporarily affected and not all relevant computer files regarding the incident were saved .
in its first press conference after the failures occurred , vattenfall admits errors were made and says misunderstandings among personnel caused the mistakes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vattenfall was criticized for not quickly sharing information about the failures july 8 , 2007 : contrary to company reports , the regulatory agency says breakdowns occurred when the brunsbuettel plant was powered back up at the beginning of the month . july 14 , 2007 : in a preliminary report , vattenfall says it should have been more open with information about the fires .
two days later , the head of the company 's nuclear division is relieved of his duties and the company 's spokesman resigns . july 18 , 2007 : vattenfall europe head klaus rauscher also resigns . july 21 , 2007 : incorrectly installed wall anchors at the brunsbuettel plant lead to the facility 's complete shutdown . feb .

a leak is also found in the cooling system . june 19 , 2009 : after nearly two years off the power grid , the kruemmel plant is put back online .
the company says many improvements had been made to the plant 's transformers to prevent short circuits and minimize their impact should they occur . july 1 , 2009 : a malfunction in one of two transformators responsible for connecting the power plant to the grid leads to the kruemmel facility 's automatic shutdown .
the plant is put back online in a matter of hours and expected to be back at full power production by july 5 .
human error is reported to be responsible for the break down . july 4 , 2009 : kruemmel undergoes a quick shutdown after a short circuit in a transformator . july 5 , 2009 : vattenfall apologizes for not informing the state regulatory agency as required and says " safety must always come before speed " in deciding when the kruemmel plant will be turned back on .

the public lost their jobs and savings and now the government wants to know why . in an effort to thoroughly investigate the economic collapse and related crimes , the icelandic government has sought help from a prominent european figure . newly elected mep eva joly , the norwegian-born french magistrate who became famous as the lead judge in the elf aquitaine corruption scandal , acts as special adviser to iceland ‘ s authorities .
deutsche welle : ms joly , how would you compare this investigation with the elf aquitaine affair ?
eva joly : this is much huger , much much more important .
this bankruptcy is much bigger than enron , involving a lot of people , involving other banks , and really the investigation is huge .
what about the time and costs involved ?
it will probably be expensive .
i calculated that in order to pay for people and experts from abroad – and we need highly trained experts – we will need some three million euros a year .
and it will take a long time , it 's impossible to say how long at the moment .
that will depend on what kind of cooperation we will get from abroad and how far we will go .
but i think that we can reasonably say that within two or three years , we should have some cases ready to go to court .
if i judge by the elf case we could even spend up to seven years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people in iceland lost their savings when the banks collapsed why is it so important to spend time and money chasing " white collar criminals " ?
i think it is of the utmost important for iceland to carry out this investigation for the social contract to function .
for people to have the courage to go on to live here because what we see today is that people are full of despair and many of them are moving away .
they are taking jobs in norway and that must not happen .
people must stay , they must fight , they must fight for their culture and for justice , and i think here , like in all the nordic countries , the feeling of justice is very important - and today there is a total feeling of injustice .
we have a huge responsibility to show that the institutions are able to carry out this inquiry and that the culprits will be convicted .
only a couple of weeks ago you threatened to step down from your post .
what was the problem ?
well , you know , here in iceland it 's a very small country .
there are only 300.000 inhabitants and people are closely linked .
you always meet the wife of somebody , or the cousin , or the uncle .
so it happens that the state prosecutor 's son is involved in the inquiry , so he is inhabile and he did n't resign from his office and i was very much afraid of that because that could jeopardize the investigation .
so i asked for his resignation and i asked for more money to do the investigation and for more people .
i do not want to be an alibi .
because i am here , people think that this investigation is serious , so i must always ensure that things are done correctly .
extra staff will now be made available for you , including three independent prosecutors .
what about the state prosecutor , who will obviously have to stay out of the investigation ?
he does n't want to step down because he 's protected by law , you see , and this is normal in a democracy .
but this situation has not been foreseen by any law .
i think the possibility to have an ad hoc state prosecutor is meant for small cases , when one of your relatives is involved in stealing a little motorbike for instance that could be the case .
but when it is the whole economic system , all the institutions in the country are involved .
what sense does it have to say i will stay state prosecutor and be isolated and not be able to participate in the most important debates ?
how do you feel the european community has reacted to iceland 's financial collapse iceland has been dealt with in a very rough manner .
i think it was a european issue .
iceland is a member of the european economic community and it was our common bank system that was involved , the common regulators were involved and i think we could have sought a european solution for iceland !
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joining the eu could restore some calm to iceland what are your thoughts on eu membership for iceland ?
i think from the eu point of view that it would be very interesting for us to have iceland on board .
it 's a very old civilization and they have solid democratic traditions that would reinforce the nordic culture of transparency and good governance .
and they also have resources that are important for europe like energy and fish .
so i think it would be very nice for us - and also for them - to be part of the european union .

the win , kaymer ’ s third on the pga european tour , is his most important . the young german needed only one extra hole to beat westwood , after the former european number one found the water with his approach to the difficult 18th . the botched extra hole came after a solid final round , however , in which westwood carded a sterling 7-under 65 to force the playoff . after 72 holes of regulation play , both players were at 13-under-par , three strokes better than third place ian poulter . putting key to victory kaymer was off to a fast start at le golf national in st. quentin-en-yvelines , france , after he tied the course record with a 62 on thursday .
rounds of 72 and 69 on friday and saturday left kaymer one back heading into sunday , and a 68 was enough to get into the playoff with westwood . a myriad of long putts , the longest an 84-footer on the eighth , proved the key to kaymer 's third european tour victory , who comes from the western german city of dusseldorf .

" i 've never been this high before . " this is the first time a german has won the french open in 25 years .
two-time masters champion bernhard langer was the last to the lift the trophy , when he won at the st. cloud golf club in paris in 1984 . for kaymer , who many say is walking in the footsteps of langer , germany ’ s most dominant player in the 20th century , the french open is his third international victory . he also triumphed in abu dhabi and at the bmw international last year . glb / dpa / reuters editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9797 dw-tv europe live journal - news with in depth we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

the public lost their jobs and savings and now the government wants to know why . in an effort to thoroughly investigate the economic collapse and related crimes , the icelandic government has sought help from a prominent european figure . newly elected mep eva joly , the norwegian-born french magistrate who became famous as the lead judge in the elf aquitaine corruption scandal , acts as special adviser to iceland ‘ s authorities .
deutsche welle : ms joly , how would you compare this investigation with the elf aquitaine affair ?
eva joly : this is much huger , much much more important .
this bankruptcy is much bigger than enron , involving a lot of people , involving other banks , and really the investigation is huge .
what about the time and costs involved ?
it will probably be expensive .
i calculated that in order to pay for people and experts from abroad – and we need highly trained experts – we will need some three million euros a year .
and it will take a long time , it 's impossible to say how long at the moment .
that will depend on what kind of cooperation we will get from abroad and how far we will go .
but i think that we can reasonably say that within two or three years , we should have some cases ready to go to court .
if i judge by the elf case we could even spend up to seven years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people in iceland lost their savings when the banks collapsed why is it so important to spend time and money chasing " white collar criminals " ?
i think it is of the utmost important for iceland to carry out this investigation for the social contract to function .
for people to have the courage to go on to live here because what we see today is that people are full of despair and many of them are moving away .
they are taking jobs in norway and that must not happen .
people must stay , they must fight , they must fight for their culture and for justice , and i think here , like in all the nordic countries , the feeling of justice is very important - and today there is a total feeling of injustice .
we have a huge responsibility to show that the institutions are able to carry out this inquiry and that the culprits will be convicted .
only a couple of weeks ago you threatened to step down from your post .
what was the problem ?
well , you know , here in iceland it 's a very small country .
there are only 300.000 inhabitants and people are closely linked .
you always meet the wife of somebody , or the cousin , or the uncle .
so it happens that the state prosecutor 's son is involved in the inquiry , so he is inhabile and he did n't resign from his office and i was very much afraid of that because that could jeopardize the investigation .
so i asked for his resignation and i asked for more money to do the investigation and for more people .
i do not want to be an alibi .
because i am here , people think that this investigation is serious , so i must always ensure that things are done correctly .
extra staff will now be made available for you , including three independent prosecutors .
what about the state prosecutor , who will obviously have to stay out of the investigation ?
he does n't want to step down because he 's protected by law , you see , and this is normal in a democracy .
but this situation has not been foreseen by any law .
i think the possibility to have an ad hoc state prosecutor is meant for small cases , when one of your relatives is involved in stealing a little motorbike for instance that could be the case .
but when it is the whole economic system , all the institutions in the country are involved .
what sense does it have to say i will stay state prosecutor and be isolated and not be able to participate in the most important debates ?
how do you feel the european community has reacted to iceland 's financial collapse iceland has been dealt with in a very rough manner .
i think it was a european issue .
iceland is a member of the european economic community and it was our common bank system that was involved , the common regulators were involved and i think we could have sought a european solution for iceland !
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joining the eu could restore some calm to iceland what are your thoughts on eu membership for iceland ?
i think from the eu point of view that it would be very interesting for us to have iceland on board .
it 's a very old civilization and they have solid democratic traditions that would reinforce the nordic culture of transparency and good governance .
and they also have resources that are important for europe like energy and fish .
so i think it would be very nice for us - and also for them - to be part of the european union .

russia released a new security strategy in may , taking another look at threats , both old and new . us president obama has said the us needs to reset its relationship with russia , which faces a series of challenges , including a public suspicious of us motives , a kremlin with two men at the helm and hard feelings on a variety of issues . russia is also talking about improving ties with its former adversary , and has been doing some resetting of its own , primarily regarding its security doctrine .
russian president dmitry medvedev signed a decree in may on the country 's national security strategy , which is meant to be a general guide for russian domestic and foreign policy until 2020 . that policy still mentions threats dating from the cold war era .
but for the first time in recent russian history , the country 's national security is not perceived as being threatened primarily by dangers from outside or being dependent on its own defensive capabilities . " the most important tasks and , at the same time , the most serious dangers are to be found inside the country , " said dmitry suslov , the deputy research director of the moscow-based council for foreign and defense policy .
" that means there 's a need for modernization , a more effective system of state intervention , fighting corruption , and so on . " the transition from perceived external threats to a new look at home-grown dangers is a natural development , especially as the new us administration has worked to diffuse some of the tensions that had grown over recent years between the old cold war sparring partners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president dmitry medvedev chaired a national security council meeting discussing russia 's security strategy " it 's a normal development , because -lrb- russia 's -rrb- relations with the west have improved over the last weeks or months since obama took office , " said alexander rahr , russia analyst at the german council on foreign relations . the new security document largely puts the focus on economic and social categories , for example , economic growth , health care , science , education , culture and quality of life .
it lays out the ambitious goal , especially given the state of today 's russia , of becoming a world leader in these areas .
one particular threat for national security is unemployment , the widening gap between rich and poor , population decreases and rising domestic prices . energy security the issue of russia 's energy future and security is also emphasized in the document .
moscow predicts that the international quest for access to energy sources will become more intense - in the barents sea , around the antarctic , the caspian region and in central asia . since russia considers military intervention possibly being used in the struggle for energy , it also sees an additional threat to russia 's borders . the kremlin openly describes its own enormous energy reserves as a way to bring the country closer to its ultimate goal - regaining its status as a superpower . old foes despite the change in focus , some security concerns have stayed the same , especially regarding foreign policy .
the asia-pacific region is almost a blank spot on the map for russia , despite its border with an ever-more powerful china . the foreign threat scenarios often concern the " usual suspects , " the us and nato , although they are not mentioned by name .
this might well be a topic of conversation between medvedev and obama . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : america 's planned missile defense system has been a bone of contention between washington and moscow the security document complains of the absence of a robust international security architecture and the quest for military superiority .
besides the modernization of nuclear arsenals , the document mentions the development of high-tech weapons , the militarization of outer space , strategic armaments in non-nuclear areas , the creation of a missile defense system partly stationed in eastern europe . the list is clearly referring to the us , which russia still sees as the principle threat to its security . " regarding foreign policy everything is being repeated which was said in the past , " said rahr .
" russia is against the eastern expansion of nato , and therefore certain western countries - unnamed - which would challenge russia on its western border , are being heavily criticized . " nato fears while the document says nato expansion to russia 's borders is not acceptable , almost in the same breath moscow names nato as a strategic partner necessary for the maintenance of international security . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow is suspicious of nato but needs it as an strategic partner " the -lrb- nato -rrb- block is a partner for russia since it is working on solving problems that are essential for russia 's security , such as afghanistan , " said analyst suslov .
" furthermore , nato is a central pillar of euro-atlantic security apparatus , whether russia likes it or not .
if russia wants to participate in such a system , it will have to work on its relations with nato . " the relationship with the us is similarly paradoxical .
although america is seen as a threat , russia is also seeking a strategic partnership of equals and wants to cooperate on the fight against terrorism and non-proliferation . " dmitry medvedev has to position himself on a foreign policy level , " said rahr .
" he wants to show that he has the situation under control , and that he has the capability to modernize the country domestically without disturbances from outside .

russia released a new security strategy in may , taking another look at threats , both old and new . us president obama has said the us needs to reset its relationship with russia , which faces a series of challenges , including a public suspicious of us motives , a kremlin with two men at the helm and hard feelings on a variety of issues . russia is also talking about improving ties with its former adversary , and has been doing some resetting of its own , primarily regarding its security doctrine .
russian president dmitry medvedev signed a decree in may on the country 's national security strategy , which is meant to be a general guide for russian domestic and foreign policy until 2020 . that policy still mentions threats dating from the cold war era .
but for the first time in recent russian history , the country 's national security is not perceived as being threatened primarily by dangers from outside or being dependent on its own defensive capabilities . " the most important tasks and , at the same time , the most serious dangers are to be found inside the country , " said dmitry suslov , the deputy research director of the moscow-based council for foreign and defense policy .
" that means there 's a need for modernization , a more effective system of state intervention , fighting corruption , and so on . " the transition from perceived external threats to a new look at home-grown dangers is a natural development , especially as the new us administration has worked to diffuse some of the tensions that had grown over recent years between the old cold war sparring partners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president dmitry medvedev chaired a national security council meeting discussing russia 's security strategy " it 's a normal development , because -lrb- russia 's -rrb- relations with the west have improved over the last weeks or months since obama took office , " said alexander rahr , russia analyst at the german council on foreign relations . the new security document largely puts the focus on economic and social categories , for example , economic growth , health care , science , education , culture and quality of life .
it lays out the ambitious goal , especially given the state of today 's russia , of becoming a world leader in these areas .
one particular threat for national security is unemployment , the widening gap between rich and poor , population decreases and rising domestic prices . energy security the issue of russia 's energy future and security is also emphasized in the document .
moscow predicts that the international quest for access to energy sources will become more intense - in the barents sea , around the antarctic , the caspian region and in central asia . since russia considers military intervention possibly being used in the struggle for energy , it also sees an additional threat to russia 's borders . the kremlin openly describes its own enormous energy reserves as a way to bring the country closer to its ultimate goal - regaining its status as a superpower . old foes despite the change in focus , some security concerns have stayed the same , especially regarding foreign policy .
the asia-pacific region is almost a blank spot on the map for russia , despite its border with an ever-more powerful china . the foreign threat scenarios often concern the " usual suspects , " the us and nato , although they are not mentioned by name .
this might well be a topic of conversation between medvedev and obama . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : america 's planned missile defense system has been a bone of contention between washington and moscow the security document complains of the absence of a robust international security architecture and the quest for military superiority .
besides the modernization of nuclear arsenals , the document mentions the development of high-tech weapons , the militarization of outer space , strategic armaments in non-nuclear areas , the creation of a missile defense system partly stationed in eastern europe . the list is clearly referring to the us , which russia still sees as the principle threat to its security . " regarding foreign policy everything is being repeated which was said in the past , " said rahr .
" russia is against the eastern expansion of nato , and therefore certain western countries - unnamed - which would challenge russia on its western border , are being heavily criticized . " nato fears while the document says nato expansion to russia 's borders is not acceptable , almost in the same breath moscow names nato as a strategic partner necessary for the maintenance of international security . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow is suspicious of nato but needs it as an strategic partner " the -lrb- nato -rrb- block is a partner for russia since it is working on solving problems that are essential for russia 's security , such as afghanistan , " said analyst suslov .
" furthermore , nato is a central pillar of euro-atlantic security apparatus , whether russia likes it or not .
if russia wants to participate in such a system , it will have to work on its relations with nato . " the relationship with the us is similarly paradoxical .
although america is seen as a threat , russia is also seeking a strategic partnership of equals and wants to cooperate on the fight against terrorism and non-proliferation . " dmitry medvedev has to position himself on a foreign policy level , " said rahr .
" he wants to show that he has the situation under control , and that he has the capability to modernize the country domestically without disturbances from outside .

german is rarely heard . " we have 2,600 mosques in germany and i do n't know a single imam who has a european education , " said political scientist bassam tibi , a professing muslim .
" how can they show the muslim who live here how to live ?
these imams would probably tell me i should n't integrate . " bulent ucar , professor for islamic studies at the university of osnabrueck , said that it 's crucial to the authentic development of islam in germany and europe that imams are educated on the continent . " only then can we have religious leaders who are informed about the country and the people and are aware of the cultural sensibilities here in germany and can act accordingly in their work in the mosque , " he added . to address the issue , the interior minister of lower saxony , uwe schuenemann , who is also the state 's integration minister , has announced a new education initiative for imams . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the university of osnabrueck was founded in 1668 " a continuing education program should be offered very soon , " said schuenemann .
" imams from turkey will be able to take courses in the teaching of religion , civic education and german . " the first batch of german-educated imams is set to graduate in osnabrueck in three years . job prospects for new imams in the past , imams have taken a reverse path : even german muslims with turkish roots have returned to turkey to complete their training . now schuenemann wants to work together with schura , a state-wide umbrella organizations for muslim groups , and ditib , the national association of turkish muslim congregations , to establish an imam training program in germany . " there are plans later on to add a masters program to the new bachelors program , " said schuenemann , " so that these imams can also teach courses in the muslim religion in schools . " in germany , elementary and high schools offer - generally catholic or protestant - religion courses .
alternatively , students can choose to take ethics .
recognized courses in islam were approved by the german government earlier this year , but have not yet been implemented in schools . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schuenemann is state minister for interior affairs , sport and integration hiring the imam graduates as part-time public school teachers would give them a secure income , said the interior minister .
otherwise , imams in germany are often subsidized by the turkish state because the mosques can not afford to pay their complete salaries . strong ties to muslim countries while other german states are looking to lower saxony as a possible trailblazer in the integration project , the state 's plan has not been particularly well received by religious leaders in the muslim community .
around one fifth of the imams who preach in german mosques tend toward conservative fundamentalism , concluded a current study by social scientist rauf ceylan of duisburg . many of the imams who are active in germany are convinced that an acceptable imam must have been educated in the home country 's muslim community . according to ceylan 's study , integration is n't yet a high priority for the majority of muslim leaders in germany . author : michael hollenbach -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he called on both sides to exercise calm and restraint and urged the chinese authorities to fully respect human rights , " especially the right to freedom of expression and peaceful demonstration . "
in an interview with dw-tv , german human rights commissioner guenther nooke on monday also spoke out against the eruption of violence between china and uighurs in the xinjiang province .
deutsche welle : how does the german government view the events in the xinjiang province ?
guenther nooke : we have not been in a position to come to an official assessment because not enough information has been made available yet , but of course we know that there have been ongoing problems with the uighurs because they are seen by the leaders in beijing , and by the chinese in general , as suspected terrorists .
this has led to tensions between the han chinese and the uighurs .

i think we have to call on the beijing leadership to act in accordance with the rule of law , even if there are grey areas , and properly investigate situations like the one in the toy factory in southern china , which seems to have sparked the unrest , and that they refrain from reacting with disproportionate force .
that is unacceptable , no matter what factors may have contributed to it , including the possibility that demonstrators committed acts of violence .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 06.07.2009 us-russian arms control deal on agenda in moscow großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear stockpile numbers in both the us and russia have fallen greatly from cold war heights the us and russia have far fewer nuclear warheads than they did at the height of the cold war , but the two countries still have large arsenals .
barack obama wants talks in moscow to lead toward reductions . nuclear arms reduction has a prominent place on the agenda of the two-day summit in moscow between russia and the united states .
the issue is a political priority for us president barack obama , who gave a speech in prague in april in which he outlined his vision of a world free of nuclear weapons . for russia on the other hand , bilateral arms-reduction talks are one of the few issues around which moscow feels its clout and cold war history makes it an equal to its one-time rival . for some time , both times have , regarding the numbers at least , made significant progress in arms reduction .
in the mid-1960s , the us had more then 30,000 warheads in its arsenal ; the russians , 20 years later , had some 40,000 .
since then , the numbers on both sides have fallen to around 5,000 . most of these warheads have a explosive force of from 10 to 30 times that of the atomic bomb that was dropped on hiroshima in 1945 . start treaty at the end of this year , the most comprehensive nuclear reduction treaty ever signed , the 1991 start treaty , will expire .
start -lrb- later renamed start i -rrb- put an upper limit of 6,000 battle-ready nuclear warheads and some 1,600 launching systems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president george bush and soviet president gorbachev at the signing of start in 1991 in addition to start , both sides signed off on the " treaty of moscow " in 2002 .
it sees a further reduction on both sides to 1,700 to 2,000 operational strategic warheads . however , the moscow document calls on verification of the agreements to be based on the procedures outlined in start , which is considered impractical by both the us and russia .
in addition , it says nothing about the development of new missiles with multiple warheads . in order to move forward with nuclear disarmament , a new version or an extension of the start treaty is necessary . by the numbers the american nuclear arsenal has , according to recent figures put out by the american " bulletin of the atomic scientists , " already reached the upper limit of 2,200 set by the treaty of moscow .
half of us launch systems are intercontinental missiles stationed on submarines , one-fourth are land-based intercontinental missiles and another one-fourth are long-range bombers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president obama in prague calling for a nuclear weapon-free world us scientists count some 2,500 warheads in america 's active reserve , as well as 500 non-strategic nuclear weapons , mostly found in us bases in europe .
the total : around 5,200 nuclear warheads .
more than 4,000 additional ones are on a waiting list to be decommissioned . the russian nuclear stockpile contains just under 2,800 strategic operational warheads , of which half are on land-based intercontinental missiles .
the other half are on long-range bombers and submarines . in addition , russia possesses 2,000 non-strategic nuclear weapons , mostly missile and anti-aircraft systems as well as tactical atomic weapons such as guided missiles .
another 8,000 warheads are held in reserve or are candidates for decommissioning . missile shield hurdle despite the reductions in their nuclear arsenals by both the us and russia , an agreement on a new arms control treaty mandating further cuts -down to 1,500 warheads - will not be easily attained . besides details such as how launch systems would be included in the equation , the biggest hurdle is the new missile-shield project planned by the us in eastern europe . bildunterschrift : the 2008 signing of an agreement to base missile interceptors in poland was not to russia 's liking the plans were developed under obama 's predecessor , george w. bush .
according to the us , the system would be designed to intercept the small number of missiles that might be launched from countries such as iran or north korea . moscow , however , considers the planned missile and radar facilities close to its western border as a threat to its security and as something that would undermine its own nuclear deterrent potential . if the us does not abandon its plans for missile facilities in poland and the czech republic , moscow signaled as recently as this past weekend , the kremlin would not sign off on any successor to the start treaty . author : hans spross -lrb- jam -rrb- editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russia released a new security strategy in may , taking another look at threats , both old and new . us president obama has said the us needs to reset its relationship with russia , which faces a series of challenges , including a public suspicious of us motives , a kremlin with two men at the helm and hard feelings on a variety of issues . russia is also talking about improving ties with its former adversary , and has been doing some resetting of its own , primarily regarding its security doctrine .
russian president dmitry medvedev signed a decree in may on the country 's national security strategy , which is meant to be a general guide for russian domestic and foreign policy until 2020 . that policy still mentions threats dating from the cold war era .
but for the first time in recent russian history , the country 's national security is not perceived as being threatened primarily by dangers from outside or being dependent on its own defensive capabilities . " the most important tasks and , at the same time , the most serious dangers are to be found inside the country , " said dmitry suslov , the deputy research director of the moscow-based council for foreign and defense policy .
" that means there 's a need for modernization , a more effective system of state intervention , fighting corruption , and so on . " the transition from perceived external threats to a new look at home-grown dangers is a natural development , especially as the new us administration has worked to diffuse some of the tensions that had grown over recent years between the old cold war sparring partners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president dmitry medvedev chaired a national security council meeting discussing russia 's security strategy " it 's a normal development , because -lrb- russia 's -rrb- relations with the west have improved over the last weeks or months since obama took office , " said alexander rahr , russia analyst at the german council on foreign relations . the new security document largely puts the focus on economic and social categories , for example , economic growth , health care , science , education , culture and quality of life .
it lays out the ambitious goal , especially given the state of today 's russia , of becoming a world leader in these areas .
one particular threat for national security is unemployment , the widening gap between rich and poor , population decreases and rising domestic prices . energy security the issue of russia 's energy future and security is also emphasized in the document .
moscow predicts that the international quest for access to energy sources will become more intense - in the barents sea , around the antarctic , the caspian region and in central asia . since russia considers military intervention possibly being used in the struggle for energy , it also sees an additional threat to russia 's borders . the kremlin openly describes its own enormous energy reserves as a way to bring the country closer to its ultimate goal - regaining its status as a superpower . old foes despite the change in focus , some security concerns have stayed the same , especially regarding foreign policy .
the asia-pacific region is almost a blank spot on the map for russia , despite its border with an ever-more powerful china . the foreign threat scenarios often concern the " usual suspects , " the us and nato , although they are not mentioned by name .
this might well be a topic of conversation between medvedev and obama . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : america 's planned missile defense system has been a bone of contention between washington and moscow the security document complains of the absence of a robust international security architecture and the quest for military superiority .
besides the modernization of nuclear arsenals , the document mentions the development of high-tech weapons , the militarization of outer space , strategic armaments in non-nuclear areas , the creation of a missile defense system partly stationed in eastern europe . the list is clearly referring to the us , which russia still sees as the principle threat to its security . " regarding foreign policy everything is being repeated which was said in the past , " said rahr .
" russia is against the eastern expansion of nato , and therefore certain western countries - unnamed - which would challenge russia on its western border , are being heavily criticized . " nato fears while the document says nato expansion to russia 's borders is not acceptable , almost in the same breath moscow names nato as a strategic partner necessary for the maintenance of international security . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow is suspicious of nato but needs it as an strategic partner " the -lrb- nato -rrb- block is a partner for russia since it is working on solving problems that are essential for russia 's security , such as afghanistan , " said analyst suslov .
" furthermore , nato is a central pillar of euro-atlantic security apparatus , whether russia likes it or not .
if russia wants to participate in such a system , it will have to work on its relations with nato . " the relationship with the us is similarly paradoxical .
although america is seen as a threat , russia is also seeking a strategic partnership of equals and wants to cooperate on the fight against terrorism and non-proliferation . " dmitry medvedev has to position himself on a foreign policy level , " said rahr .
" he wants to show that he has the situation under control , and that he has the capability to modernize the country domestically without disturbances from outside .

the energy debate heats up ahead of elections germany 's social democrats have appealed to chancellor angela merkel to consider an alternative to nuclear fuel .
the calls followed technical problems that bumped a northern plant from the national grid . social democrat environment minister sigmar gabriel called on merkel and economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg to give up their nuclear course in order to preserve " the security of german citizens . "
in an interview with berlin 's tagesspiegel daily , gabriel said " the recent incidents in krümmel prove we can not justify the protracted use of older power plants . "
indeed the kruemmel reactor in the northern state of schleswig holstein only roared back to life at the end of june after a fire in 2007 forced its closure for two full years .
and in the few days since its reopening , the plant has twice been removed from the national grid . action not investigation the plant 's swedish operators , vattenfall , say the latest shutdown , which put out the majority of traffic lights across hamburg and left thousands of homes in the region with a reduced electricity supply , was the result of a short-circuit .
they say they are investigating the cause , and have not indicated when normal operations might resume .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not quite business as usual at the krümmel plant but social democrat gabriel wants more than an investigation .
speaking to ard television on monday morning , he said the oldest eight of germany 's seventeen nuclear reactors should be removed from the national grid immediately .
he also called for a tightening of nuclear phase-out laws in order to make it possible for newer , more reliable plants to fulfil the remit of the older ones he wishes to see closed .
electorate to decide both the social democrats and the greens have seized on the latest kruemmel shutdown as an election campaign opportunity .
" on september 27th , germany will decide if this , and seven other reactors , should remain in operation as the cdu and chancellor merkel suggest , " gabriel , whose spd is currently in a coalition with the cdu , told the ard . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clean energy sources ca n't supply a whole nation .
yet .
renate kuenast , leading green party candidate , described kruemmel 's two malfunctions in as many weeks as dilettantism on the part of vattenfall .
she said voters held the key to the future of germany 's power generation .
" whoever wants to see scrap reactors like kruemmel closed down has to fight with us against a black-yellow coalition , " she told the tagesspiegel , referring to the possibility of a coalition between the " black " christian democrats and the " yellow " free democrats .
merkel 's christian democrats are in favor of extending the operational lives of germany 's nuclear plants , which , under a law passed by the former spd / green coalition , are currently due to be phased out by the year 2021 .
bridging a gap to a cleaner energy future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fire put krümmel out of action in 2007 gabriel said that to close the oldest reactors now rather would not , as some suggest , pose a supply problem , as germany currently produces more than it uses .
but the christian democratic bavarian environment minister , markus söder , said it was illusionary to think that bavaria - which is 60-70 percent reliant on nuclear energy - could switch to alternative energy sources from one day to the next .
he told bavarian public radio that germany needed nuclear fuel " until we can replace it entirely with regenerative energy . "

the energy debate heats up ahead of elections germany 's social democrats have appealed to chancellor angela merkel to consider an alternative to nuclear fuel .
the calls followed technical problems that bumped a northern plant from the national grid . social democrat environment minister sigmar gabriel called on merkel and economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg to give up their nuclear course in order to preserve " the security of german citizens . "
in an interview with berlin 's tagesspiegel daily , gabriel said " the recent incidents in krümmel prove we can not justify the protracted use of older power plants . "
indeed the kruemmel reactor in the northern state of schleswig holstein only roared back to life at the end of june after a fire in 2007 forced its closure for two full years .
and in the few days since its reopening , the plant has twice been removed from the national grid . action not investigation the plant 's swedish operators , vattenfall , say the latest shutdown , which put out the majority of traffic lights across hamburg and left thousands of homes in the region with a reduced electricity supply , was the result of a short-circuit .
they say they are investigating the cause , and have not indicated when normal operations might resume .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not quite business as usual at the krümmel plant but social democrat gabriel wants more than an investigation .
speaking to ard television on monday morning , he said the oldest eight of germany 's seventeen nuclear reactors should be removed from the national grid immediately .
he also called for a tightening of nuclear phase-out laws in order to make it possible for newer , more reliable plants to fulfil the remit of the older ones he wishes to see closed .
electorate to decide both the social democrats and the greens have seized on the latest kruemmel shutdown as an election campaign opportunity .
" on september 27th , germany will decide if this , and seven other reactors , should remain in operation as the cdu and chancellor merkel suggest , " gabriel , whose spd is currently in a coalition with the cdu , told the ard . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clean energy sources ca n't supply a whole nation .
yet .
renate kuenast , leading green party candidate , described kruemmel 's two malfunctions in as many weeks as dilettantism on the part of vattenfall .
she said voters held the key to the future of germany 's power generation .
" whoever wants to see scrap reactors like kruemmel closed down has to fight with us against a black-yellow coalition , " she told the tagesspiegel , referring to the possibility of a coalition between the " black " christian democrats and the " yellow " free democrats .
merkel 's christian democrats are in favor of extending the operational lives of germany 's nuclear plants , which , under a law passed by the former spd / green coalition , are currently due to be phased out by the year 2021 .
bridging a gap to a cleaner energy future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fire put krümmel out of action in 2007 gabriel said that to close the oldest reactors now rather would not , as some suggest , pose a supply problem , as germany currently produces more than it uses .
but the christian democratic bavarian environment minister , markus söder , said it was illusionary to think that bavaria - which is 60-70 percent reliant on nuclear energy - could switch to alternative energy sources from one day to the next .
he told bavarian public radio that germany needed nuclear fuel " until we can replace it entirely with regenerative energy . "
kruemmel has often been cited in connection with a relatively high incidence of leukemia in the region , but there has never been any proof that the reactor is to blame. tkw / ap / reuters / dpa editor : michael lawton tkw / ap / reuters / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

authorities say the initially peaceful protest turned violent when police attempted to break it up . hans-gert poettering , president of the european parliament , has expressed grave concern about the bloody clashes in xinjiang .
in a statement released by his office , poettering described reports about how the protests had been handled as " deeply disturbing . "
he called on both sides to exercise calm and restraint and urged the chinese authorities to fully respect human rights , " especially the right to freedom of expression and peaceful demonstration . "
in an interview with dw-tv , german human rights commissioner guenther nooke on monday also spoke out against the eruption of violence between china and uighurs in the xinjiang province .
deutsche welle : how does the german government view the events in the xinjiang province ?
guenther nooke : we have not been in a position to come to an official assessment because not enough information has been made available yet , but of course we know that there have been ongoing problems with the uighurs because they are seen by the leaders in beijing , and by the chinese in general , as suspected terrorists .
this has led to tensions between the han chinese and the uighurs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guenther nooke , germany 's human rights commissioner what sort of influence can the german government exercise ?
i think we have to call on the beijing leadership to act in accordance with the rule of law , even if there are grey areas , and properly investigate situations like the one in the toy factory in southern china , which seems to have sparked the unrest , and that they refrain from reacting with disproportionate force .
that is unacceptable , no matter what factors may have contributed to it , including the possibility that demonstrators committed acts of violence .

the energy debate heats up ahead of elections germany 's social democrats have appealed to chancellor angela merkel to consider an alternative to nuclear fuel .
the calls followed technical problems that bumped a northern plant from the national grid . social democrat environment minister sigmar gabriel called on merkel and economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg to give up their nuclear course in order to preserve " the security of german citizens . "
in an interview with berlin 's tagesspiegel daily , gabriel said " the recent incidents in krümmel prove we can not justify the protracted use of older power plants . "
indeed the kruemmel reactor in the northern state of schleswig holstein only roared back to life at the end of june after a fire in 2007 forced its closure for two full years .
and in the few days since its reopening , the plant has twice been removed from the national grid . action not investigation the plant 's swedish operators , vattenfall , say the latest shutdown , which put out the majority of traffic lights across hamburg and left thousands of homes in the region with a reduced electricity supply , was the result of a short-circuit .
they say they are investigating the cause , and have not indicated when normal operations might resume .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not quite business as usual at the krümmel plant but social democrat gabriel wants more than an investigation .
speaking to ard television on monday morning , he said the oldest eight of germany 's seventeen nuclear reactors should be removed from the national grid immediately .
he also called for a tightening of nuclear phase-out laws in order to make it possible for newer , more reliable plants to fulfil the remit of the older ones he wishes to see closed .
electorate to decide both the social democrats and the greens have seized on the latest kruemmel shutdown as an election campaign opportunity .
" on september 27th , germany will decide if this , and seven other reactors , should remain in operation as the cdu and chancellor merkel suggest , " gabriel , whose spd is currently in a coalition with the cdu , told the ard . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clean energy sources ca n't supply a whole nation .
yet .
renate kuenast , leading green party candidate , described kruemmel 's two malfunctions in as many weeks as dilettantism on the part of vattenfall .
she said voters held the key to the future of germany 's power generation .
" whoever wants to see scrap reactors like kruemmel closed down has to fight with us against a black-yellow coalition , " she told the tagesspiegel , referring to the possibility of a coalition between the " black " christian democrats and the " yellow " free democrats .
merkel 's christian democrats are in favor of extending the operational lives of germany 's nuclear plants , which , under a law passed by the former spd / green coalition , are currently due to be phased out by the year 2021 .
bridging a gap to a cleaner energy future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fire put krümmel out of action in 2007 gabriel said that to close the oldest reactors now rather would not , as some suggest , pose a supply problem , as germany currently produces more than it uses .
but the christian democratic bavarian environment minister , markus söder , said it was illusionary to think that bavaria - which is 60-70 percent reliant on nuclear energy - could switch to alternative energy sources from one day to the next .
he told bavarian public radio that germany needed nuclear fuel " until we can replace it entirely with regenerative energy . "
kruemmel has often been cited in connection with a relatively high incidence of leukemia in the region , but there has never been any proof that the reactor is to blame. tkw / ap / reuters / dpa editor : michael lawton tkw / ap / reuters / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

protesters and troops have clashed in tegucigalpa , the capital of honduras .
unconfirmed reports say that at least two protesters have been shot dead and several wounded . riot police also fired teargas to try and disperse thousands of supporters of ousted honduras president manuel zelaya , who had gathered at the airport in tegucigalpa . when protestors pushed through barricades at the airport , at least one soldier opened fire , killing two , including a ten-year-old boy , and wounding several other people . the crowd broke and ran . eye witnesses reported that some miltary officers began taking rifles away from junior soldiers , as ambulances tried to get through . zelaya , the country 's democratically elected president , was due to arrive at approximately 23:00 gmt , but honduran airport authorities refused the plane permission to land . at least half a dozen military vehicles blocked the only runway at the airport in tegucigalpa . interim president roberto micheletti , installed after last week 's coup , had said that he would not allow zelaya to return and had vowed to arrest the ousted president if he did reach honduran territory . zelaya was underway on a private plane with miguel d 'escoto , a nicaraguan diplomat and president of the un general assembly .
the ousted president spoke to tv station telesur from the plane and his comments were broadcast live across honduras . zelaya 's plane has now landed at managua in nicaragua , but he has vowed to try again on monday or tuesday . the nightly curfew is to be brought forward three hours , to 7pm , as the military attempts to disperse the large crowds still waiting near the airport . a small crowd of demonstrators have refused to leave the place where the shootings occurred . a back-up delegation headed by jose miguel insulza , secretary-general of the organization of american states -lrb- oas -rrb- , with presidents cristina fernandez de kirchner of argentina , rafael correa of ecuador and fernando lugo of paraguay was due to fly to el salvador later on sunday , to monitor the situation in honduras . meanwhile , interim leader roberto micheletti ramped up tensions by claiming that nicaraguan troops were moving toward their joint border , a claim nicaraguan military immediately denied . ch / afp / reuters editor : michael durrie send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 06.07.2009 german state to introduce college training for muslim imams großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most imams in germany completed their training in their home countries one german state is hoping to improve the integration of its muslim community by offering imam training programs at university . in most mosques in germany , prayers are said in arabic and the sermon is usually given in turkish .
german is rarely heard . " we have 2,600 mosques in germany and i do n't know a single imam who has a european education , " said political scientist bassam tibi , a professing muslim .
" how can they show the muslim who live here how to live ?
these imams would probably tell me i should n't integrate . " bulent ucar , professor for islamic studies at the university of osnabrueck , said that it 's crucial to the authentic development of islam in germany and europe that imams are educated on the continent . " only then can we have religious leaders who are informed about the country and the people and are aware of the cultural sensibilities here in germany and can act accordingly in their work in the mosque , " he added . to address the issue , the interior minister of lower saxony , uwe schuenemann , who is also the state 's integration minister , has announced a new education initiative for imams . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the university of osnabrueck was founded in 1668 " a continuing education program should be offered very soon , " said schuenemann .
" imams from turkey will be able to take courses in the teaching of religion , civic education and german . " the first batch of german-educated imams is set to graduate in osnabrueck in three years . job prospects for new imams in the past , imams have taken a reverse path : even german muslims with turkish roots have returned to turkey to complete their training . now schuenemann wants to work together with schura , a state-wide umbrella organizations for muslim groups , and ditib , the national association of turkish muslim congregations , to establish an imam training program in germany . " there are plans later on to add a masters program to the new bachelors program , " said schuenemann , " so that these imams can also teach courses in the muslim religion in schools . " in germany , elementary and high schools offer - generally catholic or protestant - religion courses .
alternatively , students can choose to take ethics .

this followed summit talks at the kremlin on monday to " reset " bilateral relations . us president barack obama and his russian counterpart , dmitry medvedev , signed a " joint understanding " aimed at reducing the number of nuclear warheads held by each of their countries to between 1,500 and 1,675 , compared with the maximum 2,200 the existing strategic arms reduction treaty -lrb- start -rrb- between their two countries allows . the two sides are also to aim to reduce the number of missiles capable of delivering the warheads from the current maximum of 1,600 allowed for each side to between 500 and 1,100 .
at a press conference following their summit talks at the kremlin on monday , medvedev said moscow wanted a " fresh start ” in relations with washington despite persisting differences .
admitting that relations between the two sides were not at an optimal level , he said " our countries are aiming at cooperation commensurate with the 21st century . " agreeing to forge ahead with disarmament talks , the russian leader said showed that russia and the united states were facing up to their superpower responsibilities .
for his part , obama praised what he called russia 's contribution in stemming nuclear threats to the world .
“ we resolved to reset us-russian relations , ” he said at the joint press conference .
he stressed the joint efforts being made towards a follow-up to the start treaty , saying the two countries aimed to " lead by example " in cutting back their nuclear weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skepticism persists in both countries over what can be achieved building on recent progress while admitting that some of the differences between the two sides were not likely to simply fade away , the two leaders sought to highlight progress made in recent months .
" we are confident that we can continue to build on the excellent discussions that we had in london , ” obama said , adding : “ and that on a whole host of issues - including security issues , economic issues , energy issues , environmental issues - that the united states and russia have more in common than they have differences . ”
the two countries have agreed to set up a joint commission on some of these issues .
more notably , military cooperation , which suffered in the aftermath of the russia-georgia conflict last august , is to recommence .
obama said if the two sides were to continue to hard work in the next few days , they could make “ extraordinary progress that would benefit the people of both countries . "
echoing those sentiments , medvedev said not just their two countries but the rest of the world too would gain from better us-russian relations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korea continues its provocative actions security cooperation the us president also said that he and medvedev shared concerns over nuclear proliferation and related developments in countries like north korea and iran .
he said that the two sides had taken “ important steps forward to strengthen our security through greater cooperation , " adding that he and his russian counterpart agreed on the “ need to combat the threat of violent extremism , particularly from al-qaeda " .
in an important sign of growing security cooperation , moscow has agreed to allow us military planes to fly over russian territory to afghanistan , which in obama 's words , is a “ substantial contribution ” that will save the us “ time and resources ” in its afghanistan mission .
problems persist medvedev said he saw clear progress in talks with the us on missile defence as the obama administration was prepared to listen to russian concerns .
he described monday 's summit as a “ first but very important step ” toward revitalizing relations between the former cold war foes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama says the us is keen on talking to both russian leaders despite positive talk on both sides , even president medvedev admitted to the existence of some serious glitches .

the austrian billionaire 's new fifth league team is named rasenballsport -lrb- rb -rrb- leipzig , and he wants it in the bundesliga . no prizes for guessing what you are meant to associate with the team 's new initials .
still , who could blame it ?
for the small-time club formerly known as ssv markranstaedt on the quiet outskirts of leipzig , the corporate reference is hardly an onerous price to pay for a shot at the major league .
" a global company as a sponsor , what could be better , " ssv markranstaedt manager holger nussbaum told the local leipziger volkszeitung .
the regional football association has given its approval , the contracts have been signed , and details of the venture are being worked out .
practice is set to begin any day .
" in the long run , we are aiming for the german premier league .
as a rule , we reach our goals , so that is what we are hoping for in leipzig as well , " says red bull founder , dietrich mateschitz .
mateschitz is going even further than dietmar hopp , who funded small-town team tsv hoffenheim and helped it reach the bundesliga .
he , at least , was a local businessman , but the only link that mateschitz has with rb leipzig is the initials of his product .
lofty goals a sponsor for many different sports , red bull already owns a football club in austria , the red bull salzburg team , as well as the us team red bull new york .
the energy drink firm funds soccer schools in ghana and brazil , and owns red bull racing , the former ford jaguar racing formula one team . “ we want to help give soccer in the region the significance it deserves , ” says red bull soccer manager markus egger . ” red bull is not coming to leipzig to take anything away - on the contrary . ”
two of rb leipzig 's arch rivals had hoped to win red bull as a sponsor for themselves .
but in the end , fc sachsen and 1 .
fc lokomotive leipzig lost out to markranstaedt because the former faces insolvency and the latter is known for provoking match riots .
for the time being , red bull 's new soccer team will play in the " stadion am bad " -lrb- capacity : 5,500 spectators -rrb- in markranstaedt – but the club has aspirations to sail through the divisions as soon as possible , and move into the world cup stadium in leipzig , which seats 45,000 people .
eight new players , together with coaches tino vogel , lars weissenberger , and goalie coach perry braeutigam , are expected to manage the leap from fifth to first division .
as far as money is concerned , the sky is the limit , says red bull soccer chief egger .

the energy debate heats up ahead of elections germany 's social democrats have appealed to chancellor angela merkel to consider an alternative to nuclear fuel .
the calls followed technical problems that bumped a northern plant from the national grid . social democrat environment minister sigmar gabriel called on merkel and economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg to give up their nuclear course in order to preserve " the security of german citizens . "
in an interview with berlin 's tagesspiegel daily , gabriel said " the recent incidents in krümmel prove we can not justify the protracted use of older power plants . "
indeed the kruemmel reactor in the northern state of schleswig holstein only roared back to life at the end of june after a fire in 2007 forced its closure for two full years .
and in the few days since its reopening , the plant has twice been removed from the national grid . action not investigation the plant 's swedish operators , vattenfall , say the latest shutdown , which put out the majority of traffic lights across hamburg and left thousands of homes in the region with a reduced electricity supply , was the result of a short-circuit .
they say they are investigating the cause , and have not indicated when normal operations might resume .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not quite business as usual at the krümmel plant but social democrat gabriel wants more than an investigation .
speaking to ard television on monday morning , he said the oldest eight of germany 's seventeen nuclear reactors should be removed from the national grid immediately .
he also called for a tightening of nuclear phase-out laws in order to make it possible for newer , more reliable plants to fulfil the remit of the older ones he wishes to see closed .
electorate to decide both the social democrats and the greens have seized on the latest kruemmel shutdown as an election campaign opportunity .
" on september 27th , germany will decide if this , and seven other reactors , should remain in operation as the cdu and chancellor merkel suggest , " gabriel , whose spd is currently in a coalition with the cdu , told the ard . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clean energy sources ca n't supply a whole nation .
yet .
renate kuenast , leading green party candidate , described kruemmel 's two malfunctions in as many weeks as dilettantism on the part of vattenfall .
she said voters held the key to the future of germany 's power generation .
" whoever wants to see scrap reactors like kruemmel closed down has to fight with us against a black-yellow coalition , " she told the tagesspiegel , referring to the possibility of a coalition between the " black " christian democrats and the " yellow " free democrats .
merkel 's christian democrats are in favor of extending the operational lives of germany 's nuclear plants , which , under a law passed by the former spd / green coalition , are currently due to be phased out by the year 2021 .
bridging a gap to a cleaner energy future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fire put krümmel out of action in 2007 gabriel said that to close the oldest reactors now rather would not , as some suggest , pose a supply problem , as germany currently produces more than it uses .
but the christian democratic bavarian environment minister , markus söder , said it was illusionary to think that bavaria - which is 60-70 percent reliant on nuclear energy - could switch to alternative energy sources from one day to the next .
he told bavarian public radio that germany needed nuclear fuel " until we can replace it entirely with regenerative energy . "
kruemmel has often been cited in connection with a relatively high incidence of leukemia in the region , but there has never been any proof that the reactor is to blame. tkw / ap / reuters / dpa editor : michael lawton tkw / ap / reuters / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the public lost their jobs and savings and now the government wants to know why . in an effort to thoroughly investigate the economic collapse and related crimes , the icelandic government has sought help from a prominent european figure . newly elected mep eva joly , the norwegian-born french magistrate who became famous as the lead judge in the elf aquitaine corruption scandal , acts as special adviser to iceland ‘ s authorities .
deutsche welle : ms joly , how would you compare this investigation with the elf aquitaine affair ?
eva joly : this is much huger , much much more important .
this bankruptcy is much bigger than enron , involving a lot of people , involving other banks , and really the investigation is huge .
what about the time and costs involved ?
it will probably be expensive .
i calculated that in order to pay for people and experts from abroad – and we need highly trained experts – we will need some three million euros a year .
and it will take a long time , it 's impossible to say how long at the moment .
that will depend on what kind of cooperation we will get from abroad and how far we will go .
but i think that we can reasonably say that within two or three years , we should have some cases ready to go to court .
if i judge by the elf case we could even spend up to seven years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people in iceland lost their savings when the banks collapsed why is it so important to spend time and money chasing " white collar criminals " ?
i think it is of the utmost important for iceland to carry out this investigation for the social contract to function .
for people to have the courage to go on to live here because what we see today is that people are full of despair and many of them are moving away .
they are taking jobs in norway and that must not happen .
people must stay , they must fight , they must fight for their culture and for justice , and i think here , like in all the nordic countries , the feeling of justice is very important - and today there is a total feeling of injustice .
we have a huge responsibility to show that the institutions are able to carry out this inquiry and that the culprits will be convicted .
only a couple of weeks ago you threatened to step down from your post .
what was the problem ?
well , you know , here in iceland it 's a very small country .
there are only 300.000 inhabitants and people are closely linked .
you always meet the wife of somebody , or the cousin , or the uncle .
so it happens that the state prosecutor 's son is involved in the inquiry , so he is inhabile and he did n't resign from his office and i was very much afraid of that because that could jeopardize the investigation .
so i asked for his resignation and i asked for more money to do the investigation and for more people .
i do not want to be an alibi .
because i am here , people think that this investigation is serious , so i must always ensure that things are done correctly .
extra staff will now be made available for you , including three independent prosecutors .
what about the state prosecutor , who will obviously have to stay out of the investigation ?
he does n't want to step down because he 's protected by law , you see , and this is normal in a democracy .
but this situation has not been foreseen by any law .
i think the possibility to have an ad hoc state prosecutor is meant for small cases , when one of your relatives is involved in stealing a little motorbike for instance that could be the case .
but when it is the whole economic system , all the institutions in the country are involved .
what sense does it have to say i will stay state prosecutor and be isolated and not be able to participate in the most important debates ?
how do you feel the european community has reacted to iceland 's financial collapse iceland has been dealt with in a very rough manner .
i think it was a european issue .
iceland is a member of the european economic community and it was our common bank system that was involved , the common regulators were involved and i think we could have sought a european solution for iceland !
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joining the eu could restore some calm to iceland what are your thoughts on eu membership for iceland ?
i think from the eu point of view that it would be very interesting for us to have iceland on board .
it 's a very old civilization and they have solid democratic traditions that would reinforce the nordic culture of transparency and good governance .
and they also have resources that are important for europe like energy and fish .
so i think it would be very nice for us - and also for them - to be part of the european union .

borisov , whose citizens for european development of bulgaria party -lrb- gerb -rrb- won just under half of the 240 seats up for grabs in sunday 's elections , says he wants to form a coalition that will prioritise the fight against corruption and boost the ailing economy .
gerb is widely expected to enter negotiations with the blue coalition , a group of rightist parties that collectively picked up 16 seats .
‘ batman ' borisov has also pledged to work towards the eradication of ethnic tensions in bulgaria .
" we want equality for christians and muslims and all ethnic groups living in bulgaria , " he said , adding that " anyone who raises the question of bulgaria 's ethnic map is working against democracy and the bulgarian citizens . "
improving european relations besides dealing with pressing domestic issues , the incoming premier has plenty of work to do in improving strained relations with the european union . last year the eu froze 500 million euros -lrb- $ 700 million -rrb- in aid for the balkan nation amid concerns over rampant corruption .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels wants to know exactly how sofia is going to spend eu money although the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , has since granted sofia 115 million euros for a highway project and technical assistance , the commissioner for regional policy , danuta hubner , says bulgaria still has to a lot of work to do before it can access the remaining aid funds .
" this decision -lsb- to lift the suspension -rsb- is a strong incentive for bulgaria to strengthen its efforts in all areas where funds are still suspended .
we need a future system that protects eu funding from any improper use . "
analysts say the new government must also quickly tackle economic policy issues to attract investors , many of whom fled this year , in part because of the global financial crisis .

the public lost their jobs and savings and now the government wants to know why . in an effort to thoroughly investigate the economic collapse and related crimes , the icelandic government has sought help from a prominent european figure . newly elected mep eva joly , the norwegian-born french magistrate who became famous as the lead judge in the elf aquitaine corruption scandal , acts as special adviser to iceland ‘ s authorities .
deutsche welle : ms joly , how would you compare this investigation with the elf aquitaine affair ?
eva joly : this is much huger , much much more important .
this bankruptcy is much bigger than enron , involving a lot of people , involving other banks , and really the investigation is huge .
what about the time and costs involved ?
it will probably be expensive .
i calculated that in order to pay for people and experts from abroad – and we need highly trained experts – we will need some three million euros a year .
and it will take a long time , it 's impossible to say how long at the moment .
that will depend on what kind of cooperation we will get from abroad and how far we will go .
but i think that we can reasonably say that within two or three years , we should have some cases ready to go to court .
if i judge by the elf case we could even spend up to seven years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people in iceland lost their savings when the banks collapsed why is it so important to spend time and money chasing " white collar criminals " ?
i think it is of the utmost important for iceland to carry out this investigation for the social contract to function .
for people to have the courage to go on to live here because what we see today is that people are full of despair and many of them are moving away .
they are taking jobs in norway and that must not happen .
people must stay , they must fight , they must fight for their culture and for justice , and i think here , like in all the nordic countries , the feeling of justice is very important - and today there is a total feeling of injustice .
we have a huge responsibility to show that the institutions are able to carry out this inquiry and that the culprits will be convicted .
only a couple of weeks ago you threatened to step down from your post .
what was the problem ?
well , you know , here in iceland it 's a very small country .
there are only 300.000 inhabitants and people are closely linked .
you always meet the wife of somebody , or the cousin , or the uncle .
so it happens that the state prosecutor 's son is involved in the inquiry , so he is inhabile and he did n't resign from his office and i was very much afraid of that because that could jeopardize the investigation .
so i asked for his resignation and i asked for more money to do the investigation and for more people .
i do not want to be an alibi .
because i am here , people think that this investigation is serious , so i must always ensure that things are done correctly .
extra staff will now be made available for you , including three independent prosecutors .
what about the state prosecutor , who will obviously have to stay out of the investigation ?
he does n't want to step down because he 's protected by law , you see , and this is normal in a democracy .
but this situation has not been foreseen by any law .
i think the possibility to have an ad hoc state prosecutor is meant for small cases , when one of your relatives is involved in stealing a little motorbike for instance that could be the case .
but when it is the whole economic system , all the institutions in the country are involved .
what sense does it have to say i will stay state prosecutor and be isolated and not be able to participate in the most important debates ?
how do you feel the european community has reacted to iceland 's financial collapse iceland has been dealt with in a very rough manner .
i think it was a european issue .
iceland is a member of the european economic community and it was our common bank system that was involved , the common regulators were involved and i think we could have sought a european solution for iceland !
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joining the eu could restore some calm to iceland what are your thoughts on eu membership for iceland ?
i think from the eu point of view that it would be very interesting for us to have iceland on board .
it 's a very old civilization and they have solid democratic traditions that would reinforce the nordic culture of transparency and good governance .
and they also have resources that are important for europe like energy and fish .
so i think it would be very nice for us - and also for them - to be part of the european union .

barack obama wants talks in moscow to lead toward reductions . nuclear arms reduction has a prominent place on the agenda of the two-day summit in moscow between russia and the united states .
the issue is a political priority for us president barack obama , who gave a speech in prague in april in which he outlined his vision of a world free of nuclear weapons . for russia on the other hand , bilateral arms-reduction talks are one of the few issues around which moscow feels its clout and cold war history makes it an equal to its one-time rival . for some time , both times have , regarding the numbers at least , made significant progress in arms reduction .
in the mid-1960s , the us had more then 30,000 warheads in its arsenal ; the russians , 20 years later , had some 40,000 .
since then , the numbers on both sides have fallen to around 5,000 . most of these warheads have a explosive force of from 10 to 30 times that of the atomic bomb that was dropped on hiroshima in 1945 . start treaty at the end of this year , the most comprehensive nuclear reduction treaty ever signed , the 1991 start treaty , will expire .
start -lrb- later renamed start i -rrb- put an upper limit of 6,000 battle-ready nuclear warheads and some 1,600 launching systems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president george bush and soviet president gorbachev at the signing of start in 1991 in addition to start , both sides signed off on the " treaty of moscow " in 2002 .
it sees a further reduction on both sides to 1,700 to 2,000 operational strategic warheads . however , the moscow document calls on verification of the agreements to be based on the procedures outlined in start , which is considered impractical by both the us and russia .
in addition , it says nothing about the development of new missiles with multiple warheads . in order to move forward with nuclear disarmament , a new version or an extension of the start treaty is necessary . by the numbers the american nuclear arsenal has , according to recent figures put out by the american " bulletin of the atomic scientists , " already reached the upper limit of 2,200 set by the treaty of moscow .
half of us launch systems are intercontinental missiles stationed on submarines , one-fourth are land-based intercontinental missiles and another one-fourth are long-range bombers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president obama in prague calling for a nuclear weapon-free world us scientists count some 2,500 warheads in america 's active reserve , as well as 500 non-strategic nuclear weapons , mostly found in us bases in europe .
the total : around 5,200 nuclear warheads .
more than 4,000 additional ones are on a waiting list to be decommissioned . the russian nuclear stockpile contains just under 2,800 strategic operational warheads , of which half are on land-based intercontinental missiles .
the other half are on long-range bombers and submarines . in addition , russia possesses 2,000 non-strategic nuclear weapons , mostly missile and anti-aircraft systems as well as tactical atomic weapons such as guided missiles .
another 8,000 warheads are held in reserve or are candidates for decommissioning . missile shield hurdle despite the reductions in their nuclear arsenals by both the us and russia , an agreement on a new arms control treaty mandating further cuts -down to 1,500 warheads - will not be easily attained . besides details such as how launch systems would be included in the equation , the biggest hurdle is the new missile-shield project planned by the us in eastern europe . bildunterschrift : the 2008 signing of an agreement to base missile interceptors in poland was not to russia 's liking the plans were developed under obama 's predecessor , george w. bush .
according to the us , the system would be designed to intercept the small number of missiles that might be launched from countries such as iran or north korea . moscow , however , considers the planned missile and radar facilities close to its western border as a threat to its security and as something that would undermine its own nuclear deterrent potential . if the us does not abandon its plans for missile facilities in poland and the czech republic , moscow signaled as recently as this past weekend , the kremlin would not sign off on any successor to the start treaty . author : hans spross -lrb- jam -rrb- editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 06.07.2009 coalition talks in the offing for bulgaria ’ s centre-right winners großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after the elections : boiko borisov is planning to turn bulgaria around bulgaria 's center-right opposition party is gearing up for coalition talks after beating the ruling socialists in the country 's first parliamentary elections since joining the european union two years ago . bulgaria 's next prime minister is expected to be sofia mayor and former bodyguard boiko borisov , who has been nicknamed ' batman ' for his tough talk on the country 's endemic corruption .
borisov , whose citizens for european development of bulgaria party -lrb- gerb -rrb- won just under half of the 240 seats up for grabs in sunday 's elections , says he wants to form a coalition that will prioritise the fight against corruption and boost the ailing economy .
gerb is widely expected to enter negotiations with the blue coalition , a group of rightist parties that collectively picked up 16 seats .
‘ batman ' borisov has also pledged to work towards the eradication of ethnic tensions in bulgaria .
" we want equality for christians and muslims and all ethnic groups living in bulgaria , " he said , adding that " anyone who raises the question of bulgaria 's ethnic map is working against democracy and the bulgarian citizens . "
improving european relations besides dealing with pressing domestic issues , the incoming premier has plenty of work to do in improving strained relations with the european union . last year the eu froze 500 million euros -lrb- $ 700 million -rrb- in aid for the balkan nation amid concerns over rampant corruption .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels wants to know exactly how sofia is going to spend eu money although the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , has since granted sofia 115 million euros for a highway project and technical assistance , the commissioner for regional policy , danuta hubner , says bulgaria still has to a lot of work to do before it can access the remaining aid funds .
" this decision -lsb- to lift the suspension -rsb- is a strong incentive for bulgaria to strengthen its efforts in all areas where funds are still suspended .
we need a future system that protects eu funding from any improper use . "
analysts say the new government must also quickly tackle economic policy issues to attract investors , many of whom fled this year , in part because of the global financial crisis .

the justice ministry in saxony has confirmed the report , making this the second such case in recent years . according to the report , two inmates aged 15 and 24 years tortured another inmate at the regis-breitingen juvenile detention center , located near leipzig in the eastern state of saxony . the state of saxony has pressed charges of attempted murder against the inmates , though it is still unclear when the trial will take place . neo-nazi inspired torture according to the report , the two stand accused of trying to get the 18-year-old to commit suicide by beating him with a broomstick and pouring boiling water on him . out of fear , the attacked inmate attempted to hang himself in his cell but was unsuccessful .
after seeing that he survived the attempted suicide , the attackers then attempted to strangle him with a belt but failed in their attempts .
the victim was able to escape and alert the guards . before the beatings , the inmates , at this point together with other inmates , allegedly painted swastikas on their victim . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the incident in saxony recalls a similarly heinous case in siegburg in 2006 not the first case of juvenile torture in germany this latest case , which allegedly happened in may 2008 , is similar to a brutal murder that took place inside a juvenile prison in 2006 .
in that case , three inmates at the siegburg detention center near the western city of bonn tortured a fellow inmate for hours , raping and beating him unconscious .
the three then hung their victim , in an attempt to make it appear as if the victim had taken his own life . the state of north rhine-westphalia found all three inmates guilty , with the main attacker receiving a further ten years in a maximum security prison .
the other attackers both received 10 years in prison . critique of the inmate " re-socialization " process this latest case of juvenile inmate torture has aroused debate in germany , particularly with regard to the question of how to deal with juvenile delinquents effectively . klaus bartl , a speaker for the left party , says the heinous nature of this crime is a sign that the current system is n't working . " this horrible incident is yet further evidence that the juvenile prison in saxony does n't help its inmates .
it does the opposite of what it says it should , which is to " re-socialize " them and stop them from using so much violence . " the regis-breitingen juvenile detention center is the most modern of its kind in saxony .
the prison has room for almost 400 inmates and was opened on october 5th , 2007 . less than one month after its opening , one of its inmates , a 21-year-old charged with murder , committed suicide in his cell . glb / dpa / ap editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russia released a new security strategy in may , taking another look at threats , both old and new . us president obama has said the us needs to reset its relationship with russia , which faces a series of challenges , including a public suspicious of us motives , a kremlin with two men at the helm and hard feelings on a variety of issues . russia is also talking about improving ties with its former adversary , and has been doing some resetting of its own , primarily regarding its security doctrine .
russian president dmitry medvedev signed a decree in may on the country 's national security strategy , which is meant to be a general guide for russian domestic and foreign policy until 2020 . that policy still mentions threats dating from the cold war era .
but for the first time in recent russian history , the country 's national security is not perceived as being threatened primarily by dangers from outside or being dependent on its own defensive capabilities . " the most important tasks and , at the same time , the most serious dangers are to be found inside the country , " said dmitry suslov , the deputy research director of the moscow-based council for foreign and defense policy .
" that means there 's a need for modernization , a more effective system of state intervention , fighting corruption , and so on . " the transition from perceived external threats to a new look at home-grown dangers is a natural development , especially as the new us administration has worked to diffuse some of the tensions that had grown over recent years between the old cold war sparring partners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president dmitry medvedev chaired a national security council meeting discussing russia 's security strategy " it 's a normal development , because -lrb- russia 's -rrb- relations with the west have improved over the last weeks or months since obama took office , " said alexander rahr , russia analyst at the german council on foreign relations . the new security document largely puts the focus on economic and social categories , for example , economic growth , health care , science , education , culture and quality of life .
it lays out the ambitious goal , especially given the state of today 's russia , of becoming a world leader in these areas .
one particular threat for national security is unemployment , the widening gap between rich and poor , population decreases and rising domestic prices . energy security the issue of russia 's energy future and security is also emphasized in the document .
moscow predicts that the international quest for access to energy sources will become more intense - in the barents sea , around the antarctic , the caspian region and in central asia . since russia considers military intervention possibly being used in the struggle for energy , it also sees an additional threat to russia 's borders . the kremlin openly describes its own enormous energy reserves as a way to bring the country closer to its ultimate goal - regaining its status as a superpower . old foes despite the change in focus , some security concerns have stayed the same , especially regarding foreign policy .
the asia-pacific region is almost a blank spot on the map for russia , despite its border with an ever-more powerful china . the foreign threat scenarios often concern the " usual suspects , " the us and nato , although they are not mentioned by name .
this might well be a topic of conversation between medvedev and obama . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : america 's planned missile defense system has been a bone of contention between washington and moscow the security document complains of the absence of a robust international security architecture and the quest for military superiority .
besides the modernization of nuclear arsenals , the document mentions the development of high-tech weapons , the militarization of outer space , strategic armaments in non-nuclear areas , the creation of a missile defense system partly stationed in eastern europe . the list is clearly referring to the us , which russia still sees as the principle threat to its security . " regarding foreign policy everything is being repeated which was said in the past , " said rahr .
" russia is against the eastern expansion of nato , and therefore certain western countries - unnamed - which would challenge russia on its western border , are being heavily criticized . " nato fears while the document says nato expansion to russia 's borders is not acceptable , almost in the same breath moscow names nato as a strategic partner necessary for the maintenance of international security . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow is suspicious of nato but needs it as an strategic partner " the -lrb- nato -rrb- block is a partner for russia since it is working on solving problems that are essential for russia 's security , such as afghanistan , " said analyst suslov .

russia released a new security strategy in may , taking another look at threats , both old and new . us president obama has said the us needs to reset its relationship with russia , which faces a series of challenges , including a public suspicious of us motives , a kremlin with two men at the helm and hard feelings on a variety of issues . russia is also talking about improving ties with its former adversary , and has been doing some resetting of its own , primarily regarding its security doctrine .
russian president dmitry medvedev signed a decree in may on the country 's national security strategy , which is meant to be a general guide for russian domestic and foreign policy until 2020 . that policy still mentions threats dating from the cold war era .
but for the first time in recent russian history , the country 's national security is not perceived as being threatened primarily by dangers from outside or being dependent on its own defensive capabilities . " the most important tasks and , at the same time , the most serious dangers are to be found inside the country , " said dmitry suslov , the deputy research director of the moscow-based council for foreign and defense policy .
" that means there 's a need for modernization , a more effective system of state intervention , fighting corruption , and so on . " the transition from perceived external threats to a new look at home-grown dangers is a natural development , especially as the new us administration has worked to diffuse some of the tensions that had grown over recent years between the old cold war sparring partners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president dmitry medvedev chaired a national security council meeting discussing russia 's security strategy " it 's a normal development , because -lrb- russia 's -rrb- relations with the west have improved over the last weeks or months since obama took office , " said alexander rahr , russia analyst at the german council on foreign relations . the new security document largely puts the focus on economic and social categories , for example , economic growth , health care , science , education , culture and quality of life .
it lays out the ambitious goal , especially given the state of today 's russia , of becoming a world leader in these areas .
one particular threat for national security is unemployment , the widening gap between rich and poor , population decreases and rising domestic prices . energy security the issue of russia 's energy future and security is also emphasized in the document .
moscow predicts that the international quest for access to energy sources will become more intense - in the barents sea , around the antarctic , the caspian region and in central asia . since russia considers military intervention possibly being used in the struggle for energy , it also sees an additional threat to russia 's borders . the kremlin openly describes its own enormous energy reserves as a way to bring the country closer to its ultimate goal - regaining its status as a superpower . old foes despite the change in focus , some security concerns have stayed the same , especially regarding foreign policy .
the asia-pacific region is almost a blank spot on the map for russia , despite its border with an ever-more powerful china . the foreign threat scenarios often concern the " usual suspects , " the us and nato , although they are not mentioned by name .
this might well be a topic of conversation between medvedev and obama . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : america 's planned missile defense system has been a bone of contention between washington and moscow the security document complains of the absence of a robust international security architecture and the quest for military superiority .
besides the modernization of nuclear arsenals , the document mentions the development of high-tech weapons , the militarization of outer space , strategic armaments in non-nuclear areas , the creation of a missile defense system partly stationed in eastern europe . the list is clearly referring to the us , which russia still sees as the principle threat to its security . " regarding foreign policy everything is being repeated which was said in the past , " said rahr .
" russia is against the eastern expansion of nato , and therefore certain western countries - unnamed - which would challenge russia on its western border , are being heavily criticized . " nato fears while the document says nato expansion to russia 's borders is not acceptable , almost in the same breath moscow names nato as a strategic partner necessary for the maintenance of international security . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow is suspicious of nato but needs it as an strategic partner " the -lrb- nato -rrb- block is a partner for russia since it is working on solving problems that are essential for russia 's security , such as afghanistan , " said analyst suslov .
" furthermore , nato is a central pillar of euro-atlantic security apparatus , whether russia likes it or not .
if russia wants to participate in such a system , it will have to work on its relations with nato . " the relationship with the us is similarly paradoxical .
although america is seen as a threat , russia is also seeking a strategic partnership of equals and wants to cooperate on the fight against terrorism and non-proliferation . " dmitry medvedev has to position himself on a foreign policy level , " said rahr .

borisov , whose citizens for european development of bulgaria party -lrb- gerb -rrb- won just under half of the 240 seats up for grabs in sunday 's elections , says he wants to form a coalition that will prioritise the fight against corruption and boost the ailing economy .
gerb is widely expected to enter negotiations with the blue coalition , a group of rightist parties that collectively picked up 16 seats .
‘ batman ' borisov has also pledged to work towards the eradication of ethnic tensions in bulgaria .
" we want equality for christians and muslims and all ethnic groups living in bulgaria , " he said , adding that " anyone who raises the question of bulgaria 's ethnic map is working against democracy and the bulgarian citizens . "
improving european relations besides dealing with pressing domestic issues , the incoming premier has plenty of work to do in improving strained relations with the european union . last year the eu froze 500 million euros -lrb- $ 700 million -rrb- in aid for the balkan nation amid concerns over rampant corruption .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels wants to know exactly how sofia is going to spend eu money although the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , has since granted sofia 115 million euros for a highway project and technical assistance , the commissioner for regional policy , danuta hubner , says bulgaria still has to a lot of work to do before it can access the remaining aid funds .
" this decision -lsb- to lift the suspension -rsb- is a strong incentive for bulgaria to strengthen its efforts in all areas where funds are still suspended .
we need a future system that protects eu funding from any improper use . "
analysts say the new government must also quickly tackle economic policy issues to attract investors , many of whom fled this year , in part because of the global financial crisis .

the public lost their jobs and savings and now the government wants to know why . in an effort to thoroughly investigate the economic collapse and related crimes , the icelandic government has sought help from a prominent european figure . newly elected mep eva joly , the norwegian-born french magistrate who became famous as the lead judge in the elf aquitaine corruption scandal , acts as special adviser to iceland ‘ s authorities .
deutsche welle : ms joly , how would you compare this investigation with the elf aquitaine affair ?
eva joly : this is much huger , much much more important .
this bankruptcy is much bigger than enron , involving a lot of people , involving other banks , and really the investigation is huge .
what about the time and costs involved ?
it will probably be expensive .
i calculated that in order to pay for people and experts from abroad – and we need highly trained experts – we will need some three million euros a year .
and it will take a long time , it 's impossible to say how long at the moment .
that will depend on what kind of cooperation we will get from abroad and how far we will go .
but i think that we can reasonably say that within two or three years , we should have some cases ready to go to court .
if i judge by the elf case we could even spend up to seven years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people in iceland lost their savings when the banks collapsed why is it so important to spend time and money chasing " white collar criminals " ?
i think it is of the utmost important for iceland to carry out this investigation for the social contract to function .
for people to have the courage to go on to live here because what we see today is that people are full of despair and many of them are moving away .
they are taking jobs in norway and that must not happen .
people must stay , they must fight , they must fight for their culture and for justice , and i think here , like in all the nordic countries , the feeling of justice is very important - and today there is a total feeling of injustice .
we have a huge responsibility to show that the institutions are able to carry out this inquiry and that the culprits will be convicted .
only a couple of weeks ago you threatened to step down from your post .
what was the problem ?
well , you know , here in iceland it 's a very small country .
there are only 300.000 inhabitants and people are closely linked .
you always meet the wife of somebody , or the cousin , or the uncle .
so it happens that the state prosecutor 's son is involved in the inquiry , so he is inhabile and he did n't resign from his office and i was very much afraid of that because that could jeopardize the investigation .
so i asked for his resignation and i asked for more money to do the investigation and for more people .
i do not want to be an alibi .
because i am here , people think that this investigation is serious , so i must always ensure that things are done correctly .
extra staff will now be made available for you , including three independent prosecutors .
what about the state prosecutor , who will obviously have to stay out of the investigation ?
he does n't want to step down because he 's protected by law , you see , and this is normal in a democracy .
but this situation has not been foreseen by any law .
i think the possibility to have an ad hoc state prosecutor is meant for small cases , when one of your relatives is involved in stealing a little motorbike for instance that could be the case .
but when it is the whole economic system , all the institutions in the country are involved .
what sense does it have to say i will stay state prosecutor and be isolated and not be able to participate in the most important debates ?
how do you feel the european community has reacted to iceland 's financial collapse iceland has been dealt with in a very rough manner .
i think it was a european issue .
iceland is a member of the european economic community and it was our common bank system that was involved , the common regulators were involved and i think we could have sought a european solution for iceland !
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joining the eu could restore some calm to iceland what are your thoughts on eu membership for iceland ?
i think from the eu point of view that it would be very interesting for us to have iceland on board .
it 's a very old civilization and they have solid democratic traditions that would reinforce the nordic culture of transparency and good governance .
and they also have resources that are important for europe like energy and fish .
so i think it would be very nice for us - and also for them - to be part of the european union .

we have a huge responsibility to show that the institutions are able to carry out this inquiry and that the culprits will be convicted .
only a couple of weeks ago you threatened to step down from your post .
what was the problem ?
well , you know , here in iceland it 's a very small country .
there are only 300.000 inhabitants and people are closely linked .
you always meet the wife of somebody , or the cousin , or the uncle .
so it happens that the state prosecutor 's son is involved in the inquiry , so he is inhabile and he did n't resign from his office and i was very much afraid of that because that could jeopardize the investigation .
so i asked for his resignation and i asked for more money to do the investigation and for more people .
i do not want to be an alibi .
because i am here , people think that this investigation is serious , so i must always ensure that things are done correctly .
extra staff will now be made available for you , including three independent prosecutors .
what about the state prosecutor , who will obviously have to stay out of the investigation ?
he does n't want to step down because he 's protected by law , you see , and this is normal in a democracy .
but this situation has not been foreseen by any law .
i think the possibility to have an ad hoc state prosecutor is meant for small cases , when one of your relatives is involved in stealing a little motorbike for instance that could be the case .
but when it is the whole economic system , all the institutions in the country are involved .
what sense does it have to say i will stay state prosecutor and be isolated and not be able to participate in the most important debates ?
how do you feel the european community has reacted to iceland 's financial collapse iceland has been dealt with in a very rough manner .
i think it was a european issue .
iceland is a member of the european economic community and it was our common bank system that was involved , the common regulators were involved and i think we could have sought a european solution for iceland !
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joining the eu could restore some calm to iceland what are your thoughts on eu membership for iceland ?
i think from the eu point of view that it would be very interesting for us to have iceland on board .
it 's a very old civilization and they have solid democratic traditions that would reinforce the nordic culture of transparency and good governance .
and they also have resources that are important for europe like energy and fish .
so i think it would be very nice for us - and also for them - to be part of the european union .

barack obama wants talks in moscow to lead toward reductions . nuclear arms reduction has a prominent place on the agenda of the two-day summit in moscow between russia and the united states .
the issue is a political priority for us president barack obama , who gave a speech in prague in april in which he outlined his vision of a world free of nuclear weapons . for russia on the other hand , bilateral arms-reduction talks are one of the few issues around which moscow feels its clout and cold war history makes it an equal to its one-time rival . for some time , both times have , regarding the numbers at least , made significant progress in arms reduction .
in the mid-1960s , the us had more then 30,000 warheads in its arsenal ; the russians , 20 years later , had some 40,000 .
since then , the numbers on both sides have fallen to around 5,000 . most of these warheads have a explosive force of from 10 to 30 times that of the atomic bomb that was dropped on hiroshima in 1945 . start treaty at the end of this year , the most comprehensive nuclear reduction treaty ever signed , the 1991 start treaty , will expire .
start -lrb- later renamed start i -rrb- put an upper limit of 6,000 battle-ready nuclear warheads and some 1,600 launching systems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president george bush and soviet president gorbachev at the signing of start in 1991 in addition to start , both sides signed off on the " treaty of moscow " in 2002 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de china -pipe- 06.07.2009 german , european officials react to riots in china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angry protesters from the uighur minority clashed with police on sunday eu leaders have spoken out against riots in china 's xinjiang region that have claimed the lives of at least 150 people .
authorities say the initially peaceful protest turned violent when police attempted to break it up . hans-gert poettering , president of the european parliament , has expressed grave concern about the bloody clashes in xinjiang .
in a statement released by his office , poettering described reports about how the protests had been handled as " deeply disturbing . "
he called on both sides to exercise calm and restraint and urged the chinese authorities to fully respect human rights , " especially the right to freedom of expression and peaceful demonstration . "
in an interview with dw-tv , german human rights commissioner guenther nooke on monday also spoke out against the eruption of violence between china and uighurs in the xinjiang province .
deutsche welle : how does the german government view the events in the xinjiang province ?
guenther nooke : we have not been in a position to come to an official assessment because not enough information has been made available yet , but of course we know that there have been ongoing problems with the uighurs because they are seen by the leaders in beijing , and by the chinese in general , as suspected terrorists .
this has led to tensions between the han chinese and the uighurs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guenther nooke , germany 's human rights commissioner what sort of influence can the german government exercise ?
i think we have to call on the beijing leadership to act in accordance with the rule of law , even if there are grey areas , and properly investigate situations like the one in the toy factory in southern china , which seems to have sparked the unrest , and that they refrain from reacting with disproportionate force .

at a press conference following their summit talks at the kremlin on monday , medvedev said moscow wanted a " fresh start ” in relations with washington despite persisting differences .
admitting that relations between the two sides were not at an optimal level , he said " our countries are aiming at cooperation commensurate with the 21st century . " agreeing to forge ahead with disarmament talks , the russian leader said showed that russia and the united states were facing up to their superpower responsibilities .

the two countries have agreed to set up a joint commission on some of these issues .
more notably , military cooperation , which suffered in the aftermath of the russia-georgia conflict last august , is to recommence .
obama said if the two sides were to continue to hard work in the next few days , they could make “ extraordinary progress that would benefit the people of both countries . "

in an important sign of growing security cooperation , moscow has agreed to allow us military planes to fly over russian territory to afghanistan , which in obama 's words , is a “ substantial contribution ” that will save the us “ time and resources ” in its afghanistan mission .
problems persist medvedev said he saw clear progress in talks with the us on missile defence as the obama administration was prepared to listen to russian concerns .
he described monday 's summit as a “ first but very important step ” toward revitalizing relations between the former cold war foes .

the win , kaymer ’ s third on the pga european tour , is his most important . the young german needed only one extra hole to beat westwood , after the former european number one found the water with his approach to the difficult 18th . the botched extra hole came after a solid final round , however , in which westwood carded a sterling 7-under 65 to force the playoff . after 72 holes of regulation play , both players were at 13-under-par , three strokes better than third place ian poulter . putting key to victory kaymer was off to a fast start at le golf national in st. quentin-en-yvelines , france , after he tied the course record with a 62 on thursday .
rounds of 72 and 69 on friday and saturday left kaymer one back heading into sunday , and a 68 was enough to get into the playoff with westwood . a myriad of long putts , the longest an 84-footer on the eighth , proved the key to kaymer 's third european tour victory , who comes from the western german city of dusseldorf . " my putting was great all week , " kaymer told reporters .
" i made so many putts from everywhere . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many say kaymer is the next bernhard langer significant win with the victory kaymer took home the $ 930,000 top prize , which brings him to fifth on the european order of merit .
more importantly , however , the win is sure to bring kaymer into the top 20 in the world golf rankings . " the world ranking is the important thing to me , " kaymer said .
" i 've never been this high before . " this is the first time a german has won the french open in 25 years .
two-time masters champion bernhard langer was the last to the lift the trophy , when he won at the st. cloud golf club in paris in 1984 . for kaymer , who many say is walking in the footsteps of langer , germany ’ s most dominant player in the 20th century , the french open is his third international victory . he also triumphed in abu dhabi and at the bmw international last year . glb / dpa / reuters editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9800 dw-tv europe live in focus - documentaries and reports we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

for the small-time club formerly known as ssv markranstaedt on the quiet outskirts of leipzig , the corporate reference is hardly an onerous price to pay for a shot at the major league .
" a global company as a sponsor , what could be better , " ssv markranstaedt manager holger nussbaum told the local leipziger volkszeitung .
the regional football association has given its approval , the contracts have been signed , and details of the venture are being worked out .

eight new players , together with coaches tino vogel , lars weissenberger , and goalie coach perry braeutigam , are expected to manage the leap from fifth to first division .

the energy debate heats up ahead of elections germany 's social democrats have appealed to chancellor angela merkel to consider an alternative to nuclear fuel .
the calls followed technical problems that bumped a northern plant from the national grid . social democrat environment minister sigmar gabriel called on merkel and economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg to give up their nuclear course in order to preserve " the security of german citizens . "
in an interview with berlin 's tagesspiegel daily , gabriel said " the recent incidents in krümmel prove we can not justify the protracted use of older power plants . "
indeed the kruemmel reactor in the northern state of schleswig holstein only roared back to life at the end of june after a fire in 2007 forced its closure for two full years .
and in the few days since its reopening , the plant has twice been removed from the national grid . action not investigation the plant 's swedish operators , vattenfall , say the latest shutdown , which put out the majority of traffic lights across hamburg and left thousands of homes in the region with a reduced electricity supply , was the result of a short-circuit .
they say they are investigating the cause , and have not indicated when normal operations might resume .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not quite business as usual at the krümmel plant but social democrat gabriel wants more than an investigation .
speaking to ard television on monday morning , he said the oldest eight of germany 's seventeen nuclear reactors should be removed from the national grid immediately .
he also called for a tightening of nuclear phase-out laws in order to make it possible for newer , more reliable plants to fulfil the remit of the older ones he wishes to see closed .
electorate to decide both the social democrats and the greens have seized on the latest kruemmel shutdown as an election campaign opportunity .
" on september 27th , germany will decide if this , and seven other reactors , should remain in operation as the cdu and chancellor merkel suggest , " gabriel , whose spd is currently in a coalition with the cdu , told the ard . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clean energy sources ca n't supply a whole nation .
yet .
renate kuenast , leading green party candidate , described kruemmel 's two malfunctions in as many weeks as dilettantism on the part of vattenfall .
she said voters held the key to the future of germany 's power generation .
" whoever wants to see scrap reactors like kruemmel closed down has to fight with us against a black-yellow coalition , " she told the tagesspiegel , referring to the possibility of a coalition between the " black " christian democrats and the " yellow " free democrats .
merkel 's christian democrats are in favor of extending the operational lives of germany 's nuclear plants , which , under a law passed by the former spd / green coalition , are currently due to be phased out by the year 2021 .
bridging a gap to a cleaner energy future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fire put krümmel out of action in 2007 gabriel said that to close the oldest reactors now rather would not , as some suggest , pose a supply problem , as germany currently produces more than it uses .
but the christian democratic bavarian environment minister , markus söder , said it was illusionary to think that bavaria - which is 60-70 percent reliant on nuclear energy - could switch to alternative energy sources from one day to the next .
he told bavarian public radio that germany needed nuclear fuel " until we can replace it entirely with regenerative energy . "
kruemmel has often been cited in connection with a relatively high incidence of leukemia in the region , but there has never been any proof that the reactor is to blame. tkw / ap / reuters / dpa editor : michael lawton tkw / ap / reuters / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the two companies also jointly own the brunsbuettel nuclear power plant , with two-thirds in vattenfall 's hands , and share ownership of the brokdorf nuclear power plant , which is operated by eon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a pair of vattenfall-run nuclear power plants were shut down on june 28 , 2007 june 28 , 2007 : vattenfall announces that the kruemmel power plant was taken offline after a fire occurred in a transformer outside the reactor building .
shortly before the announcement , the company also said that , in a separate incident , a short-circuit led to the temporary shut-down of its nuclear power plant in brunsbuettel . june 30 , 2007 : vattenfall officials say neither of the incidents was connected to the parts of the plants responsible for nuclear power production . july 1 , 2007 : brunsbuettel goes back online but is put on stand-by after two weeks due to a transformer problem . july 3 , 2007 : the energy company says the quick shutdown in kruemmel caused a pump malfunction . july 6 , 2007 : a state nuclear regulatory agency releases information showing that smoke from the kruemmel fire clouded the control room , the plant 's internal energy supply was temporarily affected and not all relevant computer files regarding the incident were saved .
in its first press conference after the failures occurred , vattenfall admits errors were made and says misunderstandings among personnel caused the mistakes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vattenfall was criticized for not quickly sharing information about the failures july 8 , 2007 : contrary to company reports , the regulatory agency says breakdowns occurred when the brunsbuettel plant was powered back up at the beginning of the month . july 14 , 2007 : in a preliminary report , vattenfall says it should have been more open with information about the fires .
two days later , the head of the company 's nuclear division is relieved of his duties and the company 's spokesman resigns . july 18 , 2007 : vattenfall europe head klaus rauscher also resigns . july 21 , 2007 : incorrectly installed wall anchors at the brunsbuettel plant lead to the facility 's complete shutdown . feb .
4 , 2008 : a smoldering fire in the kruemmel reactor 's ventilation system is extinguished immediately after starting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the brunsbuettel facility went into operation in 1976 feb .
20 , 2008 : a defective electronic card leads to a transformer in the brunsbuettel emergency power system to shut down . may 18 , 2009 : a diesel motor in the brunsbuettel plant malfunctions during planned maintenance .
a leak is also found in the cooling system . june 19 , 2009 : after nearly two years off the power grid , the kruemmel plant is put back online .
the company says many improvements had been made to the plant 's transformers to prevent short circuits and minimize their impact should they occur . july 1 , 2009 : a malfunction in one of two transformators responsible for connecting the power plant to the grid leads to the kruemmel facility 's automatic shutdown .
the plant is put back online in a matter of hours and expected to be back at full power production by july 5 .
human error is reported to be responsible for the break down . july 4 , 2009 : kruemmel undergoes a quick shutdown after a short circuit in a transformator . july 5 , 2009 : vattenfall apologizes for not informing the state regulatory agency as required and says " safety must always come before speed " in deciding when the kruemmel plant will be turned back on .
the company adds that it is unsure what caused the short circuit or when the plant could be put back online . sms / dpa / afp editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the justice ministry in saxony has confirmed the report , making this the second such case in recent years . according to the report , two inmates aged 15 and 24 years tortured another inmate at the regis-breitingen juvenile detention center , located near leipzig in the eastern state of saxony . the state of saxony has pressed charges of attempted murder against the inmates , though it is still unclear when the trial will take place . neo-nazi inspired torture according to the report , the two stand accused of trying to get the 18-year-old to commit suicide by beating him with a broomstick and pouring boiling water on him . out of fear , the attacked inmate attempted to hang himself in his cell but was unsuccessful .
after seeing that he survived the attempted suicide , the attackers then attempted to strangle him with a belt but failed in their attempts .
the victim was able to escape and alert the guards . before the beatings , the inmates , at this point together with other inmates , allegedly painted swastikas on their victim . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the incident in saxony recalls a similarly heinous case in siegburg in 2006 not the first case of juvenile torture in germany this latest case , which allegedly happened in may 2008 , is similar to a brutal murder that took place inside a juvenile prison in 2006 .
in that case , three inmates at the siegburg detention center near the western city of bonn tortured a fellow inmate for hours , raping and beating him unconscious .
the three then hung their victim , in an attempt to make it appear as if the victim had taken his own life . the state of north rhine-westphalia found all three inmates guilty , with the main attacker receiving a further ten years in a maximum security prison .
the other attackers both received 10 years in prison . critique of the inmate " re-socialization " process this latest case of juvenile inmate torture has aroused debate in germany , particularly with regard to the question of how to deal with juvenile delinquents effectively . klaus bartl , a speaker for the left party , says the heinous nature of this crime is a sign that the current system is n't working . " this horrible incident is yet further evidence that the juvenile prison in saxony does n't help its inmates .
it does the opposite of what it says it should , which is to " re-socialize " them and stop them from using so much violence . " the regis-breitingen juvenile detention center is the most modern of its kind in saxony .
the prison has room for almost 400 inmates and was opened on october 5th , 2007 . less than one month after its opening , one of its inmates , a 21-year-old charged with murder , committed suicide in his cell . glb / dpa / ap editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i will continue to press for israel 's difficult neighbors – in syria and in lebanon – to participate constructively in these efforts towards a two-state solution , " he told reporters .

russia released a new security strategy in may , taking another look at threats , both old and new . us president obama has said the us needs to reset its relationship with russia , which faces a series of challenges , including a public suspicious of us motives , a kremlin with two men at the helm and hard feelings on a variety of issues . russia is also talking about improving ties with its former adversary , and has been doing some resetting of its own , primarily regarding its security doctrine .
russian president dmitry medvedev signed a decree in may on the country 's national security strategy , which is meant to be a general guide for russian domestic and foreign policy until 2020 . that policy still mentions threats dating from the cold war era .
but for the first time in recent russian history , the country 's national security is not perceived as being threatened primarily by dangers from outside or being dependent on its own defensive capabilities . " the most important tasks and , at the same time , the most serious dangers are to be found inside the country , " said dmitry suslov , the deputy research director of the moscow-based council for foreign and defense policy .
" that means there 's a need for modernization , a more effective system of state intervention , fighting corruption , and so on . " the transition from perceived external threats to a new look at home-grown dangers is a natural development , especially as the new us administration has worked to diffuse some of the tensions that had grown over recent years between the old cold war sparring partners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president dmitry medvedev chaired a national security council meeting discussing russia 's security strategy " it 's a normal development , because -lrb- russia 's -rrb- relations with the west have improved over the last weeks or months since obama took office , " said alexander rahr , russia analyst at the german council on foreign relations . the new security document largely puts the focus on economic and social categories , for example , economic growth , health care , science , education , culture and quality of life .
it lays out the ambitious goal , especially given the state of today 's russia , of becoming a world leader in these areas .
one particular threat for national security is unemployment , the widening gap between rich and poor , population decreases and rising domestic prices . energy security the issue of russia 's energy future and security is also emphasized in the document .
moscow predicts that the international quest for access to energy sources will become more intense - in the barents sea , around the antarctic , the caspian region and in central asia . since russia considers military intervention possibly being used in the struggle for energy , it also sees an additional threat to russia 's borders . the kremlin openly describes its own enormous energy reserves as a way to bring the country closer to its ultimate goal - regaining its status as a superpower . old foes despite the change in focus , some security concerns have stayed the same , especially regarding foreign policy .
the asia-pacific region is almost a blank spot on the map for russia , despite its border with an ever-more powerful china . the foreign threat scenarios often concern the " usual suspects , " the us and nato , although they are not mentioned by name .
this might well be a topic of conversation between medvedev and obama . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : america 's planned missile defense system has been a bone of contention between washington and moscow the security document complains of the absence of a robust international security architecture and the quest for military superiority .
besides the modernization of nuclear arsenals , the document mentions the development of high-tech weapons , the militarization of outer space , strategic armaments in non-nuclear areas , the creation of a missile defense system partly stationed in eastern europe . the list is clearly referring to the us , which russia still sees as the principle threat to its security . " regarding foreign policy everything is being repeated which was said in the past , " said rahr .
" russia is against the eastern expansion of nato , and therefore certain western countries - unnamed - which would challenge russia on its western border , are being heavily criticized . " nato fears while the document says nato expansion to russia 's borders is not acceptable , almost in the same breath moscow names nato as a strategic partner necessary for the maintenance of international security . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow is suspicious of nato but needs it as an strategic partner " the -lrb- nato -rrb- block is a partner for russia since it is working on solving problems that are essential for russia 's security , such as afghanistan , " said analyst suslov .
" furthermore , nato is a central pillar of euro-atlantic security apparatus , whether russia likes it or not .
if russia wants to participate in such a system , it will have to work on its relations with nato . " the relationship with the us is similarly paradoxical .
although america is seen as a threat , russia is also seeking a strategic partnership of equals and wants to cooperate on the fight against terrorism and non-proliferation . " dmitry medvedev has to position himself on a foreign policy level , " said rahr .
" he wants to show that he has the situation under control , and that he has the capability to modernize the country domestically without disturbances from outside .

as he went into the meeting , held at peres ' private residence , steinmeier said he had high hopes of the new us administration in the context of the middle east .
" i hope we are on the verge of a fresh start , " he said , " a fresh start that has been made possible by the initiative of the us president – a decisive , fervent call for a two-state solution made not only to israel and the palestinians but also to their arab neighbors . "
he said it was crucial to encourage " moderate arab states " to work together to secure peace in the region , adding that germany and europe would do everything they could to support the goal .
" i will continue to press for israel 's difficult neighbors – in syria and in lebanon – to participate constructively in these efforts towards a two-state solution , " he told reporters .

the public lost their jobs and savings and now the government wants to know why . in an effort to thoroughly investigate the economic collapse and related crimes , the icelandic government has sought help from a prominent european figure . newly elected mep eva joly , the norwegian-born french magistrate who became famous as the lead judge in the elf aquitaine corruption scandal , acts as special adviser to iceland ‘ s authorities .
deutsche welle : ms joly , how would you compare this investigation with the elf aquitaine affair ?
eva joly : this is much huger , much much more important .
this bankruptcy is much bigger than enron , involving a lot of people , involving other banks , and really the investigation is huge .
what about the time and costs involved ?
it will probably be expensive .
i calculated that in order to pay for people and experts from abroad – and we need highly trained experts – we will need some three million euros a year .
and it will take a long time , it 's impossible to say how long at the moment .
that will depend on what kind of cooperation we will get from abroad and how far we will go .
but i think that we can reasonably say that within two or three years , we should have some cases ready to go to court .
if i judge by the elf case we could even spend up to seven years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people in iceland lost their savings when the banks collapsed why is it so important to spend time and money chasing " white collar criminals " ?
i think it is of the utmost important for iceland to carry out this investigation for the social contract to function .
for people to have the courage to go on to live here because what we see today is that people are full of despair and many of them are moving away .
they are taking jobs in norway and that must not happen .
people must stay , they must fight , they must fight for their culture and for justice , and i think here , like in all the nordic countries , the feeling of justice is very important - and today there is a total feeling of injustice .
we have a huge responsibility to show that the institutions are able to carry out this inquiry and that the culprits will be convicted .
only a couple of weeks ago you threatened to step down from your post .
what was the problem ?
well , you know , here in iceland it 's a very small country .
there are only 300.000 inhabitants and people are closely linked .
you always meet the wife of somebody , or the cousin , or the uncle .
so it happens that the state prosecutor 's son is involved in the inquiry , so he is inhabile and he did n't resign from his office and i was very much afraid of that because that could jeopardize the investigation .
so i asked for his resignation and i asked for more money to do the investigation and for more people .
i do not want to be an alibi .
because i am here , people think that this investigation is serious , so i must always ensure that things are done correctly .
extra staff will now be made available for you , including three independent prosecutors .
what about the state prosecutor , who will obviously have to stay out of the investigation ?
he does n't want to step down because he 's protected by law , you see , and this is normal in a democracy .
but this situation has not been foreseen by any law .
i think the possibility to have an ad hoc state prosecutor is meant for small cases , when one of your relatives is involved in stealing a little motorbike for instance that could be the case .
but when it is the whole economic system , all the institutions in the country are involved .
what sense does it have to say i will stay state prosecutor and be isolated and not be able to participate in the most important debates ?
how do you feel the european community has reacted to iceland 's financial collapse iceland has been dealt with in a very rough manner .
i think it was a european issue .
iceland is a member of the european economic community and it was our common bank system that was involved , the common regulators were involved and i think we could have sought a european solution for iceland !
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joining the eu could restore some calm to iceland what are your thoughts on eu membership for iceland ?
i think from the eu point of view that it would be very interesting for us to have iceland on board .
it 's a very old civilization and they have solid democratic traditions that would reinforce the nordic culture of transparency and good governance .
and they also have resources that are important for europe like energy and fish .
so i think it would be very nice for us - and also for them - to be part of the european union .

the public lost their jobs and savings and now the government wants to know why . in an effort to thoroughly investigate the economic collapse and related crimes , the icelandic government has sought help from a prominent european figure . newly elected mep eva joly , the norwegian-born french magistrate who became famous as the lead judge in the elf aquitaine corruption scandal , acts as special adviser to iceland ‘ s authorities .
deutsche welle : ms joly , how would you compare this investigation with the elf aquitaine affair ?
eva joly : this is much huger , much much more important .
this bankruptcy is much bigger than enron , involving a lot of people , involving other banks , and really the investigation is huge .
what about the time and costs involved ?
it will probably be expensive .
i calculated that in order to pay for people and experts from abroad – and we need highly trained experts – we will need some three million euros a year .
and it will take a long time , it 's impossible to say how long at the moment .
that will depend on what kind of cooperation we will get from abroad and how far we will go .
but i think that we can reasonably say that within two or three years , we should have some cases ready to go to court .
if i judge by the elf case we could even spend up to seven years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people in iceland lost their savings when the banks collapsed why is it so important to spend time and money chasing " white collar criminals " ?
i think it is of the utmost important for iceland to carry out this investigation for the social contract to function .
for people to have the courage to go on to live here because what we see today is that people are full of despair and many of them are moving away .
they are taking jobs in norway and that must not happen .
people must stay , they must fight , they must fight for their culture and for justice , and i think here , like in all the nordic countries , the feeling of justice is very important - and today there is a total feeling of injustice .
we have a huge responsibility to show that the institutions are able to carry out this inquiry and that the culprits will be convicted .
only a couple of weeks ago you threatened to step down from your post .
what was the problem ?
well , you know , here in iceland it 's a very small country .
there are only 300.000 inhabitants and people are closely linked .
you always meet the wife of somebody , or the cousin , or the uncle .
so it happens that the state prosecutor 's son is involved in the inquiry , so he is inhabile and he did n't resign from his office and i was very much afraid of that because that could jeopardize the investigation .
so i asked for his resignation and i asked for more money to do the investigation and for more people .
i do not want to be an alibi .
because i am here , people think that this investigation is serious , so i must always ensure that things are done correctly .
extra staff will now be made available for you , including three independent prosecutors .
what about the state prosecutor , who will obviously have to stay out of the investigation ?
he does n't want to step down because he 's protected by law , you see , and this is normal in a democracy .
but this situation has not been foreseen by any law .
i think the possibility to have an ad hoc state prosecutor is meant for small cases , when one of your relatives is involved in stealing a little motorbike for instance that could be the case .
but when it is the whole economic system , all the institutions in the country are involved .
what sense does it have to say i will stay state prosecutor and be isolated and not be able to participate in the most important debates ?
how do you feel the european community has reacted to iceland 's financial collapse iceland has been dealt with in a very rough manner .
i think it was a european issue .
iceland is a member of the european economic community and it was our common bank system that was involved , the common regulators were involved and i think we could have sought a european solution for iceland !
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joining the eu could restore some calm to iceland what are your thoughts on eu membership for iceland ?
i think from the eu point of view that it would be very interesting for us to have iceland on board .
it 's a very old civilization and they have solid democratic traditions that would reinforce the nordic culture of transparency and good governance .
and they also have resources that are important for europe like energy and fish .
so i think it would be very nice for us - and also for them - to be part of the european union .

the public lost their jobs and savings and now the government wants to know why . in an effort to thoroughly investigate the economic collapse and related crimes , the icelandic government has sought help from a prominent european figure . newly elected mep eva joly , the norwegian-born french magistrate who became famous as the lead judge in the elf aquitaine corruption scandal , acts as special adviser to iceland ‘ s authorities .
deutsche welle : ms joly , how would you compare this investigation with the elf aquitaine affair ?
eva joly : this is much huger , much much more important .
this bankruptcy is much bigger than enron , involving a lot of people , involving other banks , and really the investigation is huge .
what about the time and costs involved ?
it will probably be expensive .
i calculated that in order to pay for people and experts from abroad – and we need highly trained experts – we will need some three million euros a year .
and it will take a long time , it 's impossible to say how long at the moment .
that will depend on what kind of cooperation we will get from abroad and how far we will go .
but i think that we can reasonably say that within two or three years , we should have some cases ready to go to court .
if i judge by the elf case we could even spend up to seven years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people in iceland lost their savings when the banks collapsed why is it so important to spend time and money chasing " white collar criminals " ?
i think it is of the utmost important for iceland to carry out this investigation for the social contract to function .
for people to have the courage to go on to live here because what we see today is that people are full of despair and many of them are moving away .
they are taking jobs in norway and that must not happen .
people must stay , they must fight , they must fight for their culture and for justice , and i think here , like in all the nordic countries , the feeling of justice is very important - and today there is a total feeling of injustice .
we have a huge responsibility to show that the institutions are able to carry out this inquiry and that the culprits will be convicted .
only a couple of weeks ago you threatened to step down from your post .
what was the problem ?
well , you know , here in iceland it 's a very small country .
there are only 300.000 inhabitants and people are closely linked .
you always meet the wife of somebody , or the cousin , or the uncle .
so it happens that the state prosecutor 's son is involved in the inquiry , so he is inhabile and he did n't resign from his office and i was very much afraid of that because that could jeopardize the investigation .
so i asked for his resignation and i asked for more money to do the investigation and for more people .
i do not want to be an alibi .
because i am here , people think that this investigation is serious , so i must always ensure that things are done correctly .
extra staff will now be made available for you , including three independent prosecutors .
what about the state prosecutor , who will obviously have to stay out of the investigation ?
he does n't want to step down because he 's protected by law , you see , and this is normal in a democracy .
but this situation has not been foreseen by any law .
i think the possibility to have an ad hoc state prosecutor is meant for small cases , when one of your relatives is involved in stealing a little motorbike for instance that could be the case .
but when it is the whole economic system , all the institutions in the country are involved .
what sense does it have to say i will stay state prosecutor and be isolated and not be able to participate in the most important debates ?
how do you feel the european community has reacted to iceland 's financial collapse iceland has been dealt with in a very rough manner .
i think it was a european issue .
iceland is a member of the european economic community and it was our common bank system that was involved , the common regulators were involved and i think we could have sought a european solution for iceland !
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joining the eu could restore some calm to iceland what are your thoughts on eu membership for iceland ?
i think from the eu point of view that it would be very interesting for us to have iceland on board .
it 's a very old civilization and they have solid democratic traditions that would reinforce the nordic culture of transparency and good governance .
and they also have resources that are important for europe like energy and fish .
so i think it would be very nice for us - and also for them - to be part of the european union .

as he went into the meeting , held at peres ' private residence , steinmeier said he had high hopes of the new us administration in the context of the middle east .
" i hope we are on the verge of a fresh start , " he said , " a fresh start that has been made possible by the initiative of the us president – a decisive , fervent call for a two-state solution made not only to israel and the palestinians but also to their arab neighbors . "
he said it was crucial to encourage " moderate arab states " to work together to secure peace in the region , adding that germany and europe would do everything they could to support the goal .
" i will continue to press for israel 's difficult neighbors – in syria and in lebanon – to participate constructively in these efforts towards a two-state solution , " he told reporters .
security a pre-requisite for peace steinmeier stressed that israel would need to stop settlement construction in the palestinian territories in order to move its arab neighbors to support the initiative for regional peace , but also said the security of the israeli people was a " clear pre-condition " for all talks .

barack obama wants talks in moscow to lead toward reductions . nuclear arms reduction has a prominent place on the agenda of the two-day summit in moscow between russia and the united states .
the issue is a political priority for us president barack obama , who gave a speech in prague in april in which he outlined his vision of a world free of nuclear weapons . for russia on the other hand , bilateral arms-reduction talks are one of the few issues around which moscow feels its clout and cold war history makes it an equal to its one-time rival . for some time , both times have , regarding the numbers at least , made significant progress in arms reduction .
in the mid-1960s , the us had more then 30,000 warheads in its arsenal ; the russians , 20 years later , had some 40,000 .
since then , the numbers on both sides have fallen to around 5,000 . most of these warheads have a explosive force of from 10 to 30 times that of the atomic bomb that was dropped on hiroshima in 1945 . start treaty at the end of this year , the most comprehensive nuclear reduction treaty ever signed , the 1991 start treaty , will expire .
start -lrb- later renamed start i -rrb- put an upper limit of 6,000 battle-ready nuclear warheads and some 1,600 launching systems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president george bush and soviet president gorbachev at the signing of start in 1991 in addition to start , both sides signed off on the " treaty of moscow " in 2002 .
it sees a further reduction on both sides to 1,700 to 2,000 operational strategic warheads . however , the moscow document calls on verification of the agreements to be based on the procedures outlined in start , which is considered impractical by both the us and russia .
in addition , it says nothing about the development of new missiles with multiple warheads . in order to move forward with nuclear disarmament , a new version or an extension of the start treaty is necessary . by the numbers the american nuclear arsenal has , according to recent figures put out by the american " bulletin of the atomic scientists , " already reached the upper limit of 2,200 set by the treaty of moscow .
half of us launch systems are intercontinental missiles stationed on submarines , one-fourth are land-based intercontinental missiles and another one-fourth are long-range bombers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president obama in prague calling for a nuclear weapon-free world us scientists count some 2,500 warheads in america 's active reserve , as well as 500 non-strategic nuclear weapons , mostly found in us bases in europe .
the total : around 5,200 nuclear warheads .
more than 4,000 additional ones are on a waiting list to be decommissioned . the russian nuclear stockpile contains just under 2,800 strategic operational warheads , of which half are on land-based intercontinental missiles .
the other half are on long-range bombers and submarines . in addition , russia possesses 2,000 non-strategic nuclear weapons , mostly missile and anti-aircraft systems as well as tactical atomic weapons such as guided missiles .
another 8,000 warheads are held in reserve or are candidates for decommissioning . missile shield hurdle despite the reductions in their nuclear arsenals by both the us and russia , an agreement on a new arms control treaty mandating further cuts -down to 1,500 warheads - will not be easily attained . besides details such as how launch systems would be included in the equation , the biggest hurdle is the new missile-shield project planned by the us in eastern europe . bildunterschrift : the 2008 signing of an agreement to base missile interceptors in poland was not to russia 's liking the plans were developed under obama 's predecessor , george w. bush .
according to the us , the system would be designed to intercept the small number of missiles that might be launched from countries such as iran or north korea . moscow , however , considers the planned missile and radar facilities close to its western border as a threat to its security and as something that would undermine its own nuclear deterrent potential . if the us does not abandon its plans for missile facilities in poland and the czech republic , moscow signaled as recently as this past weekend , the kremlin would not sign off on any successor to the start treaty . author : hans spross -lrb- jam -rrb- editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

barack obama wants talks in moscow to lead toward reductions . nuclear arms reduction has a prominent place on the agenda of the two-day summit in moscow between russia and the united states .
the issue is a political priority for us president barack obama , who gave a speech in prague in april in which he outlined his vision of a world free of nuclear weapons . for russia on the other hand , bilateral arms-reduction talks are one of the few issues around which moscow feels its clout and cold war history makes it an equal to its one-time rival . for some time , both times have , regarding the numbers at least , made significant progress in arms reduction .
in the mid-1960s , the us had more then 30,000 warheads in its arsenal ; the russians , 20 years later , had some 40,000 .

it sees a further reduction on both sides to 1,700 to 2,000 operational strategic warheads . however , the moscow document calls on verification of the agreements to be based on the procedures outlined in start , which is considered impractical by both the us and russia .
in addition , it says nothing about the development of new missiles with multiple warheads . in order to move forward with nuclear disarmament , a new version or an extension of the start treaty is necessary . by the numbers the american nuclear arsenal has , according to recent figures put out by the american " bulletin of the atomic scientists , " already reached the upper limit of 2,200 set by the treaty of moscow .

barack obama wants talks in moscow to lead toward reductions . nuclear arms reduction has a prominent place on the agenda of the two-day summit in moscow between russia and the united states .
the issue is a political priority for us president barack obama , who gave a speech in prague in april in which he outlined his vision of a world free of nuclear weapons . for russia on the other hand , bilateral arms-reduction talks are one of the few issues around which moscow feels its clout and cold war history makes it an equal to its one-time rival . for some time , both times have , regarding the numbers at least , made significant progress in arms reduction .
in the mid-1960s , the us had more then 30,000 warheads in its arsenal ; the russians , 20 years later , had some 40,000 .
since then , the numbers on both sides have fallen to around 5,000 . most of these warheads have a explosive force of from 10 to 30 times that of the atomic bomb that was dropped on hiroshima in 1945 . start treaty at the end of this year , the most comprehensive nuclear reduction treaty ever signed , the 1991 start treaty , will expire .
start -lrb- later renamed start i -rrb- put an upper limit of 6,000 battle-ready nuclear warheads and some 1,600 launching systems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president george bush and soviet president gorbachev at the signing of start in 1991 in addition to start , both sides signed off on the " treaty of moscow " in 2002 .
it sees a further reduction on both sides to 1,700 to 2,000 operational strategic warheads . however , the moscow document calls on verification of the agreements to be based on the procedures outlined in start , which is considered impractical by both the us and russia .
in addition , it says nothing about the development of new missiles with multiple warheads . in order to move forward with nuclear disarmament , a new version or an extension of the start treaty is necessary . by the numbers the american nuclear arsenal has , according to recent figures put out by the american " bulletin of the atomic scientists , " already reached the upper limit of 2,200 set by the treaty of moscow .
half of us launch systems are intercontinental missiles stationed on submarines , one-fourth are land-based intercontinental missiles and another one-fourth are long-range bombers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president obama in prague calling for a nuclear weapon-free world us scientists count some 2,500 warheads in america 's active reserve , as well as 500 non-strategic nuclear weapons , mostly found in us bases in europe .
the total : around 5,200 nuclear warheads .
more than 4,000 additional ones are on a waiting list to be decommissioned . the russian nuclear stockpile contains just under 2,800 strategic operational warheads , of which half are on land-based intercontinental missiles .
the other half are on long-range bombers and submarines . in addition , russia possesses 2,000 non-strategic nuclear weapons , mostly missile and anti-aircraft systems as well as tactical atomic weapons such as guided missiles .
another 8,000 warheads are held in reserve or are candidates for decommissioning . missile shield hurdle despite the reductions in their nuclear arsenals by both the us and russia , an agreement on a new arms control treaty mandating further cuts -down to 1,500 warheads - will not be easily attained . besides details such as how launch systems would be included in the equation , the biggest hurdle is the new missile-shield project planned by the us in eastern europe . bildunterschrift : the 2008 signing of an agreement to base missile interceptors in poland was not to russia 's liking the plans were developed under obama 's predecessor , george w. bush .
according to the us , the system would be designed to intercept the small number of missiles that might be launched from countries such as iran or north korea . moscow , however , considers the planned missile and radar facilities close to its western border as a threat to its security and as something that would undermine its own nuclear deterrent potential . if the us does not abandon its plans for missile facilities in poland and the czech republic , moscow signaled as recently as this past weekend , the kremlin would not sign off on any successor to the start treaty . author : hans spross -lrb- jam -rrb- editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the justice ministry in saxony has confirmed the report , making this the second such case in recent years . according to the report , two inmates aged 15 and 24 years tortured another inmate at the regis-breitingen juvenile detention center , located near leipzig in the eastern state of saxony . the state of saxony has pressed charges of attempted murder against the inmates , though it is still unclear when the trial will take place . neo-nazi inspired torture according to the report , the two stand accused of trying to get the 18-year-old to commit suicide by beating him with a broomstick and pouring boiling water on him . out of fear , the attacked inmate attempted to hang himself in his cell but was unsuccessful .
after seeing that he survived the attempted suicide , the attackers then attempted to strangle him with a belt but failed in their attempts .
the victim was able to escape and alert the guards . before the beatings , the inmates , at this point together with other inmates , allegedly painted swastikas on their victim . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the incident in saxony recalls a similarly heinous case in siegburg in 2006 not the first case of juvenile torture in germany this latest case , which allegedly happened in may 2008 , is similar to a brutal murder that took place inside a juvenile prison in 2006 .
in that case , three inmates at the siegburg detention center near the western city of bonn tortured a fellow inmate for hours , raping and beating him unconscious .
the three then hung their victim , in an attempt to make it appear as if the victim had taken his own life . the state of north rhine-westphalia found all three inmates guilty , with the main attacker receiving a further ten years in a maximum security prison .
the other attackers both received 10 years in prison . critique of the inmate " re-socialization " process this latest case of juvenile inmate torture has aroused debate in germany , particularly with regard to the question of how to deal with juvenile delinquents effectively . klaus bartl , a speaker for the left party , says the heinous nature of this crime is a sign that the current system is n't working . " this horrible incident is yet further evidence that the juvenile prison in saxony does n't help its inmates .
it does the opposite of what it says it should , which is to " re-socialize " them and stop them from using so much violence . " the regis-breitingen juvenile detention center is the most modern of its kind in saxony .
the prison has room for almost 400 inmates and was opened on october 5th , 2007 . less than one month after its opening , one of its inmates , a 21-year-old charged with murder , committed suicide in his cell . glb / dpa / ap editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the energy debate heats up ahead of elections germany 's social democrats have appealed to chancellor angela merkel to consider an alternative to nuclear fuel .
the calls followed technical problems that bumped a northern plant from the national grid . social democrat environment minister sigmar gabriel called on merkel and economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg to give up their nuclear course in order to preserve " the security of german citizens . "
in an interview with berlin 's tagesspiegel daily , gabriel said " the recent incidents in krümmel prove we can not justify the protracted use of older power plants . "
indeed the kruemmel reactor in the northern state of schleswig holstein only roared back to life at the end of june after a fire in 2007 forced its closure for two full years .
and in the few days since its reopening , the plant has twice been removed from the national grid . action not investigation the plant 's swedish operators , vattenfall , say the latest shutdown , which put out the majority of traffic lights across hamburg and left thousands of homes in the region with a reduced electricity supply , was the result of a short-circuit .
they say they are investigating the cause , and have not indicated when normal operations might resume .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not quite business as usual at the krümmel plant but social democrat gabriel wants more than an investigation .
speaking to ard television on monday morning , he said the oldest eight of germany 's seventeen nuclear reactors should be removed from the national grid immediately .
he also called for a tightening of nuclear phase-out laws in order to make it possible for newer , more reliable plants to fulfil the remit of the older ones he wishes to see closed .
electorate to decide both the social democrats and the greens have seized on the latest kruemmel shutdown as an election campaign opportunity .
" on september 27th , germany will decide if this , and seven other reactors , should remain in operation as the cdu and chancellor merkel suggest , " gabriel , whose spd is currently in a coalition with the cdu , told the ard . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clean energy sources ca n't supply a whole nation .
yet .
renate kuenast , leading green party candidate , described kruemmel 's two malfunctions in as many weeks as dilettantism on the part of vattenfall .
she said voters held the key to the future of germany 's power generation .
" whoever wants to see scrap reactors like kruemmel closed down has to fight with us against a black-yellow coalition , " she told the tagesspiegel , referring to the possibility of a coalition between the " black " christian democrats and the " yellow " free democrats .
merkel 's christian democrats are in favor of extending the operational lives of germany 's nuclear plants , which , under a law passed by the former spd / green coalition , are currently due to be phased out by the year 2021 .
bridging a gap to a cleaner energy future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fire put krümmel out of action in 2007 gabriel said that to close the oldest reactors now rather would not , as some suggest , pose a supply problem , as germany currently produces more than it uses .
but the christian democratic bavarian environment minister , markus söder , said it was illusionary to think that bavaria - which is 60-70 percent reliant on nuclear energy - could switch to alternative energy sources from one day to the next .
he told bavarian public radio that germany needed nuclear fuel " until we can replace it entirely with regenerative energy . "
kruemmel has often been cited in connection with a relatively high incidence of leukemia in the region , but there has never been any proof that the reactor is to blame. tkw / ap / reuters / dpa editor : michael lawton tkw / ap / reuters / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the energy debate heats up ahead of elections germany 's social democrats have appealed to chancellor angela merkel to consider an alternative to nuclear fuel .
the calls followed technical problems that bumped a northern plant from the national grid . social democrat environment minister sigmar gabriel called on merkel and economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg to give up their nuclear course in order to preserve " the security of german citizens . "
in an interview with berlin 's tagesspiegel daily , gabriel said " the recent incidents in krümmel prove we can not justify the protracted use of older power plants . "
indeed the kruemmel reactor in the northern state of schleswig holstein only roared back to life at the end of june after a fire in 2007 forced its closure for two full years .
and in the few days since its reopening , the plant has twice been removed from the national grid . action not investigation the plant 's swedish operators , vattenfall , say the latest shutdown , which put out the majority of traffic lights across hamburg and left thousands of homes in the region with a reduced electricity supply , was the result of a short-circuit .
they say they are investigating the cause , and have not indicated when normal operations might resume .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not quite business as usual at the krümmel plant but social democrat gabriel wants more than an investigation .
speaking to ard television on monday morning , he said the oldest eight of germany 's seventeen nuclear reactors should be removed from the national grid immediately .
he also called for a tightening of nuclear phase-out laws in order to make it possible for newer , more reliable plants to fulfil the remit of the older ones he wishes to see closed .
electorate to decide both the social democrats and the greens have seized on the latest kruemmel shutdown as an election campaign opportunity .
" on september 27th , germany will decide if this , and seven other reactors , should remain in operation as the cdu and chancellor merkel suggest , " gabriel , whose spd is currently in a coalition with the cdu , told the ard . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clean energy sources ca n't supply a whole nation .
yet .
renate kuenast , leading green party candidate , described kruemmel 's two malfunctions in as many weeks as dilettantism on the part of vattenfall .
she said voters held the key to the future of germany 's power generation .
" whoever wants to see scrap reactors like kruemmel closed down has to fight with us against a black-yellow coalition , " she told the tagesspiegel , referring to the possibility of a coalition between the " black " christian democrats and the " yellow " free democrats .
merkel 's christian democrats are in favor of extending the operational lives of germany 's nuclear plants , which , under a law passed by the former spd / green coalition , are currently due to be phased out by the year 2021 .
bridging a gap to a cleaner energy future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fire put krümmel out of action in 2007 gabriel said that to close the oldest reactors now rather would not , as some suggest , pose a supply problem , as germany currently produces more than it uses .
but the christian democratic bavarian environment minister , markus söder , said it was illusionary to think that bavaria - which is 60-70 percent reliant on nuclear energy - could switch to alternative energy sources from one day to the next .
he told bavarian public radio that germany needed nuclear fuel " until we can replace it entirely with regenerative energy . "

the energy debate heats up ahead of elections germany 's social democrats have appealed to chancellor angela merkel to consider an alternative to nuclear fuel .
the calls followed technical problems that bumped a northern plant from the national grid . social democrat environment minister sigmar gabriel called on merkel and economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg to give up their nuclear course in order to preserve " the security of german citizens . "
in an interview with berlin 's tagesspiegel daily , gabriel said " the recent incidents in krümmel prove we can not justify the protracted use of older power plants . "
indeed the kruemmel reactor in the northern state of schleswig holstein only roared back to life at the end of june after a fire in 2007 forced its closure for two full years .
and in the few days since its reopening , the plant has twice been removed from the national grid . action not investigation the plant 's swedish operators , vattenfall , say the latest shutdown , which put out the majority of traffic lights across hamburg and left thousands of homes in the region with a reduced electricity supply , was the result of a short-circuit .

this followed summit talks at the kremlin on monday to " reset " bilateral relations . us president barack obama and his russian counterpart , dmitry medvedev , signed a " joint understanding " aimed at reducing the number of nuclear warheads held by each of their countries to between 1,500 and 1,675 , compared with the maximum 2,200 the existing strategic arms reduction treaty -lrb- start -rrb- between their two countries allows . the two sides are also to aim to reduce the number of missiles capable of delivering the warheads from the current maximum of 1,600 allowed for each side to between 500 and 1,100 .
at a press conference following their summit talks at the kremlin on monday , medvedev said moscow wanted a " fresh start ” in relations with washington despite persisting differences .
admitting that relations between the two sides were not at an optimal level , he said " our countries are aiming at cooperation commensurate with the 21st century . " agreeing to forge ahead with disarmament talks , the russian leader said showed that russia and the united states were facing up to their superpower responsibilities .
for his part , obama praised what he called russia 's contribution in stemming nuclear threats to the world .
“ we resolved to reset us-russian relations , ” he said at the joint press conference .
he stressed the joint efforts being made towards a follow-up to the start treaty , saying the two countries aimed to " lead by example " in cutting back their nuclear weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skepticism persists in both countries over what can be achieved building on recent progress while admitting that some of the differences between the two sides were not likely to simply fade away , the two leaders sought to highlight progress made in recent months .
" we are confident that we can continue to build on the excellent discussions that we had in london , ” obama said , adding : “ and that on a whole host of issues - including security issues , economic issues , energy issues , environmental issues - that the united states and russia have more in common than they have differences . ”
the two countries have agreed to set up a joint commission on some of these issues .
more notably , military cooperation , which suffered in the aftermath of the russia-georgia conflict last august , is to recommence .
obama said if the two sides were to continue to hard work in the next few days , they could make “ extraordinary progress that would benefit the people of both countries . "
echoing those sentiments , medvedev said not just their two countries but the rest of the world too would gain from better us-russian relations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korea continues its provocative actions security cooperation the us president also said that he and medvedev shared concerns over nuclear proliferation and related developments in countries like north korea and iran .
he said that the two sides had taken “ important steps forward to strengthen our security through greater cooperation , " adding that he and his russian counterpart agreed on the “ need to combat the threat of violent extremism , particularly from al-qaeda " .
in an important sign of growing security cooperation , moscow has agreed to allow us military planes to fly over russian territory to afghanistan , which in obama 's words , is a “ substantial contribution ” that will save the us “ time and resources ” in its afghanistan mission .
problems persist medvedev said he saw clear progress in talks with the us on missile defence as the obama administration was prepared to listen to russian concerns .
he described monday 's summit as a “ first but very important step ” toward revitalizing relations between the former cold war foes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama says the us is keen on talking to both russian leaders despite positive talk on both sides , even president medvedev admitted to the existence of some serious glitches .
us plans to install a missile defence system in poland and the czech republic which the previous bush administration said was aimed at countering threats from so-called “ rogue states ” like iran .
however , moscow is opposed to the plan and has urged obama to abandon it .
just last week , russian prime minister vladimir putin urged washington to drop plans for a missile defence shield .

authorities say the initially peaceful protest turned violent when police attempted to break it up . hans-gert poettering , president of the european parliament , has expressed grave concern about the bloody clashes in xinjiang .
in a statement released by his office , poettering described reports about how the protests had been handled as " deeply disturbing . "
he called on both sides to exercise calm and restraint and urged the chinese authorities to fully respect human rights , " especially the right to freedom of expression and peaceful demonstration . "
in an interview with dw-tv , german human rights commissioner guenther nooke on monday also spoke out against the eruption of violence between china and uighurs in the xinjiang province .
deutsche welle : how does the german government view the events in the xinjiang province ?
guenther nooke : we have not been in a position to come to an official assessment because not enough information has been made available yet , but of course we know that there have been ongoing problems with the uighurs because they are seen by the leaders in beijing , and by the chinese in general , as suspected terrorists .
this has led to tensions between the han chinese and the uighurs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guenther nooke , germany 's human rights commissioner what sort of influence can the german government exercise ?
i think we have to call on the beijing leadership to act in accordance with the rule of law , even if there are grey areas , and properly investigate situations like the one in the toy factory in southern china , which seems to have sparked the unrest , and that they refrain from reacting with disproportionate force .
that is unacceptable , no matter what factors may have contributed to it , including the possibility that demonstrators committed acts of violence .

authorities say the initially peaceful protest turned violent when police attempted to break it up . hans-gert poettering , president of the european parliament , has expressed grave concern about the bloody clashes in xinjiang .
in a statement released by his office , poettering described reports about how the protests had been handled as " deeply disturbing . "
he called on both sides to exercise calm and restraint and urged the chinese authorities to fully respect human rights , " especially the right to freedom of expression and peaceful demonstration . "
in an interview with dw-tv , german human rights commissioner guenther nooke on monday also spoke out against the eruption of violence between china and uighurs in the xinjiang province .
deutsche welle : how does the german government view the events in the xinjiang province ?
guenther nooke : we have not been in a position to come to an official assessment because not enough information has been made available yet , but of course we know that there have been ongoing problems with the uighurs because they are seen by the leaders in beijing , and by the chinese in general , as suspected terrorists .
this has led to tensions between the han chinese and the uighurs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guenther nooke , germany 's human rights commissioner what sort of influence can the german government exercise ?
i think we have to call on the beijing leadership to act in accordance with the rule of law , even if there are grey areas , and properly investigate situations like the one in the toy factory in southern china , which seems to have sparked the unrest , and that they refrain from reacting with disproportionate force .
that is unacceptable , no matter what factors may have contributed to it , including the possibility that demonstrators committed acts of violence .

the win , kaymer ’ s third on the pga european tour , is his most important . the young german needed only one extra hole to beat westwood , after the former european number one found the water with his approach to the difficult 18th . the botched extra hole came after a solid final round , however , in which westwood carded a sterling 7-under 65 to force the playoff . after 72 holes of regulation play , both players were at 13-under-par , three strokes better than third place ian poulter . putting key to victory kaymer was off to a fast start at le golf national in st. quentin-en-yvelines , france , after he tied the course record with a 62 on thursday .
rounds of 72 and 69 on friday and saturday left kaymer one back heading into sunday , and a 68 was enough to get into the playoff with westwood . a myriad of long putts , the longest an 84-footer on the eighth , proved the key to kaymer 's third european tour victory , who comes from the western german city of dusseldorf . " my putting was great all week , " kaymer told reporters .
" i made so many putts from everywhere . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many say kaymer is the next bernhard langer significant win with the victory kaymer took home the $ 930,000 top prize , which brings him to fifth on the european order of merit .
more importantly , however , the win is sure to bring kaymer into the top 20 in the world golf rankings . " the world ranking is the important thing to me , " kaymer said .
" i 've never been this high before . " this is the first time a german has won the french open in 25 years .
two-time masters champion bernhard langer was the last to the lift the trophy , when he won at the st. cloud golf club in paris in 1984 . for kaymer , who many say is walking in the footsteps of langer , germany ’ s most dominant player in the 20th century , the french open is his third international victory . he also triumphed in abu dhabi and at the bmw international last year . glb / dpa / reuters editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

borisov , whose citizens for european development of bulgaria party -lrb- gerb -rrb- won just under half of the 240 seats up for grabs in sunday 's elections , says he wants to form a coalition that will prioritise the fight against corruption and boost the ailing economy .
gerb is widely expected to enter negotiations with the blue coalition , a group of rightist parties that collectively picked up 16 seats .
‘ batman ' borisov has also pledged to work towards the eradication of ethnic tensions in bulgaria .
" we want equality for christians and muslims and all ethnic groups living in bulgaria , " he said , adding that " anyone who raises the question of bulgaria 's ethnic map is working against democracy and the bulgarian citizens . "
improving european relations besides dealing with pressing domestic issues , the incoming premier has plenty of work to do in improving strained relations with the european union . last year the eu froze 500 million euros -lrb- $ 700 million -rrb- in aid for the balkan nation amid concerns over rampant corruption .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels wants to know exactly how sofia is going to spend eu money although the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , has since granted sofia 115 million euros for a highway project and technical assistance , the commissioner for regional policy , danuta hubner , says bulgaria still has to a lot of work to do before it can access the remaining aid funds .
" this decision -lsb- to lift the suspension -rsb- is a strong incentive for bulgaria to strengthen its efforts in all areas where funds are still suspended .
we need a future system that protects eu funding from any improper use . "
analysts say the new government must also quickly tackle economic policy issues to attract investors , many of whom fled this year , in part because of the global financial crisis .

russia released a new security strategy in may , taking another look at threats , both old and new . us president obama has said the us needs to reset its relationship with russia , which faces a series of challenges , including a public suspicious of us motives , a kremlin with two men at the helm and hard feelings on a variety of issues . russia is also talking about improving ties with its former adversary , and has been doing some resetting of its own , primarily regarding its security doctrine .
russian president dmitry medvedev signed a decree in may on the country 's national security strategy , which is meant to be a general guide for russian domestic and foreign policy until 2020 . that policy still mentions threats dating from the cold war era .
but for the first time in recent russian history , the country 's national security is not perceived as being threatened primarily by dangers from outside or being dependent on its own defensive capabilities . " the most important tasks and , at the same time , the most serious dangers are to be found inside the country , " said dmitry suslov , the deputy research director of the moscow-based council for foreign and defense policy .
" that means there 's a need for modernization , a more effective system of state intervention , fighting corruption , and so on . " the transition from perceived external threats to a new look at home-grown dangers is a natural development , especially as the new us administration has worked to diffuse some of the tensions that had grown over recent years between the old cold war sparring partners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president dmitry medvedev chaired a national security council meeting discussing russia 's security strategy " it 's a normal development , because -lrb- russia 's -rrb- relations with the west have improved over the last weeks or months since obama took office , " said alexander rahr , russia analyst at the german council on foreign relations . the new security document largely puts the focus on economic and social categories , for example , economic growth , health care , science , education , culture and quality of life .
it lays out the ambitious goal , especially given the state of today 's russia , of becoming a world leader in these areas .
one particular threat for national security is unemployment , the widening gap between rich and poor , population decreases and rising domestic prices . energy security the issue of russia 's energy future and security is also emphasized in the document .
moscow predicts that the international quest for access to energy sources will become more intense - in the barents sea , around the antarctic , the caspian region and in central asia . since russia considers military intervention possibly being used in the struggle for energy , it also sees an additional threat to russia 's borders . the kremlin openly describes its own enormous energy reserves as a way to bring the country closer to its ultimate goal - regaining its status as a superpower . old foes despite the change in focus , some security concerns have stayed the same , especially regarding foreign policy .
the asia-pacific region is almost a blank spot on the map for russia , despite its border with an ever-more powerful china . the foreign threat scenarios often concern the " usual suspects , " the us and nato , although they are not mentioned by name .
this might well be a topic of conversation between medvedev and obama . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : america 's planned missile defense system has been a bone of contention between washington and moscow the security document complains of the absence of a robust international security architecture and the quest for military superiority .
besides the modernization of nuclear arsenals , the document mentions the development of high-tech weapons , the militarization of outer space , strategic armaments in non-nuclear areas , the creation of a missile defense system partly stationed in eastern europe . the list is clearly referring to the us , which russia still sees as the principle threat to its security . " regarding foreign policy everything is being repeated which was said in the past , " said rahr .
" russia is against the eastern expansion of nato , and therefore certain western countries - unnamed - which would challenge russia on its western border , are being heavily criticized . " nato fears while the document says nato expansion to russia 's borders is not acceptable , almost in the same breath moscow names nato as a strategic partner necessary for the maintenance of international security . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow is suspicious of nato but needs it as an strategic partner " the -lrb- nato -rrb- block is a partner for russia since it is working on solving problems that are essential for russia 's security , such as afghanistan , " said analyst suslov .

russia released a new security strategy in may , taking another look at threats , both old and new . us president obama has said the us needs to reset its relationship with russia , which faces a series of challenges , including a public suspicious of us motives , a kremlin with two men at the helm and hard feelings on a variety of issues . russia is also talking about improving ties with its former adversary , and has been doing some resetting of its own , primarily regarding its security doctrine .
russian president dmitry medvedev signed a decree in may on the country 's national security strategy , which is meant to be a general guide for russian domestic and foreign policy until 2020 . that policy still mentions threats dating from the cold war era .
but for the first time in recent russian history , the country 's national security is not perceived as being threatened primarily by dangers from outside or being dependent on its own defensive capabilities . " the most important tasks and , at the same time , the most serious dangers are to be found inside the country , " said dmitry suslov , the deputy research director of the moscow-based council for foreign and defense policy .
" that means there 's a need for modernization , a more effective system of state intervention , fighting corruption , and so on . " the transition from perceived external threats to a new look at home-grown dangers is a natural development , especially as the new us administration has worked to diffuse some of the tensions that had grown over recent years between the old cold war sparring partners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president dmitry medvedev chaired a national security council meeting discussing russia 's security strategy " it 's a normal development , because -lrb- russia 's -rrb- relations with the west have improved over the last weeks or months since obama took office , " said alexander rahr , russia analyst at the german council on foreign relations . the new security document largely puts the focus on economic and social categories , for example , economic growth , health care , science , education , culture and quality of life .
it lays out the ambitious goal , especially given the state of today 's russia , of becoming a world leader in these areas .
one particular threat for national security is unemployment , the widening gap between rich and poor , population decreases and rising domestic prices . energy security the issue of russia 's energy future and security is also emphasized in the document .
moscow predicts that the international quest for access to energy sources will become more intense - in the barents sea , around the antarctic , the caspian region and in central asia . since russia considers military intervention possibly being used in the struggle for energy , it also sees an additional threat to russia 's borders . the kremlin openly describes its own enormous energy reserves as a way to bring the country closer to its ultimate goal - regaining its status as a superpower . old foes despite the change in focus , some security concerns have stayed the same , especially regarding foreign policy .
the asia-pacific region is almost a blank spot on the map for russia , despite its border with an ever-more powerful china . the foreign threat scenarios often concern the " usual suspects , " the us and nato , although they are not mentioned by name .
this might well be a topic of conversation between medvedev and obama . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : america 's planned missile defense system has been a bone of contention between washington and moscow the security document complains of the absence of a robust international security architecture and the quest for military superiority .
besides the modernization of nuclear arsenals , the document mentions the development of high-tech weapons , the militarization of outer space , strategic armaments in non-nuclear areas , the creation of a missile defense system partly stationed in eastern europe . the list is clearly referring to the us , which russia still sees as the principle threat to its security . " regarding foreign policy everything is being repeated which was said in the past , " said rahr .
" russia is against the eastern expansion of nato , and therefore certain western countries - unnamed - which would challenge russia on its western border , are being heavily criticized . " nato fears while the document says nato expansion to russia 's borders is not acceptable , almost in the same breath moscow names nato as a strategic partner necessary for the maintenance of international security . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow is suspicious of nato but needs it as an strategic partner " the -lrb- nato -rrb- block is a partner for russia since it is working on solving problems that are essential for russia 's security , such as afghanistan , " said analyst suslov .

russia released a new security strategy in may , taking another look at threats , both old and new . us president obama has said the us needs to reset its relationship with russia , which faces a series of challenges , including a public suspicious of us motives , a kremlin with two men at the helm and hard feelings on a variety of issues . russia is also talking about improving ties with its former adversary , and has been doing some resetting of its own , primarily regarding its security doctrine .
russian president dmitry medvedev signed a decree in may on the country 's national security strategy , which is meant to be a general guide for russian domestic and foreign policy until 2020 . that policy still mentions threats dating from the cold war era .
but for the first time in recent russian history , the country 's national security is not perceived as being threatened primarily by dangers from outside or being dependent on its own defensive capabilities . " the most important tasks and , at the same time , the most serious dangers are to be found inside the country , " said dmitry suslov , the deputy research director of the moscow-based council for foreign and defense policy .
" that means there 's a need for modernization , a more effective system of state intervention , fighting corruption , and so on . " the transition from perceived external threats to a new look at home-grown dangers is a natural development , especially as the new us administration has worked to diffuse some of the tensions that had grown over recent years between the old cold war sparring partners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president dmitry medvedev chaired a national security council meeting discussing russia 's security strategy " it 's a normal development , because -lrb- russia 's -rrb- relations with the west have improved over the last weeks or months since obama took office , " said alexander rahr , russia analyst at the german council on foreign relations . the new security document largely puts the focus on economic and social categories , for example , economic growth , health care , science , education , culture and quality of life .
it lays out the ambitious goal , especially given the state of today 's russia , of becoming a world leader in these areas .
one particular threat for national security is unemployment , the widening gap between rich and poor , population decreases and rising domestic prices . energy security the issue of russia 's energy future and security is also emphasized in the document .
moscow predicts that the international quest for access to energy sources will become more intense - in the barents sea , around the antarctic , the caspian region and in central asia . since russia considers military intervention possibly being used in the struggle for energy , it also sees an additional threat to russia 's borders . the kremlin openly describes its own enormous energy reserves as a way to bring the country closer to its ultimate goal - regaining its status as a superpower . old foes despite the change in focus , some security concerns have stayed the same , especially regarding foreign policy .

as he went into the meeting , held at peres ' private residence , steinmeier said he had high hopes of the new us administration in the context of the middle east .
" i hope we are on the verge of a fresh start , " he said , " a fresh start that has been made possible by the initiative of the us president – a decisive , fervent call for a two-state solution made not only to israel and the palestinians but also to their arab neighbors . "
he said it was crucial to encourage " moderate arab states " to work together to secure peace in the region , adding that germany and europe would do everything they could to support the goal .
" i will continue to press for israel 's difficult neighbors – in syria and in lebanon – to participate constructively in these efforts towards a two-state solution , " he told reporters .
security a pre-requisite for peace steinmeier stressed that israel would need to stop settlement construction in the palestinian territories in order to move its arab neighbors to support the initiative for regional peace , but also said the security of the israeli people was a " clear pre-condition " for all talks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 06.07.2009 russia 's security strategy considers new and old challenges großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia sees many of its future security concerns being home grown security is on the agenda during talks between the kremlin and barack obama in moscow over the next two days .
russia released a new security strategy in may , taking another look at threats , both old and new . us president obama has said the us needs to reset its relationship with russia , which faces a series of challenges , including a public suspicious of us motives , a kremlin with two men at the helm and hard feelings on a variety of issues . russia is also talking about improving ties with its former adversary , and has been doing some resetting of its own , primarily regarding its security doctrine .
russian president dmitry medvedev signed a decree in may on the country 's national security strategy , which is meant to be a general guide for russian domestic and foreign policy until 2020 . that policy still mentions threats dating from the cold war era .
but for the first time in recent russian history , the country 's national security is not perceived as being threatened primarily by dangers from outside or being dependent on its own defensive capabilities . " the most important tasks and , at the same time , the most serious dangers are to be found inside the country , " said dmitry suslov , the deputy research director of the moscow-based council for foreign and defense policy .
" that means there 's a need for modernization , a more effective system of state intervention , fighting corruption , and so on . " the transition from perceived external threats to a new look at home-grown dangers is a natural development , especially as the new us administration has worked to diffuse some of the tensions that had grown over recent years between the old cold war sparring partners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president dmitry medvedev chaired a national security council meeting discussing russia 's security strategy " it 's a normal development , because -lrb- russia 's -rrb- relations with the west have improved over the last weeks or months since obama took office , " said alexander rahr , russia analyst at the german council on foreign relations . the new security document largely puts the focus on economic and social categories , for example , economic growth , health care , science , education , culture and quality of life .
it lays out the ambitious goal , especially given the state of today 's russia , of becoming a world leader in these areas .
one particular threat for national security is unemployment , the widening gap between rich and poor , population decreases and rising domestic prices . energy security the issue of russia 's energy future and security is also emphasized in the document .
moscow predicts that the international quest for access to energy sources will become more intense - in the barents sea , around the antarctic , the caspian region and in central asia . since russia considers military intervention possibly being used in the struggle for energy , it also sees an additional threat to russia 's borders . the kremlin openly describes its own enormous energy reserves as a way to bring the country closer to its ultimate goal - regaining its status as a superpower . old foes despite the change in focus , some security concerns have stayed the same , especially regarding foreign policy .
the asia-pacific region is almost a blank spot on the map for russia , despite its border with an ever-more powerful china . the foreign threat scenarios often concern the " usual suspects , " the us and nato , although they are not mentioned by name .
this might well be a topic of conversation between medvedev and obama . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : america 's planned missile defense system has been a bone of contention between washington and moscow the security document complains of the absence of a robust international security architecture and the quest for military superiority .
besides the modernization of nuclear arsenals , the document mentions the development of high-tech weapons , the militarization of outer space , strategic armaments in non-nuclear areas , the creation of a missile defense system partly stationed in eastern europe . the list is clearly referring to the us , which russia still sees as the principle threat to its security . " regarding foreign policy everything is being repeated which was said in the past , " said rahr .
" russia is against the eastern expansion of nato , and therefore certain western countries - unnamed - which would challenge russia on its western border , are being heavily criticized . " nato fears while the document says nato expansion to russia 's borders is not acceptable , almost in the same breath moscow names nato as a strategic partner necessary for the maintenance of international security . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow is suspicious of nato but needs it as an strategic partner " the -lrb- nato -rrb- block is a partner for russia since it is working on solving problems that are essential for russia 's security , such as afghanistan , " said analyst suslov .
" furthermore , nato is a central pillar of euro-atlantic security apparatus , whether russia likes it or not .
if russia wants to participate in such a system , it will have to work on its relations with nato . " the relationship with the us is similarly paradoxical .
although america is seen as a threat , russia is also seeking a strategic partnership of equals and wants to cooperate on the fight against terrorism and non-proliferation . " dmitry medvedev has to position himself on a foreign policy level , " said rahr .
" he wants to show that he has the situation under control , and that he has the capability to modernize the country domestically without disturbances from outside .

german is rarely heard . " we have 2,600 mosques in germany and i do n't know a single imam who has a european education , " said political scientist bassam tibi , a professing muslim .
" how can they show the muslim who live here how to live ?
these imams would probably tell me i should n't integrate . " bulent ucar , professor for islamic studies at the university of osnabrueck , said that it 's crucial to the authentic development of islam in germany and europe that imams are educated on the continent . " only then can we have religious leaders who are informed about the country and the people and are aware of the cultural sensibilities here in germany and can act accordingly in their work in the mosque , " he added . to address the issue , the interior minister of lower saxony , uwe schuenemann , who is also the state 's integration minister , has announced a new education initiative for imams . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the university of osnabrueck was founded in 1668 " a continuing education program should be offered very soon , " said schuenemann .
" imams from turkey will be able to take courses in the teaching of religion , civic education and german . " the first batch of german-educated imams is set to graduate in osnabrueck in three years . job prospects for new imams in the past , imams have taken a reverse path : even german muslims with turkish roots have returned to turkey to complete their training . now schuenemann wants to work together with schura , a state-wide umbrella organizations for muslim groups , and ditib , the national association of turkish muslim congregations , to establish an imam training program in germany . " there are plans later on to add a masters program to the new bachelors program , " said schuenemann , " so that these imams can also teach courses in the muslim religion in schools . " in germany , elementary and high schools offer - generally catholic or protestant - religion courses .
alternatively , students can choose to take ethics .
recognized courses in islam were approved by the german government earlier this year , but have not yet been implemented in schools . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schuenemann is state minister for interior affairs , sport and integration hiring the imam graduates as part-time public school teachers would give them a secure income , said the interior minister .
otherwise , imams in germany are often subsidized by the turkish state because the mosques can not afford to pay their complete salaries . strong ties to muslim countries while other german states are looking to lower saxony as a possible trailblazer in the integration project , the state 's plan has not been particularly well received by religious leaders in the muslim community .
around one fifth of the imams who preach in german mosques tend toward conservative fundamentalism , concluded a current study by social scientist rauf ceylan of duisburg . many of the imams who are active in germany are convinced that an acceptable imam must have been educated in the home country 's muslim community . according to ceylan 's study , integration is n't yet a high priority for the majority of muslim leaders in germany . author : michael hollenbach -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this followed summit talks at the kremlin on monday to " reset " bilateral relations . us president barack obama and his russian counterpart , dmitry medvedev , signed a " joint understanding " aimed at reducing the number of nuclear warheads held by each of their countries to between 1,500 and 1,675 , compared with the maximum 2,200 the existing strategic arms reduction treaty -lrb- start -rrb- between their two countries allows . the two sides are also to aim to reduce the number of missiles capable of delivering the warheads from the current maximum of 1,600 allowed for each side to between 500 and 1,100 .
at a press conference following their summit talks at the kremlin on monday , medvedev said moscow wanted a " fresh start ” in relations with washington despite persisting differences .
admitting that relations between the two sides were not at an optimal level , he said " our countries are aiming at cooperation commensurate with the 21st century . " agreeing to forge ahead with disarmament talks , the russian leader said showed that russia and the united states were facing up to their superpower responsibilities .
for his part , obama praised what he called russia 's contribution in stemming nuclear threats to the world .
“ we resolved to reset us-russian relations , ” he said at the joint press conference .
he stressed the joint efforts being made towards a follow-up to the start treaty , saying the two countries aimed to " lead by example " in cutting back their nuclear weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skepticism persists in both countries over what can be achieved building on recent progress while admitting that some of the differences between the two sides were not likely to simply fade away , the two leaders sought to highlight progress made in recent months .
" we are confident that we can continue to build on the excellent discussions that we had in london , ” obama said , adding : “ and that on a whole host of issues - including security issues , economic issues , energy issues , environmental issues - that the united states and russia have more in common than they have differences . ”
the two countries have agreed to set up a joint commission on some of these issues .
more notably , military cooperation , which suffered in the aftermath of the russia-georgia conflict last august , is to recommence .
obama said if the two sides were to continue to hard work in the next few days , they could make “ extraordinary progress that would benefit the people of both countries . "
echoing those sentiments , medvedev said not just their two countries but the rest of the world too would gain from better us-russian relations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korea continues its provocative actions security cooperation the us president also said that he and medvedev shared concerns over nuclear proliferation and related developments in countries like north korea and iran .
he said that the two sides had taken “ important steps forward to strengthen our security through greater cooperation , " adding that he and his russian counterpart agreed on the “ need to combat the threat of violent extremism , particularly from al-qaeda " .
in an important sign of growing security cooperation , moscow has agreed to allow us military planes to fly over russian territory to afghanistan , which in obama 's words , is a “ substantial contribution ” that will save the us “ time and resources ” in its afghanistan mission .
problems persist medvedev said he saw clear progress in talks with the us on missile defence as the obama administration was prepared to listen to russian concerns .
he described monday 's summit as a “ first but very important step ” toward revitalizing relations between the former cold war foes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama says the us is keen on talking to both russian leaders despite positive talk on both sides , even president medvedev admitted to the existence of some serious glitches .
us plans to install a missile defence system in poland and the czech republic which the previous bush administration said was aimed at countering threats from so-called “ rogue states ” like iran .
however , moscow is opposed to the plan and has urged obama to abandon it .

police recorded 132 such crimes last year , but charities said the true figures were much higher .
a report by cerebral palsy charity scope suggested of 50 serious assaults against disabled people , only one was recorded as a hate crime .
scope said more consideration was needed when categorising crimes .
campaigners told bbc wales ' eye on wales programme that many disabled people were reluctant to report incidents , or were sometimes unaware they had been victimised .
scope is calling for a more in-depth look at hostility as a motive in crimes against disabled people , with a view to tougher sentencing .
he 'd come up to my shoulder and he 'd say , ' you 're not blind , you 're ' and then various swear words sarah craig under section 146 of the criminal justice act , sentencing can be enhanced if a hate crime motive is established .
ruth scott , policy director for scope , said : " a lot of disabled people have experienced hate crime .
they do n't necessarily recognise that it 's hate crime , they do n't necessarily have the language to describe it .
" but part of that is related to the fact that disability hate crime is really hard to recognise and that the vast majority of police officers and others also do n't recognise it .
" we found lots of incidences , including some very serious crimes like murders , where this seems to have been motivated by hostility towards this person because they 're a disabled person .
" -lsb- they -rsb- were n't being picked up , -lsb- or -rsb- being prosecuted using hate crime legislation , so the whole issue remains very hidden or invisible . "
' abusive ' sarah craig , from bridgend , is visually impaired and uses a guide dog .
she has experienced intimidation and harassment which she believes is related to her disability .
" i had one guy who just literally followed me around bridgend all day .
he 'd come up to my shoulder and he 'd say , ' you 're not blind , you 're ' and then various swear words .
" another guy , he started dancing around in front of me and saying , ' how can you avoid me if you ca n't see me , you obviously can see me ' .
" i 'm lucky , i 've got a little bit of sight , but even so , i knew he was there .
i told him ' can i get past please ' - he was just verbally abusive . "
gwent police hosted a conference last week to raise awareness of disability hate crime , and the crown prosecution service has established independent scrutiny panels to review case files on offences against disabled people .
chris woolley , chief crown prosecutor for south wales , said : " this is a crime that we 're all waking up to , just as we woke up to racial and religious crime some years ago , to homophobic crime , and crimes against the elderly .
" this is one more in that series that all of us working in the criminal justice system have to be alert to . "
eye on wales is broadcast on radio wales on monday 6 july at 1830 bst .

police recorded 132 such crimes last year , but charities said the true figures were much higher .
a report by cerebral palsy charity scope suggested of 50 serious assaults against disabled people , only one was recorded as a hate crime .
scope said more consideration was needed when categorising crimes .
campaigners told bbc wales ' eye on wales programme that many disabled people were reluctant to report incidents , or were sometimes unaware they had been victimised .
scope is calling for a more in-depth look at hostility as a motive in crimes against disabled people , with a view to tougher sentencing .
he 'd come up to my shoulder and he 'd say , ' you 're not blind , you 're ' and then various swear words sarah craig under section 146 of the criminal justice act , sentencing can be enhanced if a hate crime motive is established .
ruth scott , policy director for scope , said : " a lot of disabled people have experienced hate crime .
they do n't necessarily recognise that it 's hate crime , they do n't necessarily have the language to describe it .
" but part of that is related to the fact that disability hate crime is really hard to recognise and that the vast majority of police officers and others also do n't recognise it .
" we found lots of incidences , including some very serious crimes like murders , where this seems to have been motivated by hostility towards this person because they 're a disabled person .
" -lsb- they -rsb- were n't being picked up , -lsb- or -rsb- being prosecuted using hate crime legislation , so the whole issue remains very hidden or invisible . "
' abusive ' sarah craig , from bridgend , is visually impaired and uses a guide dog .
she has experienced intimidation and harassment which she believes is related to her disability .
" i had one guy who just literally followed me around bridgend all day .
he 'd come up to my shoulder and he 'd say , ' you 're not blind , you 're ' and then various swear words .
" another guy , he started dancing around in front of me and saying , ' how can you avoid me if you ca n't see me , you obviously can see me ' .
" i 'm lucky , i 've got a little bit of sight , but even so , i knew he was there .
i told him ' can i get past please ' - he was just verbally abusive . "
gwent police hosted a conference last week to raise awareness of disability hate crime , and the crown prosecution service has established independent scrutiny panels to review case files on offences against disabled people .
chris woolley , chief crown prosecutor for south wales , said : " this is a crime that we 're all waking up to , just as we woke up to racial and religious crime some years ago , to homophobic crime , and crimes against the elderly .
" this is one more in that series that all of us working in the criminal justice system have to be alert to . "
eye on wales is broadcast on radio wales on monday 6 july at 1830 bst .

the cbi wants struggling firms to be allowed to suspend employees ' contracts for up to six months .
workers would then be paid the equivalent of twice the rate of jobseekers ' allowance - half paid by the government , half by the employer .
but the tuc questioned whether employees would lose redundancy rights .
unemployment in the uk reached 2.22 million in the first quarter of 2009 .
the cbi warned that unemployment will rise to 3.03 million by the second quarter of next year unless more is done to help save jobs and businesses .
union concerns under the group 's proposed scheme , firms could take employees back during the six months if business improves .
but if demand is still low , workers would be offered the normal redundancy package .
" the alternative to redundancy scheme could save jobs by giving businesses more leeway as the economy recovers , " said john cridland , the cbi 's deputy director general .
" this is not about businesses ducking their redundancy responsibility - in fact , if a scheme runs for six months and a redundancy is still made , then the business will end up paying more . "
but tuc general secretary brendan barber said : " we have many concerns about the detail of these proposals .
" in particular , there will be worries about whether employees who took up this option could end up losing redundancy rights and the big cut in income they will face , without any cushioning redundancy pay for the first six months . "
separately , a report by the accountants bdo stoy hayward says the economy is looking like a " saxophone-shaped cycle of recession and recovery " .
the group says there was a sharp downturn from july 2008 to february 2009 , followed by a bounce starting in march , and now predicts a period of slowing recovery .

the cbi wants struggling firms to be allowed to suspend employees ' contracts for up to six months .
workers would then be paid the equivalent of twice the rate of jobseekers ' allowance - half paid by the government , half by the employer .
but the tuc questioned whether employees would lose redundancy rights .
unemployment in the uk reached 2.22 million in the first quarter of 2009 .
the cbi warned that unemployment will rise to 3.03 million by the second quarter of next year unless more is done to help save jobs and businesses .
union concerns under the group 's proposed scheme , firms could take employees back during the six months if business improves .
but if demand is still low , workers would be offered the normal redundancy package .
" the alternative to redundancy scheme could save jobs by giving businesses more leeway as the economy recovers , " said john cridland , the cbi 's deputy director general .
" this is not about businesses ducking their redundancy responsibility - in fact , if a scheme runs for six months and a redundancy is still made , then the business will end up paying more . "
but tuc general secretary brendan barber said : " we have many concerns about the detail of these proposals .
" in particular , there will be worries about whether employees who took up this option could end up losing redundancy rights and the big cut in income they will face , without any cushioning redundancy pay for the first six months . "
separately , a report by the accountants bdo stoy hayward says the economy is looking like a " saxophone-shaped cycle of recession and recovery " .
the group says there was a sharp downturn from july 2008 to february 2009 , followed by a bounce starting in march , and now predicts a period of slowing recovery .
