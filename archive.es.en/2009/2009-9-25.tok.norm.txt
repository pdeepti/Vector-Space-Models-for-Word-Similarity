they presented their produce in italy this year and swapped knowledge with italian farmers . leaving the arid plains of west pokot in kenya for the rolling green hills of piedmont in northern italy , four goat- and cow-herders from the terzoi tribe were among the special guests at cheese 2009 . it is the slow food movement 's biennial fair aimed at protecting and preserving traditional dairy products . the kenyans were presenting their unique yogurt , fermented in colorful hollowed gourds .
what makes it special is ash – made from burning branches of the local cromwo tree – that 's added to it as a disinfectant and preservative , giving it a distinctive aromatic flavor and speckled grey color . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional terzoi yoghurt is fermented in gourds the community is very poor : they live in mud and straw huts , their animals graze freely , and they do n't have any dairy facilities .
but , thanks to slow food 's interest in their product , these farmers have had the opportunity to leave their country for the first time and discover first-hand the techniques and traditions of their italian counterparts . a great exchange of skills " it has been a phenomenal learning experience , for both the kenyans and the farmers in italy . " said peter namianya , a kenyan graduate from the university of gastronomy in piedmont , who coordinated the trip . " when the terzoi saw the italian goats they exclaimed ' oh , they 're the size of my cows ! ' , and everybody laughed . "
the kenyan goat and cow herders and their italian counterparts discovered they have a lot in common . the time spent with local dairy farmers , cheese-makers and vets was a real cultural exchange .
" one of them would say , ' back home we do it like this ' , and the other would reply , ' here you do it like this . " kenyans and italians discover how much they have in common bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kenyan cattleherders inspecting italian stables the group spent two and a half days on mario gala 's farm , where he taught them how to improve their hygiene standards and look after their animals ' health . " i think the shepherds from kenya are more similar to me than any italian bank employee ! " , laughed mario gala , " we are the same people .
our day is the same , we pay attention to the seasons , the rain , the pasturing , the good health of our animals , my cheese , their yogurt . " gala 's kenyan visitors were equally enthusiastic .
" there are some things that we have not done well , like milking and cleaning , and we are going to improve our standards , " said simon pkite lochawan .
the group was clearly impressed by the high importance put on hygiene in the stables and the quality of animal fodder in italy . learning the art of cheese making bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a cross-cultural culinary encounter one of the most exciting and precious skills the kenyans have learned is the art of cheese-making .
for countless generations , the terzoi have been making butter and their unusual yogurt , but they 've never turned their milk into cheese .
although you can buy imported cheeses at supermarkets in kenya 's big cities , farmers have no cheesemaking traditions of their own . " they do n't have a culture of cheese but they want to try to make it when they go back home , " said peter namianya .
he added that this is a unique way of conserving milk , instead of just making yogurt and drinking fresh milk . this could also become another way of reducing hunger in the community . " if there is abundant milk , they can make cheese and store it and then use it in a time when there 's no food . " praise for traditional kenyan yoghurt pkite and his colleagues have enjoyed the opportunity to try so many different varieties of cheese at the slow food fair .
they especially like the taste of soft cheeses like ricotta , and are looking forward to experimenting with their own milk when they get back .
the positive reactions to their yoghurt have also made them realize the value of their own traditional product . the kenyans ' visit has also inspired the curiosity of their italian hosts , who are now keen to experience everyday life in west pokot . namianya already envisions a kind of eco-tourism : " you go to the village , taste their food and taste the real culture of the people .

most countries could learn a lesson or two on how to do that from brazil . a new geography of international trade called " south-south " - that is the ambitious goal of brazilian president luiz inácio “ lula ” da silva .
the former trade union leader wants to better connect his country with other developing and emerging nations , a vision he already announced back in 2004 at a un trade conference in sao paulo .
while he wanted to continue to export to industrial nations , he also emphasized that he was looking for new opportunities .
" we want to foster partnerships , which enable better cooperation between the economies of the south , " lula said .
that strategy seems to work .
today brazil sells more goods to developing and emerging countries than to countries in the northern hemisphere .
china has become brazil 's third largest trade partner , after the us , and close behind neighboring argentina .
aside from china , brazilian companies have increasingly focused on africa , a continent , which in the past was regarded mainly as the home of former slaves .
lula himself already has travelled to africa eleven times and does n't get tired of repeating that brazil is home to the largest population of african descent outside of africa .
the official export agency apex has also intensified its efforts and earlier this month a delegation of brazilian businessmen visited south africa .
maurício manfré , who leads the project within apex , does n't view himself merely as a representative of brazilian companies .
he is also on the look out for products , which he can import .
" we want to expand and intensify this relationship , " he says .
rapid increase in exports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angola is brasil 's number one african trading partner in the past ten years brazilian exports to sub-saharan africa have increased almost eightfold .
last year they reached more than ten billion us dollars , five percent of all brazilian exports .
angola was brazil 's number one export destination with two billion us dollars , followed by south africa with 1.8 billion dollars and nigeria with 1.5 billion dollars respectively .
especially in the midst of the global financial and economic crisis new markets in africa are more than welcome , says jorge duarte de oliveira , the director of exportaminas , the export agency of the south eastern brazilian state of minas gerais : " the emerging countries have suffered considerably less from the international crisis , " he explains .
" they offer very attractive markets to small companies , which produce consumer goods here in brazil for the middle and lower class . "
jorge duarte de oliveira is convinced that those smaller brazilian producers will find the same kind of customers in africa and the middle east .
wide range of brasilian exports to africa while two thirds of chinese imports from brazil are commodities like soy and iron ore and bejing has little interest in industrial products , brazil 's range of exports to africa is more diverse .
only one third are commodities , two thirds consist of assembled products , from textiles and furniture to agricultural machines .
" africa has n't been able yet to develop its own industries .
that 's why the africans buy a large part of brazil 's industrial exports , " says carlos abijaodi , a trade expert with the industrial association of the federal state of minas gerais .
that is the reason why brazil 's range of products is broad , he explains brazil is also closely related to africa , adds abijaodi and says that he noticed that through his international contacts .
" they have similar customs and in the portuguese speaking countries in africa like angola and mozambique we share the same language . "
brazilian multinationals invest billions in africa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mozambique could also see a surge in brazilian investments brazil 's most important trading partner in africa is angola .
the oil-rich country which boasted double-digit growth rates in recent years has attracted investments by many brazilian companies .
petrobrás , the state-run oil concern , is surveying angola 's coast for possible oil fields while construction firm odebrecht maintains roads and brazilian conglomerate camargo corrêa builds a 370 million dollar cement plant in angola .
but in the near future , mozambique , africa 's most populous portuguese speaking country , is likely to also become more attractive for brazil .
vale , the leading brazilian mining company , invests 1.3 billion dollars there to exploit coal near moatize in central mozambique .
moatize is considered to be one of the largest unexploited coal reserves in the world .
it could provide high quality coal for more than a hundred years .

that is the reason why brazil 's range of products is broad , he explains brazil is also closely related to africa , adds abijaodi and says that he noticed that through his international contacts .
" they have similar customs and in the portuguese speaking countries in africa like angola and mozambique we share the same language . "
brazilian multinationals invest billions in africa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mozambique could also see a surge in brazilian investments brazil 's most important trading partner in africa is angola .
the oil-rich country which boasted double-digit growth rates in recent years has attracted investments by many brazilian companies .
petrobrás , the state-run oil concern , is surveying angola 's coast for possible oil fields while construction firm odebrecht maintains roads and brazilian conglomerate camargo corrêa builds a 370 million dollar cement plant in angola .
but in the near future , mozambique , africa 's most populous portuguese speaking country , is likely to also become more attractive for brazil .
vale , the leading brazilian mining company , invests 1.3 billion dollars there to exploit coal near moatize in central mozambique .
moatize is considered to be one of the largest unexploited coal reserves in the world .
it could provide high quality coal for more than a hundred years .

however , times are changing , and tax evaders from abroad will have to be more careful in future . switzerland has paved the way to be dropped from a so-called grey list of uncooperative tax havens , after signing a necessary 12th new bilateral taxation agreement with qatar .
swiss president hans-rudolf merz signed the treaty with qatar 's prime minister sheikh hamad bin jassim bin jabr al-thani on the sidelines of the un general assembly in new york late on thursday .
the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- demands that countries listed on the grey list sign at least 12 bilateral tax cooperation treaties before they lose that stigma .
switzerland has also signed deals with norway , denmark , finland , the faroe islands , great britain , france , luxembourg , austria , mexico , spain and the united states .
however , oecd head , angel guerria , stressed that switzerland not only had to sign agreements but also work toward " effective implementation . "
the alpine state , which has faced strong international pressure to join the global hunt for tax evaders , caved in earlier this year , saying it would improve cooperation with foreign tax authorities . however , the swiss government emphasized that banking secrecy would be maintained as long as no tax offences were committed .
" banking secrecy offers no protection in the case of tax offences .
as a result of the globalization of financial markets and particularly against the backdrop of the financial crisis , international cooperation in the area of taxes has grown in importance , " the swiss federal department of finance said in a statement upon completion of the 12th deal. nk / dpa / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 25.09.2009 the climate ball is in the rich world 's court großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g20 could be the place to get a deal on funding to protect rainforests .
this week witnessed some important meetings for climate negotiations .
world leaders gathered for two high-level conferences in the us .
a leading us scientific advisor gave dw his thoughts on where climate talks stood . alden meyer is director of strategy and policy for the union of concerned scientists – a us organisation which campaigns for tough international action to tackle global warming .
meyer has 30 years experience advising government on environmental and energy issues , and spoke to deutsche welle from the g20 summit in pittsburgh .
he said world leaders made some progress when they met in new york for a special one-day climate summit .
he added that although the united states remains distracted by a struggle over health care reform , the g20 could prove to unblock efforts to get an ambitious agreement at december 's crucial climate conference in copenhagen .
deutsche welle : what struck you about world leaders ' addresses on climate change on tuesday ?
alden meyer : one of the significant developments at the special summit on climate change on tuesday was the commitment by chinese president hu jintao that china would put forward a carbon intensity target for china between now and 2020 that is to reduce the emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases as a proportion of their economic output .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meyer has testified before congress on global warming and energy issues it is the first time china has made that proposal .
he did not put forward a specific number , and obviously we have to wait to see how aggressive that carbon intensity reduction goal is , but it was a meaningful offer by china.i think that added some momentum coming out of new york , going into pittsburgh and on to copenhagen at the end of the year .
also , japan , the new prime minister there , pledging to increase japan 's greenhouse gas reduction target from the minus eight percent below 1990 levels , pledged by the previous government , to 25 percent below 1990 levels .
of course that 's much more in keeping with the proposal that the european union has put forward and begins to be within the range of what the science says we need to do to get a handle on the problem .
some commentators were quite disappointed with the us position , with obama 's remarks , how did you perceive them ?
i think he said a lot of the right things in terms of the urgency of the problem ; that he gets it on the science ; that the us is committed to do its part on this .
he gave a good overview of all the things he and his administration have done in the eight months since he took office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's un address won a luke warm reception from some observers i think what was disappointing to a lot of observers , and particularly to those from other countries , was that he did n't say very much about the need for the senate in our country to take action on domestic climate legislation in advance of copenhagen .
he did mention that the house has already passed a domestic climate bill and that committees in the senate are starting to consider it , but he did n't lay down the gauntlet and say to the senate ' i really need you to do this by copenhagen so that i can go in there with the credibility of the congressional backing for the position i want to take at that meeting . '
i think people understand the situation he is in .
he is fighting very hard for a domestic health care bill .
they are focused on that like a laser and do n't want to be distracting the senate with talk about other issues , but i think there is more and more impatience on the international scene about the fact that one body of our congress is threatening to hold up the whole process in copenhagen .
two years ago countries agreed to reach a new deal to replace the kyoto protocol by the end of this year , yet negotiations remain about as deadlocked as they have been for the better part of a decade .
how likely is it that we 'll see an agreement at the next big round of negotiations in copenhagen in december – especially given , as you said , that the senate in the us seems to be holding up the process ?
i think there are two big issues here .
one is what the state is of the us domestic debate .
if the president comes to copenhagen with the senate moving forward on climate legislation – with a leadership bill having been introduced and expressions of support – i think he 'll have more credibility .
certainly more than president clinton and vice-president gore did in kyoto when everyone knew that congress was not likely to back what they were putting forward .
the other piece , which is equally daunting frankly , is the issue of climate finance : the roughly 100-150 billion euro-a-year estimates for developing countries for mitigation and adaptation activities on climate change .
and there it 's not just the us , but europe and japan as well which have to do much more to advance that issue before copenhagen .
many of the developing countries have made it clear that if there is not the serious financing and technology package on offer in copenhagen that was promised back in bali two years ago , there 's not going to be a deal from their side .
bildunterschrift : western money to pay for clean development could be a deal-breaker there are still critics who question not only whether an international deal is feasible , but whether it is even desirable .
the controversial danish statistician björn lomborg told deutsche welle this week that cutting emissions was too expensive and ultimately futile .
he said the world would get more bang for its buck by investing in super-projects to pump clouds into the atmosphere to cool the planet .
does lomborg have a point ?
we certainly disagree with his premise that cutting carbon emissions is expensive .
as a matter of fact , my organization just completed an analysis of the us potential for emission reductions showing that we could go far beyond the reductions that the president and the congress are talking about , and that -lrb- we could provide -rrb- savings for consumers .
the reality is , particularly energy efficiency investments pay back very quickly , and then you get benefits from that for years to come .
there are also signals that wind energy and other renewable technologies are coming down in price .
wind is taking off in the united states as it is in other parts of the world , so i fundamentally disagree with the premise that cutting emissions has to be expensive .
yes there is some cost , but it is much less than the cost of damages from climate change that we will see if we do n't take action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish statistician bjorn lomborg says money would be better spent elsewhere when it comes to the issue of geo-engineering , this is obviously something the science community is starting to talk about .
it is very controversial , because obviously these are unproven technologies , and more importantly there could be side-effects from these large-scale geo-engineering schemes that we do n't fully understand .
we 're obviously not doing a very good of regulating the planet with our activities now , and to think that we can have some kind of technical fix that works without some kind of unforeseen side-effect is a little bit of hubris on our part .
so i think there is some interest in exploring some of these options , but i think to hang your whole strategy on that would be a grave mistake .
so what are some of the biggest challenges going to be in securing a good deal at copenhagen at the end of the year ?
indeed , what would amount to a good deal ?
i think what you need for a good deal is something that 's ambitious , that 's in line with what the science says we have to do to bend the emissions curve .
this means we need deeper reductions than what most of the industrialized countries are to date putting on the table .
we also need action by the major developing countries to see a deviation from their business-as-usual growth-path in emissions over the next decade or so , with a view towards eventually having an absolute cap and eventual reduction in their emission later this century .
and we need a substantial financing and technology package to help make those countries make the transition – to basically leap-frog across the way the industrialized countries did their development over the last century , and go right to cleaner technologies .
i think that 's going to be a real challenge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : per capita , indians produce a tenth of the co2 that americans do there also has to be a fair agreement .
it has to recognize the different stages of development that different countries are at ; that acknowledges the fact that a country like india , for example , emits two tones of carbon per person or less , whereas my country , the united states , emits 20 tones per person – ten times as much .
so it 's not fair to ask india to do the same as the united states in terms of taking leadership .
it is fair to ask india to do something , and to do more than they have been , and i think they 're showing signals that they 're willing to step up to the plate on that , as is china and other countries , but equity is a key part of this .
the third element is that it has to be binding .
it has to be something that is not just a voluntary commitment , but where countries look each other in the eye and say ' we are going to do this , we are going to have a system of verification , a system of compliance , that assures us that each of is doing our part in what we agreed to in copenhagen .
those are the three basic elements – it has to be fair , it has to be ambitious and it has to be binding .
climate change is also on the agenda when the leaders of the group of 20 major economies meet on thursday and friday .
some say the g20 could prove to be an even more important venue to overcome deadlocks between rich nations like the us and developing countries like china … the two issues that are on the agenda here in pittsburgh this week are climate finance .
how do you generate and govern the flows of investment that are needed for clean energy technologies ; reducing the rate of deforestation in tropical rainforest countries ; and for helping the poorest countries adapt to the impacts of climate change .
that 's going to be a big discussion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the g20 be the right venue to broker a compromise ?
the other issue , which the us has put on the agenda , is the issue of fossil fuel subsidies .
it turns out that the world is spending somewhere around 200 billion dollars a year or more encouraging production and consumption on the very things we 're trying to reduce to deal with global warming – that 's coal and oil .
so that topic is on the agenda , we 'll see how far we get with that , that 's obviously a very difficult issue - not only for the united states , but other countries .
it 's very political and there are entrenched interests that benefit from those embedded subsidies and will fight very hard against efforts to reduce or eliminate them .
climate is just one of the topics , but it is the first time that it has been on the agenda in a way like at the g20 and i think that does give us some prospect of movement .
certainly if they do some follow up between pittsburgh and copenhagen and the g20 process , they could help deliver that element of the package on climate finance . interview : nathan witkop editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this week witnessed some important meetings for climate negotiations .
world leaders gathered for two high-level conferences in the us .
a leading us scientific advisor gave dw his thoughts on where climate talks stood . alden meyer is director of strategy and policy for the union of concerned scientists – a us organisation which campaigns for tough international action to tackle global warming .
meyer has 30 years experience advising government on environmental and energy issues , and spoke to deutsche welle from the g20 summit in pittsburgh .
he said world leaders made some progress when they met in new york for a special one-day climate summit .
he added that although the united states remains distracted by a struggle over health care reform , the g20 could prove to unblock efforts to get an ambitious agreement at december 's crucial climate conference in copenhagen .
deutsche welle : what struck you about world leaders ' addresses on climate change on tuesday ?
alden meyer : one of the significant developments at the special summit on climate change on tuesday was the commitment by chinese president hu jintao that china would put forward a carbon intensity target for china between now and 2020 that is to reduce the emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases as a proportion of their economic output .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meyer has testified before congress on global warming and energy issues it is the first time china has made that proposal .
he did not put forward a specific number , and obviously we have to wait to see how aggressive that carbon intensity reduction goal is , but it was a meaningful offer by china.i think that added some momentum coming out of new york , going into pittsburgh and on to copenhagen at the end of the year .
also , japan , the new prime minister there , pledging to increase japan 's greenhouse gas reduction target from the minus eight percent below 1990 levels , pledged by the previous government , to 25 percent below 1990 levels .
of course that 's much more in keeping with the proposal that the european union has put forward and begins to be within the range of what the science says we need to do to get a handle on the problem .
some commentators were quite disappointed with the us position , with obama 's remarks , how did you perceive them ?
i think he said a lot of the right things in terms of the urgency of the problem ; that he gets it on the science ; that the us is committed to do its part on this .
he gave a good overview of all the things he and his administration have done in the eight months since he took office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's un address won a luke warm reception from some observers i think what was disappointing to a lot of observers , and particularly to those from other countries , was that he did n't say very much about the need for the senate in our country to take action on domestic climate legislation in advance of copenhagen .
he did mention that the house has already passed a domestic climate bill and that committees in the senate are starting to consider it , but he did n't lay down the gauntlet and say to the senate ' i really need you to do this by copenhagen so that i can go in there with the credibility of the congressional backing for the position i want to take at that meeting . '
i think people understand the situation he is in .
he is fighting very hard for a domestic health care bill .
they are focused on that like a laser and do n't want to be distracting the senate with talk about other issues , but i think there is more and more impatience on the international scene about the fact that one body of our congress is threatening to hold up the whole process in copenhagen .
two years ago countries agreed to reach a new deal to replace the kyoto protocol by the end of this year , yet negotiations remain about as deadlocked as they have been for the better part of a decade .
how likely is it that we 'll see an agreement at the next big round of negotiations in copenhagen in december – especially given , as you said , that the senate in the us seems to be holding up the process ?
i think there are two big issues here .
one is what the state is of the us domestic debate .
if the president comes to copenhagen with the senate moving forward on climate legislation – with a leadership bill having been introduced and expressions of support – i think he 'll have more credibility .
certainly more than president clinton and vice-president gore did in kyoto when everyone knew that congress was not likely to back what they were putting forward .
the other piece , which is equally daunting frankly , is the issue of climate finance : the roughly 100-150 billion euro-a-year estimates for developing countries for mitigation and adaptation activities on climate change .
and there it 's not just the us , but europe and japan as well which have to do much more to advance that issue before copenhagen .
many of the developing countries have made it clear that if there is not the serious financing and technology package on offer in copenhagen that was promised back in bali two years ago , there 's not going to be a deal from their side .
bildunterschrift : western money to pay for clean development could be a deal-breaker there are still critics who question not only whether an international deal is feasible , but whether it is even desirable .
the controversial danish statistician björn lomborg told deutsche welle this week that cutting emissions was too expensive and ultimately futile .
he said the world would get more bang for its buck by investing in super-projects to pump clouds into the atmosphere to cool the planet .
does lomborg have a point ?
we certainly disagree with his premise that cutting carbon emissions is expensive .
as a matter of fact , my organization just completed an analysis of the us potential for emission reductions showing that we could go far beyond the reductions that the president and the congress are talking about , and that -lrb- we could provide -rrb- savings for consumers .
the reality is , particularly energy efficiency investments pay back very quickly , and then you get benefits from that for years to come .
there are also signals that wind energy and other renewable technologies are coming down in price .
wind is taking off in the united states as it is in other parts of the world , so i fundamentally disagree with the premise that cutting emissions has to be expensive .
yes there is some cost , but it is much less than the cost of damages from climate change that we will see if we do n't take action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish statistician bjorn lomborg says money would be better spent elsewhere when it comes to the issue of geo-engineering , this is obviously something the science community is starting to talk about .
it is very controversial , because obviously these are unproven technologies , and more importantly there could be side-effects from these large-scale geo-engineering schemes that we do n't fully understand .
we 're obviously not doing a very good of regulating the planet with our activities now , and to think that we can have some kind of technical fix that works without some kind of unforeseen side-effect is a little bit of hubris on our part .
so i think there is some interest in exploring some of these options , but i think to hang your whole strategy on that would be a grave mistake .
so what are some of the biggest challenges going to be in securing a good deal at copenhagen at the end of the year ?
indeed , what would amount to a good deal ?
i think what you need for a good deal is something that 's ambitious , that 's in line with what the science says we have to do to bend the emissions curve .

this week witnessed some important meetings for climate negotiations .
world leaders gathered for two high-level conferences in the us .
a leading us scientific advisor gave dw his thoughts on where climate talks stood . alden meyer is director of strategy and policy for the union of concerned scientists – a us organisation which campaigns for tough international action to tackle global warming .
meyer has 30 years experience advising government on environmental and energy issues , and spoke to deutsche welle from the g20 summit in pittsburgh .
he said world leaders made some progress when they met in new york for a special one-day climate summit .
he added that although the united states remains distracted by a struggle over health care reform , the g20 could prove to unblock efforts to get an ambitious agreement at december 's crucial climate conference in copenhagen .
deutsche welle : what struck you about world leaders ' addresses on climate change on tuesday ?
alden meyer : one of the significant developments at the special summit on climate change on tuesday was the commitment by chinese president hu jintao that china would put forward a carbon intensity target for china between now and 2020 that is to reduce the emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases as a proportion of their economic output .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meyer has testified before congress on global warming and energy issues it is the first time china has made that proposal .
he did not put forward a specific number , and obviously we have to wait to see how aggressive that carbon intensity reduction goal is , but it was a meaningful offer by china.i think that added some momentum coming out of new york , going into pittsburgh and on to copenhagen at the end of the year .
also , japan , the new prime minister there , pledging to increase japan 's greenhouse gas reduction target from the minus eight percent below 1990 levels , pledged by the previous government , to 25 percent below 1990 levels .
of course that 's much more in keeping with the proposal that the european union has put forward and begins to be within the range of what the science says we need to do to get a handle on the problem .
some commentators were quite disappointed with the us position , with obama 's remarks , how did you perceive them ?
i think he said a lot of the right things in terms of the urgency of the problem ; that he gets it on the science ; that the us is committed to do its part on this .
he gave a good overview of all the things he and his administration have done in the eight months since he took office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's un address won a luke warm reception from some observers i think what was disappointing to a lot of observers , and particularly to those from other countries , was that he did n't say very much about the need for the senate in our country to take action on domestic climate legislation in advance of copenhagen .
he did mention that the house has already passed a domestic climate bill and that committees in the senate are starting to consider it , but he did n't lay down the gauntlet and say to the senate ' i really need you to do this by copenhagen so that i can go in there with the credibility of the congressional backing for the position i want to take at that meeting . '
i think people understand the situation he is in .
he is fighting very hard for a domestic health care bill .
they are focused on that like a laser and do n't want to be distracting the senate with talk about other issues , but i think there is more and more impatience on the international scene about the fact that one body of our congress is threatening to hold up the whole process in copenhagen .
two years ago countries agreed to reach a new deal to replace the kyoto protocol by the end of this year , yet negotiations remain about as deadlocked as they have been for the better part of a decade .
how likely is it that we 'll see an agreement at the next big round of negotiations in copenhagen in december – especially given , as you said , that the senate in the us seems to be holding up the process ?
i think there are two big issues here .
one is what the state is of the us domestic debate .
if the president comes to copenhagen with the senate moving forward on climate legislation – with a leadership bill having been introduced and expressions of support – i think he 'll have more credibility .
certainly more than president clinton and vice-president gore did in kyoto when everyone knew that congress was not likely to back what they were putting forward .
the other piece , which is equally daunting frankly , is the issue of climate finance : the roughly 100-150 billion euro-a-year estimates for developing countries for mitigation and adaptation activities on climate change .
and there it 's not just the us , but europe and japan as well which have to do much more to advance that issue before copenhagen .
many of the developing countries have made it clear that if there is not the serious financing and technology package on offer in copenhagen that was promised back in bali two years ago , there 's not going to be a deal from their side .
bildunterschrift : western money to pay for clean development could be a deal-breaker there are still critics who question not only whether an international deal is feasible , but whether it is even desirable .
the controversial danish statistician björn lomborg told deutsche welle this week that cutting emissions was too expensive and ultimately futile .
he said the world would get more bang for its buck by investing in super-projects to pump clouds into the atmosphere to cool the planet .
does lomborg have a point ?
we certainly disagree with his premise that cutting carbon emissions is expensive .
as a matter of fact , my organization just completed an analysis of the us potential for emission reductions showing that we could go far beyond the reductions that the president and the congress are talking about , and that -lrb- we could provide -rrb- savings for consumers .
the reality is , particularly energy efficiency investments pay back very quickly , and then you get benefits from that for years to come .
there are also signals that wind energy and other renewable technologies are coming down in price .
wind is taking off in the united states as it is in other parts of the world , so i fundamentally disagree with the premise that cutting emissions has to be expensive .
yes there is some cost , but it is much less than the cost of damages from climate change that we will see if we do n't take action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish statistician bjorn lomborg says money would be better spent elsewhere when it comes to the issue of geo-engineering , this is obviously something the science community is starting to talk about .
it is very controversial , because obviously these are unproven technologies , and more importantly there could be side-effects from these large-scale geo-engineering schemes that we do n't fully understand .
we 're obviously not doing a very good of regulating the planet with our activities now , and to think that we can have some kind of technical fix that works without some kind of unforeseen side-effect is a little bit of hubris on our part .
so i think there is some interest in exploring some of these options , but i think to hang your whole strategy on that would be a grave mistake .
so what are some of the biggest challenges going to be in securing a good deal at copenhagen at the end of the year ?
indeed , what would amount to a good deal ?
i think what you need for a good deal is something that 's ambitious , that 's in line with what the science says we have to do to bend the emissions curve .
this means we need deeper reductions than what most of the industrialized countries are to date putting on the table .
we also need action by the major developing countries to see a deviation from their business-as-usual growth-path in emissions over the next decade or so , with a view towards eventually having an absolute cap and eventual reduction in their emission later this century .
and we need a substantial financing and technology package to help make those countries make the transition – to basically leap-frog across the way the industrialized countries did their development over the last century , and go right to cleaner technologies .
i think that 's going to be a real challenge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : per capita , indians produce a tenth of the co2 that americans do there also has to be a fair agreement .
it has to recognize the different stages of development that different countries are at ; that acknowledges the fact that a country like india , for example , emits two tones of carbon per person or less , whereas my country , the united states , emits 20 tones per person – ten times as much .
so it 's not fair to ask india to do the same as the united states in terms of taking leadership .
it is fair to ask india to do something , and to do more than they have been , and i think they 're showing signals that they 're willing to step up to the plate on that , as is china and other countries , but equity is a key part of this .
the third element is that it has to be binding .
it has to be something that is not just a voluntary commitment , but where countries look each other in the eye and say ' we are going to do this , we are going to have a system of verification , a system of compliance , that assures us that each of is doing our part in what we agreed to in copenhagen .
those are the three basic elements – it has to be fair , it has to be ambitious and it has to be binding .
climate change is also on the agenda when the leaders of the group of 20 major economies meet on thursday and friday .
some say the g20 could prove to be an even more important venue to overcome deadlocks between rich nations like the us and developing countries like china … the two issues that are on the agenda here in pittsburgh this week are climate finance .
how do you generate and govern the flows of investment that are needed for clean energy technologies ; reducing the rate of deforestation in tropical rainforest countries ; and for helping the poorest countries adapt to the impacts of climate change .
that 's going to be a big discussion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the g20 be the right venue to broker a compromise ?
the other issue , which the us has put on the agenda , is the issue of fossil fuel subsidies .
it turns out that the world is spending somewhere around 200 billion dollars a year or more encouraging production and consumption on the very things we 're trying to reduce to deal with global warming – that 's coal and oil .
so that topic is on the agenda , we 'll see how far we get with that , that 's obviously a very difficult issue - not only for the united states , but other countries .
it 's very political and there are entrenched interests that benefit from those embedded subsidies and will fight very hard against efforts to reduce or eliminate them .
climate is just one of the topics , but it is the first time that it has been on the agenda in a way like at the g20 and i think that does give us some prospect of movement .
certainly if they do some follow up between pittsburgh and copenhagen and the g20 process , they could help deliver that element of the package on climate finance . interview : nathan witkop editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in germany , politics and pop culture are like chalk and cheese .
but some of the more intrepid candidates in the upcoming parliamentary elections are now going where few have ever dared to tread : late-night tv . german politicians looked on enviously during the last us election campaign as then-presidential-hopeful barack obama managed to mobilize the youth vote .
it was primarily his use of the internet and social networking sites that helped him reach the blasé young people who in this generation have shown little interest in politics .
but media-savvy appearances on tv talk shows also helped propel obama into the forefront of popular culture .
in march , he became the first sitting president to appear on a late-night talk show when he dropped by " the tonight show with jay leno . "
rolling with the punches the strategy has clearly been noticed in germany - where the hope is that young voters will not only help sway the current , close election , but will stay true to their parties for life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tv host stefan raab does not treat his guests with kid gloves so politicians are starting to spread their wings .
appearing on established topical chat shows aired by public broadcasters and hosted by high-minded hosts such as anne will and maybrit illner are obviously nothing new .
but as parliamentary elections loom this weekend , a slew of berlin heavyweights , from the ever-slick economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg to the loquacious left party candidate gregor gysi , have decided to take their cues from obama and appear on prime-time private broadcaster prosieben .
joining them for an election-night panel on a saturday night show will be social democrat chairman franz muentefering , while liberal free democrats and the green party are sending their respective frontrunner candidates guido westerwelle and juergen trittin .
the show ’ s host is none other than stefan raab , enfant terrible of late-night viewing .
as a tv personality , he 's famous for making his interviewees squirm - and a lot more used to grilling guests such as germany 's next top model and kylie minogue than political leaders .
over exposure still , he wo n't be the only one treading new ground . a turn on a show as anchored in youth culture as " tv total bundestagswahl 2009 " certainly marks a departure for senior politicians .
but it is likely to be a canny move .
when an election show hosted by raab aired on the eve of the vote four years ago , it snagged a 29 percent market share of the 14 -29 age group category .
obviously , politicians have decided to do whatever it takes to galvanize young voters out of their living rooms and into the polling stations come sunday , and if that means subjecting themselves to raab 's punishing wit , they 're willing to roll with the punches .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the heavily plugged merkel- steinmeier debate was widely deemed a dud after all , the duller-than-dishwater debate between chancellor angela merkel and her challenger , frank-walter steinmeier , which aired a week ahead of the vote on germany 's first public broadcaster ard , did little to tickle the public 's interest - let alone attract the younger generation .

in germany , politics and pop culture are like chalk and cheese .
but some of the more intrepid candidates in the upcoming parliamentary elections are now going where few have ever dared to tread : late-night tv . german politicians looked on enviously during the last us election campaign as then-presidential-hopeful barack obama managed to mobilize the youth vote .
it was primarily his use of the internet and social networking sites that helped him reach the blasé young people who in this generation have shown little interest in politics .
but media-savvy appearances on tv talk shows also helped propel obama into the forefront of popular culture .
in march , he became the first sitting president to appear on a late-night talk show when he dropped by " the tonight show with jay leno . "
rolling with the punches the strategy has clearly been noticed in germany - where the hope is that young voters will not only help sway the current , close election , but will stay true to their parties for life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tv host stefan raab does not treat his guests with kid gloves so politicians are starting to spread their wings .
appearing on established topical chat shows aired by public broadcasters and hosted by high-minded hosts such as anne will and maybrit illner are obviously nothing new .
but as parliamentary elections loom this weekend , a slew of berlin heavyweights , from the ever-slick economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg to the loquacious left party candidate gregor gysi , have decided to take their cues from obama and appear on prime-time private broadcaster prosieben .
joining them for an election-night panel on a saturday night show will be social democrat chairman franz muentefering , while liberal free democrats and the green party are sending their respective frontrunner candidates guido westerwelle and juergen trittin .
the show ’ s host is none other than stefan raab , enfant terrible of late-night viewing .
as a tv personality , he 's famous for making his interviewees squirm - and a lot more used to grilling guests such as germany 's next top model and kylie minogue than political leaders .
over exposure still , he wo n't be the only one treading new ground . a turn on a show as anchored in youth culture as " tv total bundestagswahl 2009 " certainly marks a departure for senior politicians .
but it is likely to be a canny move .
when an election show hosted by raab aired on the eve of the vote four years ago , it snagged a 29 percent market share of the 14 -29 age group category .
obviously , politicians have decided to do whatever it takes to galvanize young voters out of their living rooms and into the polling stations come sunday , and if that means subjecting themselves to raab 's punishing wit , they 're willing to roll with the punches .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the heavily plugged merkel- steinmeier debate was widely deemed a dud after all , the duller-than-dishwater debate between chancellor angela merkel and her challenger , frank-walter steinmeier , which aired a week ahead of the vote on germany 's first public broadcaster ard , did little to tickle the public 's interest - let alone attract the younger generation .

in germany , politics and pop culture are like chalk and cheese .
but some of the more intrepid candidates in the upcoming parliamentary elections are now going where few have ever dared to tread : late-night tv . german politicians looked on enviously during the last us election campaign as then-presidential-hopeful barack obama managed to mobilize the youth vote .
it was primarily his use of the internet and social networking sites that helped him reach the blasé young people who in this generation have shown little interest in politics .
but media-savvy appearances on tv talk shows also helped propel obama into the forefront of popular culture .
in march , he became the first sitting president to appear on a late-night talk show when he dropped by " the tonight show with jay leno . "
rolling with the punches the strategy has clearly been noticed in germany - where the hope is that young voters will not only help sway the current , close election , but will stay true to their parties for life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tv host stefan raab does not treat his guests with kid gloves so politicians are starting to spread their wings .
appearing on established topical chat shows aired by public broadcasters and hosted by high-minded hosts such as anne will and maybrit illner are obviously nothing new .
but as parliamentary elections loom this weekend , a slew of berlin heavyweights , from the ever-slick economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg to the loquacious left party candidate gregor gysi , have decided to take their cues from obama and appear on prime-time private broadcaster prosieben .
joining them for an election-night panel on a saturday night show will be social democrat chairman franz muentefering , while liberal free democrats and the green party are sending their respective frontrunner candidates guido westerwelle and juergen trittin .
the show ’ s host is none other than stefan raab , enfant terrible of late-night viewing .
as a tv personality , he 's famous for making his interviewees squirm - and a lot more used to grilling guests such as germany 's next top model and kylie minogue than political leaders .
over exposure still , he wo n't be the only one treading new ground . a turn on a show as anchored in youth culture as " tv total bundestagswahl 2009 " certainly marks a departure for senior politicians .
but it is likely to be a canny move .
when an election show hosted by raab aired on the eve of the vote four years ago , it snagged a 29 percent market share of the 14 -29 age group category .
obviously , politicians have decided to do whatever it takes to galvanize young voters out of their living rooms and into the polling stations come sunday , and if that means subjecting themselves to raab 's punishing wit , they 're willing to roll with the punches .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the heavily plugged merkel- steinmeier debate was widely deemed a dud after all , the duller-than-dishwater debate between chancellor angela merkel and her challenger , frank-walter steinmeier , which aired a week ahead of the vote on germany 's first public broadcaster ard , did little to tickle the public 's interest - let alone attract the younger generation .
with the two rivals remaining civil and measured throughout , it could hardly even be termed a debate .
and in terms of ratings , it was a resounding flop : 7 million fewer viewers tuned in than did four years ago , and with 7,86 million watching , it attracted a market share of only 23,4 percent .
but merkel probably feels as though she currently has enough exposure in popular culture , now that a youtube video featuring her getting heckled by a " flash mob " at an election rally in hamburg has been watched by more than a quarter of a million people in the last week .
participants shouted " yeaahh " at every sentence spoken by the conservative leader , and waved placards with the words : " all together : yeaahh . "
" this is our political message and the political meaning of this flash mob - we wo n't swallow election campaign messages anymore and we 'll throw merkel 's rubbish back at her with a ironic ' yeaahh ' , " wrote rene walter on the nerdcore.de blog , according to news agency afp .

more and more of the criminals are coming from the ranks of management . white-collar crime in germany has exploded in severity , the consulting firm pricewaterhousecoopers -lrb- pwc -rrb- said thursday , with over 60 percent of german companies reporting cases of industrial espionage , corruption and other offenses .
firms expect crime to worsen as a weak economy makes competition tougher and workers unhappier .
the average cost to a firm per incident has risen from 1.47 million euros four years ago to nearly 4.3 million euros today .
" the direct costs of crime are only the tip of the iceberg , " said pwc partner and former prosecutor steffem salvenmoser .
" above all , the reputational damage to a firm in cases of corruption , data theft or price-fixing is often greater than the measurable financial losses . "
the study 's results are based on a survey of 500 large german companies conducted by pwc in spring of 2009 , after the german economy sank into its deepest recession in over 60 years , propelled in part by the worldwide financial crisis .
over 40 percent of the surveyed firms expect competitors to use espionage or anti-competitive practices such as cartels to gain an advantage in a tough economic climate .
over a third of the companies expected workers to steal from their employers as concerns about holding onto jobs mounts .
crime from the corner office bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only 50 percent of managers accused of criminal deeds are prosecuted over 70 percent of the perpetrators were caught thanks to tipsters , the study said , despite increased investment in internal control measures designed to detect theft and fraud .
those results suggest that preventive measures have little effect according to professor kai bussmann from the martin luther university in halle , who worked on the study .
further tainting a company 's reputation is the finding that the perpetrators often come from the ranks of management .
the study said 29 percent were executives from the very top of the company 's leadership and 38 percent were middle managers .
many perpetrators were long time employees , 45 percent with more than ten years of tenure with the company and over 90 percent were men .
strikingly , despite the size and nature of the crimes , firms pressed charges against malfeasant managers just 50 percent of the time , compared to 61 percent in the pwc 's last survey in 2007 .
one fifth of the top managers who took part in crimes against their employers received no punishment whatsoever .
" although the relative leniency against perpetrators from the leadership level can be explained by the particular legal and factual difficulties of individual cases this practice is extremely problematic from vantage point of the credibility and leadership of management , " salvenmoser said. bn / ap / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" fostering a culture of corporate integrity is essential to protect investment , increase commercial success and ensure the stability sought by poor and rich countries alike , particularly as we climb out of an historical crisis , ” said transparency international chair huguette labelle .
the global corruption report documents that in developing and emerging countries , companies paid $ 40 billion -lrb- 27.2 billion euros -rrb- annually in bribes to polticians and government officials .
ultimately it is consumers around the globe who foot the bill .
project costs increase by at least 10 percent , according to a poll of business executives conducted by transparency international .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bribery and corruption are problems in the eurozone corporate integrity " it is not just a question of tackling corruption in business - it is also important for financial and economic stability and the ongoing reforms of the global financial architecture " , the ti report said .
another concern is the sheer economic power of some companies and business sectors , which translates into disproportionate influence on political decision-making .
the report called on companies to publish regular reports on how they are fighting corruption and to disclose information on financial support for political parties , lobbyists and governments .
transparency international also recommended that governments apply anti-corruption regulations with more vigor .
" it is time that corporations face up to the risk of paying millions in fines and the long-term loss of trust from their customers and shareholders " , said labelle .
report discusses siemens , volkswagen scandals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens has now forbidden corrupt practices one of the biggest corruption scandals in recent years in germany involves the electronics giant , siemens .
the ti report reviews the case and lists the heavy fines imposed .
it notes , " with more prosecutions expected , germany 's largest post-war economic scandal is likely to dominate the news for the next few years . "
however , it criticizes germany for not learning from the scandal , noting that one of the former siemens ceos , who was accused of bribery and corruption , was allowed to continue as head of a major government think tank until the institution was dissolved in 2008 .

" fostering a culture of corporate integrity is essential to protect investment , increase commercial success and ensure the stability sought by poor and rich countries alike , particularly as we climb out of an historical crisis , ” said transparency international chair huguette labelle .
the global corruption report documents that in developing and emerging countries , companies paid $ 40 billion -lrb- 27.2 billion euros -rrb- annually in bribes to polticians and government officials .
ultimately it is consumers around the globe who foot the bill .
project costs increase by at least 10 percent , according to a poll of business executives conducted by transparency international .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bribery and corruption are problems in the eurozone corporate integrity " it is not just a question of tackling corruption in business - it is also important for financial and economic stability and the ongoing reforms of the global financial architecture " , the ti report said .
another concern is the sheer economic power of some companies and business sectors , which translates into disproportionate influence on political decision-making .
the report called on companies to publish regular reports on how they are fighting corruption and to disclose information on financial support for political parties , lobbyists and governments .
transparency international also recommended that governments apply anti-corruption regulations with more vigor .
" it is time that corporations face up to the risk of paying millions in fines and the long-term loss of trust from their customers and shareholders " , said labelle .
report discusses siemens , volkswagen scandals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens has now forbidden corrupt practices one of the biggest corruption scandals in recent years in germany involves the electronics giant , siemens .
the ti report reviews the case and lists the heavy fines imposed .
it notes , " with more prosecutions expected , germany 's largest post-war economic scandal is likely to dominate the news for the next few years . "
however , it criticizes germany for not learning from the scandal , noting that one of the former siemens ceos , who was accused of bribery and corruption , was allowed to continue as head of a major government think tank until the institution was dissolved in 2008 .
the report also discusses the more recent vw corruption scandal in which an entire works council accepted large bribes as well as luxury hotel accommodation and , more embarrassingly , visits to brothels to encourage them to accept employer-friendly practices .
indeed , further examples in the report imply that this is one of the major forms of corruption in german society - big business offering inducements to workers ' representatives to push through management decisions , leading to unfair competitive practices to the detriment of the individual employee .
concern remains over tax havens the section of the report concentrating on germany concludes by turning its attention away from big business to wealthy individuals and the widespread use of tax havens such as liechtenstein .
it cites the case of former deutsche post ceo , klaus zumwinkel , who was arrested on charges of evading one million euros in taxes .
as a result , zumwinkel resigned from his post and was later convicted of tax evasion .
that investigation led to the revelation that german officials had spent over four million euros -lrb- $ 6 million -rrb- to obtain information about large sums deposited by wealthy germans in secret bank accounts in liechtenstein .
it 's been argued that the expense was well worthwhile because it 's expected to lead to the recovery of hundreds of millions of euros in back taxes .
transparency international complains of german inaction germany has been sharply criticized by ti for failing to ratify the un convention against corruption during the last legislative period , failing to introduce a corruption register and for not fulfilling transparency requirements when awarding public sector contracts .
last year germany was listed 14th out of 180 countries in ti 's annual corruption and bribery rankings .

the video was produced by t-online 's wahlzeit.tv website , after steini-girl offered them the song she wrote together with a friend .
" she just thinks he 's a really nice guy , " wahlzeit spokesman bjoern akstinat said .
steini-girl , whose real name is being kept secret , said her main aim " is to get people voting on sunday , and maybe i 'll get a few lucrative jobs out of it too . "
ironic love declaration in the video , steini-girl dances in front of the various seats of federal government in berlin , including the reichstag and the chancellery , wearing not many clothes and kissing pictures of social democrat chancellor candidate frank-walter steinmeier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's chances against chancellor merkel this sunday are thought to be slim the song itself is mainly an ironic love declaration to steinmeier , described in the lyrics as " coiled masculinity " , while his chief opponent in the election chancellor angela merkel is dismissed as " too masculine " .
the song also deems free liberal party leader guido westerwelle " too feminine " and prominent left party politician gregor gysi " too small " .
steini-girl is consciously based on obama girl , a similar viral video song performed by model amber lee ettinger , which was massively successful in the united states during the 2008 presidential election campaign .
obama girl has attracted over 15 million clicks on youtube to date , and made a minor celebrity of ettinger .

however , times are changing , and tax evaders from abroad will have to be more careful in future . switzerland has paved the way to be dropped from a so-called grey list of uncooperative tax havens , after signing a necessary 12th new bilateral taxation agreement with qatar .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world war ii -pipe- 25.09.2009 70 years on , polish resolution condemns crimes under stalin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's resolution condemns crimes from the era of josef stalin at the beginning of world war ii , the soviet invasion of poland led to massive loss of life in prison camps and massacres .
a new resolution from the polish parliament condemns the invasion - and irks russia . a resolution unanimously approved by the polish parliament this week condemns the soviet invasion of eastern poland in 1939 .
the resolution referred to a series of massacres of poles in russia , as well as mass deportations of over one million poles to siberia .
poland also called on russia to condemn the crimes .
sixteen days after poland was invaded by nazi germany on sept .
1 , 1939 , troops under soviet dictator josef stalin were sent into eastern poland .
a year later , a soviet-led massacre in the katyn forest left over 20,000 polish officers and intellectuals dead .
angry reactions from moscow the response from russia warned that the polish resolution , which said the stalin-era crimes amount to genocide , was a set-back to improving ties between russia and poland .
" the resolution adopted by the parliament deals a serious blow to efforts to develop normal neighborly relations between our countries , " the russian foreign ministry said in a statement , adding that the resolution was " tendentious and politicized . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bronislaw komorowski says russia has trouble dealing with its past polish parliamentary speaker bronislaw komorowski said russia 's reaction indicates the country is still coming to grips with its past .
" the fact that russia has reacted so nervously to a resolution that has nothing to do with present-day foreign policy is a sign that it is still unable to come to terms with its own history , " komorowski said .
tense relationship with history while the resolution brought a seventy-year old conflict to the forefront , both countries have previously had difficulty in addressing their shared history .
another contentious issue is the non-aggression pact signed between the soviets and the nazis on the eve of world war ii .
during a visit to poland by russian prime minister vladimir putin a few days before the resolution passed , putin made a surprising departure from russia 's previous attitude towards the pact by calling the document " immoral . "
many had hoped putin 's visit marked an improvement in frosty polish-russian relations of the past few years .
but according to commentators , poland and russia appear to have wasted an opportunity on the 70th anniversary of the outbreak of world war ii to use memories of their joint struggle against the nazis to bring them together – and instead decided to dwell on the past to cultivate their differences .

this year ’ s guest of honour , china , is refusing to allow a writer to exit the country to attend a debate at berlin ’ s house of world cultures .
liao yiwu , who has spent years in prison and whose books are banned in china was supposed to attend the “ frenetic homeland ” series that is part of the asia pacific weeks in the german capital . liao yiwu is 50 years old .
the musician and author has felt the brunt of the chinese state police many times .
he was first arrested in 1990 .
he had written a series of poems criticising the massacre on tiananmen square .
on 4th june 1989 , the chinese army moved in with tanks to disperse protesters who had been calling for more rights and democracy .
a few years later , liao yiwu was again arrested .
this time it was for publishing an article online .
he has spent a total of four years in jail just for criticising the state .
but he is not a broken man .
" i am healthy , ” he says .
“ i have done a lot in my life .
my attitude has changed with time .
at first , i was angry .
i couldn ’ t stand all this injustice .
that has changed .
if you can ’ t stand things , you should learn from them .
i have learnt from my suffering .
in prison , i learnt to play the flute and came into contact with simple people .
that would never have been the case if i hadn ’ t been to jail . ”
speaking up for simple people after his time in jail , liao yiwu developed an interest in china ’ s simple people - in those whose voices are rarely heard - prostitutes , migrant workers and petty criminals , for instance .
these are the protagonists of his books , in which he criticises the fact that the rich have all the power .
his books have been translated and published abroad but are banned in china .
" for people in the west , it ’ s completely normal to be able to write about anything freely , ” he explains .
“ but in china , one has to fight for this .
one has to try to push a closed door inch by inch .
i will keep fighting for the right to publish here .
if i don ’ t manage and continue to be censored i will go on working .
even if only one person reads my book then at least i will have influenced one person . “ china is where he wants to be despite the fact that liao yiwu is unknown to the broad chinese public because the authorities stop him from getting near it , he is not bitter and china remains the place where he wants to be .
" for me , freedom is when the heart is free .
i have yellow skin and sometimes i ’ m engulfed by the feeling that i would like to be somebody else .
but chinese blood flows through my veins .
it would be terrible if i had to live in exile .
that would be worse than being stopped from travelling outside of china .
i can write in my mother tongue here and i have so many people around me who give me warmth .
i can consider myself lucky . ”
perhaps he will even be lucky enough to travel to germany after all .
the head of the frankfurt book fair jürgen boos has said he will try to persuade the chinese authorities .

the global corruption report documents that in developing and emerging countries , companies paid $ 40 billion -lrb- 27.2 billion euros -rrb- annually in bribes to polticians and government officials .
ultimately it is consumers around the globe who foot the bill .
project costs increase by at least 10 percent , according to a poll of business executives conducted by transparency international .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bribery and corruption are problems in the eurozone corporate integrity " it is not just a question of tackling corruption in business - it is also important for financial and economic stability and the ongoing reforms of the global financial architecture " , the ti report said .
another concern is the sheer economic power of some companies and business sectors , which translates into disproportionate influence on political decision-making .
the report called on companies to publish regular reports on how they are fighting corruption and to disclose information on financial support for political parties , lobbyists and governments .
transparency international also recommended that governments apply anti-corruption regulations with more vigor .
" it is time that corporations face up to the risk of paying millions in fines and the long-term loss of trust from their customers and shareholders " , said labelle .
report discusses siemens , volkswagen scandals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens has now forbidden corrupt practices one of the biggest corruption scandals in recent years in germany involves the electronics giant , siemens .
the ti report reviews the case and lists the heavy fines imposed .
it notes , " with more prosecutions expected , germany 's largest post-war economic scandal is likely to dominate the news for the next few years . "
however , it criticizes germany for not learning from the scandal , noting that one of the former siemens ceos , who was accused of bribery and corruption , was allowed to continue as head of a major government think tank until the institution was dissolved in 2008 .
the report also discusses the more recent vw corruption scandal in which an entire works council accepted large bribes as well as luxury hotel accommodation and , more embarrassingly , visits to brothels to encourage them to accept employer-friendly practices .
indeed , further examples in the report imply that this is one of the major forms of corruption in german society - big business offering inducements to workers ' representatives to push through management decisions , leading to unfair competitive practices to the detriment of the individual employee .
concern remains over tax havens the section of the report concentrating on germany concludes by turning its attention away from big business to wealthy individuals and the widespread use of tax havens such as liechtenstein .
it cites the case of former deutsche post ceo , klaus zumwinkel , who was arrested on charges of evading one million euros in taxes .
as a result , zumwinkel resigned from his post and was later convicted of tax evasion .
that investigation led to the revelation that german officials had spent over four million euros -lrb- $ 6 million -rrb- to obtain information about large sums deposited by wealthy germans in secret bank accounts in liechtenstein .
it 's been argued that the expense was well worthwhile because it 's expected to lead to the recovery of hundreds of millions of euros in back taxes .
transparency international complains of german inaction germany has been sharply criticized by ti for failing to ratify the un convention against corruption during the last legislative period , failing to introduce a corruption register and for not fulfilling transparency requirements when awarding public sector contracts .
last year germany was listed 14th out of 180 countries in ti 's annual corruption and bribery rankings .

" fostering a culture of corporate integrity is essential to protect investment , increase commercial success and ensure the stability sought by poor and rich countries alike , particularly as we climb out of an historical crisis , ” said transparency international chair huguette labelle .
the global corruption report documents that in developing and emerging countries , companies paid $ 40 billion -lrb- 27.2 billion euros -rrb- annually in bribes to polticians and government officials .
ultimately it is consumers around the globe who foot the bill .
project costs increase by at least 10 percent , according to a poll of business executives conducted by transparency international .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bribery and corruption are problems in the eurozone corporate integrity " it is not just a question of tackling corruption in business - it is also important for financial and economic stability and the ongoing reforms of the global financial architecture " , the ti report said .
another concern is the sheer economic power of some companies and business sectors , which translates into disproportionate influence on political decision-making .
the report called on companies to publish regular reports on how they are fighting corruption and to disclose information on financial support for political parties , lobbyists and governments .
transparency international also recommended that governments apply anti-corruption regulations with more vigor .
" it is time that corporations face up to the risk of paying millions in fines and the long-term loss of trust from their customers and shareholders " , said labelle .
report discusses siemens , volkswagen scandals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens has now forbidden corrupt practices one of the biggest corruption scandals in recent years in germany involves the electronics giant , siemens .
the ti report reviews the case and lists the heavy fines imposed .
it notes , " with more prosecutions expected , germany 's largest post-war economic scandal is likely to dominate the news for the next few years . "
however , it criticizes germany for not learning from the scandal , noting that one of the former siemens ceos , who was accused of bribery and corruption , was allowed to continue as head of a major government think tank until the institution was dissolved in 2008 .
the report also discusses the more recent vw corruption scandal in which an entire works council accepted large bribes as well as luxury hotel accommodation and , more embarrassingly , visits to brothels to encourage them to accept employer-friendly practices .
indeed , further examples in the report imply that this is one of the major forms of corruption in german society - big business offering inducements to workers ' representatives to push through management decisions , leading to unfair competitive practices to the detriment of the individual employee .
concern remains over tax havens the section of the report concentrating on germany concludes by turning its attention away from big business to wealthy individuals and the widespread use of tax havens such as liechtenstein .
it cites the case of former deutsche post ceo , klaus zumwinkel , who was arrested on charges of evading one million euros in taxes .
as a result , zumwinkel resigned from his post and was later convicted of tax evasion .
that investigation led to the revelation that german officials had spent over four million euros -lrb- $ 6 million -rrb- to obtain information about large sums deposited by wealthy germans in secret bank accounts in liechtenstein .
it 's been argued that the expense was well worthwhile because it 's expected to lead to the recovery of hundreds of millions of euros in back taxes .
transparency international complains of german inaction germany has been sharply criticized by ti for failing to ratify the un convention against corruption during the last legislative period , failing to introduce a corruption register and for not fulfilling transparency requirements when awarding public sector contracts .
last year germany was listed 14th out of 180 countries in ti 's annual corruption and bribery rankings .

a new resolution from the polish parliament condemns the invasion - and irks russia . a resolution unanimously approved by the polish parliament this week condemns the soviet invasion of eastern poland in 1939 .
the resolution referred to a series of massacres of poles in russia , as well as mass deportations of over one million poles to siberia .
poland also called on russia to condemn the crimes .
sixteen days after poland was invaded by nazi germany on sept .
1 , 1939 , troops under soviet dictator josef stalin were sent into eastern poland .
a year later , a soviet-led massacre in the katyn forest left over 20,000 polish officers and intellectuals dead .
angry reactions from moscow the response from russia warned that the polish resolution , which said the stalin-era crimes amount to genocide , was a set-back to improving ties between russia and poland .
" the resolution adopted by the parliament deals a serious blow to efforts to develop normal neighborly relations between our countries , " the russian foreign ministry said in a statement , adding that the resolution was " tendentious and politicized . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bronislaw komorowski says russia has trouble dealing with its past polish parliamentary speaker bronislaw komorowski said russia 's reaction indicates the country is still coming to grips with its past .
" the fact that russia has reacted so nervously to a resolution that has nothing to do with present-day foreign policy is a sign that it is still unable to come to terms with its own history , " komorowski said .
tense relationship with history while the resolution brought a seventy-year old conflict to the forefront , both countries have previously had difficulty in addressing their shared history .
another contentious issue is the non-aggression pact signed between the soviets and the nazis on the eve of world war ii .
during a visit to poland by russian prime minister vladimir putin a few days before the resolution passed , putin made a surprising departure from russia 's previous attitude towards the pact by calling the document " immoral . "
many had hoped putin 's visit marked an improvement in frosty polish-russian relations of the past few years .
but according to commentators , poland and russia appear to have wasted an opportunity on the 70th anniversary of the outbreak of world war ii to use memories of their joint struggle against the nazis to bring them together – and instead decided to dwell on the past to cultivate their differences .

the video was produced by t-online 's wahlzeit.tv website , after steini-girl offered them the song she wrote together with a friend .
" she just thinks he 's a really nice guy , " wahlzeit spokesman bjoern akstinat said .

however , times are changing , and tax evaders from abroad will have to be more careful in future . switzerland has paved the way to be dropped from a so-called grey list of uncooperative tax havens , after signing a necessary 12th new bilateral taxation agreement with qatar .
swiss president hans-rudolf merz signed the treaty with qatar 's prime minister sheikh hamad bin jassim bin jabr al-thani on the sidelines of the un general assembly in new york late on thursday .
the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- demands that countries listed on the grey list sign at least 12 bilateral tax cooperation treaties before they lose that stigma .
switzerland has also signed deals with norway , denmark , finland , the faroe islands , great britain , france , luxembourg , austria , mexico , spain and the united states .
however , oecd head , angel guerria , stressed that switzerland not only had to sign agreements but also work toward " effective implementation . "
the alpine state , which has faced strong international pressure to join the global hunt for tax evaders , caved in earlier this year , saying it would improve cooperation with foreign tax authorities . however , the swiss government emphasized that banking secrecy would be maintained as long as no tax offences were committed .
" banking secrecy offers no protection in the case of tax offences .
as a result of the globalization of financial markets and particularly against the backdrop of the financial crisis , international cooperation in the area of taxes has grown in importance , " the swiss federal department of finance said in a statement upon completion of the 12th deal. nk / dpa / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they presented their produce in italy this year and swapped knowledge with italian farmers . leaving the arid plains of west pokot in kenya for the rolling green hills of piedmont in northern italy , four goat- and cow-herders from the terzoi tribe were among the special guests at cheese 2009 . it is the slow food movement 's biennial fair aimed at protecting and preserving traditional dairy products . the kenyans were presenting their unique yogurt , fermented in colorful hollowed gourds .
what makes it special is ash – made from burning branches of the local cromwo tree – that 's added to it as a disinfectant and preservative , giving it a distinctive aromatic flavor and speckled grey color . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional terzoi yoghurt is fermented in gourds the community is very poor : they live in mud and straw huts , their animals graze freely , and they do n't have any dairy facilities .
but , thanks to slow food 's interest in their product , these farmers have had the opportunity to leave their country for the first time and discover first-hand the techniques and traditions of their italian counterparts . a great exchange of skills " it has been a phenomenal learning experience , for both the kenyans and the farmers in italy . " said peter namianya , a kenyan graduate from the university of gastronomy in piedmont , who coordinated the trip . " when the terzoi saw the italian goats they exclaimed ' oh , they 're the size of my cows ! ' , and everybody laughed . "
the kenyan goat and cow herders and their italian counterparts discovered they have a lot in common . the time spent with local dairy farmers , cheese-makers and vets was a real cultural exchange .

although you can buy imported cheeses at supermarkets in kenya 's big cities , farmers have no cheesemaking traditions of their own . " they do n't have a culture of cheese but they want to try to make it when they go back home , " said peter namianya .
he added that this is a unique way of conserving milk , instead of just making yogurt and drinking fresh milk . this could also become another way of reducing hunger in the community .

however , times are changing , and tax evaders from abroad will have to be more careful in future . switzerland has paved the way to be dropped from a so-called grey list of uncooperative tax havens , after signing a necessary 12th new bilateral taxation agreement with qatar .

however , times are changing , and tax evaders from abroad will have to be more careful in future . switzerland has paved the way to be dropped from a so-called grey list of uncooperative tax havens , after signing a necessary 12th new bilateral taxation agreement with qatar .

the video was produced by t-online 's wahlzeit.tv website , after steini-girl offered them the song she wrote together with a friend .
" she just thinks he 's a really nice guy , " wahlzeit spokesman bjoern akstinat said .
steini-girl , whose real name is being kept secret , said her main aim " is to get people voting on sunday , and maybe i 'll get a few lucrative jobs out of it too . "
ironic love declaration in the video , steini-girl dances in front of the various seats of federal government in berlin , including the reichstag and the chancellery , wearing not many clothes and kissing pictures of social democrat chancellor candidate frank-walter steinmeier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's chances against chancellor merkel this sunday are thought to be slim the song itself is mainly an ironic love declaration to steinmeier , described in the lyrics as " coiled masculinity " , while his chief opponent in the election chancellor angela merkel is dismissed as " too masculine " .
the song also deems free liberal party leader guido westerwelle " too feminine " and prominent left party politician gregor gysi " too small " .
steini-girl is consciously based on obama girl , a similar viral video song performed by model amber lee ettinger , which was massively successful in the united states during the 2008 presidential election campaign .
obama girl has attracted over 15 million clicks on youtube to date , and made a minor celebrity of ettinger .
" my friend was in the usa last year when obama girl was totally popular , and she thought we should do that , so we just messed around and made a few rhymes , the way you do , " she told bild .

the video was produced by t-online 's wahlzeit.tv website , after steini-girl offered them the song she wrote together with a friend .

a new resolution from the polish parliament condemns the invasion - and irks russia . a resolution unanimously approved by the polish parliament this week condemns the soviet invasion of eastern poland in 1939 .
the resolution referred to a series of massacres of poles in russia , as well as mass deportations of over one million poles to siberia .
poland also called on russia to condemn the crimes .
sixteen days after poland was invaded by nazi germany on sept .
1 , 1939 , troops under soviet dictator josef stalin were sent into eastern poland .
a year later , a soviet-led massacre in the katyn forest left over 20,000 polish officers and intellectuals dead .
angry reactions from moscow the response from russia warned that the polish resolution , which said the stalin-era crimes amount to genocide , was a set-back to improving ties between russia and poland .
" the resolution adopted by the parliament deals a serious blow to efforts to develop normal neighborly relations between our countries , " the russian foreign ministry said in a statement , adding that the resolution was " tendentious and politicized . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bronislaw komorowski says russia has trouble dealing with its past polish parliamentary speaker bronislaw komorowski said russia 's reaction indicates the country is still coming to grips with its past .
" the fact that russia has reacted so nervously to a resolution that has nothing to do with present-day foreign policy is a sign that it is still unable to come to terms with its own history , " komorowski said .
tense relationship with history while the resolution brought a seventy-year old conflict to the forefront , both countries have previously had difficulty in addressing their shared history .
another contentious issue is the non-aggression pact signed between the soviets and the nazis on the eve of world war ii .
during a visit to poland by russian prime minister vladimir putin a few days before the resolution passed , putin made a surprising departure from russia 's previous attitude towards the pact by calling the document " immoral . "
many had hoped putin 's visit marked an improvement in frosty polish-russian relations of the past few years .
but according to commentators , poland and russia appear to have wasted an opportunity on the 70th anniversary of the outbreak of world war ii to use memories of their joint struggle against the nazis to bring them together – and instead decided to dwell on the past to cultivate their differences .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de latin america -pipe- 25.09.2009 brazil shows south american neighbors how to trade with africa großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's president lula da silva has increased trade with africa one goal of the second south america-africa summit this weekend in venezuela is to increase cooperation between the continents .
most countries could learn a lesson or two on how to do that from brazil . a new geography of international trade called " south-south " - that is the ambitious goal of brazilian president luiz inácio “ lula ” da silva .
the former trade union leader wants to better connect his country with other developing and emerging nations , a vision he already announced back in 2004 at a un trade conference in sao paulo .
while he wanted to continue to export to industrial nations , he also emphasized that he was looking for new opportunities .
" we want to foster partnerships , which enable better cooperation between the economies of the south , " lula said .
that strategy seems to work .
today brazil sells more goods to developing and emerging countries than to countries in the northern hemisphere .
china has become brazil 's third largest trade partner , after the us , and close behind neighboring argentina .
aside from china , brazilian companies have increasingly focused on africa , a continent , which in the past was regarded mainly as the home of former slaves .
lula himself already has travelled to africa eleven times and does n't get tired of repeating that brazil is home to the largest population of african descent outside of africa .
the official export agency apex has also intensified its efforts and earlier this month a delegation of brazilian businessmen visited south africa .
maurício manfré , who leads the project within apex , does n't view himself merely as a representative of brazilian companies .
he is also on the look out for products , which he can import .
" we want to expand and intensify this relationship , " he says .
rapid increase in exports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angola is brasil 's number one african trading partner in the past ten years brazilian exports to sub-saharan africa have increased almost eightfold .
last year they reached more than ten billion us dollars , five percent of all brazilian exports .
angola was brazil 's number one export destination with two billion us dollars , followed by south africa with 1.8 billion dollars and nigeria with 1.5 billion dollars respectively .
especially in the midst of the global financial and economic crisis new markets in africa are more than welcome , says jorge duarte de oliveira , the director of exportaminas , the export agency of the south eastern brazilian state of minas gerais : " the emerging countries have suffered considerably less from the international crisis , " he explains .
" they offer very attractive markets to small companies , which produce consumer goods here in brazil for the middle and lower class . "
jorge duarte de oliveira is convinced that those smaller brazilian producers will find the same kind of customers in africa and the middle east .
wide range of brasilian exports to africa while two thirds of chinese imports from brazil are commodities like soy and iron ore and bejing has little interest in industrial products , brazil 's range of exports to africa is more diverse .
only one third are commodities , two thirds consist of assembled products , from textiles and furniture to agricultural machines .
" africa has n't been able yet to develop its own industries .
that 's why the africans buy a large part of brazil 's industrial exports , " says carlos abijaodi , a trade expert with the industrial association of the federal state of minas gerais .
that is the reason why brazil 's range of products is broad , he explains brazil is also closely related to africa , adds abijaodi and says that he noticed that through his international contacts .
" they have similar customs and in the portuguese speaking countries in africa like angola and mozambique we share the same language . "
brazilian multinationals invest billions in africa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mozambique could also see a surge in brazilian investments brazil 's most important trading partner in africa is angola .
the oil-rich country which boasted double-digit growth rates in recent years has attracted investments by many brazilian companies .
petrobrás , the state-run oil concern , is surveying angola 's coast for possible oil fields while construction firm odebrecht maintains roads and brazilian conglomerate camargo corrêa builds a 370 million dollar cement plant in angola .
but in the near future , mozambique , africa 's most populous portuguese speaking country , is likely to also become more attractive for brazil .
vale , the leading brazilian mining company , invests 1.3 billion dollars there to exploit coal near moatize in central mozambique .
moatize is considered to be one of the largest unexploited coal reserves in the world .
it could provide high quality coal for more than a hundred years .

a new resolution from the polish parliament condemns the invasion - and irks russia . a resolution unanimously approved by the polish parliament this week condemns the soviet invasion of eastern poland in 1939 .
the resolution referred to a series of massacres of poles in russia , as well as mass deportations of over one million poles to siberia .
poland also called on russia to condemn the crimes .
sixteen days after poland was invaded by nazi germany on sept .
1 , 1939 , troops under soviet dictator josef stalin were sent into eastern poland .
a year later , a soviet-led massacre in the katyn forest left over 20,000 polish officers and intellectuals dead .
angry reactions from moscow the response from russia warned that the polish resolution , which said the stalin-era crimes amount to genocide , was a set-back to improving ties between russia and poland .
" the resolution adopted by the parliament deals a serious blow to efforts to develop normal neighborly relations between our countries , " the russian foreign ministry said in a statement , adding that the resolution was " tendentious and politicized . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bronislaw komorowski says russia has trouble dealing with its past polish parliamentary speaker bronislaw komorowski said russia 's reaction indicates the country is still coming to grips with its past .
" the fact that russia has reacted so nervously to a resolution that has nothing to do with present-day foreign policy is a sign that it is still unable to come to terms with its own history , " komorowski said .
tense relationship with history while the resolution brought a seventy-year old conflict to the forefront , both countries have previously had difficulty in addressing their shared history .
another contentious issue is the non-aggression pact signed between the soviets and the nazis on the eve of world war ii .
during a visit to poland by russian prime minister vladimir putin a few days before the resolution passed , putin made a surprising departure from russia 's previous attitude towards the pact by calling the document " immoral . "
many had hoped putin 's visit marked an improvement in frosty polish-russian relations of the past few years .
but according to commentators , poland and russia appear to have wasted an opportunity on the 70th anniversary of the outbreak of world war ii to use memories of their joint struggle against the nazis to bring them together – and instead decided to dwell on the past to cultivate their differences .

however , times are changing , and tax evaders from abroad will have to be more careful in future . switzerland has paved the way to be dropped from a so-called grey list of uncooperative tax havens , after signing a necessary 12th new bilateral taxation agreement with qatar .
swiss president hans-rudolf merz signed the treaty with qatar 's prime minister sheikh hamad bin jassim bin jabr al-thani on the sidelines of the un general assembly in new york late on thursday .
the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- demands that countries listed on the grey list sign at least 12 bilateral tax cooperation treaties before they lose that stigma .
switzerland has also signed deals with norway , denmark , finland , the faroe islands , great britain , france , luxembourg , austria , mexico , spain and the united states .
however , oecd head , angel guerria , stressed that switzerland not only had to sign agreements but also work toward " effective implementation . "
the alpine state , which has faced strong international pressure to join the global hunt for tax evaders , caved in earlier this year , saying it would improve cooperation with foreign tax authorities . however , the swiss government emphasized that banking secrecy would be maintained as long as no tax offences were committed .
" banking secrecy offers no protection in the case of tax offences .
as a result of the globalization of financial markets and particularly against the backdrop of the financial crisis , international cooperation in the area of taxes has grown in importance , " the swiss federal department of finance said in a statement upon completion of the 12th deal. nk / dpa / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a new resolution from the polish parliament condemns the invasion - and irks russia . a resolution unanimously approved by the polish parliament this week condemns the soviet invasion of eastern poland in 1939 .
the resolution referred to a series of massacres of poles in russia , as well as mass deportations of over one million poles to siberia .
poland also called on russia to condemn the crimes .
sixteen days after poland was invaded by nazi germany on sept .
1 , 1939 , troops under soviet dictator josef stalin were sent into eastern poland .
a year later , a soviet-led massacre in the katyn forest left over 20,000 polish officers and intellectuals dead .
angry reactions from moscow the response from russia warned that the polish resolution , which said the stalin-era crimes amount to genocide , was a set-back to improving ties between russia and poland .

another contentious issue is the non-aggression pact signed between the soviets and the nazis on the eve of world war ii .
during a visit to poland by russian prime minister vladimir putin a few days before the resolution passed , putin made a surprising departure from russia 's previous attitude towards the pact by calling the document " immoral . "
many had hoped putin 's visit marked an improvement in frosty polish-russian relations of the past few years .
but according to commentators , poland and russia appear to have wasted an opportunity on the 70th anniversary of the outbreak of world war ii to use memories of their joint struggle against the nazis to bring them together – and instead decided to dwell on the past to cultivate their differences .

" fostering a culture of corporate integrity is essential to protect investment , increase commercial success and ensure the stability sought by poor and rich countries alike , particularly as we climb out of an historical crisis , ” said transparency international chair huguette labelle .
the global corruption report documents that in developing and emerging countries , companies paid $ 40 billion -lrb- 27.2 billion euros -rrb- annually in bribes to polticians and government officials .
ultimately it is consumers around the globe who foot the bill .
project costs increase by at least 10 percent , according to a poll of business executives conducted by transparency international .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bribery and corruption are problems in the eurozone corporate integrity " it is not just a question of tackling corruption in business - it is also important for financial and economic stability and the ongoing reforms of the global financial architecture " , the ti report said .
another concern is the sheer economic power of some companies and business sectors , which translates into disproportionate influence on political decision-making .
the report called on companies to publish regular reports on how they are fighting corruption and to disclose information on financial support for political parties , lobbyists and governments .
transparency international also recommended that governments apply anti-corruption regulations with more vigor .
" it is time that corporations face up to the risk of paying millions in fines and the long-term loss of trust from their customers and shareholders " , said labelle .
report discusses siemens , volkswagen scandals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens has now forbidden corrupt practices one of the biggest corruption scandals in recent years in germany involves the electronics giant , siemens .
the ti report reviews the case and lists the heavy fines imposed .
it notes , " with more prosecutions expected , germany 's largest post-war economic scandal is likely to dominate the news for the next few years . "
however , it criticizes germany for not learning from the scandal , noting that one of the former siemens ceos , who was accused of bribery and corruption , was allowed to continue as head of a major government think tank until the institution was dissolved in 2008 .
the report also discusses the more recent vw corruption scandal in which an entire works council accepted large bribes as well as luxury hotel accommodation and , more embarrassingly , visits to brothels to encourage them to accept employer-friendly practices .
indeed , further examples in the report imply that this is one of the major forms of corruption in german society - big business offering inducements to workers ' representatives to push through management decisions , leading to unfair competitive practices to the detriment of the individual employee .
concern remains over tax havens the section of the report concentrating on germany concludes by turning its attention away from big business to wealthy individuals and the widespread use of tax havens such as liechtenstein .
it cites the case of former deutsche post ceo , klaus zumwinkel , who was arrested on charges of evading one million euros in taxes .
as a result , zumwinkel resigned from his post and was later convicted of tax evasion .
that investigation led to the revelation that german officials had spent over four million euros -lrb- $ 6 million -rrb- to obtain information about large sums deposited by wealthy germans in secret bank accounts in liechtenstein .
it 's been argued that the expense was well worthwhile because it 's expected to lead to the recovery of hundreds of millions of euros in back taxes .
transparency international complains of german inaction germany has been sharply criticized by ti for failing to ratify the un convention against corruption during the last legislative period , failing to introduce a corruption register and for not fulfilling transparency requirements when awarding public sector contracts .
last year germany was listed 14th out of 180 countries in ti 's annual corruption and bribery rankings .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world war ii -pipe- 25.09.2009 70 years on , polish resolution condemns crimes under stalin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's resolution condemns crimes from the era of josef stalin at the beginning of world war ii , the soviet invasion of poland led to massive loss of life in prison camps and massacres .
a new resolution from the polish parliament condemns the invasion - and irks russia . a resolution unanimously approved by the polish parliament this week condemns the soviet invasion of eastern poland in 1939 .
the resolution referred to a series of massacres of poles in russia , as well as mass deportations of over one million poles to siberia .
poland also called on russia to condemn the crimes .
sixteen days after poland was invaded by nazi germany on sept .
1 , 1939 , troops under soviet dictator josef stalin were sent into eastern poland .
a year later , a soviet-led massacre in the katyn forest left over 20,000 polish officers and intellectuals dead .
angry reactions from moscow the response from russia warned that the polish resolution , which said the stalin-era crimes amount to genocide , was a set-back to improving ties between russia and poland .
" the resolution adopted by the parliament deals a serious blow to efforts to develop normal neighborly relations between our countries , " the russian foreign ministry said in a statement , adding that the resolution was " tendentious and politicized . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bronislaw komorowski says russia has trouble dealing with its past polish parliamentary speaker bronislaw komorowski said russia 's reaction indicates the country is still coming to grips with its past .
" the fact that russia has reacted so nervously to a resolution that has nothing to do with present-day foreign policy is a sign that it is still unable to come to terms with its own history , " komorowski said .
tense relationship with history while the resolution brought a seventy-year old conflict to the forefront , both countries have previously had difficulty in addressing their shared history .
another contentious issue is the non-aggression pact signed between the soviets and the nazis on the eve of world war ii .
during a visit to poland by russian prime minister vladimir putin a few days before the resolution passed , putin made a surprising departure from russia 's previous attitude towards the pact by calling the document " immoral . "
many had hoped putin 's visit marked an improvement in frosty polish-russian relations of the past few years .
but according to commentators , poland and russia appear to have wasted an opportunity on the 70th anniversary of the outbreak of world war ii to use memories of their joint struggle against the nazis to bring them together – and instead decided to dwell on the past to cultivate their differences .

in germany , politics and pop culture are like chalk and cheese .
but some of the more intrepid candidates in the upcoming parliamentary elections are now going where few have ever dared to tread : late-night tv . german politicians looked on enviously during the last us election campaign as then-presidential-hopeful barack obama managed to mobilize the youth vote .
it was primarily his use of the internet and social networking sites that helped him reach the blasé young people who in this generation have shown little interest in politics .
but media-savvy appearances on tv talk shows also helped propel obama into the forefront of popular culture .
in march , he became the first sitting president to appear on a late-night talk show when he dropped by " the tonight show with jay leno . "
rolling with the punches the strategy has clearly been noticed in germany - where the hope is that young voters will not only help sway the current , close election , but will stay true to their parties for life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tv host stefan raab does not treat his guests with kid gloves so politicians are starting to spread their wings .
appearing on established topical chat shows aired by public broadcasters and hosted by high-minded hosts such as anne will and maybrit illner are obviously nothing new .
but as parliamentary elections loom this weekend , a slew of berlin heavyweights , from the ever-slick economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg to the loquacious left party candidate gregor gysi , have decided to take their cues from obama and appear on prime-time private broadcaster prosieben .
joining them for an election-night panel on a saturday night show will be social democrat chairman franz muentefering , while liberal free democrats and the green party are sending their respective frontrunner candidates guido westerwelle and juergen trittin .
the show ’ s host is none other than stefan raab , enfant terrible of late-night viewing .
as a tv personality , he 's famous for making his interviewees squirm - and a lot more used to grilling guests such as germany 's next top model and kylie minogue than political leaders .
over exposure still , he wo n't be the only one treading new ground . a turn on a show as anchored in youth culture as " tv total bundestagswahl 2009 " certainly marks a departure for senior politicians .
but it is likely to be a canny move .
when an election show hosted by raab aired on the eve of the vote four years ago , it snagged a 29 percent market share of the 14 -29 age group category .
obviously , politicians have decided to do whatever it takes to galvanize young voters out of their living rooms and into the polling stations come sunday , and if that means subjecting themselves to raab 's punishing wit , they 're willing to roll with the punches .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the heavily plugged merkel- steinmeier debate was widely deemed a dud after all , the duller-than-dishwater debate between chancellor angela merkel and her challenger , frank-walter steinmeier , which aired a week ahead of the vote on germany 's first public broadcaster ard , did little to tickle the public 's interest - let alone attract the younger generation .
with the two rivals remaining civil and measured throughout , it could hardly even be termed a debate .
and in terms of ratings , it was a resounding flop : 7 million fewer viewers tuned in than did four years ago , and with 7,86 million watching , it attracted a market share of only 23,4 percent .
but merkel probably feels as though she currently has enough exposure in popular culture , now that a youtube video featuring her getting heckled by a " flash mob " at an election rally in hamburg has been watched by more than a quarter of a million people in the last week .
participants shouted " yeaahh " at every sentence spoken by the conservative leader , and waved placards with the words : " all together : yeaahh . "
" this is our political message and the political meaning of this flash mob - we wo n't swallow election campaign messages anymore and we 'll throw merkel 's rubbish back at her with a ironic ' yeaahh ' , " wrote rene walter on the nerdcore.de blog , according to news agency afp .
serious co-host barring an unexpected appearance , both merkel and steinmeier will be conspicuous in their absence on the raab show , but their colleagues can expect questions on topics chosen to appeal to a younger audience , such as education , youth unemployment and the internet .
co-hosting with raab will be experienced political journalist peter limbourg , who was quoted in the daily tagesspiegel as saying that he " expects some tough talking . "
" the point is to get as many people as possible to vote , " he said .

in germany , politics and pop culture are like chalk and cheese .
but some of the more intrepid candidates in the upcoming parliamentary elections are now going where few have ever dared to tread : late-night tv . german politicians looked on enviously during the last us election campaign as then-presidential-hopeful barack obama managed to mobilize the youth vote .
it was primarily his use of the internet and social networking sites that helped him reach the blasé young people who in this generation have shown little interest in politics .
but media-savvy appearances on tv talk shows also helped propel obama into the forefront of popular culture .
in march , he became the first sitting president to appear on a late-night talk show when he dropped by " the tonight show with jay leno . "
rolling with the punches the strategy has clearly been noticed in germany - where the hope is that young voters will not only help sway the current , close election , but will stay true to their parties for life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tv host stefan raab does not treat his guests with kid gloves so politicians are starting to spread their wings .
appearing on established topical chat shows aired by public broadcasters and hosted by high-minded hosts such as anne will and maybrit illner are obviously nothing new .
but as parliamentary elections loom this weekend , a slew of berlin heavyweights , from the ever-slick economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg to the loquacious left party candidate gregor gysi , have decided to take their cues from obama and appear on prime-time private broadcaster prosieben .
joining them for an election-night panel on a saturday night show will be social democrat chairman franz muentefering , while liberal free democrats and the green party are sending their respective frontrunner candidates guido westerwelle and juergen trittin .
the show ’ s host is none other than stefan raab , enfant terrible of late-night viewing .
as a tv personality , he 's famous for making his interviewees squirm - and a lot more used to grilling guests such as germany 's next top model and kylie minogue than political leaders .
over exposure still , he wo n't be the only one treading new ground . a turn on a show as anchored in youth culture as " tv total bundestagswahl 2009 " certainly marks a departure for senior politicians .
but it is likely to be a canny move .
when an election show hosted by raab aired on the eve of the vote four years ago , it snagged a 29 percent market share of the 14 -29 age group category .
obviously , politicians have decided to do whatever it takes to galvanize young voters out of their living rooms and into the polling stations come sunday , and if that means subjecting themselves to raab 's punishing wit , they 're willing to roll with the punches .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the heavily plugged merkel- steinmeier debate was widely deemed a dud after all , the duller-than-dishwater debate between chancellor angela merkel and her challenger , frank-walter steinmeier , which aired a week ahead of the vote on germany 's first public broadcaster ard , did little to tickle the public 's interest - let alone attract the younger generation .
with the two rivals remaining civil and measured throughout , it could hardly even be termed a debate .
and in terms of ratings , it was a resounding flop : 7 million fewer viewers tuned in than did four years ago , and with 7,86 million watching , it attracted a market share of only 23,4 percent .
but merkel probably feels as though she currently has enough exposure in popular culture , now that a youtube video featuring her getting heckled by a " flash mob " at an election rally in hamburg has been watched by more than a quarter of a million people in the last week .
participants shouted " yeaahh " at every sentence spoken by the conservative leader , and waved placards with the words : " all together : yeaahh . "
" this is our political message and the political meaning of this flash mob - we wo n't swallow election campaign messages anymore and we 'll throw merkel 's rubbish back at her with a ironic ' yeaahh ' , " wrote rene walter on the nerdcore.de blog , according to news agency afp .
serious co-host barring an unexpected appearance , both merkel and steinmeier will be conspicuous in their absence on the raab show , but their colleagues can expect questions on topics chosen to appeal to a younger audience , such as education , youth unemployment and the internet .
co-hosting with raab will be experienced political journalist peter limbourg , who was quoted in the daily tagesspiegel as saying that he " expects some tough talking . "
" the point is to get as many people as possible to vote , " he said .

this week witnessed some important meetings for climate negotiations .
world leaders gathered for two high-level conferences in the us .
a leading us scientific advisor gave dw his thoughts on where climate talks stood . alden meyer is director of strategy and policy for the union of concerned scientists – a us organisation which campaigns for tough international action to tackle global warming .
meyer has 30 years experience advising government on environmental and energy issues , and spoke to deutsche welle from the g20 summit in pittsburgh .
he said world leaders made some progress when they met in new york for a special one-day climate summit .
he added that although the united states remains distracted by a struggle over health care reform , the g20 could prove to unblock efforts to get an ambitious agreement at december 's crucial climate conference in copenhagen .
deutsche welle : what struck you about world leaders ' addresses on climate change on tuesday ?
alden meyer : one of the significant developments at the special summit on climate change on tuesday was the commitment by chinese president hu jintao that china would put forward a carbon intensity target for china between now and 2020 that is to reduce the emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases as a proportion of their economic output .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meyer has testified before congress on global warming and energy issues it is the first time china has made that proposal .
he did not put forward a specific number , and obviously we have to wait to see how aggressive that carbon intensity reduction goal is , but it was a meaningful offer by china.i think that added some momentum coming out of new york , going into pittsburgh and on to copenhagen at the end of the year .
also , japan , the new prime minister there , pledging to increase japan 's greenhouse gas reduction target from the minus eight percent below 1990 levels , pledged by the previous government , to 25 percent below 1990 levels .
of course that 's much more in keeping with the proposal that the european union has put forward and begins to be within the range of what the science says we need to do to get a handle on the problem .
some commentators were quite disappointed with the us position , with obama 's remarks , how did you perceive them ?
i think he said a lot of the right things in terms of the urgency of the problem ; that he gets it on the science ; that the us is committed to do its part on this .
he gave a good overview of all the things he and his administration have done in the eight months since he took office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's un address won a luke warm reception from some observers i think what was disappointing to a lot of observers , and particularly to those from other countries , was that he did n't say very much about the need for the senate in our country to take action on domestic climate legislation in advance of copenhagen .
he did mention that the house has already passed a domestic climate bill and that committees in the senate are starting to consider it , but he did n't lay down the gauntlet and say to the senate ' i really need you to do this by copenhagen so that i can go in there with the credibility of the congressional backing for the position i want to take at that meeting . '
i think people understand the situation he is in .
he is fighting very hard for a domestic health care bill .
they are focused on that like a laser and do n't want to be distracting the senate with talk about other issues , but i think there is more and more impatience on the international scene about the fact that one body of our congress is threatening to hold up the whole process in copenhagen .
two years ago countries agreed to reach a new deal to replace the kyoto protocol by the end of this year , yet negotiations remain about as deadlocked as they have been for the better part of a decade .
how likely is it that we 'll see an agreement at the next big round of negotiations in copenhagen in december – especially given , as you said , that the senate in the us seems to be holding up the process ?
i think there are two big issues here .
one is what the state is of the us domestic debate .
if the president comes to copenhagen with the senate moving forward on climate legislation – with a leadership bill having been introduced and expressions of support – i think he 'll have more credibility .
certainly more than president clinton and vice-president gore did in kyoto when everyone knew that congress was not likely to back what they were putting forward .
the other piece , which is equally daunting frankly , is the issue of climate finance : the roughly 100-150 billion euro-a-year estimates for developing countries for mitigation and adaptation activities on climate change .
and there it 's not just the us , but europe and japan as well which have to do much more to advance that issue before copenhagen .
many of the developing countries have made it clear that if there is not the serious financing and technology package on offer in copenhagen that was promised back in bali two years ago , there 's not going to be a deal from their side .
bildunterschrift : western money to pay for clean development could be a deal-breaker there are still critics who question not only whether an international deal is feasible , but whether it is even desirable .
the controversial danish statistician björn lomborg told deutsche welle this week that cutting emissions was too expensive and ultimately futile .
he said the world would get more bang for its buck by investing in super-projects to pump clouds into the atmosphere to cool the planet .
does lomborg have a point ?
we certainly disagree with his premise that cutting carbon emissions is expensive .
as a matter of fact , my organization just completed an analysis of the us potential for emission reductions showing that we could go far beyond the reductions that the president and the congress are talking about , and that -lrb- we could provide -rrb- savings for consumers .
the reality is , particularly energy efficiency investments pay back very quickly , and then you get benefits from that for years to come .
there are also signals that wind energy and other renewable technologies are coming down in price .
wind is taking off in the united states as it is in other parts of the world , so i fundamentally disagree with the premise that cutting emissions has to be expensive .
yes there is some cost , but it is much less than the cost of damages from climate change that we will see if we do n't take action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish statistician bjorn lomborg says money would be better spent elsewhere when it comes to the issue of geo-engineering , this is obviously something the science community is starting to talk about .
it is very controversial , because obviously these are unproven technologies , and more importantly there could be side-effects from these large-scale geo-engineering schemes that we do n't fully understand .
we 're obviously not doing a very good of regulating the planet with our activities now , and to think that we can have some kind of technical fix that works without some kind of unforeseen side-effect is a little bit of hubris on our part .
so i think there is some interest in exploring some of these options , but i think to hang your whole strategy on that would be a grave mistake .
so what are some of the biggest challenges going to be in securing a good deal at copenhagen at the end of the year ?
indeed , what would amount to a good deal ?
i think what you need for a good deal is something that 's ambitious , that 's in line with what the science says we have to do to bend the emissions curve .
this means we need deeper reductions than what most of the industrialized countries are to date putting on the table .
we also need action by the major developing countries to see a deviation from their business-as-usual growth-path in emissions over the next decade or so , with a view towards eventually having an absolute cap and eventual reduction in their emission later this century .
and we need a substantial financing and technology package to help make those countries make the transition – to basically leap-frog across the way the industrialized countries did their development over the last century , and go right to cleaner technologies .
i think that 's going to be a real challenge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : per capita , indians produce a tenth of the co2 that americans do there also has to be a fair agreement .
it has to recognize the different stages of development that different countries are at ; that acknowledges the fact that a country like india , for example , emits two tones of carbon per person or less , whereas my country , the united states , emits 20 tones per person – ten times as much .
so it 's not fair to ask india to do the same as the united states in terms of taking leadership .
it is fair to ask india to do something , and to do more than they have been , and i think they 're showing signals that they 're willing to step up to the plate on that , as is china and other countries , but equity is a key part of this .
the third element is that it has to be binding .
it has to be something that is not just a voluntary commitment , but where countries look each other in the eye and say ' we are going to do this , we are going to have a system of verification , a system of compliance , that assures us that each of is doing our part in what we agreed to in copenhagen .
those are the three basic elements – it has to be fair , it has to be ambitious and it has to be binding .
climate change is also on the agenda when the leaders of the group of 20 major economies meet on thursday and friday .
some say the g20 could prove to be an even more important venue to overcome deadlocks between rich nations like the us and developing countries like china … the two issues that are on the agenda here in pittsburgh this week are climate finance .
how do you generate and govern the flows of investment that are needed for clean energy technologies ; reducing the rate of deforestation in tropical rainforest countries ; and for helping the poorest countries adapt to the impacts of climate change .
that 's going to be a big discussion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the g20 be the right venue to broker a compromise ?
the other issue , which the us has put on the agenda , is the issue of fossil fuel subsidies .
it turns out that the world is spending somewhere around 200 billion dollars a year or more encouraging production and consumption on the very things we 're trying to reduce to deal with global warming – that 's coal and oil .
so that topic is on the agenda , we 'll see how far we get with that , that 's obviously a very difficult issue - not only for the united states , but other countries .
it 's very political and there are entrenched interests that benefit from those embedded subsidies and will fight very hard against efforts to reduce or eliminate them .
climate is just one of the topics , but it is the first time that it has been on the agenda in a way like at the g20 and i think that does give us some prospect of movement .
certainly if they do some follow up between pittsburgh and copenhagen and the g20 process , they could help deliver that element of the package on climate finance . interview : nathan witkop editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meyer has testified before congress on global warming and energy issues it is the first time china has made that proposal .
he did not put forward a specific number , and obviously we have to wait to see how aggressive that carbon intensity reduction goal is , but it was a meaningful offer by china.i think that added some momentum coming out of new york , going into pittsburgh and on to copenhagen at the end of the year .
also , japan , the new prime minister there , pledging to increase japan 's greenhouse gas reduction target from the minus eight percent below 1990 levels , pledged by the previous government , to 25 percent below 1990 levels .
of course that 's much more in keeping with the proposal that the european union has put forward and begins to be within the range of what the science says we need to do to get a handle on the problem .
some commentators were quite disappointed with the us position , with obama 's remarks , how did you perceive them ?
i think he said a lot of the right things in terms of the urgency of the problem ; that he gets it on the science ; that the us is committed to do its part on this .
he gave a good overview of all the things he and his administration have done in the eight months since he took office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's un address won a luke warm reception from some observers i think what was disappointing to a lot of observers , and particularly to those from other countries , was that he did n't say very much about the need for the senate in our country to take action on domestic climate legislation in advance of copenhagen .
he did mention that the house has already passed a domestic climate bill and that committees in the senate are starting to consider it , but he did n't lay down the gauntlet and say to the senate ' i really need you to do this by copenhagen so that i can go in there with the credibility of the congressional backing for the position i want to take at that meeting . '
i think people understand the situation he is in .
he is fighting very hard for a domestic health care bill .
they are focused on that like a laser and do n't want to be distracting the senate with talk about other issues , but i think there is more and more impatience on the international scene about the fact that one body of our congress is threatening to hold up the whole process in copenhagen .
two years ago countries agreed to reach a new deal to replace the kyoto protocol by the end of this year , yet negotiations remain about as deadlocked as they have been for the better part of a decade .
how likely is it that we 'll see an agreement at the next big round of negotiations in copenhagen in december – especially given , as you said , that the senate in the us seems to be holding up the process ?
i think there are two big issues here .
one is what the state is of the us domestic debate .
if the president comes to copenhagen with the senate moving forward on climate legislation – with a leadership bill having been introduced and expressions of support – i think he 'll have more credibility .
certainly more than president clinton and vice-president gore did in kyoto when everyone knew that congress was not likely to back what they were putting forward .
the other piece , which is equally daunting frankly , is the issue of climate finance : the roughly 100-150 billion euro-a-year estimates for developing countries for mitigation and adaptation activities on climate change .
and there it 's not just the us , but europe and japan as well which have to do much more to advance that issue before copenhagen .
many of the developing countries have made it clear that if there is not the serious financing and technology package on offer in copenhagen that was promised back in bali two years ago , there 's not going to be a deal from their side .
bildunterschrift : western money to pay for clean development could be a deal-breaker there are still critics who question not only whether an international deal is feasible , but whether it is even desirable .
the controversial danish statistician björn lomborg told deutsche welle this week that cutting emissions was too expensive and ultimately futile .
he said the world would get more bang for its buck by investing in super-projects to pump clouds into the atmosphere to cool the planet .
does lomborg have a point ?
we certainly disagree with his premise that cutting carbon emissions is expensive .
as a matter of fact , my organization just completed an analysis of the us potential for emission reductions showing that we could go far beyond the reductions that the president and the congress are talking about , and that -lrb- we could provide -rrb- savings for consumers .
the reality is , particularly energy efficiency investments pay back very quickly , and then you get benefits from that for years to come .
there are also signals that wind energy and other renewable technologies are coming down in price .
wind is taking off in the united states as it is in other parts of the world , so i fundamentally disagree with the premise that cutting emissions has to be expensive .
yes there is some cost , but it is much less than the cost of damages from climate change that we will see if we do n't take action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish statistician bjorn lomborg says money would be better spent elsewhere when it comes to the issue of geo-engineering , this is obviously something the science community is starting to talk about .
it is very controversial , because obviously these are unproven technologies , and more importantly there could be side-effects from these large-scale geo-engineering schemes that we do n't fully understand .
we 're obviously not doing a very good of regulating the planet with our activities now , and to think that we can have some kind of technical fix that works without some kind of unforeseen side-effect is a little bit of hubris on our part .
so i think there is some interest in exploring some of these options , but i think to hang your whole strategy on that would be a grave mistake .
so what are some of the biggest challenges going to be in securing a good deal at copenhagen at the end of the year ?
indeed , what would amount to a good deal ?
i think what you need for a good deal is something that 's ambitious , that 's in line with what the science says we have to do to bend the emissions curve .
this means we need deeper reductions than what most of the industrialized countries are to date putting on the table .
we also need action by the major developing countries to see a deviation from their business-as-usual growth-path in emissions over the next decade or so , with a view towards eventually having an absolute cap and eventual reduction in their emission later this century .
and we need a substantial financing and technology package to help make those countries make the transition – to basically leap-frog across the way the industrialized countries did their development over the last century , and go right to cleaner technologies .
i think that 's going to be a real challenge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : per capita , indians produce a tenth of the co2 that americans do there also has to be a fair agreement .
it has to recognize the different stages of development that different countries are at ; that acknowledges the fact that a country like india , for example , emits two tones of carbon per person or less , whereas my country , the united states , emits 20 tones per person – ten times as much .
so it 's not fair to ask india to do the same as the united states in terms of taking leadership .
it is fair to ask india to do something , and to do more than they have been , and i think they 're showing signals that they 're willing to step up to the plate on that , as is china and other countries , but equity is a key part of this .
the third element is that it has to be binding .
it has to be something that is not just a voluntary commitment , but where countries look each other in the eye and say ' we are going to do this , we are going to have a system of verification , a system of compliance , that assures us that each of is doing our part in what we agreed to in copenhagen .
those are the three basic elements – it has to be fair , it has to be ambitious and it has to be binding .
climate change is also on the agenda when the leaders of the group of 20 major economies meet on thursday and friday .
some say the g20 could prove to be an even more important venue to overcome deadlocks between rich nations like the us and developing countries like china … the two issues that are on the agenda here in pittsburgh this week are climate finance .
how do you generate and govern the flows of investment that are needed for clean energy technologies ; reducing the rate of deforestation in tropical rainforest countries ; and for helping the poorest countries adapt to the impacts of climate change .
that 's going to be a big discussion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the g20 be the right venue to broker a compromise ?
the other issue , which the us has put on the agenda , is the issue of fossil fuel subsidies .
it turns out that the world is spending somewhere around 200 billion dollars a year or more encouraging production and consumption on the very things we 're trying to reduce to deal with global warming – that 's coal and oil .
so that topic is on the agenda , we 'll see how far we get with that , that 's obviously a very difficult issue - not only for the united states , but other countries .
it 's very political and there are entrenched interests that benefit from those embedded subsidies and will fight very hard against efforts to reduce or eliminate them .
climate is just one of the topics , but it is the first time that it has been on the agenda in a way like at the g20 and i think that does give us some prospect of movement .
certainly if they do some follow up between pittsburgh and copenhagen and the g20 process , they could help deliver that element of the package on climate finance . interview : nathan witkop editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this week witnessed some important meetings for climate negotiations .
world leaders gathered for two high-level conferences in the us .
a leading us scientific advisor gave dw his thoughts on where climate talks stood . alden meyer is director of strategy and policy for the union of concerned scientists – a us organisation which campaigns for tough international action to tackle global warming .
meyer has 30 years experience advising government on environmental and energy issues , and spoke to deutsche welle from the g20 summit in pittsburgh .
he said world leaders made some progress when they met in new york for a special one-day climate summit .
he added that although the united states remains distracted by a struggle over health care reform , the g20 could prove to unblock efforts to get an ambitious agreement at december 's crucial climate conference in copenhagen .

yes there is some cost , but it is much less than the cost of damages from climate change that we will see if we do n't take action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish statistician bjorn lomborg says money would be better spent elsewhere when it comes to the issue of geo-engineering , this is obviously something the science community is starting to talk about .
it is very controversial , because obviously these are unproven technologies , and more importantly there could be side-effects from these large-scale geo-engineering schemes that we do n't fully understand .
we 're obviously not doing a very good of regulating the planet with our activities now , and to think that we can have some kind of technical fix that works without some kind of unforeseen side-effect is a little bit of hubris on our part .
so i think there is some interest in exploring some of these options , but i think to hang your whole strategy on that would be a grave mistake .
so what are some of the biggest challenges going to be in securing a good deal at copenhagen at the end of the year ?
indeed , what would amount to a good deal ?
i think what you need for a good deal is something that 's ambitious , that 's in line with what the science says we have to do to bend the emissions curve .
this means we need deeper reductions than what most of the industrialized countries are to date putting on the table .
we also need action by the major developing countries to see a deviation from their business-as-usual growth-path in emissions over the next decade or so , with a view towards eventually having an absolute cap and eventual reduction in their emission later this century .
and we need a substantial financing and technology package to help make those countries make the transition – to basically leap-frog across the way the industrialized countries did their development over the last century , and go right to cleaner technologies .
i think that 's going to be a real challenge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : per capita , indians produce a tenth of the co2 that americans do there also has to be a fair agreement .
it has to recognize the different stages of development that different countries are at ; that acknowledges the fact that a country like india , for example , emits two tones of carbon per person or less , whereas my country , the united states , emits 20 tones per person – ten times as much .
so it 's not fair to ask india to do the same as the united states in terms of taking leadership .
it is fair to ask india to do something , and to do more than they have been , and i think they 're showing signals that they 're willing to step up to the plate on that , as is china and other countries , but equity is a key part of this .
the third element is that it has to be binding .
it has to be something that is not just a voluntary commitment , but where countries look each other in the eye and say ' we are going to do this , we are going to have a system of verification , a system of compliance , that assures us that each of is doing our part in what we agreed to in copenhagen .
those are the three basic elements – it has to be fair , it has to be ambitious and it has to be binding .
climate change is also on the agenda when the leaders of the group of 20 major economies meet on thursday and friday .
some say the g20 could prove to be an even more important venue to overcome deadlocks between rich nations like the us and developing countries like china … the two issues that are on the agenda here in pittsburgh this week are climate finance .
how do you generate and govern the flows of investment that are needed for clean energy technologies ; reducing the rate of deforestation in tropical rainforest countries ; and for helping the poorest countries adapt to the impacts of climate change .
that 's going to be a big discussion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the g20 be the right venue to broker a compromise ?
the other issue , which the us has put on the agenda , is the issue of fossil fuel subsidies .
it turns out that the world is spending somewhere around 200 billion dollars a year or more encouraging production and consumption on the very things we 're trying to reduce to deal with global warming – that 's coal and oil .
so that topic is on the agenda , we 'll see how far we get with that , that 's obviously a very difficult issue - not only for the united states , but other countries .
it 's very political and there are entrenched interests that benefit from those embedded subsidies and will fight very hard against efforts to reduce or eliminate them .
climate is just one of the topics , but it is the first time that it has been on the agenda in a way like at the g20 and i think that does give us some prospect of movement .
certainly if they do some follow up between pittsburgh and copenhagen and the g20 process , they could help deliver that element of the package on climate finance . interview : nathan witkop editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" fostering a culture of corporate integrity is essential to protect investment , increase commercial success and ensure the stability sought by poor and rich countries alike , particularly as we climb out of an historical crisis , ” said transparency international chair huguette labelle .
the global corruption report documents that in developing and emerging countries , companies paid $ 40 billion -lrb- 27.2 billion euros -rrb- annually in bribes to polticians and government officials .
ultimately it is consumers around the globe who foot the bill .
project costs increase by at least 10 percent , according to a poll of business executives conducted by transparency international .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bribery and corruption are problems in the eurozone corporate integrity " it is not just a question of tackling corruption in business - it is also important for financial and economic stability and the ongoing reforms of the global financial architecture " , the ti report said .
another concern is the sheer economic power of some companies and business sectors , which translates into disproportionate influence on political decision-making .
the report called on companies to publish regular reports on how they are fighting corruption and to disclose information on financial support for political parties , lobbyists and governments .
transparency international also recommended that governments apply anti-corruption regulations with more vigor .
" it is time that corporations face up to the risk of paying millions in fines and the long-term loss of trust from their customers and shareholders " , said labelle .
report discusses siemens , volkswagen scandals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens has now forbidden corrupt practices one of the biggest corruption scandals in recent years in germany involves the electronics giant , siemens .
the ti report reviews the case and lists the heavy fines imposed .
it notes , " with more prosecutions expected , germany 's largest post-war economic scandal is likely to dominate the news for the next few years . "
however , it criticizes germany for not learning from the scandal , noting that one of the former siemens ceos , who was accused of bribery and corruption , was allowed to continue as head of a major government think tank until the institution was dissolved in 2008 .
the report also discusses the more recent vw corruption scandal in which an entire works council accepted large bribes as well as luxury hotel accommodation and , more embarrassingly , visits to brothels to encourage them to accept employer-friendly practices .
indeed , further examples in the report imply that this is one of the major forms of corruption in german society - big business offering inducements to workers ' representatives to push through management decisions , leading to unfair competitive practices to the detriment of the individual employee .
concern remains over tax havens the section of the report concentrating on germany concludes by turning its attention away from big business to wealthy individuals and the widespread use of tax havens such as liechtenstein .
it cites the case of former deutsche post ceo , klaus zumwinkel , who was arrested on charges of evading one million euros in taxes .
as a result , zumwinkel resigned from his post and was later convicted of tax evasion .
that investigation led to the revelation that german officials had spent over four million euros -lrb- $ 6 million -rrb- to obtain information about large sums deposited by wealthy germans in secret bank accounts in liechtenstein .
it 's been argued that the expense was well worthwhile because it 's expected to lead to the recovery of hundreds of millions of euros in back taxes .

this week witnessed some important meetings for climate negotiations .
world leaders gathered for two high-level conferences in the us .
a leading us scientific advisor gave dw his thoughts on where climate talks stood . alden meyer is director of strategy and policy for the union of concerned scientists – a us organisation which campaigns for tough international action to tackle global warming .
meyer has 30 years experience advising government on environmental and energy issues , and spoke to deutsche welle from the g20 summit in pittsburgh .
he said world leaders made some progress when they met in new york for a special one-day climate summit .
he added that although the united states remains distracted by a struggle over health care reform , the g20 could prove to unblock efforts to get an ambitious agreement at december 's crucial climate conference in copenhagen .
deutsche welle : what struck you about world leaders ' addresses on climate change on tuesday ?
alden meyer : one of the significant developments at the special summit on climate change on tuesday was the commitment by chinese president hu jintao that china would put forward a carbon intensity target for china between now and 2020 that is to reduce the emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases as a proportion of their economic output .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meyer has testified before congress on global warming and energy issues it is the first time china has made that proposal .
he did not put forward a specific number , and obviously we have to wait to see how aggressive that carbon intensity reduction goal is , but it was a meaningful offer by china.i think that added some momentum coming out of new york , going into pittsburgh and on to copenhagen at the end of the year .
also , japan , the new prime minister there , pledging to increase japan 's greenhouse gas reduction target from the minus eight percent below 1990 levels , pledged by the previous government , to 25 percent below 1990 levels .
of course that 's much more in keeping with the proposal that the european union has put forward and begins to be within the range of what the science says we need to do to get a handle on the problem .
some commentators were quite disappointed with the us position , with obama 's remarks , how did you perceive them ?
i think he said a lot of the right things in terms of the urgency of the problem ; that he gets it on the science ; that the us is committed to do its part on this .
he gave a good overview of all the things he and his administration have done in the eight months since he took office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's un address won a luke warm reception from some observers i think what was disappointing to a lot of observers , and particularly to those from other countries , was that he did n't say very much about the need for the senate in our country to take action on domestic climate legislation in advance of copenhagen .
he did mention that the house has already passed a domestic climate bill and that committees in the senate are starting to consider it , but he did n't lay down the gauntlet and say to the senate ' i really need you to do this by copenhagen so that i can go in there with the credibility of the congressional backing for the position i want to take at that meeting . '
i think people understand the situation he is in .
he is fighting very hard for a domestic health care bill .
they are focused on that like a laser and do n't want to be distracting the senate with talk about other issues , but i think there is more and more impatience on the international scene about the fact that one body of our congress is threatening to hold up the whole process in copenhagen .
two years ago countries agreed to reach a new deal to replace the kyoto protocol by the end of this year , yet negotiations remain about as deadlocked as they have been for the better part of a decade .
how likely is it that we 'll see an agreement at the next big round of negotiations in copenhagen in december – especially given , as you said , that the senate in the us seems to be holding up the process ?
i think there are two big issues here .
one is what the state is of the us domestic debate .
if the president comes to copenhagen with the senate moving forward on climate legislation – with a leadership bill having been introduced and expressions of support – i think he 'll have more credibility .
certainly more than president clinton and vice-president gore did in kyoto when everyone knew that congress was not likely to back what they were putting forward .
the other piece , which is equally daunting frankly , is the issue of climate finance : the roughly 100-150 billion euro-a-year estimates for developing countries for mitigation and adaptation activities on climate change .
and there it 's not just the us , but europe and japan as well which have to do much more to advance that issue before copenhagen .
many of the developing countries have made it clear that if there is not the serious financing and technology package on offer in copenhagen that was promised back in bali two years ago , there 's not going to be a deal from their side .
bildunterschrift : western money to pay for clean development could be a deal-breaker there are still critics who question not only whether an international deal is feasible , but whether it is even desirable .
the controversial danish statistician björn lomborg told deutsche welle this week that cutting emissions was too expensive and ultimately futile .
he said the world would get more bang for its buck by investing in super-projects to pump clouds into the atmosphere to cool the planet .
does lomborg have a point ?
we certainly disagree with his premise that cutting carbon emissions is expensive .
as a matter of fact , my organization just completed an analysis of the us potential for emission reductions showing that we could go far beyond the reductions that the president and the congress are talking about , and that -lrb- we could provide -rrb- savings for consumers .
the reality is , particularly energy efficiency investments pay back very quickly , and then you get benefits from that for years to come .
there are also signals that wind energy and other renewable technologies are coming down in price .
wind is taking off in the united states as it is in other parts of the world , so i fundamentally disagree with the premise that cutting emissions has to be expensive .
yes there is some cost , but it is much less than the cost of damages from climate change that we will see if we do n't take action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish statistician bjorn lomborg says money would be better spent elsewhere when it comes to the issue of geo-engineering , this is obviously something the science community is starting to talk about .
it is very controversial , because obviously these are unproven technologies , and more importantly there could be side-effects from these large-scale geo-engineering schemes that we do n't fully understand .
we 're obviously not doing a very good of regulating the planet with our activities now , and to think that we can have some kind of technical fix that works without some kind of unforeseen side-effect is a little bit of hubris on our part .
so i think there is some interest in exploring some of these options , but i think to hang your whole strategy on that would be a grave mistake .
so what are some of the biggest challenges going to be in securing a good deal at copenhagen at the end of the year ?
indeed , what would amount to a good deal ?
i think what you need for a good deal is something that 's ambitious , that 's in line with what the science says we have to do to bend the emissions curve .
this means we need deeper reductions than what most of the industrialized countries are to date putting on the table .
we also need action by the major developing countries to see a deviation from their business-as-usual growth-path in emissions over the next decade or so , with a view towards eventually having an absolute cap and eventual reduction in their emission later this century .
and we need a substantial financing and technology package to help make those countries make the transition – to basically leap-frog across the way the industrialized countries did their development over the last century , and go right to cleaner technologies .
i think that 's going to be a real challenge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : per capita , indians produce a tenth of the co2 that americans do there also has to be a fair agreement .
it has to recognize the different stages of development that different countries are at ; that acknowledges the fact that a country like india , for example , emits two tones of carbon per person or less , whereas my country , the united states , emits 20 tones per person – ten times as much .
so it 's not fair to ask india to do the same as the united states in terms of taking leadership .
it is fair to ask india to do something , and to do more than they have been , and i think they 're showing signals that they 're willing to step up to the plate on that , as is china and other countries , but equity is a key part of this .
the third element is that it has to be binding .
it has to be something that is not just a voluntary commitment , but where countries look each other in the eye and say ' we are going to do this , we are going to have a system of verification , a system of compliance , that assures us that each of is doing our part in what we agreed to in copenhagen .
those are the three basic elements – it has to be fair , it has to be ambitious and it has to be binding .
climate change is also on the agenda when the leaders of the group of 20 major economies meet on thursday and friday .
some say the g20 could prove to be an even more important venue to overcome deadlocks between rich nations like the us and developing countries like china … the two issues that are on the agenda here in pittsburgh this week are climate finance .
how do you generate and govern the flows of investment that are needed for clean energy technologies ; reducing the rate of deforestation in tropical rainforest countries ; and for helping the poorest countries adapt to the impacts of climate change .
that 's going to be a big discussion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the g20 be the right venue to broker a compromise ?
the other issue , which the us has put on the agenda , is the issue of fossil fuel subsidies .
it turns out that the world is spending somewhere around 200 billion dollars a year or more encouraging production and consumption on the very things we 're trying to reduce to deal with global warming – that 's coal and oil .
so that topic is on the agenda , we 'll see how far we get with that , that 's obviously a very difficult issue - not only for the united states , but other countries .
it 's very political and there are entrenched interests that benefit from those embedded subsidies and will fight very hard against efforts to reduce or eliminate them .
climate is just one of the topics , but it is the first time that it has been on the agenda in a way like at the g20 and i think that does give us some prospect of movement .
certainly if they do some follow up between pittsburgh and copenhagen and the g20 process , they could help deliver that element of the package on climate finance . interview : nathan witkop editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corruption -pipe- 25.09.2009 watchdog says corruption partly to blame for global financial crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : transparency international is the world 's most important corruption watchdog a new report by corruption watchdog transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- concludes that corrupt business practices cost society billions and preventing sustainable economic growth . in its 2009 global corruption report the berlin-based organization transparency international said corruption undermines fair competition , stifles economic growth and ultimately undercuts a business 's own existence .
" fostering a culture of corporate integrity is essential to protect investment , increase commercial success and ensure the stability sought by poor and rich countries alike , particularly as we climb out of an historical crisis , ” said transparency international chair huguette labelle .
the global corruption report documents that in developing and emerging countries , companies paid $ 40 billion -lrb- 27.2 billion euros -rrb- annually in bribes to polticians and government officials .
ultimately it is consumers around the globe who foot the bill .
project costs increase by at least 10 percent , according to a poll of business executives conducted by transparency international .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bribery and corruption are problems in the eurozone corporate integrity " it is not just a question of tackling corruption in business - it is also important for financial and economic stability and the ongoing reforms of the global financial architecture " , the ti report said .
another concern is the sheer economic power of some companies and business sectors , which translates into disproportionate influence on political decision-making .
the report called on companies to publish regular reports on how they are fighting corruption and to disclose information on financial support for political parties , lobbyists and governments .
transparency international also recommended that governments apply anti-corruption regulations with more vigor .
" it is time that corporations face up to the risk of paying millions in fines and the long-term loss of trust from their customers and shareholders " , said labelle .
report discusses siemens , volkswagen scandals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens has now forbidden corrupt practices one of the biggest corruption scandals in recent years in germany involves the electronics giant , siemens .
the ti report reviews the case and lists the heavy fines imposed .
it notes , " with more prosecutions expected , germany 's largest post-war economic scandal is likely to dominate the news for the next few years . "
however , it criticizes germany for not learning from the scandal , noting that one of the former siemens ceos , who was accused of bribery and corruption , was allowed to continue as head of a major government think tank until the institution was dissolved in 2008 .
the report also discusses the more recent vw corruption scandal in which an entire works council accepted large bribes as well as luxury hotel accommodation and , more embarrassingly , visits to brothels to encourage them to accept employer-friendly practices .
indeed , further examples in the report imply that this is one of the major forms of corruption in german society - big business offering inducements to workers ' representatives to push through management decisions , leading to unfair competitive practices to the detriment of the individual employee .
concern remains over tax havens the section of the report concentrating on germany concludes by turning its attention away from big business to wealthy individuals and the widespread use of tax havens such as liechtenstein .
it cites the case of former deutsche post ceo , klaus zumwinkel , who was arrested on charges of evading one million euros in taxes .
as a result , zumwinkel resigned from his post and was later convicted of tax evasion .
that investigation led to the revelation that german officials had spent over four million euros -lrb- $ 6 million -rrb- to obtain information about large sums deposited by wealthy germans in secret bank accounts in liechtenstein .
it 's been argued that the expense was well worthwhile because it 's expected to lead to the recovery of hundreds of millions of euros in back taxes .
transparency international complains of german inaction germany has been sharply criticized by ti for failing to ratify the un convention against corruption during the last legislative period , failing to introduce a corruption register and for not fulfilling transparency requirements when awarding public sector contracts .
last year germany was listed 14th out of 180 countries in ti 's annual corruption and bribery rankings .

" fostering a culture of corporate integrity is essential to protect investment , increase commercial success and ensure the stability sought by poor and rich countries alike , particularly as we climb out of an historical crisis , ” said transparency international chair huguette labelle .
the global corruption report documents that in developing and emerging countries , companies paid $ 40 billion -lrb- 27.2 billion euros -rrb- annually in bribes to polticians and government officials .
ultimately it is consumers around the globe who foot the bill .
project costs increase by at least 10 percent , according to a poll of business executives conducted by transparency international .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bribery and corruption are problems in the eurozone corporate integrity " it is not just a question of tackling corruption in business - it is also important for financial and economic stability and the ongoing reforms of the global financial architecture " , the ti report said .
another concern is the sheer economic power of some companies and business sectors , which translates into disproportionate influence on political decision-making .
the report called on companies to publish regular reports on how they are fighting corruption and to disclose information on financial support for political parties , lobbyists and governments .
transparency international also recommended that governments apply anti-corruption regulations with more vigor .
" it is time that corporations face up to the risk of paying millions in fines and the long-term loss of trust from their customers and shareholders " , said labelle .
report discusses siemens , volkswagen scandals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens has now forbidden corrupt practices one of the biggest corruption scandals in recent years in germany involves the electronics giant , siemens .
the ti report reviews the case and lists the heavy fines imposed .
it notes , " with more prosecutions expected , germany 's largest post-war economic scandal is likely to dominate the news for the next few years . "
however , it criticizes germany for not learning from the scandal , noting that one of the former siemens ceos , who was accused of bribery and corruption , was allowed to continue as head of a major government think tank until the institution was dissolved in 2008 .
the report also discusses the more recent vw corruption scandal in which an entire works council accepted large bribes as well as luxury hotel accommodation and , more embarrassingly , visits to brothels to encourage them to accept employer-friendly practices .
indeed , further examples in the report imply that this is one of the major forms of corruption in german society - big business offering inducements to workers ' representatives to push through management decisions , leading to unfair competitive practices to the detriment of the individual employee .
concern remains over tax havens the section of the report concentrating on germany concludes by turning its attention away from big business to wealthy individuals and the widespread use of tax havens such as liechtenstein .
it cites the case of former deutsche post ceo , klaus zumwinkel , who was arrested on charges of evading one million euros in taxes .
as a result , zumwinkel resigned from his post and was later convicted of tax evasion .
that investigation led to the revelation that german officials had spent over four million euros -lrb- $ 6 million -rrb- to obtain information about large sums deposited by wealthy germans in secret bank accounts in liechtenstein .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 25.09.2009 fraud , corruption and espionage on the rise at german firms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two-thirds of corporate crime is committed by top and middle managers damages from white-collar crime at large german companies have almost tripled in recent years , according to a new study released this week .
more and more of the criminals are coming from the ranks of management . white-collar crime in germany has exploded in severity , the consulting firm pricewaterhousecoopers -lrb- pwc -rrb- said thursday , with over 60 percent of german companies reporting cases of industrial espionage , corruption and other offenses .
firms expect crime to worsen as a weak economy makes competition tougher and workers unhappier .
the average cost to a firm per incident has risen from 1.47 million euros four years ago to nearly 4.3 million euros today .
" the direct costs of crime are only the tip of the iceberg , " said pwc partner and former prosecutor steffem salvenmoser .
" above all , the reputational damage to a firm in cases of corruption , data theft or price-fixing is often greater than the measurable financial losses . "
the study 's results are based on a survey of 500 large german companies conducted by pwc in spring of 2009 , after the german economy sank into its deepest recession in over 60 years , propelled in part by the worldwide financial crisis .
over 40 percent of the surveyed firms expect competitors to use espionage or anti-competitive practices such as cartels to gain an advantage in a tough economic climate .
over a third of the companies expected workers to steal from their employers as concerns about holding onto jobs mounts .
crime from the corner office bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only 50 percent of managers accused of criminal deeds are prosecuted over 70 percent of the perpetrators were caught thanks to tipsters , the study said , despite increased investment in internal control measures designed to detect theft and fraud .
those results suggest that preventive measures have little effect according to professor kai bussmann from the martin luther university in halle , who worked on the study .
further tainting a company 's reputation is the finding that the perpetrators often come from the ranks of management .
the study said 29 percent were executives from the very top of the company 's leadership and 38 percent were middle managers .
many perpetrators were long time employees , 45 percent with more than ten years of tenure with the company and over 90 percent were men .
strikingly , despite the size and nature of the crimes , firms pressed charges against malfeasant managers just 50 percent of the time , compared to 61 percent in the pwc 's last survey in 2007 .
one fifth of the top managers who took part in crimes against their employers received no punishment whatsoever .
" although the relative leniency against perpetrators from the leadership level can be explained by the particular legal and factual difficulties of individual cases this practice is extremely problematic from vantage point of the credibility and leadership of management , " salvenmoser said. bn / ap / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de latin america -pipe- 25.09.2009 brazil shows south american neighbors how to trade with africa großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's president lula da silva has increased trade with africa one goal of the second south america-africa summit this weekend in venezuela is to increase cooperation between the continents .
most countries could learn a lesson or two on how to do that from brazil . a new geography of international trade called " south-south " - that is the ambitious goal of brazilian president luiz inácio “ lula ” da silva .
the former trade union leader wants to better connect his country with other developing and emerging nations , a vision he already announced back in 2004 at a un trade conference in sao paulo .
while he wanted to continue to export to industrial nations , he also emphasized that he was looking for new opportunities .
" we want to foster partnerships , which enable better cooperation between the economies of the south , " lula said .
that strategy seems to work .
today brazil sells more goods to developing and emerging countries than to countries in the northern hemisphere .
china has become brazil 's third largest trade partner , after the us , and close behind neighboring argentina .
aside from china , brazilian companies have increasingly focused on africa , a continent , which in the past was regarded mainly as the home of former slaves .
lula himself already has travelled to africa eleven times and does n't get tired of repeating that brazil is home to the largest population of african descent outside of africa .
the official export agency apex has also intensified its efforts and earlier this month a delegation of brazilian businessmen visited south africa .
maurício manfré , who leads the project within apex , does n't view himself merely as a representative of brazilian companies .
he is also on the look out for products , which he can import .
" we want to expand and intensify this relationship , " he says .
rapid increase in exports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angola is brasil 's number one african trading partner in the past ten years brazilian exports to sub-saharan africa have increased almost eightfold .
last year they reached more than ten billion us dollars , five percent of all brazilian exports .
angola was brazil 's number one export destination with two billion us dollars , followed by south africa with 1.8 billion dollars and nigeria with 1.5 billion dollars respectively .
especially in the midst of the global financial and economic crisis new markets in africa are more than welcome , says jorge duarte de oliveira , the director of exportaminas , the export agency of the south eastern brazilian state of minas gerais : " the emerging countries have suffered considerably less from the international crisis , " he explains .
" they offer very attractive markets to small companies , which produce consumer goods here in brazil for the middle and lower class . "
jorge duarte de oliveira is convinced that those smaller brazilian producers will find the same kind of customers in africa and the middle east .
wide range of brasilian exports to africa while two thirds of chinese imports from brazil are commodities like soy and iron ore and bejing has little interest in industrial products , brazil 's range of exports to africa is more diverse .
only one third are commodities , two thirds consist of assembled products , from textiles and furniture to agricultural machines .
" africa has n't been able yet to develop its own industries .
that 's why the africans buy a large part of brazil 's industrial exports , " says carlos abijaodi , a trade expert with the industrial association of the federal state of minas gerais .
that is the reason why brazil 's range of products is broad , he explains brazil is also closely related to africa , adds abijaodi and says that he noticed that through his international contacts .
" they have similar customs and in the portuguese speaking countries in africa like angola and mozambique we share the same language . "
brazilian multinationals invest billions in africa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mozambique could also see a surge in brazilian investments brazil 's most important trading partner in africa is angola .
the oil-rich country which boasted double-digit growth rates in recent years has attracted investments by many brazilian companies .
petrobrás , the state-run oil concern , is surveying angola 's coast for possible oil fields while construction firm odebrecht maintains roads and brazilian conglomerate camargo corrêa builds a 370 million dollar cement plant in angola .
but in the near future , mozambique , africa 's most populous portuguese speaking country , is likely to also become more attractive for brazil .
vale , the leading brazilian mining company , invests 1.3 billion dollars there to exploit coal near moatize in central mozambique .
moatize is considered to be one of the largest unexploited coal reserves in the world .
it could provide high quality coal for more than a hundred years .

it 's been argued that the expense was well worthwhile because it 's expected to lead to the recovery of hundreds of millions of euros in back taxes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 25.09.2009 fraud , corruption and espionage on the rise at german firms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two-thirds of corporate crime is committed by top and middle managers damages from white-collar crime at large german companies have almost tripled in recent years , according to a new study released this week .
more and more of the criminals are coming from the ranks of management . white-collar crime in germany has exploded in severity , the consulting firm pricewaterhousecoopers -lrb- pwc -rrb- said thursday , with over 60 percent of german companies reporting cases of industrial espionage , corruption and other offenses .
firms expect crime to worsen as a weak economy makes competition tougher and workers unhappier .
the average cost to a firm per incident has risen from 1.47 million euros four years ago to nearly 4.3 million euros today .
" the direct costs of crime are only the tip of the iceberg , " said pwc partner and former prosecutor steffem salvenmoser .
" above all , the reputational damage to a firm in cases of corruption , data theft or price-fixing is often greater than the measurable financial losses . "
the study 's results are based on a survey of 500 large german companies conducted by pwc in spring of 2009 , after the german economy sank into its deepest recession in over 60 years , propelled in part by the worldwide financial crisis .
over 40 percent of the surveyed firms expect competitors to use espionage or anti-competitive practices such as cartels to gain an advantage in a tough economic climate .
over a third of the companies expected workers to steal from their employers as concerns about holding onto jobs mounts .
crime from the corner office bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only 50 percent of managers accused of criminal deeds are prosecuted over 70 percent of the perpetrators were caught thanks to tipsters , the study said , despite increased investment in internal control measures designed to detect theft and fraud .
those results suggest that preventive measures have little effect according to professor kai bussmann from the martin luther university in halle , who worked on the study .
further tainting a company 's reputation is the finding that the perpetrators often come from the ranks of management .
the study said 29 percent were executives from the very top of the company 's leadership and 38 percent were middle managers .
many perpetrators were long time employees , 45 percent with more than ten years of tenure with the company and over 90 percent were men .
strikingly , despite the size and nature of the crimes , firms pressed charges against malfeasant managers just 50 percent of the time , compared to 61 percent in the pwc 's last survey in 2007 .
one fifth of the top managers who took part in crimes against their employers received no punishment whatsoever .
" although the relative leniency against perpetrators from the leadership level can be explained by the particular legal and factual difficulties of individual cases this practice is extremely problematic from vantage point of the credibility and leadership of management , " salvenmoser said. bn / ap / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world war ii -pipe- 25.09.2009 70 years on , polish resolution condemns crimes under stalin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's resolution condemns crimes from the era of josef stalin at the beginning of world war ii , the soviet invasion of poland led to massive loss of life in prison camps and massacres .
a new resolution from the polish parliament condemns the invasion - and irks russia . a resolution unanimously approved by the polish parliament this week condemns the soviet invasion of eastern poland in 1939 .
the resolution referred to a series of massacres of poles in russia , as well as mass deportations of over one million poles to siberia .
poland also called on russia to condemn the crimes .
sixteen days after poland was invaded by nazi germany on sept .
1 , 1939 , troops under soviet dictator josef stalin were sent into eastern poland .
a year later , a soviet-led massacre in the katyn forest left over 20,000 polish officers and intellectuals dead .
angry reactions from moscow the response from russia warned that the polish resolution , which said the stalin-era crimes amount to genocide , was a set-back to improving ties between russia and poland .
" the resolution adopted by the parliament deals a serious blow to efforts to develop normal neighborly relations between our countries , " the russian foreign ministry said in a statement , adding that the resolution was " tendentious and politicized . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bronislaw komorowski says russia has trouble dealing with its past polish parliamentary speaker bronislaw komorowski said russia 's reaction indicates the country is still coming to grips with its past .
" the fact that russia has reacted so nervously to a resolution that has nothing to do with present-day foreign policy is a sign that it is still unable to come to terms with its own history , " komorowski said .
tense relationship with history while the resolution brought a seventy-year old conflict to the forefront , both countries have previously had difficulty in addressing their shared history .
another contentious issue is the non-aggression pact signed between the soviets and the nazis on the eve of world war ii .
during a visit to poland by russian prime minister vladimir putin a few days before the resolution passed , putin made a surprising departure from russia 's previous attitude towards the pact by calling the document " immoral . "
many had hoped putin 's visit marked an improvement in frosty polish-russian relations of the past few years .
but according to commentators , poland and russia appear to have wasted an opportunity on the 70th anniversary of the outbreak of world war ii to use memories of their joint struggle against the nazis to bring them together – and instead decided to dwell on the past to cultivate their differences .

" fostering a culture of corporate integrity is essential to protect investment , increase commercial success and ensure the stability sought by poor and rich countries alike , particularly as we climb out of an historical crisis , ” said transparency international chair huguette labelle .
the global corruption report documents that in developing and emerging countries , companies paid $ 40 billion -lrb- 27.2 billion euros -rrb- annually in bribes to polticians and government officials .
ultimately it is consumers around the globe who foot the bill .
project costs increase by at least 10 percent , according to a poll of business executives conducted by transparency international .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bribery and corruption are problems in the eurozone corporate integrity " it is not just a question of tackling corruption in business - it is also important for financial and economic stability and the ongoing reforms of the global financial architecture " , the ti report said .
another concern is the sheer economic power of some companies and business sectors , which translates into disproportionate influence on political decision-making .
the report called on companies to publish regular reports on how they are fighting corruption and to disclose information on financial support for political parties , lobbyists and governments .
transparency international also recommended that governments apply anti-corruption regulations with more vigor .
" it is time that corporations face up to the risk of paying millions in fines and the long-term loss of trust from their customers and shareholders " , said labelle .
report discusses siemens , volkswagen scandals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens has now forbidden corrupt practices one of the biggest corruption scandals in recent years in germany involves the electronics giant , siemens .
the ti report reviews the case and lists the heavy fines imposed .
it notes , " with more prosecutions expected , germany 's largest post-war economic scandal is likely to dominate the news for the next few years . "
however , it criticizes germany for not learning from the scandal , noting that one of the former siemens ceos , who was accused of bribery and corruption , was allowed to continue as head of a major government think tank until the institution was dissolved in 2008 .
the report also discusses the more recent vw corruption scandal in which an entire works council accepted large bribes as well as luxury hotel accommodation and , more embarrassingly , visits to brothels to encourage them to accept employer-friendly practices .
indeed , further examples in the report imply that this is one of the major forms of corruption in german society - big business offering inducements to workers ' representatives to push through management decisions , leading to unfair competitive practices to the detriment of the individual employee .
concern remains over tax havens the section of the report concentrating on germany concludes by turning its attention away from big business to wealthy individuals and the widespread use of tax havens such as liechtenstein .
it cites the case of former deutsche post ceo , klaus zumwinkel , who was arrested on charges of evading one million euros in taxes .
as a result , zumwinkel resigned from his post and was later convicted of tax evasion .
that investigation led to the revelation that german officials had spent over four million euros -lrb- $ 6 million -rrb- to obtain information about large sums deposited by wealthy germans in secret bank accounts in liechtenstein .
it 's been argued that the expense was well worthwhile because it 's expected to lead to the recovery of hundreds of millions of euros in back taxes .
transparency international complains of german inaction germany has been sharply criticized by ti for failing to ratify the un convention against corruption during the last legislative period , failing to introduce a corruption register and for not fulfilling transparency requirements when awarding public sector contracts .
last year germany was listed 14th out of 180 countries in ti 's annual corruption and bribery rankings .

this week witnessed some important meetings for climate negotiations .
world leaders gathered for two high-level conferences in the us .
a leading us scientific advisor gave dw his thoughts on where climate talks stood . alden meyer is director of strategy and policy for the union of concerned scientists – a us organisation which campaigns for tough international action to tackle global warming .
meyer has 30 years experience advising government on environmental and energy issues , and spoke to deutsche welle from the g20 summit in pittsburgh .
he said world leaders made some progress when they met in new york for a special one-day climate summit .
he added that although the united states remains distracted by a struggle over health care reform , the g20 could prove to unblock efforts to get an ambitious agreement at december 's crucial climate conference in copenhagen .
deutsche welle : what struck you about world leaders ' addresses on climate change on tuesday ?
alden meyer : one of the significant developments at the special summit on climate change on tuesday was the commitment by chinese president hu jintao that china would put forward a carbon intensity target for china between now and 2020 that is to reduce the emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases as a proportion of their economic output .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meyer has testified before congress on global warming and energy issues it is the first time china has made that proposal .
he did not put forward a specific number , and obviously we have to wait to see how aggressive that carbon intensity reduction goal is , but it was a meaningful offer by china.i think that added some momentum coming out of new york , going into pittsburgh and on to copenhagen at the end of the year .
also , japan , the new prime minister there , pledging to increase japan 's greenhouse gas reduction target from the minus eight percent below 1990 levels , pledged by the previous government , to 25 percent below 1990 levels .
of course that 's much more in keeping with the proposal that the european union has put forward and begins to be within the range of what the science says we need to do to get a handle on the problem .
some commentators were quite disappointed with the us position , with obama 's remarks , how did you perceive them ?
i think he said a lot of the right things in terms of the urgency of the problem ; that he gets it on the science ; that the us is committed to do its part on this .
he gave a good overview of all the things he and his administration have done in the eight months since he took office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's un address won a luke warm reception from some observers i think what was disappointing to a lot of observers , and particularly to those from other countries , was that he did n't say very much about the need for the senate in our country to take action on domestic climate legislation in advance of copenhagen .
he did mention that the house has already passed a domestic climate bill and that committees in the senate are starting to consider it , but he did n't lay down the gauntlet and say to the senate ' i really need you to do this by copenhagen so that i can go in there with the credibility of the congressional backing for the position i want to take at that meeting . '
i think people understand the situation he is in .
he is fighting very hard for a domestic health care bill .
they are focused on that like a laser and do n't want to be distracting the senate with talk about other issues , but i think there is more and more impatience on the international scene about the fact that one body of our congress is threatening to hold up the whole process in copenhagen .
two years ago countries agreed to reach a new deal to replace the kyoto protocol by the end of this year , yet negotiations remain about as deadlocked as they have been for the better part of a decade .
how likely is it that we 'll see an agreement at the next big round of negotiations in copenhagen in december – especially given , as you said , that the senate in the us seems to be holding up the process ?
i think there are two big issues here .
one is what the state is of the us domestic debate .
if the president comes to copenhagen with the senate moving forward on climate legislation – with a leadership bill having been introduced and expressions of support – i think he 'll have more credibility .
certainly more than president clinton and vice-president gore did in kyoto when everyone knew that congress was not likely to back what they were putting forward .
the other piece , which is equally daunting frankly , is the issue of climate finance : the roughly 100-150 billion euro-a-year estimates for developing countries for mitigation and adaptation activities on climate change .
and there it 's not just the us , but europe and japan as well which have to do much more to advance that issue before copenhagen .
many of the developing countries have made it clear that if there is not the serious financing and technology package on offer in copenhagen that was promised back in bali two years ago , there 's not going to be a deal from their side .
bildunterschrift : western money to pay for clean development could be a deal-breaker there are still critics who question not only whether an international deal is feasible , but whether it is even desirable .
the controversial danish statistician björn lomborg told deutsche welle this week that cutting emissions was too expensive and ultimately futile .
he said the world would get more bang for its buck by investing in super-projects to pump clouds into the atmosphere to cool the planet .
does lomborg have a point ?
we certainly disagree with his premise that cutting carbon emissions is expensive .
as a matter of fact , my organization just completed an analysis of the us potential for emission reductions showing that we could go far beyond the reductions that the president and the congress are talking about , and that -lrb- we could provide -rrb- savings for consumers .
the reality is , particularly energy efficiency investments pay back very quickly , and then you get benefits from that for years to come .
there are also signals that wind energy and other renewable technologies are coming down in price .
wind is taking off in the united states as it is in other parts of the world , so i fundamentally disagree with the premise that cutting emissions has to be expensive .
yes there is some cost , but it is much less than the cost of damages from climate change that we will see if we do n't take action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish statistician bjorn lomborg says money would be better spent elsewhere when it comes to the issue of geo-engineering , this is obviously something the science community is starting to talk about .
it is very controversial , because obviously these are unproven technologies , and more importantly there could be side-effects from these large-scale geo-engineering schemes that we do n't fully understand .
we 're obviously not doing a very good of regulating the planet with our activities now , and to think that we can have some kind of technical fix that works without some kind of unforeseen side-effect is a little bit of hubris on our part .
so i think there is some interest in exploring some of these options , but i think to hang your whole strategy on that would be a grave mistake .
so what are some of the biggest challenges going to be in securing a good deal at copenhagen at the end of the year ?
indeed , what would amount to a good deal ?
i think what you need for a good deal is something that 's ambitious , that 's in line with what the science says we have to do to bend the emissions curve .
this means we need deeper reductions than what most of the industrialized countries are to date putting on the table .
we also need action by the major developing countries to see a deviation from their business-as-usual growth-path in emissions over the next decade or so , with a view towards eventually having an absolute cap and eventual reduction in their emission later this century .
and we need a substantial financing and technology package to help make those countries make the transition – to basically leap-frog across the way the industrialized countries did their development over the last century , and go right to cleaner technologies .
i think that 's going to be a real challenge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : per capita , indians produce a tenth of the co2 that americans do there also has to be a fair agreement .
it has to recognize the different stages of development that different countries are at ; that acknowledges the fact that a country like india , for example , emits two tones of carbon per person or less , whereas my country , the united states , emits 20 tones per person – ten times as much .
so it 's not fair to ask india to do the same as the united states in terms of taking leadership .
it is fair to ask india to do something , and to do more than they have been , and i think they 're showing signals that they 're willing to step up to the plate on that , as is china and other countries , but equity is a key part of this .
the third element is that it has to be binding .
it has to be something that is not just a voluntary commitment , but where countries look each other in the eye and say ' we are going to do this , we are going to have a system of verification , a system of compliance , that assures us that each of is doing our part in what we agreed to in copenhagen .
those are the three basic elements – it has to be fair , it has to be ambitious and it has to be binding .
climate change is also on the agenda when the leaders of the group of 20 major economies meet on thursday and friday .
some say the g20 could prove to be an even more important venue to overcome deadlocks between rich nations like the us and developing countries like china … the two issues that are on the agenda here in pittsburgh this week are climate finance .
how do you generate and govern the flows of investment that are needed for clean energy technologies ; reducing the rate of deforestation in tropical rainforest countries ; and for helping the poorest countries adapt to the impacts of climate change .
that 's going to be a big discussion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the g20 be the right venue to broker a compromise ?
the other issue , which the us has put on the agenda , is the issue of fossil fuel subsidies .
it turns out that the world is spending somewhere around 200 billion dollars a year or more encouraging production and consumption on the very things we 're trying to reduce to deal with global warming – that 's coal and oil .
so that topic is on the agenda , we 'll see how far we get with that , that 's obviously a very difficult issue - not only for the united states , but other countries .
it 's very political and there are entrenched interests that benefit from those embedded subsidies and will fight very hard against efforts to reduce or eliminate them .
climate is just one of the topics , but it is the first time that it has been on the agenda in a way like at the g20 and i think that does give us some prospect of movement .
certainly if they do some follow up between pittsburgh and copenhagen and the g20 process , they could help deliver that element of the package on climate finance . interview : nathan witkop editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" fostering a culture of corporate integrity is essential to protect investment , increase commercial success and ensure the stability sought by poor and rich countries alike , particularly as we climb out of an historical crisis , ” said transparency international chair huguette labelle .
the global corruption report documents that in developing and emerging countries , companies paid $ 40 billion -lrb- 27.2 billion euros -rrb- annually in bribes to polticians and government officials .
ultimately it is consumers around the globe who foot the bill .
project costs increase by at least 10 percent , according to a poll of business executives conducted by transparency international .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bribery and corruption are problems in the eurozone corporate integrity " it is not just a question of tackling corruption in business - it is also important for financial and economic stability and the ongoing reforms of the global financial architecture " , the ti report said .
another concern is the sheer economic power of some companies and business sectors , which translates into disproportionate influence on political decision-making .
the report called on companies to publish regular reports on how they are fighting corruption and to disclose information on financial support for political parties , lobbyists and governments .
transparency international also recommended that governments apply anti-corruption regulations with more vigor .
" it is time that corporations face up to the risk of paying millions in fines and the long-term loss of trust from their customers and shareholders " , said labelle .
report discusses siemens , volkswagen scandals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens has now forbidden corrupt practices one of the biggest corruption scandals in recent years in germany involves the electronics giant , siemens .
the ti report reviews the case and lists the heavy fines imposed .
it notes , " with more prosecutions expected , germany 's largest post-war economic scandal is likely to dominate the news for the next few years . "
however , it criticizes germany for not learning from the scandal , noting that one of the former siemens ceos , who was accused of bribery and corruption , was allowed to continue as head of a major government think tank until the institution was dissolved in 2008 .
the report also discusses the more recent vw corruption scandal in which an entire works council accepted large bribes as well as luxury hotel accommodation and , more embarrassingly , visits to brothels to encourage them to accept employer-friendly practices .
indeed , further examples in the report imply that this is one of the major forms of corruption in german society - big business offering inducements to workers ' representatives to push through management decisions , leading to unfair competitive practices to the detriment of the individual employee .
concern remains over tax havens the section of the report concentrating on germany concludes by turning its attention away from big business to wealthy individuals and the widespread use of tax havens such as liechtenstein .
it cites the case of former deutsche post ceo , klaus zumwinkel , who was arrested on charges of evading one million euros in taxes .
as a result , zumwinkel resigned from his post and was later convicted of tax evasion .
that investigation led to the revelation that german officials had spent over four million euros -lrb- $ 6 million -rrb- to obtain information about large sums deposited by wealthy germans in secret bank accounts in liechtenstein .
it 's been argued that the expense was well worthwhile because it 's expected to lead to the recovery of hundreds of millions of euros in back taxes .
transparency international complains of german inaction germany has been sharply criticized by ti for failing to ratify the un convention against corruption during the last legislative period , failing to introduce a corruption register and for not fulfilling transparency requirements when awarding public sector contracts .
last year germany was listed 14th out of 180 countries in ti 's annual corruption and bribery rankings .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de latin america -pipe- 25.09.2009 brazil shows south american neighbors how to trade with africa großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's president lula da silva has increased trade with africa one goal of the second south america-africa summit this weekend in venezuela is to increase cooperation between the continents .
most countries could learn a lesson or two on how to do that from brazil . a new geography of international trade called " south-south " - that is the ambitious goal of brazilian president luiz inácio “ lula ” da silva .
the former trade union leader wants to better connect his country with other developing and emerging nations , a vision he already announced back in 2004 at a un trade conference in sao paulo .
while he wanted to continue to export to industrial nations , he also emphasized that he was looking for new opportunities .
" we want to foster partnerships , which enable better cooperation between the economies of the south , " lula said .
that strategy seems to work .
today brazil sells more goods to developing and emerging countries than to countries in the northern hemisphere .
china has become brazil 's third largest trade partner , after the us , and close behind neighboring argentina .
aside from china , brazilian companies have increasingly focused on africa , a continent , which in the past was regarded mainly as the home of former slaves .
lula himself already has travelled to africa eleven times and does n't get tired of repeating that brazil is home to the largest population of african descent outside of africa .
the official export agency apex has also intensified its efforts and earlier this month a delegation of brazilian businessmen visited south africa .
maurício manfré , who leads the project within apex , does n't view himself merely as a representative of brazilian companies .
he is also on the look out for products , which he can import .
" we want to expand and intensify this relationship , " he says .
rapid increase in exports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angola is brasil 's number one african trading partner in the past ten years brazilian exports to sub-saharan africa have increased almost eightfold .
last year they reached more than ten billion us dollars , five percent of all brazilian exports .
angola was brazil 's number one export destination with two billion us dollars , followed by south africa with 1.8 billion dollars and nigeria with 1.5 billion dollars respectively .
especially in the midst of the global financial and economic crisis new markets in africa are more than welcome , says jorge duarte de oliveira , the director of exportaminas , the export agency of the south eastern brazilian state of minas gerais : " the emerging countries have suffered considerably less from the international crisis , " he explains .
" they offer very attractive markets to small companies , which produce consumer goods here in brazil for the middle and lower class . "
jorge duarte de oliveira is convinced that those smaller brazilian producers will find the same kind of customers in africa and the middle east .
wide range of brasilian exports to africa while two thirds of chinese imports from brazil are commodities like soy and iron ore and bejing has little interest in industrial products , brazil 's range of exports to africa is more diverse .
only one third are commodities , two thirds consist of assembled products , from textiles and furniture to agricultural machines .
" africa has n't been able yet to develop its own industries .
that 's why the africans buy a large part of brazil 's industrial exports , " says carlos abijaodi , a trade expert with the industrial association of the federal state of minas gerais .
that is the reason why brazil 's range of products is broad , he explains brazil is also closely related to africa , adds abijaodi and says that he noticed that through his international contacts .
" they have similar customs and in the portuguese speaking countries in africa like angola and mozambique we share the same language . "
brazilian multinationals invest billions in africa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mozambique could also see a surge in brazilian investments brazil 's most important trading partner in africa is angola .
the oil-rich country which boasted double-digit growth rates in recent years has attracted investments by many brazilian companies .
petrobrás , the state-run oil concern , is surveying angola 's coast for possible oil fields while construction firm odebrecht maintains roads and brazilian conglomerate camargo corrêa builds a 370 million dollar cement plant in angola .
but in the near future , mozambique , africa 's most populous portuguese speaking country , is likely to also become more attractive for brazil .
vale , the leading brazilian mining company , invests 1.3 billion dollars there to exploit coal near moatize in central mozambique .
moatize is considered to be one of the largest unexploited coal reserves in the world .
it could provide high quality coal for more than a hundred years .

the video was produced by t-online 's wahlzeit.tv website , after steini-girl offered them the song she wrote together with a friend .
" she just thinks he 's a really nice guy , " wahlzeit spokesman bjoern akstinat said .
steini-girl , whose real name is being kept secret , said her main aim " is to get people voting on sunday , and maybe i 'll get a few lucrative jobs out of it too . "
ironic love declaration in the video , steini-girl dances in front of the various seats of federal government in berlin , including the reichstag and the chancellery , wearing not many clothes and kissing pictures of social democrat chancellor candidate frank-walter steinmeier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's chances against chancellor merkel this sunday are thought to be slim the song itself is mainly an ironic love declaration to steinmeier , described in the lyrics as " coiled masculinity " , while his chief opponent in the election chancellor angela merkel is dismissed as " too masculine " .
the song also deems free liberal party leader guido westerwelle " too feminine " and prominent left party politician gregor gysi " too small " .
steini-girl is consciously based on obama girl , a similar viral video song performed by model amber lee ettinger , which was massively successful in the united states during the 2008 presidential election campaign .
obama girl has attracted over 15 million clicks on youtube to date , and made a minor celebrity of ettinger .
" my friend was in the usa last year when obama girl was totally popular , and she thought we should do that , so we just messed around and made a few rhymes , the way you do , " she told bild .

however , times are changing , and tax evaders from abroad will have to be more careful in future . switzerland has paved the way to be dropped from a so-called grey list of uncooperative tax havens , after signing a necessary 12th new bilateral taxation agreement with qatar .
swiss president hans-rudolf merz signed the treaty with qatar 's prime minister sheikh hamad bin jassim bin jabr al-thani on the sidelines of the un general assembly in new york late on thursday .

they presented their produce in italy this year and swapped knowledge with italian farmers . leaving the arid plains of west pokot in kenya for the rolling green hills of piedmont in northern italy , four goat- and cow-herders from the terzoi tribe were among the special guests at cheese 2009 . it is the slow food movement 's biennial fair aimed at protecting and preserving traditional dairy products . the kenyans were presenting their unique yogurt , fermented in colorful hollowed gourds .
what makes it special is ash – made from burning branches of the local cromwo tree – that 's added to it as a disinfectant and preservative , giving it a distinctive aromatic flavor and speckled grey color . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional terzoi yoghurt is fermented in gourds the community is very poor : they live in mud and straw huts , their animals graze freely , and they do n't have any dairy facilities .
but , thanks to slow food 's interest in their product , these farmers have had the opportunity to leave their country for the first time and discover first-hand the techniques and traditions of their italian counterparts . a great exchange of skills " it has been a phenomenal learning experience , for both the kenyans and the farmers in italy . " said peter namianya , a kenyan graduate from the university of gastronomy in piedmont , who coordinated the trip . " when the terzoi saw the italian goats they exclaimed ' oh , they 're the size of my cows ! ' , and everybody laughed . "
the kenyan goat and cow herders and their italian counterparts discovered they have a lot in common . the time spent with local dairy farmers , cheese-makers and vets was a real cultural exchange .
" one of them would say , ' back home we do it like this ' , and the other would reply , ' here you do it like this . " kenyans and italians discover how much they have in common bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kenyan cattleherders inspecting italian stables the group spent two and a half days on mario gala 's farm , where he taught them how to improve their hygiene standards and look after their animals ' health . " i think the shepherds from kenya are more similar to me than any italian bank employee ! " , laughed mario gala , " we are the same people .
our day is the same , we pay attention to the seasons , the rain , the pasturing , the good health of our animals , my cheese , their yogurt . " gala 's kenyan visitors were equally enthusiastic .
" there are some things that we have not done well , like milking and cleaning , and we are going to improve our standards , " said simon pkite lochawan .
the group was clearly impressed by the high importance put on hygiene in the stables and the quality of animal fodder in italy . learning the art of cheese making bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a cross-cultural culinary encounter one of the most exciting and precious skills the kenyans have learned is the art of cheese-making .
for countless generations , the terzoi have been making butter and their unusual yogurt , but they 've never turned their milk into cheese .
although you can buy imported cheeses at supermarkets in kenya 's big cities , farmers have no cheesemaking traditions of their own . " they do n't have a culture of cheese but they want to try to make it when they go back home , " said peter namianya .
he added that this is a unique way of conserving milk , instead of just making yogurt and drinking fresh milk . this could also become another way of reducing hunger in the community . " if there is abundant milk , they can make cheese and store it and then use it in a time when there 's no food . " praise for traditional kenyan yoghurt pkite and his colleagues have enjoyed the opportunity to try so many different varieties of cheese at the slow food fair .
they especially like the taste of soft cheeses like ricotta , and are looking forward to experimenting with their own milk when they get back .
the positive reactions to their yoghurt have also made them realize the value of their own traditional product . the kenyans ' visit has also inspired the curiosity of their italian hosts , who are now keen to experience everyday life in west pokot . namianya already envisions a kind of eco-tourism : " you go to the village , taste their food and taste the real culture of the people .

however , times are changing , and tax evaders from abroad will have to be more careful in future . switzerland has paved the way to be dropped from a so-called grey list of uncooperative tax havens , after signing a necessary 12th new bilateral taxation agreement with qatar .
swiss president hans-rudolf merz signed the treaty with qatar 's prime minister sheikh hamad bin jassim bin jabr al-thani on the sidelines of the un general assembly in new york late on thursday .
the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- demands that countries listed on the grey list sign at least 12 bilateral tax cooperation treaties before they lose that stigma .
switzerland has also signed deals with norway , denmark , finland , the faroe islands , great britain , france , luxembourg , austria , mexico , spain and the united states .
however , oecd head , angel guerria , stressed that switzerland not only had to sign agreements but also work toward " effective implementation . "
the alpine state , which has faced strong international pressure to join the global hunt for tax evaders , caved in earlier this year , saying it would improve cooperation with foreign tax authorities . however , the swiss government emphasized that banking secrecy would be maintained as long as no tax offences were committed .
" banking secrecy offers no protection in the case of tax offences .
as a result of the globalization of financial markets and particularly against the backdrop of the financial crisis , international cooperation in the area of taxes has grown in importance , " the swiss federal department of finance said in a statement upon completion of the 12th deal. nk / dpa / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this week witnessed some important meetings for climate negotiations .
world leaders gathered for two high-level conferences in the us .
a leading us scientific advisor gave dw his thoughts on where climate talks stood . alden meyer is director of strategy and policy for the union of concerned scientists – a us organisation which campaigns for tough international action to tackle global warming .
meyer has 30 years experience advising government on environmental and energy issues , and spoke to deutsche welle from the g20 summit in pittsburgh .
he said world leaders made some progress when they met in new york for a special one-day climate summit .
he added that although the united states remains distracted by a struggle over health care reform , the g20 could prove to unblock efforts to get an ambitious agreement at december 's crucial climate conference in copenhagen .
deutsche welle : what struck you about world leaders ' addresses on climate change on tuesday ?
alden meyer : one of the significant developments at the special summit on climate change on tuesday was the commitment by chinese president hu jintao that china would put forward a carbon intensity target for china between now and 2020 that is to reduce the emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases as a proportion of their economic output .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meyer has testified before congress on global warming and energy issues it is the first time china has made that proposal .
he did not put forward a specific number , and obviously we have to wait to see how aggressive that carbon intensity reduction goal is , but it was a meaningful offer by china.i think that added some momentum coming out of new york , going into pittsburgh and on to copenhagen at the end of the year .
also , japan , the new prime minister there , pledging to increase japan 's greenhouse gas reduction target from the minus eight percent below 1990 levels , pledged by the previous government , to 25 percent below 1990 levels .
of course that 's much more in keeping with the proposal that the european union has put forward and begins to be within the range of what the science says we need to do to get a handle on the problem .
some commentators were quite disappointed with the us position , with obama 's remarks , how did you perceive them ?
i think he said a lot of the right things in terms of the urgency of the problem ; that he gets it on the science ; that the us is committed to do its part on this .
he gave a good overview of all the things he and his administration have done in the eight months since he took office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's un address won a luke warm reception from some observers i think what was disappointing to a lot of observers , and particularly to those from other countries , was that he did n't say very much about the need for the senate in our country to take action on domestic climate legislation in advance of copenhagen .
he did mention that the house has already passed a domestic climate bill and that committees in the senate are starting to consider it , but he did n't lay down the gauntlet and say to the senate ' i really need you to do this by copenhagen so that i can go in there with the credibility of the congressional backing for the position i want to take at that meeting . '
i think people understand the situation he is in .
he is fighting very hard for a domestic health care bill .
they are focused on that like a laser and do n't want to be distracting the senate with talk about other issues , but i think there is more and more impatience on the international scene about the fact that one body of our congress is threatening to hold up the whole process in copenhagen .
two years ago countries agreed to reach a new deal to replace the kyoto protocol by the end of this year , yet negotiations remain about as deadlocked as they have been for the better part of a decade .
how likely is it that we 'll see an agreement at the next big round of negotiations in copenhagen in december – especially given , as you said , that the senate in the us seems to be holding up the process ?
i think there are two big issues here .
one is what the state is of the us domestic debate .
if the president comes to copenhagen with the senate moving forward on climate legislation – with a leadership bill having been introduced and expressions of support – i think he 'll have more credibility .
certainly more than president clinton and vice-president gore did in kyoto when everyone knew that congress was not likely to back what they were putting forward .
the other piece , which is equally daunting frankly , is the issue of climate finance : the roughly 100-150 billion euro-a-year estimates for developing countries for mitigation and adaptation activities on climate change .
and there it 's not just the us , but europe and japan as well which have to do much more to advance that issue before copenhagen .
many of the developing countries have made it clear that if there is not the serious financing and technology package on offer in copenhagen that was promised back in bali two years ago , there 's not going to be a deal from their side .
bildunterschrift : western money to pay for clean development could be a deal-breaker there are still critics who question not only whether an international deal is feasible , but whether it is even desirable .
the controversial danish statistician björn lomborg told deutsche welle this week that cutting emissions was too expensive and ultimately futile .
he said the world would get more bang for its buck by investing in super-projects to pump clouds into the atmosphere to cool the planet .
does lomborg have a point ?
we certainly disagree with his premise that cutting carbon emissions is expensive .
as a matter of fact , my organization just completed an analysis of the us potential for emission reductions showing that we could go far beyond the reductions that the president and the congress are talking about , and that -lrb- we could provide -rrb- savings for consumers .
the reality is , particularly energy efficiency investments pay back very quickly , and then you get benefits from that for years to come .
there are also signals that wind energy and other renewable technologies are coming down in price .
wind is taking off in the united states as it is in other parts of the world , so i fundamentally disagree with the premise that cutting emissions has to be expensive .
yes there is some cost , but it is much less than the cost of damages from climate change that we will see if we do n't take action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish statistician bjorn lomborg says money would be better spent elsewhere when it comes to the issue of geo-engineering , this is obviously something the science community is starting to talk about .
it is very controversial , because obviously these are unproven technologies , and more importantly there could be side-effects from these large-scale geo-engineering schemes that we do n't fully understand .
we 're obviously not doing a very good of regulating the planet with our activities now , and to think that we can have some kind of technical fix that works without some kind of unforeseen side-effect is a little bit of hubris on our part .
so i think there is some interest in exploring some of these options , but i think to hang your whole strategy on that would be a grave mistake .
so what are some of the biggest challenges going to be in securing a good deal at copenhagen at the end of the year ?
indeed , what would amount to a good deal ?
i think what you need for a good deal is something that 's ambitious , that 's in line with what the science says we have to do to bend the emissions curve .
this means we need deeper reductions than what most of the industrialized countries are to date putting on the table .
we also need action by the major developing countries to see a deviation from their business-as-usual growth-path in emissions over the next decade or so , with a view towards eventually having an absolute cap and eventual reduction in their emission later this century .
and we need a substantial financing and technology package to help make those countries make the transition – to basically leap-frog across the way the industrialized countries did their development over the last century , and go right to cleaner technologies .
i think that 's going to be a real challenge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : per capita , indians produce a tenth of the co2 that americans do there also has to be a fair agreement .
it has to recognize the different stages of development that different countries are at ; that acknowledges the fact that a country like india , for example , emits two tones of carbon per person or less , whereas my country , the united states , emits 20 tones per person – ten times as much .
so it 's not fair to ask india to do the same as the united states in terms of taking leadership .
it is fair to ask india to do something , and to do more than they have been , and i think they 're showing signals that they 're willing to step up to the plate on that , as is china and other countries , but equity is a key part of this .
the third element is that it has to be binding .
it has to be something that is not just a voluntary commitment , but where countries look each other in the eye and say ' we are going to do this , we are going to have a system of verification , a system of compliance , that assures us that each of is doing our part in what we agreed to in copenhagen .
those are the three basic elements – it has to be fair , it has to be ambitious and it has to be binding .
climate change is also on the agenda when the leaders of the group of 20 major economies meet on thursday and friday .
some say the g20 could prove to be an even more important venue to overcome deadlocks between rich nations like the us and developing countries like china … the two issues that are on the agenda here in pittsburgh this week are climate finance .
how do you generate and govern the flows of investment that are needed for clean energy technologies ; reducing the rate of deforestation in tropical rainforest countries ; and for helping the poorest countries adapt to the impacts of climate change .
that 's going to be a big discussion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the g20 be the right venue to broker a compromise ?
the other issue , which the us has put on the agenda , is the issue of fossil fuel subsidies .
it turns out that the world is spending somewhere around 200 billion dollars a year or more encouraging production and consumption on the very things we 're trying to reduce to deal with global warming – that 's coal and oil .
so that topic is on the agenda , we 'll see how far we get with that , that 's obviously a very difficult issue - not only for the united states , but other countries .
it 's very political and there are entrenched interests that benefit from those embedded subsidies and will fight very hard against efforts to reduce or eliminate them .
climate is just one of the topics , but it is the first time that it has been on the agenda in a way like at the g20 and i think that does give us some prospect of movement .
certainly if they do some follow up between pittsburgh and copenhagen and the g20 process , they could help deliver that element of the package on climate finance . interview : nathan witkop editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

how likely is it that we 'll see an agreement at the next big round of negotiations in copenhagen in december – especially given , as you said , that the senate in the us seems to be holding up the process ?
i think there are two big issues here .
one is what the state is of the us domestic debate .
if the president comes to copenhagen with the senate moving forward on climate legislation – with a leadership bill having been introduced and expressions of support – i think he 'll have more credibility .
certainly more than president clinton and vice-president gore did in kyoto when everyone knew that congress was not likely to back what they were putting forward .
the other piece , which is equally daunting frankly , is the issue of climate finance : the roughly 100-150 billion euro-a-year estimates for developing countries for mitigation and adaptation activities on climate change .
and there it 's not just the us , but europe and japan as well which have to do much more to advance that issue before copenhagen .
many of the developing countries have made it clear that if there is not the serious financing and technology package on offer in copenhagen that was promised back in bali two years ago , there 's not going to be a deal from their side .
bildunterschrift : western money to pay for clean development could be a deal-breaker there are still critics who question not only whether an international deal is feasible , but whether it is even desirable .
the controversial danish statistician björn lomborg told deutsche welle this week that cutting emissions was too expensive and ultimately futile .
he said the world would get more bang for its buck by investing in super-projects to pump clouds into the atmosphere to cool the planet .
does lomborg have a point ?
we certainly disagree with his premise that cutting carbon emissions is expensive .
as a matter of fact , my organization just completed an analysis of the us potential for emission reductions showing that we could go far beyond the reductions that the president and the congress are talking about , and that -lrb- we could provide -rrb- savings for consumers .
the reality is , particularly energy efficiency investments pay back very quickly , and then you get benefits from that for years to come .
there are also signals that wind energy and other renewable technologies are coming down in price .
wind is taking off in the united states as it is in other parts of the world , so i fundamentally disagree with the premise that cutting emissions has to be expensive .
yes there is some cost , but it is much less than the cost of damages from climate change that we will see if we do n't take action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish statistician bjorn lomborg says money would be better spent elsewhere when it comes to the issue of geo-engineering , this is obviously something the science community is starting to talk about .
it is very controversial , because obviously these are unproven technologies , and more importantly there could be side-effects from these large-scale geo-engineering schemes that we do n't fully understand .
we 're obviously not doing a very good of regulating the planet with our activities now , and to think that we can have some kind of technical fix that works without some kind of unforeseen side-effect is a little bit of hubris on our part .
so i think there is some interest in exploring some of these options , but i think to hang your whole strategy on that would be a grave mistake .
so what are some of the biggest challenges going to be in securing a good deal at copenhagen at the end of the year ?
indeed , what would amount to a good deal ?
i think what you need for a good deal is something that 's ambitious , that 's in line with what the science says we have to do to bend the emissions curve .
this means we need deeper reductions than what most of the industrialized countries are to date putting on the table .
we also need action by the major developing countries to see a deviation from their business-as-usual growth-path in emissions over the next decade or so , with a view towards eventually having an absolute cap and eventual reduction in their emission later this century .
and we need a substantial financing and technology package to help make those countries make the transition – to basically leap-frog across the way the industrialized countries did their development over the last century , and go right to cleaner technologies .
i think that 's going to be a real challenge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : per capita , indians produce a tenth of the co2 that americans do there also has to be a fair agreement .
it has to recognize the different stages of development that different countries are at ; that acknowledges the fact that a country like india , for example , emits two tones of carbon per person or less , whereas my country , the united states , emits 20 tones per person – ten times as much .
so it 's not fair to ask india to do the same as the united states in terms of taking leadership .
it is fair to ask india to do something , and to do more than they have been , and i think they 're showing signals that they 're willing to step up to the plate on that , as is china and other countries , but equity is a key part of this .
the third element is that it has to be binding .
it has to be something that is not just a voluntary commitment , but where countries look each other in the eye and say ' we are going to do this , we are going to have a system of verification , a system of compliance , that assures us that each of is doing our part in what we agreed to in copenhagen .
those are the three basic elements – it has to be fair , it has to be ambitious and it has to be binding .
climate change is also on the agenda when the leaders of the group of 20 major economies meet on thursday and friday .
some say the g20 could prove to be an even more important venue to overcome deadlocks between rich nations like the us and developing countries like china … the two issues that are on the agenda here in pittsburgh this week are climate finance .
how do you generate and govern the flows of investment that are needed for clean energy technologies ; reducing the rate of deforestation in tropical rainforest countries ; and for helping the poorest countries adapt to the impacts of climate change .
that 's going to be a big discussion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the g20 be the right venue to broker a compromise ?
the other issue , which the us has put on the agenda , is the issue of fossil fuel subsidies .
it turns out that the world is spending somewhere around 200 billion dollars a year or more encouraging production and consumption on the very things we 're trying to reduce to deal with global warming – that 's coal and oil .
so that topic is on the agenda , we 'll see how far we get with that , that 's obviously a very difficult issue - not only for the united states , but other countries .
it 's very political and there are entrenched interests that benefit from those embedded subsidies and will fight very hard against efforts to reduce or eliminate them .
climate is just one of the topics , but it is the first time that it has been on the agenda in a way like at the g20 and i think that does give us some prospect of movement .
certainly if they do some follow up between pittsburgh and copenhagen and the g20 process , they could help deliver that element of the package on climate finance . interview : nathan witkop editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this week witnessed some important meetings for climate negotiations .
world leaders gathered for two high-level conferences in the us .
a leading us scientific advisor gave dw his thoughts on where climate talks stood . alden meyer is director of strategy and policy for the union of concerned scientists – a us organisation which campaigns for tough international action to tackle global warming .
meyer has 30 years experience advising government on environmental and energy issues , and spoke to deutsche welle from the g20 summit in pittsburgh .
he said world leaders made some progress when they met in new york for a special one-day climate summit .
he added that although the united states remains distracted by a struggle over health care reform , the g20 could prove to unblock efforts to get an ambitious agreement at december 's crucial climate conference in copenhagen .
deutsche welle : what struck you about world leaders ' addresses on climate change on tuesday ?
alden meyer : one of the significant developments at the special summit on climate change on tuesday was the commitment by chinese president hu jintao that china would put forward a carbon intensity target for china between now and 2020 that is to reduce the emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases as a proportion of their economic output .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meyer has testified before congress on global warming and energy issues it is the first time china has made that proposal .
he did not put forward a specific number , and obviously we have to wait to see how aggressive that carbon intensity reduction goal is , but it was a meaningful offer by china.i think that added some momentum coming out of new york , going into pittsburgh and on to copenhagen at the end of the year .
also , japan , the new prime minister there , pledging to increase japan 's greenhouse gas reduction target from the minus eight percent below 1990 levels , pledged by the previous government , to 25 percent below 1990 levels .
of course that 's much more in keeping with the proposal that the european union has put forward and begins to be within the range of what the science says we need to do to get a handle on the problem .
some commentators were quite disappointed with the us position , with obama 's remarks , how did you perceive them ?
i think he said a lot of the right things in terms of the urgency of the problem ; that he gets it on the science ; that the us is committed to do its part on this .
he gave a good overview of all the things he and his administration have done in the eight months since he took office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's un address won a luke warm reception from some observers i think what was disappointing to a lot of observers , and particularly to those from other countries , was that he did n't say very much about the need for the senate in our country to take action on domestic climate legislation in advance of copenhagen .
he did mention that the house has already passed a domestic climate bill and that committees in the senate are starting to consider it , but he did n't lay down the gauntlet and say to the senate ' i really need you to do this by copenhagen so that i can go in there with the credibility of the congressional backing for the position i want to take at that meeting . '
i think people understand the situation he is in .
he is fighting very hard for a domestic health care bill .
they are focused on that like a laser and do n't want to be distracting the senate with talk about other issues , but i think there is more and more impatience on the international scene about the fact that one body of our congress is threatening to hold up the whole process in copenhagen .

a new resolution from the polish parliament condemns the invasion - and irks russia . a resolution unanimously approved by the polish parliament this week condemns the soviet invasion of eastern poland in 1939 .
the resolution referred to a series of massacres of poles in russia , as well as mass deportations of over one million poles to siberia .
poland also called on russia to condemn the crimes .
sixteen days after poland was invaded by nazi germany on sept .
1 , 1939 , troops under soviet dictator josef stalin were sent into eastern poland .
a year later , a soviet-led massacre in the katyn forest left over 20,000 polish officers and intellectuals dead .
angry reactions from moscow the response from russia warned that the polish resolution , which said the stalin-era crimes amount to genocide , was a set-back to improving ties between russia and poland .
" the resolution adopted by the parliament deals a serious blow to efforts to develop normal neighborly relations between our countries , " the russian foreign ministry said in a statement , adding that the resolution was " tendentious and politicized . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bronislaw komorowski says russia has trouble dealing with its past polish parliamentary speaker bronislaw komorowski said russia 's reaction indicates the country is still coming to grips with its past .
" the fact that russia has reacted so nervously to a resolution that has nothing to do with present-day foreign policy is a sign that it is still unable to come to terms with its own history , " komorowski said .
tense relationship with history while the resolution brought a seventy-year old conflict to the forefront , both countries have previously had difficulty in addressing their shared history .
another contentious issue is the non-aggression pact signed between the soviets and the nazis on the eve of world war ii .
during a visit to poland by russian prime minister vladimir putin a few days before the resolution passed , putin made a surprising departure from russia 's previous attitude towards the pact by calling the document " immoral . "
many had hoped putin 's visit marked an improvement in frosty polish-russian relations of the past few years .
but according to commentators , poland and russia appear to have wasted an opportunity on the 70th anniversary of the outbreak of world war ii to use memories of their joint struggle against the nazis to bring them together – and instead decided to dwell on the past to cultivate their differences .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de latin america -pipe- 25.09.2009 brazil shows south american neighbors how to trade with africa großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's president lula da silva has increased trade with africa one goal of the second south america-africa summit this weekend in venezuela is to increase cooperation between the continents .
most countries could learn a lesson or two on how to do that from brazil . a new geography of international trade called " south-south " - that is the ambitious goal of brazilian president luiz inácio “ lula ” da silva .
the former trade union leader wants to better connect his country with other developing and emerging nations , a vision he already announced back in 2004 at a un trade conference in sao paulo .
while he wanted to continue to export to industrial nations , he also emphasized that he was looking for new opportunities .
" we want to foster partnerships , which enable better cooperation between the economies of the south , " lula said .
that strategy seems to work .
today brazil sells more goods to developing and emerging countries than to countries in the northern hemisphere .
china has become brazil 's third largest trade partner , after the us , and close behind neighboring argentina .
aside from china , brazilian companies have increasingly focused on africa , a continent , which in the past was regarded mainly as the home of former slaves .
lula himself already has travelled to africa eleven times and does n't get tired of repeating that brazil is home to the largest population of african descent outside of africa .
the official export agency apex has also intensified its efforts and earlier this month a delegation of brazilian businessmen visited south africa .
maurício manfré , who leads the project within apex , does n't view himself merely as a representative of brazilian companies .
he is also on the look out for products , which he can import .
" we want to expand and intensify this relationship , " he says .
rapid increase in exports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angola is brasil 's number one african trading partner in the past ten years brazilian exports to sub-saharan africa have increased almost eightfold .
last year they reached more than ten billion us dollars , five percent of all brazilian exports .
angola was brazil 's number one export destination with two billion us dollars , followed by south africa with 1.8 billion dollars and nigeria with 1.5 billion dollars respectively .
especially in the midst of the global financial and economic crisis new markets in africa are more than welcome , says jorge duarte de oliveira , the director of exportaminas , the export agency of the south eastern brazilian state of minas gerais : " the emerging countries have suffered considerably less from the international crisis , " he explains .
" they offer very attractive markets to small companies , which produce consumer goods here in brazil for the middle and lower class . "
jorge duarte de oliveira is convinced that those smaller brazilian producers will find the same kind of customers in africa and the middle east .
wide range of brasilian exports to africa while two thirds of chinese imports from brazil are commodities like soy and iron ore and bejing has little interest in industrial products , brazil 's range of exports to africa is more diverse .
only one third are commodities , two thirds consist of assembled products , from textiles and furniture to agricultural machines .
" africa has n't been able yet to develop its own industries .
that 's why the africans buy a large part of brazil 's industrial exports , " says carlos abijaodi , a trade expert with the industrial association of the federal state of minas gerais .
that is the reason why brazil 's range of products is broad , he explains brazil is also closely related to africa , adds abijaodi and says that he noticed that through his international contacts .
" they have similar customs and in the portuguese speaking countries in africa like angola and mozambique we share the same language . "
brazilian multinationals invest billions in africa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mozambique could also see a surge in brazilian investments brazil 's most important trading partner in africa is angola .
the oil-rich country which boasted double-digit growth rates in recent years has attracted investments by many brazilian companies .
petrobrás , the state-run oil concern , is surveying angola 's coast for possible oil fields while construction firm odebrecht maintains roads and brazilian conglomerate camargo corrêa builds a 370 million dollar cement plant in angola .
but in the near future , mozambique , africa 's most populous portuguese speaking country , is likely to also become more attractive for brazil .
vale , the leading brazilian mining company , invests 1.3 billion dollars there to exploit coal near moatize in central mozambique .
moatize is considered to be one of the largest unexploited coal reserves in the world .
it could provide high quality coal for more than a hundred years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 25.09.2009 the climate ball is in the rich world 's court großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g20 could be the place to get a deal on funding to protect rainforests .
this week witnessed some important meetings for climate negotiations .
world leaders gathered for two high-level conferences in the us .
a leading us scientific advisor gave dw his thoughts on where climate talks stood . alden meyer is director of strategy and policy for the union of concerned scientists – a us organisation which campaigns for tough international action to tackle global warming .
meyer has 30 years experience advising government on environmental and energy issues , and spoke to deutsche welle from the g20 summit in pittsburgh .
he said world leaders made some progress when they met in new york for a special one-day climate summit .
he added that although the united states remains distracted by a struggle over health care reform , the g20 could prove to unblock efforts to get an ambitious agreement at december 's crucial climate conference in copenhagen .
deutsche welle : what struck you about world leaders ' addresses on climate change on tuesday ?
alden meyer : one of the significant developments at the special summit on climate change on tuesday was the commitment by chinese president hu jintao that china would put forward a carbon intensity target for china between now and 2020 that is to reduce the emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases as a proportion of their economic output .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meyer has testified before congress on global warming and energy issues it is the first time china has made that proposal .
he did not put forward a specific number , and obviously we have to wait to see how aggressive that carbon intensity reduction goal is , but it was a meaningful offer by china.i think that added some momentum coming out of new york , going into pittsburgh and on to copenhagen at the end of the year .
also , japan , the new prime minister there , pledging to increase japan 's greenhouse gas reduction target from the minus eight percent below 1990 levels , pledged by the previous government , to 25 percent below 1990 levels .
of course that 's much more in keeping with the proposal that the european union has put forward and begins to be within the range of what the science says we need to do to get a handle on the problem .
some commentators were quite disappointed with the us position , with obama 's remarks , how did you perceive them ?
i think he said a lot of the right things in terms of the urgency of the problem ; that he gets it on the science ; that the us is committed to do its part on this .
he gave a good overview of all the things he and his administration have done in the eight months since he took office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's un address won a luke warm reception from some observers i think what was disappointing to a lot of observers , and particularly to those from other countries , was that he did n't say very much about the need for the senate in our country to take action on domestic climate legislation in advance of copenhagen .
he did mention that the house has already passed a domestic climate bill and that committees in the senate are starting to consider it , but he did n't lay down the gauntlet and say to the senate ' i really need you to do this by copenhagen so that i can go in there with the credibility of the congressional backing for the position i want to take at that meeting . '
i think people understand the situation he is in .
he is fighting very hard for a domestic health care bill .
they are focused on that like a laser and do n't want to be distracting the senate with talk about other issues , but i think there is more and more impatience on the international scene about the fact that one body of our congress is threatening to hold up the whole process in copenhagen .
two years ago countries agreed to reach a new deal to replace the kyoto protocol by the end of this year , yet negotiations remain about as deadlocked as they have been for the better part of a decade .
how likely is it that we 'll see an agreement at the next big round of negotiations in copenhagen in december – especially given , as you said , that the senate in the us seems to be holding up the process ?
i think there are two big issues here .
one is what the state is of the us domestic debate .
if the president comes to copenhagen with the senate moving forward on climate legislation – with a leadership bill having been introduced and expressions of support – i think he 'll have more credibility .
certainly more than president clinton and vice-president gore did in kyoto when everyone knew that congress was not likely to back what they were putting forward .
the other piece , which is equally daunting frankly , is the issue of climate finance : the roughly 100-150 billion euro-a-year estimates for developing countries for mitigation and adaptation activities on climate change .
and there it 's not just the us , but europe and japan as well which have to do much more to advance that issue before copenhagen .
many of the developing countries have made it clear that if there is not the serious financing and technology package on offer in copenhagen that was promised back in bali two years ago , there 's not going to be a deal from their side .
bildunterschrift : western money to pay for clean development could be a deal-breaker there are still critics who question not only whether an international deal is feasible , but whether it is even desirable .
the controversial danish statistician björn lomborg told deutsche welle this week that cutting emissions was too expensive and ultimately futile .
he said the world would get more bang for its buck by investing in super-projects to pump clouds into the atmosphere to cool the planet .
does lomborg have a point ?
we certainly disagree with his premise that cutting carbon emissions is expensive .
as a matter of fact , my organization just completed an analysis of the us potential for emission reductions showing that we could go far beyond the reductions that the president and the congress are talking about , and that -lrb- we could provide -rrb- savings for consumers .
the reality is , particularly energy efficiency investments pay back very quickly , and then you get benefits from that for years to come .
there are also signals that wind energy and other renewable technologies are coming down in price .
wind is taking off in the united states as it is in other parts of the world , so i fundamentally disagree with the premise that cutting emissions has to be expensive .
yes there is some cost , but it is much less than the cost of damages from climate change that we will see if we do n't take action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish statistician bjorn lomborg says money would be better spent elsewhere when it comes to the issue of geo-engineering , this is obviously something the science community is starting to talk about .
it is very controversial , because obviously these are unproven technologies , and more importantly there could be side-effects from these large-scale geo-engineering schemes that we do n't fully understand .
we 're obviously not doing a very good of regulating the planet with our activities now , and to think that we can have some kind of technical fix that works without some kind of unforeseen side-effect is a little bit of hubris on our part .
so i think there is some interest in exploring some of these options , but i think to hang your whole strategy on that would be a grave mistake .
so what are some of the biggest challenges going to be in securing a good deal at copenhagen at the end of the year ?
indeed , what would amount to a good deal ?
i think what you need for a good deal is something that 's ambitious , that 's in line with what the science says we have to do to bend the emissions curve .
this means we need deeper reductions than what most of the industrialized countries are to date putting on the table .
we also need action by the major developing countries to see a deviation from their business-as-usual growth-path in emissions over the next decade or so , with a view towards eventually having an absolute cap and eventual reduction in their emission later this century .
and we need a substantial financing and technology package to help make those countries make the transition – to basically leap-frog across the way the industrialized countries did their development over the last century , and go right to cleaner technologies .
i think that 's going to be a real challenge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : per capita , indians produce a tenth of the co2 that americans do there also has to be a fair agreement .
it has to recognize the different stages of development that different countries are at ; that acknowledges the fact that a country like india , for example , emits two tones of carbon per person or less , whereas my country , the united states , emits 20 tones per person – ten times as much .
so it 's not fair to ask india to do the same as the united states in terms of taking leadership .
it is fair to ask india to do something , and to do more than they have been , and i think they 're showing signals that they 're willing to step up to the plate on that , as is china and other countries , but equity is a key part of this .
the third element is that it has to be binding .
it has to be something that is not just a voluntary commitment , but where countries look each other in the eye and say ' we are going to do this , we are going to have a system of verification , a system of compliance , that assures us that each of is doing our part in what we agreed to in copenhagen .
those are the three basic elements – it has to be fair , it has to be ambitious and it has to be binding .
climate change is also on the agenda when the leaders of the group of 20 major economies meet on thursday and friday .
some say the g20 could prove to be an even more important venue to overcome deadlocks between rich nations like the us and developing countries like china … the two issues that are on the agenda here in pittsburgh this week are climate finance .
how do you generate and govern the flows of investment that are needed for clean energy technologies ; reducing the rate of deforestation in tropical rainforest countries ; and for helping the poorest countries adapt to the impacts of climate change .
that 's going to be a big discussion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the g20 be the right venue to broker a compromise ?
the other issue , which the us has put on the agenda , is the issue of fossil fuel subsidies .
it turns out that the world is spending somewhere around 200 billion dollars a year or more encouraging production and consumption on the very things we 're trying to reduce to deal with global warming – that 's coal and oil .
so that topic is on the agenda , we 'll see how far we get with that , that 's obviously a very difficult issue - not only for the united states , but other countries .
it 's very political and there are entrenched interests that benefit from those embedded subsidies and will fight very hard against efforts to reduce or eliminate them .
climate is just one of the topics , but it is the first time that it has been on the agenda in a way like at the g20 and i think that does give us some prospect of movement .
certainly if they do some follow up between pittsburgh and copenhagen and the g20 process , they could help deliver that element of the package on climate finance . interview : nathan witkop editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some commentators were quite disappointed with the us position , with obama 's remarks , how did you perceive them ?
i think he said a lot of the right things in terms of the urgency of the problem ; that he gets it on the science ; that the us is committed to do its part on this .
he gave a good overview of all the things he and his administration have done in the eight months since he took office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's un address won a luke warm reception from some observers i think what was disappointing to a lot of observers , and particularly to those from other countries , was that he did n't say very much about the need for the senate in our country to take action on domestic climate legislation in advance of copenhagen .
he did mention that the house has already passed a domestic climate bill and that committees in the senate are starting to consider it , but he did n't lay down the gauntlet and say to the senate ' i really need you to do this by copenhagen so that i can go in there with the credibility of the congressional backing for the position i want to take at that meeting . '
i think people understand the situation he is in .
he is fighting very hard for a domestic health care bill .
they are focused on that like a laser and do n't want to be distracting the senate with talk about other issues , but i think there is more and more impatience on the international scene about the fact that one body of our congress is threatening to hold up the whole process in copenhagen .
two years ago countries agreed to reach a new deal to replace the kyoto protocol by the end of this year , yet negotiations remain about as deadlocked as they have been for the better part of a decade .
how likely is it that we 'll see an agreement at the next big round of negotiations in copenhagen in december – especially given , as you said , that the senate in the us seems to be holding up the process ?
i think there are two big issues here .
one is what the state is of the us domestic debate .
if the president comes to copenhagen with the senate moving forward on climate legislation – with a leadership bill having been introduced and expressions of support – i think he 'll have more credibility .
certainly more than president clinton and vice-president gore did in kyoto when everyone knew that congress was not likely to back what they were putting forward .
the other piece , which is equally daunting frankly , is the issue of climate finance : the roughly 100-150 billion euro-a-year estimates for developing countries for mitigation and adaptation activities on climate change .
and there it 's not just the us , but europe and japan as well which have to do much more to advance that issue before copenhagen .
many of the developing countries have made it clear that if there is not the serious financing and technology package on offer in copenhagen that was promised back in bali two years ago , there 's not going to be a deal from their side .
bildunterschrift : western money to pay for clean development could be a deal-breaker there are still critics who question not only whether an international deal is feasible , but whether it is even desirable .
the controversial danish statistician björn lomborg told deutsche welle this week that cutting emissions was too expensive and ultimately futile .
he said the world would get more bang for its buck by investing in super-projects to pump clouds into the atmosphere to cool the planet .
does lomborg have a point ?
we certainly disagree with his premise that cutting carbon emissions is expensive .
as a matter of fact , my organization just completed an analysis of the us potential for emission reductions showing that we could go far beyond the reductions that the president and the congress are talking about , and that -lrb- we could provide -rrb- savings for consumers .
the reality is , particularly energy efficiency investments pay back very quickly , and then you get benefits from that for years to come .
there are also signals that wind energy and other renewable technologies are coming down in price .
wind is taking off in the united states as it is in other parts of the world , so i fundamentally disagree with the premise that cutting emissions has to be expensive .
yes there is some cost , but it is much less than the cost of damages from climate change that we will see if we do n't take action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish statistician bjorn lomborg says money would be better spent elsewhere when it comes to the issue of geo-engineering , this is obviously something the science community is starting to talk about .
it is very controversial , because obviously these are unproven technologies , and more importantly there could be side-effects from these large-scale geo-engineering schemes that we do n't fully understand .
we 're obviously not doing a very good of regulating the planet with our activities now , and to think that we can have some kind of technical fix that works without some kind of unforeseen side-effect is a little bit of hubris on our part .
so i think there is some interest in exploring some of these options , but i think to hang your whole strategy on that would be a grave mistake .
so what are some of the biggest challenges going to be in securing a good deal at copenhagen at the end of the year ?
indeed , what would amount to a good deal ?
i think what you need for a good deal is something that 's ambitious , that 's in line with what the science says we have to do to bend the emissions curve .
this means we need deeper reductions than what most of the industrialized countries are to date putting on the table .
we also need action by the major developing countries to see a deviation from their business-as-usual growth-path in emissions over the next decade or so , with a view towards eventually having an absolute cap and eventual reduction in their emission later this century .
and we need a substantial financing and technology package to help make those countries make the transition – to basically leap-frog across the way the industrialized countries did their development over the last century , and go right to cleaner technologies .
i think that 's going to be a real challenge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : per capita , indians produce a tenth of the co2 that americans do there also has to be a fair agreement .
it has to recognize the different stages of development that different countries are at ; that acknowledges the fact that a country like india , for example , emits two tones of carbon per person or less , whereas my country , the united states , emits 20 tones per person – ten times as much .
so it 's not fair to ask india to do the same as the united states in terms of taking leadership .
it is fair to ask india to do something , and to do more than they have been , and i think they 're showing signals that they 're willing to step up to the plate on that , as is china and other countries , but equity is a key part of this .
the third element is that it has to be binding .
it has to be something that is not just a voluntary commitment , but where countries look each other in the eye and say ' we are going to do this , we are going to have a system of verification , a system of compliance , that assures us that each of is doing our part in what we agreed to in copenhagen .
those are the three basic elements – it has to be fair , it has to be ambitious and it has to be binding .
climate change is also on the agenda when the leaders of the group of 20 major economies meet on thursday and friday .
some say the g20 could prove to be an even more important venue to overcome deadlocks between rich nations like the us and developing countries like china … the two issues that are on the agenda here in pittsburgh this week are climate finance .
how do you generate and govern the flows of investment that are needed for clean energy technologies ; reducing the rate of deforestation in tropical rainforest countries ; and for helping the poorest countries adapt to the impacts of climate change .
that 's going to be a big discussion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the g20 be the right venue to broker a compromise ?
the other issue , which the us has put on the agenda , is the issue of fossil fuel subsidies .
it turns out that the world is spending somewhere around 200 billion dollars a year or more encouraging production and consumption on the very things we 're trying to reduce to deal with global warming – that 's coal and oil .
so that topic is on the agenda , we 'll see how far we get with that , that 's obviously a very difficult issue - not only for the united states , but other countries .
it 's very political and there are entrenched interests that benefit from those embedded subsidies and will fight very hard against efforts to reduce or eliminate them .
climate is just one of the topics , but it is the first time that it has been on the agenda in a way like at the g20 and i think that does give us some prospect of movement .
certainly if they do some follow up between pittsburgh and copenhagen and the g20 process , they could help deliver that element of the package on climate finance . interview : nathan witkop editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in germany , politics and pop culture are like chalk and cheese .
but some of the more intrepid candidates in the upcoming parliamentary elections are now going where few have ever dared to tread : late-night tv . german politicians looked on enviously during the last us election campaign as then-presidential-hopeful barack obama managed to mobilize the youth vote .
it was primarily his use of the internet and social networking sites that helped him reach the blasé young people who in this generation have shown little interest in politics .
but media-savvy appearances on tv talk shows also helped propel obama into the forefront of popular culture .
in march , he became the first sitting president to appear on a late-night talk show when he dropped by " the tonight show with jay leno . "
rolling with the punches the strategy has clearly been noticed in germany - where the hope is that young voters will not only help sway the current , close election , but will stay true to their parties for life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tv host stefan raab does not treat his guests with kid gloves so politicians are starting to spread their wings .
appearing on established topical chat shows aired by public broadcasters and hosted by high-minded hosts such as anne will and maybrit illner are obviously nothing new .
but as parliamentary elections loom this weekend , a slew of berlin heavyweights , from the ever-slick economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg to the loquacious left party candidate gregor gysi , have decided to take their cues from obama and appear on prime-time private broadcaster prosieben .
joining them for an election-night panel on a saturday night show will be social democrat chairman franz muentefering , while liberal free democrats and the green party are sending their respective frontrunner candidates guido westerwelle and juergen trittin .
the show ’ s host is none other than stefan raab , enfant terrible of late-night viewing .
as a tv personality , he 's famous for making his interviewees squirm - and a lot more used to grilling guests such as germany 's next top model and kylie minogue than political leaders .
over exposure still , he wo n't be the only one treading new ground . a turn on a show as anchored in youth culture as " tv total bundestagswahl 2009 " certainly marks a departure for senior politicians .
but it is likely to be a canny move .
when an election show hosted by raab aired on the eve of the vote four years ago , it snagged a 29 percent market share of the 14 -29 age group category .
obviously , politicians have decided to do whatever it takes to galvanize young voters out of their living rooms and into the polling stations come sunday , and if that means subjecting themselves to raab 's punishing wit , they 're willing to roll with the punches .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the heavily plugged merkel- steinmeier debate was widely deemed a dud after all , the duller-than-dishwater debate between chancellor angela merkel and her challenger , frank-walter steinmeier , which aired a week ahead of the vote on germany 's first public broadcaster ard , did little to tickle the public 's interest - let alone attract the younger generation .
with the two rivals remaining civil and measured throughout , it could hardly even be termed a debate .
and in terms of ratings , it was a resounding flop : 7 million fewer viewers tuned in than did four years ago , and with 7,86 million watching , it attracted a market share of only 23,4 percent .
but merkel probably feels as though she currently has enough exposure in popular culture , now that a youtube video featuring her getting heckled by a " flash mob " at an election rally in hamburg has been watched by more than a quarter of a million people in the last week .
participants shouted " yeaahh " at every sentence spoken by the conservative leader , and waved placards with the words : " all together : yeaahh . "

serious co-host barring an unexpected appearance , both merkel and steinmeier will be conspicuous in their absence on the raab show , but their colleagues can expect questions on topics chosen to appeal to a younger audience , such as education , youth unemployment and the internet .

in germany , politics and pop culture are like chalk and cheese .
but some of the more intrepid candidates in the upcoming parliamentary elections are now going where few have ever dared to tread : late-night tv . german politicians looked on enviously during the last us election campaign as then-presidential-hopeful barack obama managed to mobilize the youth vote .
it was primarily his use of the internet and social networking sites that helped him reach the blasé young people who in this generation have shown little interest in politics .
but media-savvy appearances on tv talk shows also helped propel obama into the forefront of popular culture .
in march , he became the first sitting president to appear on a late-night talk show when he dropped by " the tonight show with jay leno . "
rolling with the punches the strategy has clearly been noticed in germany - where the hope is that young voters will not only help sway the current , close election , but will stay true to their parties for life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tv host stefan raab does not treat his guests with kid gloves so politicians are starting to spread their wings .
appearing on established topical chat shows aired by public broadcasters and hosted by high-minded hosts such as anne will and maybrit illner are obviously nothing new .
but as parliamentary elections loom this weekend , a slew of berlin heavyweights , from the ever-slick economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg to the loquacious left party candidate gregor gysi , have decided to take their cues from obama and appear on prime-time private broadcaster prosieben .
joining them for an election-night panel on a saturday night show will be social democrat chairman franz muentefering , while liberal free democrats and the green party are sending their respective frontrunner candidates guido westerwelle and juergen trittin .
the show ’ s host is none other than stefan raab , enfant terrible of late-night viewing .
as a tv personality , he 's famous for making his interviewees squirm - and a lot more used to grilling guests such as germany 's next top model and kylie minogue than political leaders .
over exposure still , he wo n't be the only one treading new ground . a turn on a show as anchored in youth culture as " tv total bundestagswahl 2009 " certainly marks a departure for senior politicians .
but it is likely to be a canny move .
when an election show hosted by raab aired on the eve of the vote four years ago , it snagged a 29 percent market share of the 14 -29 age group category .
obviously , politicians have decided to do whatever it takes to galvanize young voters out of their living rooms and into the polling stations come sunday , and if that means subjecting themselves to raab 's punishing wit , they 're willing to roll with the punches .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the heavily plugged merkel- steinmeier debate was widely deemed a dud after all , the duller-than-dishwater debate between chancellor angela merkel and her challenger , frank-walter steinmeier , which aired a week ahead of the vote on germany 's first public broadcaster ard , did little to tickle the public 's interest - let alone attract the younger generation .
with the two rivals remaining civil and measured throughout , it could hardly even be termed a debate .
and in terms of ratings , it was a resounding flop : 7 million fewer viewers tuned in than did four years ago , and with 7,86 million watching , it attracted a market share of only 23,4 percent .
but merkel probably feels as though she currently has enough exposure in popular culture , now that a youtube video featuring her getting heckled by a " flash mob " at an election rally in hamburg has been watched by more than a quarter of a million people in the last week .
participants shouted " yeaahh " at every sentence spoken by the conservative leader , and waved placards with the words : " all together : yeaahh . "
" this is our political message and the political meaning of this flash mob - we wo n't swallow election campaign messages anymore and we 'll throw merkel 's rubbish back at her with a ironic ' yeaahh ' , " wrote rene walter on the nerdcore.de blog , according to news agency afp .
serious co-host barring an unexpected appearance , both merkel and steinmeier will be conspicuous in their absence on the raab show , but their colleagues can expect questions on topics chosen to appeal to a younger audience , such as education , youth unemployment and the internet .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 25.09.2009 fraud , corruption and espionage on the rise at german firms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two-thirds of corporate crime is committed by top and middle managers damages from white-collar crime at large german companies have almost tripled in recent years , according to a new study released this week .
more and more of the criminals are coming from the ranks of management . white-collar crime in germany has exploded in severity , the consulting firm pricewaterhousecoopers -lrb- pwc -rrb- said thursday , with over 60 percent of german companies reporting cases of industrial espionage , corruption and other offenses .
firms expect crime to worsen as a weak economy makes competition tougher and workers unhappier .
the average cost to a firm per incident has risen from 1.47 million euros four years ago to nearly 4.3 million euros today .
" the direct costs of crime are only the tip of the iceberg , " said pwc partner and former prosecutor steffem salvenmoser .
" above all , the reputational damage to a firm in cases of corruption , data theft or price-fixing is often greater than the measurable financial losses . "
the study 's results are based on a survey of 500 large german companies conducted by pwc in spring of 2009 , after the german economy sank into its deepest recession in over 60 years , propelled in part by the worldwide financial crisis .
over 40 percent of the surveyed firms expect competitors to use espionage or anti-competitive practices such as cartels to gain an advantage in a tough economic climate .
over a third of the companies expected workers to steal from their employers as concerns about holding onto jobs mounts .
crime from the corner office bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only 50 percent of managers accused of criminal deeds are prosecuted over 70 percent of the perpetrators were caught thanks to tipsters , the study said , despite increased investment in internal control measures designed to detect theft and fraud .
those results suggest that preventive measures have little effect according to professor kai bussmann from the martin luther university in halle , who worked on the study .
further tainting a company 's reputation is the finding that the perpetrators often come from the ranks of management .
the study said 29 percent were executives from the very top of the company 's leadership and 38 percent were middle managers .
many perpetrators were long time employees , 45 percent with more than ten years of tenure with the company and over 90 percent were men .
strikingly , despite the size and nature of the crimes , firms pressed charges against malfeasant managers just 50 percent of the time , compared to 61 percent in the pwc 's last survey in 2007 .
one fifth of the top managers who took part in crimes against their employers received no punishment whatsoever .
" although the relative leniency against perpetrators from the leadership level can be explained by the particular legal and factual difficulties of individual cases this practice is extremely problematic from vantage point of the credibility and leadership of management , " salvenmoser said. bn / ap / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the video was produced by t-online 's wahlzeit.tv website , after steini-girl offered them the song she wrote together with a friend .
" she just thinks he 's a really nice guy , " wahlzeit spokesman bjoern akstinat said .
steini-girl , whose real name is being kept secret , said her main aim " is to get people voting on sunday , and maybe i 'll get a few lucrative jobs out of it too . "
ironic love declaration in the video , steini-girl dances in front of the various seats of federal government in berlin , including the reichstag and the chancellery , wearing not many clothes and kissing pictures of social democrat chancellor candidate frank-walter steinmeier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's chances against chancellor merkel this sunday are thought to be slim the song itself is mainly an ironic love declaration to steinmeier , described in the lyrics as " coiled masculinity " , while his chief opponent in the election chancellor angela merkel is dismissed as " too masculine " .
the song also deems free liberal party leader guido westerwelle " too feminine " and prominent left party politician gregor gysi " too small " .
steini-girl is consciously based on obama girl , a similar viral video song performed by model amber lee ettinger , which was massively successful in the united states during the 2008 presidential election campaign .
obama girl has attracted over 15 million clicks on youtube to date , and made a minor celebrity of ettinger .
" my friend was in the usa last year when obama girl was totally popular , and she thought we should do that , so we just messed around and made a few rhymes , the way you do , " she told bild .
the spd has denied any involvement in making the video , and a spokesman for steinmeier would not reveal whether he had watched it. bk / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

steini-girl is consciously based on obama girl , a similar viral video song performed by model amber lee ettinger , which was massively successful in the united states during the 2008 presidential election campaign .
obama girl has attracted over 15 million clicks on youtube to date , and made a minor celebrity of ettinger .
" my friend was in the usa last year when obama girl was totally popular , and she thought we should do that , so we just messed around and made a few rhymes , the way you do , " she told bild .
the spd has denied any involvement in making the video , and a spokesman for steinmeier would not reveal whether he had watched it. bk / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

never have the spd 's poll ratings been so low shortly before national elections . their candidate for chancellor , frank-walter steinmeier , who has often been seen as a grey technocrat , has been unable to significantly boost the party 's popularity . only about 25 percent of the population say they would vote for the spd if elections were held today .
but the spd has kept up its mantra that it is aiming for a role in government , not opposition .
we take a look at the social democrats in germany , whose candidate for chancellor is thought to have little chance of gaining office . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in germany , politics and pop culture are like chalk and cheese .
but some of the more intrepid candidates in the upcoming parliamentary elections are now going where few have ever dared to tread : late-night tv . german politicians looked on enviously during the last us election campaign as then-presidential-hopeful barack obama managed to mobilize the youth vote .
it was primarily his use of the internet and social networking sites that helped him reach the blasé young people who in this generation have shown little interest in politics .
but media-savvy appearances on tv talk shows also helped propel obama into the forefront of popular culture .
in march , he became the first sitting president to appear on a late-night talk show when he dropped by " the tonight show with jay leno . "
rolling with the punches the strategy has clearly been noticed in germany - where the hope is that young voters will not only help sway the current , close election , but will stay true to their parties for life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tv host stefan raab does not treat his guests with kid gloves so politicians are starting to spread their wings .
appearing on established topical chat shows aired by public broadcasters and hosted by high-minded hosts such as anne will and maybrit illner are obviously nothing new .
but as parliamentary elections loom this weekend , a slew of berlin heavyweights , from the ever-slick economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg to the loquacious left party candidate gregor gysi , have decided to take their cues from obama and appear on prime-time private broadcaster prosieben .
joining them for an election-night panel on a saturday night show will be social democrat chairman franz muentefering , while liberal free democrats and the green party are sending their respective frontrunner candidates guido westerwelle and juergen trittin .
the show ’ s host is none other than stefan raab , enfant terrible of late-night viewing .
as a tv personality , he 's famous for making his interviewees squirm - and a lot more used to grilling guests such as germany 's next top model and kylie minogue than political leaders .
over exposure still , he wo n't be the only one treading new ground . a turn on a show as anchored in youth culture as " tv total bundestagswahl 2009 " certainly marks a departure for senior politicians .
but it is likely to be a canny move .
when an election show hosted by raab aired on the eve of the vote four years ago , it snagged a 29 percent market share of the 14 -29 age group category .
obviously , politicians have decided to do whatever it takes to galvanize young voters out of their living rooms and into the polling stations come sunday , and if that means subjecting themselves to raab 's punishing wit , they 're willing to roll with the punches .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the heavily plugged merkel- steinmeier debate was widely deemed a dud after all , the duller-than-dishwater debate between chancellor angela merkel and her challenger , frank-walter steinmeier , which aired a week ahead of the vote on germany 's first public broadcaster ard , did little to tickle the public 's interest - let alone attract the younger generation .
with the two rivals remaining civil and measured throughout , it could hardly even be termed a debate .
and in terms of ratings , it was a resounding flop : 7 million fewer viewers tuned in than did four years ago , and with 7,86 million watching , it attracted a market share of only 23,4 percent .
but merkel probably feels as though she currently has enough exposure in popular culture , now that a youtube video featuring her getting heckled by a " flash mob " at an election rally in hamburg has been watched by more than a quarter of a million people in the last week .
participants shouted " yeaahh " at every sentence spoken by the conservative leader , and waved placards with the words : " all together : yeaahh . "
" this is our political message and the political meaning of this flash mob - we wo n't swallow election campaign messages anymore and we 'll throw merkel 's rubbish back at her with a ironic ' yeaahh ' , " wrote rene walter on the nerdcore.de blog , according to news agency afp .
serious co-host barring an unexpected appearance , both merkel and steinmeier will be conspicuous in their absence on the raab show , but their colleagues can expect questions on topics chosen to appeal to a younger audience , such as education , youth unemployment and the internet .
co-hosting with raab will be experienced political journalist peter limbourg , who was quoted in the daily tagesspiegel as saying that he " expects some tough talking . "
" the point is to get as many people as possible to vote , " he said .

in germany , politics and pop culture are like chalk and cheese .
but some of the more intrepid candidates in the upcoming parliamentary elections are now going where few have ever dared to tread : late-night tv . german politicians looked on enviously during the last us election campaign as then-presidential-hopeful barack obama managed to mobilize the youth vote .
it was primarily his use of the internet and social networking sites that helped him reach the blasé young people who in this generation have shown little interest in politics .
but media-savvy appearances on tv talk shows also helped propel obama into the forefront of popular culture .
in march , he became the first sitting president to appear on a late-night talk show when he dropped by " the tonight show with jay leno . "
rolling with the punches the strategy has clearly been noticed in germany - where the hope is that young voters will not only help sway the current , close election , but will stay true to their parties for life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tv host stefan raab does not treat his guests with kid gloves so politicians are starting to spread their wings .
appearing on established topical chat shows aired by public broadcasters and hosted by high-minded hosts such as anne will and maybrit illner are obviously nothing new .
but as parliamentary elections loom this weekend , a slew of berlin heavyweights , from the ever-slick economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg to the loquacious left party candidate gregor gysi , have decided to take their cues from obama and appear on prime-time private broadcaster prosieben .
joining them for an election-night panel on a saturday night show will be social democrat chairman franz muentefering , while liberal free democrats and the green party are sending their respective frontrunner candidates guido westerwelle and juergen trittin .
the show ’ s host is none other than stefan raab , enfant terrible of late-night viewing .
as a tv personality , he 's famous for making his interviewees squirm - and a lot more used to grilling guests such as germany 's next top model and kylie minogue than political leaders .
over exposure still , he wo n't be the only one treading new ground . a turn on a show as anchored in youth culture as " tv total bundestagswahl 2009 " certainly marks a departure for senior politicians .

and in terms of ratings , it was a resounding flop : 7 million fewer viewers tuned in than did four years ago , and with 7,86 million watching , it attracted a market share of only 23,4 percent .
but merkel probably feels as though she currently has enough exposure in popular culture , now that a youtube video featuring her getting heckled by a " flash mob " at an election rally in hamburg has been watched by more than a quarter of a million people in the last week .
participants shouted " yeaahh " at every sentence spoken by the conservative leader , and waved placards with the words : " all together : yeaahh . "
" this is our political message and the political meaning of this flash mob - we wo n't swallow election campaign messages anymore and we 'll throw merkel 's rubbish back at her with a ironic ' yeaahh ' , " wrote rene walter on the nerdcore.de blog , according to news agency afp .
serious co-host barring an unexpected appearance , both merkel and steinmeier will be conspicuous in their absence on the raab show , but their colleagues can expect questions on topics chosen to appeal to a younger audience , such as education , youth unemployment and the internet .
co-hosting with raab will be experienced political journalist peter limbourg , who was quoted in the daily tagesspiegel as saying that he " expects some tough talking . "
" the point is to get as many people as possible to vote , " he said .

more and more of the criminals are coming from the ranks of management . white-collar crime in germany has exploded in severity , the consulting firm pricewaterhousecoopers -lrb- pwc -rrb- said thursday , with over 60 percent of german companies reporting cases of industrial espionage , corruption and other offenses .
firms expect crime to worsen as a weak economy makes competition tougher and workers unhappier .
the average cost to a firm per incident has risen from 1.47 million euros four years ago to nearly 4.3 million euros today .
" the direct costs of crime are only the tip of the iceberg , " said pwc partner and former prosecutor steffem salvenmoser .
" above all , the reputational damage to a firm in cases of corruption , data theft or price-fixing is often greater than the measurable financial losses . "
the study 's results are based on a survey of 500 large german companies conducted by pwc in spring of 2009 , after the german economy sank into its deepest recession in over 60 years , propelled in part by the worldwide financial crisis .
over 40 percent of the surveyed firms expect competitors to use espionage or anti-competitive practices such as cartels to gain an advantage in a tough economic climate .
over a third of the companies expected workers to steal from their employers as concerns about holding onto jobs mounts .
crime from the corner office bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only 50 percent of managers accused of criminal deeds are prosecuted over 70 percent of the perpetrators were caught thanks to tipsters , the study said , despite increased investment in internal control measures designed to detect theft and fraud .
those results suggest that preventive measures have little effect according to professor kai bussmann from the martin luther university in halle , who worked on the study .
further tainting a company 's reputation is the finding that the perpetrators often come from the ranks of management .
the study said 29 percent were executives from the very top of the company 's leadership and 38 percent were middle managers .
many perpetrators were long time employees , 45 percent with more than ten years of tenure with the company and over 90 percent were men .
strikingly , despite the size and nature of the crimes , firms pressed charges against malfeasant managers just 50 percent of the time , compared to 61 percent in the pwc 's last survey in 2007 .
one fifth of the top managers who took part in crimes against their employers received no punishment whatsoever .
" although the relative leniency against perpetrators from the leadership level can be explained by the particular legal and factual difficulties of individual cases this practice is extremely problematic from vantage point of the credibility and leadership of management , " salvenmoser said. bn / ap / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

more and more of the criminals are coming from the ranks of management . white-collar crime in germany has exploded in severity , the consulting firm pricewaterhousecoopers -lrb- pwc -rrb- said thursday , with over 60 percent of german companies reporting cases of industrial espionage , corruption and other offenses .
firms expect crime to worsen as a weak economy makes competition tougher and workers unhappier .
the average cost to a firm per incident has risen from 1.47 million euros four years ago to nearly 4.3 million euros today .
" the direct costs of crime are only the tip of the iceberg , " said pwc partner and former prosecutor steffem salvenmoser .
" above all , the reputational damage to a firm in cases of corruption , data theft or price-fixing is often greater than the measurable financial losses . "
the study 's results are based on a survey of 500 large german companies conducted by pwc in spring of 2009 , after the german economy sank into its deepest recession in over 60 years , propelled in part by the worldwide financial crisis .
over 40 percent of the surveyed firms expect competitors to use espionage or anti-competitive practices such as cartels to gain an advantage in a tough economic climate .

those results suggest that preventive measures have little effect according to professor kai bussmann from the martin luther university in halle , who worked on the study .
further tainting a company 's reputation is the finding that the perpetrators often come from the ranks of management .
the study said 29 percent were executives from the very top of the company 's leadership and 38 percent were middle managers .
many perpetrators were long time employees , 45 percent with more than ten years of tenure with the company and over 90 percent were men .
strikingly , despite the size and nature of the crimes , firms pressed charges against malfeasant managers just 50 percent of the time , compared to 61 percent in the pwc 's last survey in 2007 .

this week witnessed some important meetings for climate negotiations .
world leaders gathered for two high-level conferences in the us .
a leading us scientific advisor gave dw his thoughts on where climate talks stood . alden meyer is director of strategy and policy for the union of concerned scientists – a us organisation which campaigns for tough international action to tackle global warming .
meyer has 30 years experience advising government on environmental and energy issues , and spoke to deutsche welle from the g20 summit in pittsburgh .
he said world leaders made some progress when they met in new york for a special one-day climate summit .
he added that although the united states remains distracted by a struggle over health care reform , the g20 could prove to unblock efforts to get an ambitious agreement at december 's crucial climate conference in copenhagen .
deutsche welle : what struck you about world leaders ' addresses on climate change on tuesday ?
alden meyer : one of the significant developments at the special summit on climate change on tuesday was the commitment by chinese president hu jintao that china would put forward a carbon intensity target for china between now and 2020 that is to reduce the emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases as a proportion of their economic output .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meyer has testified before congress on global warming and energy issues it is the first time china has made that proposal .
he did not put forward a specific number , and obviously we have to wait to see how aggressive that carbon intensity reduction goal is , but it was a meaningful offer by china.i think that added some momentum coming out of new york , going into pittsburgh and on to copenhagen at the end of the year .
also , japan , the new prime minister there , pledging to increase japan 's greenhouse gas reduction target from the minus eight percent below 1990 levels , pledged by the previous government , to 25 percent below 1990 levels .
of course that 's much more in keeping with the proposal that the european union has put forward and begins to be within the range of what the science says we need to do to get a handle on the problem .
some commentators were quite disappointed with the us position , with obama 's remarks , how did you perceive them ?
i think he said a lot of the right things in terms of the urgency of the problem ; that he gets it on the science ; that the us is committed to do its part on this .
he gave a good overview of all the things he and his administration have done in the eight months since he took office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's un address won a luke warm reception from some observers i think what was disappointing to a lot of observers , and particularly to those from other countries , was that he did n't say very much about the need for the senate in our country to take action on domestic climate legislation in advance of copenhagen .
he did mention that the house has already passed a domestic climate bill and that committees in the senate are starting to consider it , but he did n't lay down the gauntlet and say to the senate ' i really need you to do this by copenhagen so that i can go in there with the credibility of the congressional backing for the position i want to take at that meeting . '
i think people understand the situation he is in .
he is fighting very hard for a domestic health care bill .
they are focused on that like a laser and do n't want to be distracting the senate with talk about other issues , but i think there is more and more impatience on the international scene about the fact that one body of our congress is threatening to hold up the whole process in copenhagen .
two years ago countries agreed to reach a new deal to replace the kyoto protocol by the end of this year , yet negotiations remain about as deadlocked as they have been for the better part of a decade .
how likely is it that we 'll see an agreement at the next big round of negotiations in copenhagen in december – especially given , as you said , that the senate in the us seems to be holding up the process ?
i think there are two big issues here .
one is what the state is of the us domestic debate .
if the president comes to copenhagen with the senate moving forward on climate legislation – with a leadership bill having been introduced and expressions of support – i think he 'll have more credibility .
certainly more than president clinton and vice-president gore did in kyoto when everyone knew that congress was not likely to back what they were putting forward .
the other piece , which is equally daunting frankly , is the issue of climate finance : the roughly 100-150 billion euro-a-year estimates for developing countries for mitigation and adaptation activities on climate change .
and there it 's not just the us , but europe and japan as well which have to do much more to advance that issue before copenhagen .
many of the developing countries have made it clear that if there is not the serious financing and technology package on offer in copenhagen that was promised back in bali two years ago , there 's not going to be a deal from their side .
bildunterschrift : western money to pay for clean development could be a deal-breaker there are still critics who question not only whether an international deal is feasible , but whether it is even desirable .
the controversial danish statistician björn lomborg told deutsche welle this week that cutting emissions was too expensive and ultimately futile .
he said the world would get more bang for its buck by investing in super-projects to pump clouds into the atmosphere to cool the planet .
does lomborg have a point ?
we certainly disagree with his premise that cutting carbon emissions is expensive .
as a matter of fact , my organization just completed an analysis of the us potential for emission reductions showing that we could go far beyond the reductions that the president and the congress are talking about , and that -lrb- we could provide -rrb- savings for consumers .
the reality is , particularly energy efficiency investments pay back very quickly , and then you get benefits from that for years to come .
there are also signals that wind energy and other renewable technologies are coming down in price .
wind is taking off in the united states as it is in other parts of the world , so i fundamentally disagree with the premise that cutting emissions has to be expensive .
yes there is some cost , but it is much less than the cost of damages from climate change that we will see if we do n't take action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish statistician bjorn lomborg says money would be better spent elsewhere when it comes to the issue of geo-engineering , this is obviously something the science community is starting to talk about .
it is very controversial , because obviously these are unproven technologies , and more importantly there could be side-effects from these large-scale geo-engineering schemes that we do n't fully understand .
we 're obviously not doing a very good of regulating the planet with our activities now , and to think that we can have some kind of technical fix that works without some kind of unforeseen side-effect is a little bit of hubris on our part .
so i think there is some interest in exploring some of these options , but i think to hang your whole strategy on that would be a grave mistake .
so what are some of the biggest challenges going to be in securing a good deal at copenhagen at the end of the year ?
indeed , what would amount to a good deal ?
i think what you need for a good deal is something that 's ambitious , that 's in line with what the science says we have to do to bend the emissions curve .
this means we need deeper reductions than what most of the industrialized countries are to date putting on the table .
we also need action by the major developing countries to see a deviation from their business-as-usual growth-path in emissions over the next decade or so , with a view towards eventually having an absolute cap and eventual reduction in their emission later this century .
and we need a substantial financing and technology package to help make those countries make the transition – to basically leap-frog across the way the industrialized countries did their development over the last century , and go right to cleaner technologies .
i think that 's going to be a real challenge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : per capita , indians produce a tenth of the co2 that americans do there also has to be a fair agreement .
it has to recognize the different stages of development that different countries are at ; that acknowledges the fact that a country like india , for example , emits two tones of carbon per person or less , whereas my country , the united states , emits 20 tones per person – ten times as much .
so it 's not fair to ask india to do the same as the united states in terms of taking leadership .
it is fair to ask india to do something , and to do more than they have been , and i think they 're showing signals that they 're willing to step up to the plate on that , as is china and other countries , but equity is a key part of this .
the third element is that it has to be binding .
it has to be something that is not just a voluntary commitment , but where countries look each other in the eye and say ' we are going to do this , we are going to have a system of verification , a system of compliance , that assures us that each of is doing our part in what we agreed to in copenhagen .
those are the three basic elements – it has to be fair , it has to be ambitious and it has to be binding .
climate change is also on the agenda when the leaders of the group of 20 major economies meet on thursday and friday .
some say the g20 could prove to be an even more important venue to overcome deadlocks between rich nations like the us and developing countries like china … the two issues that are on the agenda here in pittsburgh this week are climate finance .
how do you generate and govern the flows of investment that are needed for clean energy technologies ; reducing the rate of deforestation in tropical rainforest countries ; and for helping the poorest countries adapt to the impacts of climate change .
that 's going to be a big discussion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the g20 be the right venue to broker a compromise ?
the other issue , which the us has put on the agenda , is the issue of fossil fuel subsidies .
it turns out that the world is spending somewhere around 200 billion dollars a year or more encouraging production and consumption on the very things we 're trying to reduce to deal with global warming – that 's coal and oil .
so that topic is on the agenda , we 'll see how far we get with that , that 's obviously a very difficult issue - not only for the united states , but other countries .
it 's very political and there are entrenched interests that benefit from those embedded subsidies and will fight very hard against efforts to reduce or eliminate them .
climate is just one of the topics , but it is the first time that it has been on the agenda in a way like at the g20 and i think that does give us some prospect of movement .
certainly if they do some follow up between pittsburgh and copenhagen and the g20 process , they could help deliver that element of the package on climate finance . interview : nathan witkop editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

certainly more than president clinton and vice-president gore did in kyoto when everyone knew that congress was not likely to back what they were putting forward .
the other piece , which is equally daunting frankly , is the issue of climate finance : the roughly 100-150 billion euro-a-year estimates for developing countries for mitigation and adaptation activities on climate change .
and there it 's not just the us , but europe and japan as well which have to do much more to advance that issue before copenhagen .
many of the developing countries have made it clear that if there is not the serious financing and technology package on offer in copenhagen that was promised back in bali two years ago , there 's not going to be a deal from their side .
bildunterschrift : western money to pay for clean development could be a deal-breaker there are still critics who question not only whether an international deal is feasible , but whether it is even desirable .
the controversial danish statistician björn lomborg told deutsche welle this week that cutting emissions was too expensive and ultimately futile .
he said the world would get more bang for its buck by investing in super-projects to pump clouds into the atmosphere to cool the planet .
does lomborg have a point ?
we certainly disagree with his premise that cutting carbon emissions is expensive .
as a matter of fact , my organization just completed an analysis of the us potential for emission reductions showing that we could go far beyond the reductions that the president and the congress are talking about , and that -lrb- we could provide -rrb- savings for consumers .
the reality is , particularly energy efficiency investments pay back very quickly , and then you get benefits from that for years to come .
there are also signals that wind energy and other renewable technologies are coming down in price .
wind is taking off in the united states as it is in other parts of the world , so i fundamentally disagree with the premise that cutting emissions has to be expensive .
yes there is some cost , but it is much less than the cost of damages from climate change that we will see if we do n't take action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish statistician bjorn lomborg says money would be better spent elsewhere when it comes to the issue of geo-engineering , this is obviously something the science community is starting to talk about .
it is very controversial , because obviously these are unproven technologies , and more importantly there could be side-effects from these large-scale geo-engineering schemes that we do n't fully understand .
we 're obviously not doing a very good of regulating the planet with our activities now , and to think that we can have some kind of technical fix that works without some kind of unforeseen side-effect is a little bit of hubris on our part .
so i think there is some interest in exploring some of these options , but i think to hang your whole strategy on that would be a grave mistake .
so what are some of the biggest challenges going to be in securing a good deal at copenhagen at the end of the year ?
indeed , what would amount to a good deal ?
i think what you need for a good deal is something that 's ambitious , that 's in line with what the science says we have to do to bend the emissions curve .
this means we need deeper reductions than what most of the industrialized countries are to date putting on the table .
we also need action by the major developing countries to see a deviation from their business-as-usual growth-path in emissions over the next decade or so , with a view towards eventually having an absolute cap and eventual reduction in their emission later this century .
and we need a substantial financing and technology package to help make those countries make the transition – to basically leap-frog across the way the industrialized countries did their development over the last century , and go right to cleaner technologies .
i think that 's going to be a real challenge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : per capita , indians produce a tenth of the co2 that americans do there also has to be a fair agreement .
it has to recognize the different stages of development that different countries are at ; that acknowledges the fact that a country like india , for example , emits two tones of carbon per person or less , whereas my country , the united states , emits 20 tones per person – ten times as much .
so it 's not fair to ask india to do the same as the united states in terms of taking leadership .
it is fair to ask india to do something , and to do more than they have been , and i think they 're showing signals that they 're willing to step up to the plate on that , as is china and other countries , but equity is a key part of this .
the third element is that it has to be binding .
it has to be something that is not just a voluntary commitment , but where countries look each other in the eye and say ' we are going to do this , we are going to have a system of verification , a system of compliance , that assures us that each of is doing our part in what we agreed to in copenhagen .
those are the three basic elements – it has to be fair , it has to be ambitious and it has to be binding .
climate change is also on the agenda when the leaders of the group of 20 major economies meet on thursday and friday .
some say the g20 could prove to be an even more important venue to overcome deadlocks between rich nations like the us and developing countries like china … the two issues that are on the agenda here in pittsburgh this week are climate finance .
how do you generate and govern the flows of investment that are needed for clean energy technologies ; reducing the rate of deforestation in tropical rainforest countries ; and for helping the poorest countries adapt to the impacts of climate change .
that 's going to be a big discussion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the g20 be the right venue to broker a compromise ?
the other issue , which the us has put on the agenda , is the issue of fossil fuel subsidies .
it turns out that the world is spending somewhere around 200 billion dollars a year or more encouraging production and consumption on the very things we 're trying to reduce to deal with global warming – that 's coal and oil .
so that topic is on the agenda , we 'll see how far we get with that , that 's obviously a very difficult issue - not only for the united states , but other countries .
it 's very political and there are entrenched interests that benefit from those embedded subsidies and will fight very hard against efforts to reduce or eliminate them .
climate is just one of the topics , but it is the first time that it has been on the agenda in a way like at the g20 and i think that does give us some prospect of movement .
certainly if they do some follow up between pittsburgh and copenhagen and the g20 process , they could help deliver that element of the package on climate finance . interview : nathan witkop editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this week witnessed some important meetings for climate negotiations .
world leaders gathered for two high-level conferences in the us .
a leading us scientific advisor gave dw his thoughts on where climate talks stood . alden meyer is director of strategy and policy for the union of concerned scientists – a us organisation which campaigns for tough international action to tackle global warming .
meyer has 30 years experience advising government on environmental and energy issues , and spoke to deutsche welle from the g20 summit in pittsburgh .
he said world leaders made some progress when they met in new york for a special one-day climate summit .
he added that although the united states remains distracted by a struggle over health care reform , the g20 could prove to unblock efforts to get an ambitious agreement at december 's crucial climate conference in copenhagen .
deutsche welle : what struck you about world leaders ' addresses on climate change on tuesday ?
alden meyer : one of the significant developments at the special summit on climate change on tuesday was the commitment by chinese president hu jintao that china would put forward a carbon intensity target for china between now and 2020 that is to reduce the emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases as a proportion of their economic output .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meyer has testified before congress on global warming and energy issues it is the first time china has made that proposal .
he did not put forward a specific number , and obviously we have to wait to see how aggressive that carbon intensity reduction goal is , but it was a meaningful offer by china.i think that added some momentum coming out of new york , going into pittsburgh and on to copenhagen at the end of the year .
also , japan , the new prime minister there , pledging to increase japan 's greenhouse gas reduction target from the minus eight percent below 1990 levels , pledged by the previous government , to 25 percent below 1990 levels .
of course that 's much more in keeping with the proposal that the european union has put forward and begins to be within the range of what the science says we need to do to get a handle on the problem .
some commentators were quite disappointed with the us position , with obama 's remarks , how did you perceive them ?
i think he said a lot of the right things in terms of the urgency of the problem ; that he gets it on the science ; that the us is committed to do its part on this .
he gave a good overview of all the things he and his administration have done in the eight months since he took office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's un address won a luke warm reception from some observers i think what was disappointing to a lot of observers , and particularly to those from other countries , was that he did n't say very much about the need for the senate in our country to take action on domestic climate legislation in advance of copenhagen .
he did mention that the house has already passed a domestic climate bill and that committees in the senate are starting to consider it , but he did n't lay down the gauntlet and say to the senate ' i really need you to do this by copenhagen so that i can go in there with the credibility of the congressional backing for the position i want to take at that meeting . '
i think people understand the situation he is in .
he is fighting very hard for a domestic health care bill .
they are focused on that like a laser and do n't want to be distracting the senate with talk about other issues , but i think there is more and more impatience on the international scene about the fact that one body of our congress is threatening to hold up the whole process in copenhagen .
two years ago countries agreed to reach a new deal to replace the kyoto protocol by the end of this year , yet negotiations remain about as deadlocked as they have been for the better part of a decade .
how likely is it that we 'll see an agreement at the next big round of negotiations in copenhagen in december – especially given , as you said , that the senate in the us seems to be holding up the process ?
i think there are two big issues here .
one is what the state is of the us domestic debate .
if the president comes to copenhagen with the senate moving forward on climate legislation – with a leadership bill having been introduced and expressions of support – i think he 'll have more credibility .

how do you generate and govern the flows of investment that are needed for clean energy technologies ; reducing the rate of deforestation in tropical rainforest countries ; and for helping the poorest countries adapt to the impacts of climate change .
that 's going to be a big discussion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the g20 be the right venue to broker a compromise ?
the other issue , which the us has put on the agenda , is the issue of fossil fuel subsidies .
it turns out that the world is spending somewhere around 200 billion dollars a year or more encouraging production and consumption on the very things we 're trying to reduce to deal with global warming – that 's coal and oil .
so that topic is on the agenda , we 'll see how far we get with that , that 's obviously a very difficult issue - not only for the united states , but other countries .
it 's very political and there are entrenched interests that benefit from those embedded subsidies and will fight very hard against efforts to reduce or eliminate them .
climate is just one of the topics , but it is the first time that it has been on the agenda in a way like at the g20 and i think that does give us some prospect of movement .
certainly if they do some follow up between pittsburgh and copenhagen and the g20 process , they could help deliver that element of the package on climate finance . interview : nathan witkop editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this week witnessed some important meetings for climate negotiations .
world leaders gathered for two high-level conferences in the us .
a leading us scientific advisor gave dw his thoughts on where climate talks stood . alden meyer is director of strategy and policy for the union of concerned scientists – a us organisation which campaigns for tough international action to tackle global warming .
meyer has 30 years experience advising government on environmental and energy issues , and spoke to deutsche welle from the g20 summit in pittsburgh .
he said world leaders made some progress when they met in new york for a special one-day climate summit .
he added that although the united states remains distracted by a struggle over health care reform , the g20 could prove to unblock efforts to get an ambitious agreement at december 's crucial climate conference in copenhagen .
deutsche welle : what struck you about world leaders ' addresses on climate change on tuesday ?
alden meyer : one of the significant developments at the special summit on climate change on tuesday was the commitment by chinese president hu jintao that china would put forward a carbon intensity target for china between now and 2020 that is to reduce the emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases as a proportion of their economic output .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meyer has testified before congress on global warming and energy issues it is the first time china has made that proposal .
he did not put forward a specific number , and obviously we have to wait to see how aggressive that carbon intensity reduction goal is , but it was a meaningful offer by china.i think that added some momentum coming out of new york , going into pittsburgh and on to copenhagen at the end of the year .
also , japan , the new prime minister there , pledging to increase japan 's greenhouse gas reduction target from the minus eight percent below 1990 levels , pledged by the previous government , to 25 percent below 1990 levels .
of course that 's much more in keeping with the proposal that the european union has put forward and begins to be within the range of what the science says we need to do to get a handle on the problem .
some commentators were quite disappointed with the us position , with obama 's remarks , how did you perceive them ?
i think he said a lot of the right things in terms of the urgency of the problem ; that he gets it on the science ; that the us is committed to do its part on this .
he gave a good overview of all the things he and his administration have done in the eight months since he took office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's un address won a luke warm reception from some observers i think what was disappointing to a lot of observers , and particularly to those from other countries , was that he did n't say very much about the need for the senate in our country to take action on domestic climate legislation in advance of copenhagen .
he did mention that the house has already passed a domestic climate bill and that committees in the senate are starting to consider it , but he did n't lay down the gauntlet and say to the senate ' i really need you to do this by copenhagen so that i can go in there with the credibility of the congressional backing for the position i want to take at that meeting . '
i think people understand the situation he is in .
he is fighting very hard for a domestic health care bill .
they are focused on that like a laser and do n't want to be distracting the senate with talk about other issues , but i think there is more and more impatience on the international scene about the fact that one body of our congress is threatening to hold up the whole process in copenhagen .
two years ago countries agreed to reach a new deal to replace the kyoto protocol by the end of this year , yet negotiations remain about as deadlocked as they have been for the better part of a decade .
how likely is it that we 'll see an agreement at the next big round of negotiations in copenhagen in december – especially given , as you said , that the senate in the us seems to be holding up the process ?
i think there are two big issues here .
one is what the state is of the us domestic debate .
if the president comes to copenhagen with the senate moving forward on climate legislation – with a leadership bill having been introduced and expressions of support – i think he 'll have more credibility .
certainly more than president clinton and vice-president gore did in kyoto when everyone knew that congress was not likely to back what they were putting forward .
the other piece , which is equally daunting frankly , is the issue of climate finance : the roughly 100-150 billion euro-a-year estimates for developing countries for mitigation and adaptation activities on climate change .
and there it 's not just the us , but europe and japan as well which have to do much more to advance that issue before copenhagen .
many of the developing countries have made it clear that if there is not the serious financing and technology package on offer in copenhagen that was promised back in bali two years ago , there 's not going to be a deal from their side .
bildunterschrift : western money to pay for clean development could be a deal-breaker there are still critics who question not only whether an international deal is feasible , but whether it is even desirable .
the controversial danish statistician björn lomborg told deutsche welle this week that cutting emissions was too expensive and ultimately futile .
he said the world would get more bang for its buck by investing in super-projects to pump clouds into the atmosphere to cool the planet .
does lomborg have a point ?
we certainly disagree with his premise that cutting carbon emissions is expensive .
as a matter of fact , my organization just completed an analysis of the us potential for emission reductions showing that we could go far beyond the reductions that the president and the congress are talking about , and that -lrb- we could provide -rrb- savings for consumers .
the reality is , particularly energy efficiency investments pay back very quickly , and then you get benefits from that for years to come .
there are also signals that wind energy and other renewable technologies are coming down in price .
wind is taking off in the united states as it is in other parts of the world , so i fundamentally disagree with the premise that cutting emissions has to be expensive .
yes there is some cost , but it is much less than the cost of damages from climate change that we will see if we do n't take action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish statistician bjorn lomborg says money would be better spent elsewhere when it comes to the issue of geo-engineering , this is obviously something the science community is starting to talk about .
it is very controversial , because obviously these are unproven technologies , and more importantly there could be side-effects from these large-scale geo-engineering schemes that we do n't fully understand .
we 're obviously not doing a very good of regulating the planet with our activities now , and to think that we can have some kind of technical fix that works without some kind of unforeseen side-effect is a little bit of hubris on our part .
so i think there is some interest in exploring some of these options , but i think to hang your whole strategy on that would be a grave mistake .
so what are some of the biggest challenges going to be in securing a good deal at copenhagen at the end of the year ?
indeed , what would amount to a good deal ?
i think what you need for a good deal is something that 's ambitious , that 's in line with what the science says we have to do to bend the emissions curve .
this means we need deeper reductions than what most of the industrialized countries are to date putting on the table .
we also need action by the major developing countries to see a deviation from their business-as-usual growth-path in emissions over the next decade or so , with a view towards eventually having an absolute cap and eventual reduction in their emission later this century .
and we need a substantial financing and technology package to help make those countries make the transition – to basically leap-frog across the way the industrialized countries did their development over the last century , and go right to cleaner technologies .
i think that 's going to be a real challenge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : per capita , indians produce a tenth of the co2 that americans do there also has to be a fair agreement .
it has to recognize the different stages of development that different countries are at ; that acknowledges the fact that a country like india , for example , emits two tones of carbon per person or less , whereas my country , the united states , emits 20 tones per person – ten times as much .
so it 's not fair to ask india to do the same as the united states in terms of taking leadership .
it is fair to ask india to do something , and to do more than they have been , and i think they 're showing signals that they 're willing to step up to the plate on that , as is china and other countries , but equity is a key part of this .
the third element is that it has to be binding .
it has to be something that is not just a voluntary commitment , but where countries look each other in the eye and say ' we are going to do this , we are going to have a system of verification , a system of compliance , that assures us that each of is doing our part in what we agreed to in copenhagen .
those are the three basic elements – it has to be fair , it has to be ambitious and it has to be binding .
climate change is also on the agenda when the leaders of the group of 20 major economies meet on thursday and friday .
some say the g20 could prove to be an even more important venue to overcome deadlocks between rich nations like the us and developing countries like china … the two issues that are on the agenda here in pittsburgh this week are climate finance .

a leading us scientific advisor gave dw his thoughts on where climate talks stood . alden meyer is director of strategy and policy for the union of concerned scientists – a us organisation which campaigns for tough international action to tackle global warming .
meyer has 30 years experience advising government on environmental and energy issues , and spoke to deutsche welle from the g20 summit in pittsburgh .
he said world leaders made some progress when they met in new york for a special one-day climate summit .
he added that although the united states remains distracted by a struggle over health care reform , the g20 could prove to unblock efforts to get an ambitious agreement at december 's crucial climate conference in copenhagen .
deutsche welle : what struck you about world leaders ' addresses on climate change on tuesday ?
alden meyer : one of the significant developments at the special summit on climate change on tuesday was the commitment by chinese president hu jintao that china would put forward a carbon intensity target for china between now and 2020 that is to reduce the emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases as a proportion of their economic output .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meyer has testified before congress on global warming and energy issues it is the first time china has made that proposal .
he did not put forward a specific number , and obviously we have to wait to see how aggressive that carbon intensity reduction goal is , but it was a meaningful offer by china.i think that added some momentum coming out of new york , going into pittsburgh and on to copenhagen at the end of the year .
also , japan , the new prime minister there , pledging to increase japan 's greenhouse gas reduction target from the minus eight percent below 1990 levels , pledged by the previous government , to 25 percent below 1990 levels .
of course that 's much more in keeping with the proposal that the european union has put forward and begins to be within the range of what the science says we need to do to get a handle on the problem .
some commentators were quite disappointed with the us position , with obama 's remarks , how did you perceive them ?
i think he said a lot of the right things in terms of the urgency of the problem ; that he gets it on the science ; that the us is committed to do its part on this .
he gave a good overview of all the things he and his administration have done in the eight months since he took office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's un address won a luke warm reception from some observers i think what was disappointing to a lot of observers , and particularly to those from other countries , was that he did n't say very much about the need for the senate in our country to take action on domestic climate legislation in advance of copenhagen .
he did mention that the house has already passed a domestic climate bill and that committees in the senate are starting to consider it , but he did n't lay down the gauntlet and say to the senate ' i really need you to do this by copenhagen so that i can go in there with the credibility of the congressional backing for the position i want to take at that meeting . '
i think people understand the situation he is in .
he is fighting very hard for a domestic health care bill .
they are focused on that like a laser and do n't want to be distracting the senate with talk about other issues , but i think there is more and more impatience on the international scene about the fact that one body of our congress is threatening to hold up the whole process in copenhagen .
two years ago countries agreed to reach a new deal to replace the kyoto protocol by the end of this year , yet negotiations remain about as deadlocked as they have been for the better part of a decade .
how likely is it that we 'll see an agreement at the next big round of negotiations in copenhagen in december – especially given , as you said , that the senate in the us seems to be holding up the process ?
i think there are two big issues here .
one is what the state is of the us domestic debate .
if the president comes to copenhagen with the senate moving forward on climate legislation – with a leadership bill having been introduced and expressions of support – i think he 'll have more credibility .
certainly more than president clinton and vice-president gore did in kyoto when everyone knew that congress was not likely to back what they were putting forward .
the other piece , which is equally daunting frankly , is the issue of climate finance : the roughly 100-150 billion euro-a-year estimates for developing countries for mitigation and adaptation activities on climate change .
and there it 's not just the us , but europe and japan as well which have to do much more to advance that issue before copenhagen .
many of the developing countries have made it clear that if there is not the serious financing and technology package on offer in copenhagen that was promised back in bali two years ago , there 's not going to be a deal from their side .
bildunterschrift : western money to pay for clean development could be a deal-breaker there are still critics who question not only whether an international deal is feasible , but whether it is even desirable .
the controversial danish statistician björn lomborg told deutsche welle this week that cutting emissions was too expensive and ultimately futile .
he said the world would get more bang for its buck by investing in super-projects to pump clouds into the atmosphere to cool the planet .
does lomborg have a point ?
we certainly disagree with his premise that cutting carbon emissions is expensive .
as a matter of fact , my organization just completed an analysis of the us potential for emission reductions showing that we could go far beyond the reductions that the president and the congress are talking about , and that -lrb- we could provide -rrb- savings for consumers .
the reality is , particularly energy efficiency investments pay back very quickly , and then you get benefits from that for years to come .
there are also signals that wind energy and other renewable technologies are coming down in price .
wind is taking off in the united states as it is in other parts of the world , so i fundamentally disagree with the premise that cutting emissions has to be expensive .
yes there is some cost , but it is much less than the cost of damages from climate change that we will see if we do n't take action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish statistician bjorn lomborg says money would be better spent elsewhere when it comes to the issue of geo-engineering , this is obviously something the science community is starting to talk about .
it is very controversial , because obviously these are unproven technologies , and more importantly there could be side-effects from these large-scale geo-engineering schemes that we do n't fully understand .
we 're obviously not doing a very good of regulating the planet with our activities now , and to think that we can have some kind of technical fix that works without some kind of unforeseen side-effect is a little bit of hubris on our part .
so i think there is some interest in exploring some of these options , but i think to hang your whole strategy on that would be a grave mistake .
so what are some of the biggest challenges going to be in securing a good deal at copenhagen at the end of the year ?
indeed , what would amount to a good deal ?
i think what you need for a good deal is something that 's ambitious , that 's in line with what the science says we have to do to bend the emissions curve .
this means we need deeper reductions than what most of the industrialized countries are to date putting on the table .
we also need action by the major developing countries to see a deviation from their business-as-usual growth-path in emissions over the next decade or so , with a view towards eventually having an absolute cap and eventual reduction in their emission later this century .
and we need a substantial financing and technology package to help make those countries make the transition – to basically leap-frog across the way the industrialized countries did their development over the last century , and go right to cleaner technologies .
i think that 's going to be a real challenge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : per capita , indians produce a tenth of the co2 that americans do there also has to be a fair agreement .
it has to recognize the different stages of development that different countries are at ; that acknowledges the fact that a country like india , for example , emits two tones of carbon per person or less , whereas my country , the united states , emits 20 tones per person – ten times as much .
so it 's not fair to ask india to do the same as the united states in terms of taking leadership .
it is fair to ask india to do something , and to do more than they have been , and i think they 're showing signals that they 're willing to step up to the plate on that , as is china and other countries , but equity is a key part of this .
the third element is that it has to be binding .
it has to be something that is not just a voluntary commitment , but where countries look each other in the eye and say ' we are going to do this , we are going to have a system of verification , a system of compliance , that assures us that each of is doing our part in what we agreed to in copenhagen .
those are the three basic elements – it has to be fair , it has to be ambitious and it has to be binding .
climate change is also on the agenda when the leaders of the group of 20 major economies meet on thursday and friday .
some say the g20 could prove to be an even more important venue to overcome deadlocks between rich nations like the us and developing countries like china … the two issues that are on the agenda here in pittsburgh this week are climate finance .
how do you generate and govern the flows of investment that are needed for clean energy technologies ; reducing the rate of deforestation in tropical rainforest countries ; and for helping the poorest countries adapt to the impacts of climate change .
that 's going to be a big discussion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the g20 be the right venue to broker a compromise ?
the other issue , which the us has put on the agenda , is the issue of fossil fuel subsidies .
it turns out that the world is spending somewhere around 200 billion dollars a year or more encouraging production and consumption on the very things we 're trying to reduce to deal with global warming – that 's coal and oil .
so that topic is on the agenda , we 'll see how far we get with that , that 's obviously a very difficult issue - not only for the united states , but other countries .
it 's very political and there are entrenched interests that benefit from those embedded subsidies and will fight very hard against efforts to reduce or eliminate them .
climate is just one of the topics , but it is the first time that it has been on the agenda in a way like at the g20 and i think that does give us some prospect of movement .
certainly if they do some follow up between pittsburgh and copenhagen and the g20 process , they could help deliver that element of the package on climate finance . interview : nathan witkop editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

most countries could learn a lesson or two on how to do that from brazil . a new geography of international trade called " south-south " - that is the ambitious goal of brazilian president luiz inácio “ lula ” da silva .
the former trade union leader wants to better connect his country with other developing and emerging nations , a vision he already announced back in 2004 at a un trade conference in sao paulo .
while he wanted to continue to export to industrial nations , he also emphasized that he was looking for new opportunities .
" we want to foster partnerships , which enable better cooperation between the economies of the south , " lula said .
that strategy seems to work .
today brazil sells more goods to developing and emerging countries than to countries in the northern hemisphere .
china has become brazil 's third largest trade partner , after the us , and close behind neighboring argentina .
aside from china , brazilian companies have increasingly focused on africa , a continent , which in the past was regarded mainly as the home of former slaves .
lula himself already has travelled to africa eleven times and does n't get tired of repeating that brazil is home to the largest population of african descent outside of africa .
the official export agency apex has also intensified its efforts and earlier this month a delegation of brazilian businessmen visited south africa .
maurício manfré , who leads the project within apex , does n't view himself merely as a representative of brazilian companies .
he is also on the look out for products , which he can import .
" we want to expand and intensify this relationship , " he says .
rapid increase in exports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angola is brasil 's number one african trading partner in the past ten years brazilian exports to sub-saharan africa have increased almost eightfold .
last year they reached more than ten billion us dollars , five percent of all brazilian exports .
angola was brazil 's number one export destination with two billion us dollars , followed by south africa with 1.8 billion dollars and nigeria with 1.5 billion dollars respectively .
especially in the midst of the global financial and economic crisis new markets in africa are more than welcome , says jorge duarte de oliveira , the director of exportaminas , the export agency of the south eastern brazilian state of minas gerais : " the emerging countries have suffered considerably less from the international crisis , " he explains .
" they offer very attractive markets to small companies , which produce consumer goods here in brazil for the middle and lower class . "
jorge duarte de oliveira is convinced that those smaller brazilian producers will find the same kind of customers in africa and the middle east .
wide range of brasilian exports to africa while two thirds of chinese imports from brazil are commodities like soy and iron ore and bejing has little interest in industrial products , brazil 's range of exports to africa is more diverse .
only one third are commodities , two thirds consist of assembled products , from textiles and furniture to agricultural machines .
" africa has n't been able yet to develop its own industries .
that 's why the africans buy a large part of brazil 's industrial exports , " says carlos abijaodi , a trade expert with the industrial association of the federal state of minas gerais .
that is the reason why brazil 's range of products is broad , he explains brazil is also closely related to africa , adds abijaodi and says that he noticed that through his international contacts .
" they have similar customs and in the portuguese speaking countries in africa like angola and mozambique we share the same language . "
brazilian multinationals invest billions in africa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mozambique could also see a surge in brazilian investments brazil 's most important trading partner in africa is angola .
the oil-rich country which boasted double-digit growth rates in recent years has attracted investments by many brazilian companies .
petrobrás , the state-run oil concern , is surveying angola 's coast for possible oil fields while construction firm odebrecht maintains roads and brazilian conglomerate camargo corrêa builds a 370 million dollar cement plant in angola .
but in the near future , mozambique , africa 's most populous portuguese speaking country , is likely to also become more attractive for brazil .
vale , the leading brazilian mining company , invests 1.3 billion dollars there to exploit coal near moatize in central mozambique .
moatize is considered to be one of the largest unexploited coal reserves in the world .
it could provide high quality coal for more than a hundred years .

most countries could learn a lesson or two on how to do that from brazil . a new geography of international trade called " south-south " - that is the ambitious goal of brazilian president luiz inácio “ lula ” da silva .
the former trade union leader wants to better connect his country with other developing and emerging nations , a vision he already announced back in 2004 at a un trade conference in sao paulo .
while he wanted to continue to export to industrial nations , he also emphasized that he was looking for new opportunities .
" we want to foster partnerships , which enable better cooperation between the economies of the south , " lula said .
that strategy seems to work .
today brazil sells more goods to developing and emerging countries than to countries in the northern hemisphere .
china has become brazil 's third largest trade partner , after the us , and close behind neighboring argentina .
aside from china , brazilian companies have increasingly focused on africa , a continent , which in the past was regarded mainly as the home of former slaves .
lula himself already has travelled to africa eleven times and does n't get tired of repeating that brazil is home to the largest population of african descent outside of africa .
the official export agency apex has also intensified its efforts and earlier this month a delegation of brazilian businessmen visited south africa .
maurício manfré , who leads the project within apex , does n't view himself merely as a representative of brazilian companies .
he is also on the look out for products , which he can import .
" we want to expand and intensify this relationship , " he says .
rapid increase in exports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angola is brasil 's number one african trading partner in the past ten years brazilian exports to sub-saharan africa have increased almost eightfold .
last year they reached more than ten billion us dollars , five percent of all brazilian exports .
angola was brazil 's number one export destination with two billion us dollars , followed by south africa with 1.8 billion dollars and nigeria with 1.5 billion dollars respectively .
especially in the midst of the global financial and economic crisis new markets in africa are more than welcome , says jorge duarte de oliveira , the director of exportaminas , the export agency of the south eastern brazilian state of minas gerais : " the emerging countries have suffered considerably less from the international crisis , " he explains .
" they offer very attractive markets to small companies , which produce consumer goods here in brazil for the middle and lower class . "
jorge duarte de oliveira is convinced that those smaller brazilian producers will find the same kind of customers in africa and the middle east .
wide range of brasilian exports to africa while two thirds of chinese imports from brazil are commodities like soy and iron ore and bejing has little interest in industrial products , brazil 's range of exports to africa is more diverse .
only one third are commodities , two thirds consist of assembled products , from textiles and furniture to agricultural machines .
" africa has n't been able yet to develop its own industries .
that 's why the africans buy a large part of brazil 's industrial exports , " says carlos abijaodi , a trade expert with the industrial association of the federal state of minas gerais .
that is the reason why brazil 's range of products is broad , he explains brazil is also closely related to africa , adds abijaodi and says that he noticed that through his international contacts .
" they have similar customs and in the portuguese speaking countries in africa like angola and mozambique we share the same language . "
brazilian multinationals invest billions in africa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mozambique could also see a surge in brazilian investments brazil 's most important trading partner in africa is angola .
the oil-rich country which boasted double-digit growth rates in recent years has attracted investments by many brazilian companies .
petrobrás , the state-run oil concern , is surveying angola 's coast for possible oil fields while construction firm odebrecht maintains roads and brazilian conglomerate camargo corrêa builds a 370 million dollar cement plant in angola .
but in the near future , mozambique , africa 's most populous portuguese speaking country , is likely to also become more attractive for brazil .
vale , the leading brazilian mining company , invests 1.3 billion dollars there to exploit coal near moatize in central mozambique .
moatize is considered to be one of the largest unexploited coal reserves in the world .
it could provide high quality coal for more than a hundred years .

angola was brazil 's number one export destination with two billion us dollars , followed by south africa with 1.8 billion dollars and nigeria with 1.5 billion dollars respectively .
especially in the midst of the global financial and economic crisis new markets in africa are more than welcome , says jorge duarte de oliveira , the director of exportaminas , the export agency of the south eastern brazilian state of minas gerais : " the emerging countries have suffered considerably less from the international crisis , " he explains .
" they offer very attractive markets to small companies , which produce consumer goods here in brazil for the middle and lower class . "
jorge duarte de oliveira is convinced that those smaller brazilian producers will find the same kind of customers in africa and the middle east .
wide range of brasilian exports to africa while two thirds of chinese imports from brazil are commodities like soy and iron ore and bejing has little interest in industrial products , brazil 's range of exports to africa is more diverse .
only one third are commodities , two thirds consist of assembled products , from textiles and furniture to agricultural machines .
" africa has n't been able yet to develop its own industries .
that 's why the africans buy a large part of brazil 's industrial exports , " says carlos abijaodi , a trade expert with the industrial association of the federal state of minas gerais .
that is the reason why brazil 's range of products is broad , he explains brazil is also closely related to africa , adds abijaodi and says that he noticed that through his international contacts .
" they have similar customs and in the portuguese speaking countries in africa like angola and mozambique we share the same language . "
brazilian multinationals invest billions in africa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mozambique could also see a surge in brazilian investments brazil 's most important trading partner in africa is angola .
the oil-rich country which boasted double-digit growth rates in recent years has attracted investments by many brazilian companies .
petrobrás , the state-run oil concern , is surveying angola 's coast for possible oil fields while construction firm odebrecht maintains roads and brazilian conglomerate camargo corrêa builds a 370 million dollar cement plant in angola .
but in the near future , mozambique , africa 's most populous portuguese speaking country , is likely to also become more attractive for brazil .
vale , the leading brazilian mining company , invests 1.3 billion dollars there to exploit coal near moatize in central mozambique .
moatize is considered to be one of the largest unexploited coal reserves in the world .
it could provide high quality coal for more than a hundred years .

most countries could learn a lesson or two on how to do that from brazil . a new geography of international trade called " south-south " - that is the ambitious goal of brazilian president luiz inácio “ lula ” da silva .
the former trade union leader wants to better connect his country with other developing and emerging nations , a vision he already announced back in 2004 at a un trade conference in sao paulo .
while he wanted to continue to export to industrial nations , he also emphasized that he was looking for new opportunities .
" we want to foster partnerships , which enable better cooperation between the economies of the south , " lula said .
that strategy seems to work .
today brazil sells more goods to developing and emerging countries than to countries in the northern hemisphere .
china has become brazil 's third largest trade partner , after the us , and close behind neighboring argentina .
aside from china , brazilian companies have increasingly focused on africa , a continent , which in the past was regarded mainly as the home of former slaves .
lula himself already has travelled to africa eleven times and does n't get tired of repeating that brazil is home to the largest population of african descent outside of africa .
the official export agency apex has also intensified its efforts and earlier this month a delegation of brazilian businessmen visited south africa .
maurício manfré , who leads the project within apex , does n't view himself merely as a representative of brazilian companies .
he is also on the look out for products , which he can import .
" we want to expand and intensify this relationship , " he says .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de entertainment -pipe- 25.09.2009 top german politicians brave youth tv to boost popularity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will germans follow the us strategy for youth votes ?
in germany , politics and pop culture are like chalk and cheese .
but some of the more intrepid candidates in the upcoming parliamentary elections are now going where few have ever dared to tread : late-night tv . german politicians looked on enviously during the last us election campaign as then-presidential-hopeful barack obama managed to mobilize the youth vote .
it was primarily his use of the internet and social networking sites that helped him reach the blasé young people who in this generation have shown little interest in politics .
but media-savvy appearances on tv talk shows also helped propel obama into the forefront of popular culture .
in march , he became the first sitting president to appear on a late-night talk show when he dropped by " the tonight show with jay leno . "
rolling with the punches the strategy has clearly been noticed in germany - where the hope is that young voters will not only help sway the current , close election , but will stay true to their parties for life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tv host stefan raab does not treat his guests with kid gloves so politicians are starting to spread their wings .
appearing on established topical chat shows aired by public broadcasters and hosted by high-minded hosts such as anne will and maybrit illner are obviously nothing new .
but as parliamentary elections loom this weekend , a slew of berlin heavyweights , from the ever-slick economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg to the loquacious left party candidate gregor gysi , have decided to take their cues from obama and appear on prime-time private broadcaster prosieben .
joining them for an election-night panel on a saturday night show will be social democrat chairman franz muentefering , while liberal free democrats and the green party are sending their respective frontrunner candidates guido westerwelle and juergen trittin .
the show ’ s host is none other than stefan raab , enfant terrible of late-night viewing .
as a tv personality , he 's famous for making his interviewees squirm - and a lot more used to grilling guests such as germany 's next top model and kylie minogue than political leaders .
over exposure still , he wo n't be the only one treading new ground . a turn on a show as anchored in youth culture as " tv total bundestagswahl 2009 " certainly marks a departure for senior politicians .
but it is likely to be a canny move .
when an election show hosted by raab aired on the eve of the vote four years ago , it snagged a 29 percent market share of the 14 -29 age group category .
obviously , politicians have decided to do whatever it takes to galvanize young voters out of their living rooms and into the polling stations come sunday , and if that means subjecting themselves to raab 's punishing wit , they 're willing to roll with the punches .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the heavily plugged merkel- steinmeier debate was widely deemed a dud after all , the duller-than-dishwater debate between chancellor angela merkel and her challenger , frank-walter steinmeier , which aired a week ahead of the vote on germany 's first public broadcaster ard , did little to tickle the public 's interest - let alone attract the younger generation .
with the two rivals remaining civil and measured throughout , it could hardly even be termed a debate .
and in terms of ratings , it was a resounding flop : 7 million fewer viewers tuned in than did four years ago , and with 7,86 million watching , it attracted a market share of only 23,4 percent .
but merkel probably feels as though she currently has enough exposure in popular culture , now that a youtube video featuring her getting heckled by a " flash mob " at an election rally in hamburg has been watched by more than a quarter of a million people in the last week .
participants shouted " yeaahh " at every sentence spoken by the conservative leader , and waved placards with the words : " all together : yeaahh . "
" this is our political message and the political meaning of this flash mob - we wo n't swallow election campaign messages anymore and we 'll throw merkel 's rubbish back at her with a ironic ' yeaahh ' , " wrote rene walter on the nerdcore.de blog , according to news agency afp .
serious co-host barring an unexpected appearance , both merkel and steinmeier will be conspicuous in their absence on the raab show , but their colleagues can expect questions on topics chosen to appeal to a younger audience , such as education , youth unemployment and the internet .
co-hosting with raab will be experienced political journalist peter limbourg , who was quoted in the daily tagesspiegel as saying that he " expects some tough talking . "
" the point is to get as many people as possible to vote , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 25.09.2009 the climate ball is in the rich world 's court großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g20 could be the place to get a deal on funding to protect rainforests .
this week witnessed some important meetings for climate negotiations .
world leaders gathered for two high-level conferences in the us .
a leading us scientific advisor gave dw his thoughts on where climate talks stood . alden meyer is director of strategy and policy for the union of concerned scientists – a us organisation which campaigns for tough international action to tackle global warming .
meyer has 30 years experience advising government on environmental and energy issues , and spoke to deutsche welle from the g20 summit in pittsburgh .
he said world leaders made some progress when they met in new york for a special one-day climate summit .
he added that although the united states remains distracted by a struggle over health care reform , the g20 could prove to unblock efforts to get an ambitious agreement at december 's crucial climate conference in copenhagen .
deutsche welle : what struck you about world leaders ' addresses on climate change on tuesday ?
alden meyer : one of the significant developments at the special summit on climate change on tuesday was the commitment by chinese president hu jintao that china would put forward a carbon intensity target for china between now and 2020 that is to reduce the emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases as a proportion of their economic output .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meyer has testified before congress on global warming and energy issues it is the first time china has made that proposal .
he did not put forward a specific number , and obviously we have to wait to see how aggressive that carbon intensity reduction goal is , but it was a meaningful offer by china.i think that added some momentum coming out of new york , going into pittsburgh and on to copenhagen at the end of the year .
also , japan , the new prime minister there , pledging to increase japan 's greenhouse gas reduction target from the minus eight percent below 1990 levels , pledged by the previous government , to 25 percent below 1990 levels .
of course that 's much more in keeping with the proposal that the european union has put forward and begins to be within the range of what the science says we need to do to get a handle on the problem .
some commentators were quite disappointed with the us position , with obama 's remarks , how did you perceive them ?
i think he said a lot of the right things in terms of the urgency of the problem ; that he gets it on the science ; that the us is committed to do its part on this .
he gave a good overview of all the things he and his administration have done in the eight months since he took office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's un address won a luke warm reception from some observers i think what was disappointing to a lot of observers , and particularly to those from other countries , was that he did n't say very much about the need for the senate in our country to take action on domestic climate legislation in advance of copenhagen .
he did mention that the house has already passed a domestic climate bill and that committees in the senate are starting to consider it , but he did n't lay down the gauntlet and say to the senate ' i really need you to do this by copenhagen so that i can go in there with the credibility of the congressional backing for the position i want to take at that meeting . '
i think people understand the situation he is in .
he is fighting very hard for a domestic health care bill .
they are focused on that like a laser and do n't want to be distracting the senate with talk about other issues , but i think there is more and more impatience on the international scene about the fact that one body of our congress is threatening to hold up the whole process in copenhagen .
two years ago countries agreed to reach a new deal to replace the kyoto protocol by the end of this year , yet negotiations remain about as deadlocked as they have been for the better part of a decade .
how likely is it that we 'll see an agreement at the next big round of negotiations in copenhagen in december – especially given , as you said , that the senate in the us seems to be holding up the process ?
i think there are two big issues here .
one is what the state is of the us domestic debate .
if the president comes to copenhagen with the senate moving forward on climate legislation – with a leadership bill having been introduced and expressions of support – i think he 'll have more credibility .
certainly more than president clinton and vice-president gore did in kyoto when everyone knew that congress was not likely to back what they were putting forward .
the other piece , which is equally daunting frankly , is the issue of climate finance : the roughly 100-150 billion euro-a-year estimates for developing countries for mitigation and adaptation activities on climate change .
and there it 's not just the us , but europe and japan as well which have to do much more to advance that issue before copenhagen .
many of the developing countries have made it clear that if there is not the serious financing and technology package on offer in copenhagen that was promised back in bali two years ago , there 's not going to be a deal from their side .
bildunterschrift : western money to pay for clean development could be a deal-breaker there are still critics who question not only whether an international deal is feasible , but whether it is even desirable .
the controversial danish statistician björn lomborg told deutsche welle this week that cutting emissions was too expensive and ultimately futile .
he said the world would get more bang for its buck by investing in super-projects to pump clouds into the atmosphere to cool the planet .
does lomborg have a point ?
we certainly disagree with his premise that cutting carbon emissions is expensive .
as a matter of fact , my organization just completed an analysis of the us potential for emission reductions showing that we could go far beyond the reductions that the president and the congress are talking about , and that -lrb- we could provide -rrb- savings for consumers .
the reality is , particularly energy efficiency investments pay back very quickly , and then you get benefits from that for years to come .
there are also signals that wind energy and other renewable technologies are coming down in price .
wind is taking off in the united states as it is in other parts of the world , so i fundamentally disagree with the premise that cutting emissions has to be expensive .
yes there is some cost , but it is much less than the cost of damages from climate change that we will see if we do n't take action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish statistician bjorn lomborg says money would be better spent elsewhere when it comes to the issue of geo-engineering , this is obviously something the science community is starting to talk about .
it is very controversial , because obviously these are unproven technologies , and more importantly there could be side-effects from these large-scale geo-engineering schemes that we do n't fully understand .
we 're obviously not doing a very good of regulating the planet with our activities now , and to think that we can have some kind of technical fix that works without some kind of unforeseen side-effect is a little bit of hubris on our part .
so i think there is some interest in exploring some of these options , but i think to hang your whole strategy on that would be a grave mistake .
so what are some of the biggest challenges going to be in securing a good deal at copenhagen at the end of the year ?
indeed , what would amount to a good deal ?
i think what you need for a good deal is something that 's ambitious , that 's in line with what the science says we have to do to bend the emissions curve .
this means we need deeper reductions than what most of the industrialized countries are to date putting on the table .
we also need action by the major developing countries to see a deviation from their business-as-usual growth-path in emissions over the next decade or so , with a view towards eventually having an absolute cap and eventual reduction in their emission later this century .
and we need a substantial financing and technology package to help make those countries make the transition – to basically leap-frog across the way the industrialized countries did their development over the last century , and go right to cleaner technologies .
i think that 's going to be a real challenge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : per capita , indians produce a tenth of the co2 that americans do there also has to be a fair agreement .
it has to recognize the different stages of development that different countries are at ; that acknowledges the fact that a country like india , for example , emits two tones of carbon per person or less , whereas my country , the united states , emits 20 tones per person – ten times as much .
so it 's not fair to ask india to do the same as the united states in terms of taking leadership .
it is fair to ask india to do something , and to do more than they have been , and i think they 're showing signals that they 're willing to step up to the plate on that , as is china and other countries , but equity is a key part of this .
the third element is that it has to be binding .
it has to be something that is not just a voluntary commitment , but where countries look each other in the eye and say ' we are going to do this , we are going to have a system of verification , a system of compliance , that assures us that each of is doing our part in what we agreed to in copenhagen .
those are the three basic elements – it has to be fair , it has to be ambitious and it has to be binding .
climate change is also on the agenda when the leaders of the group of 20 major economies meet on thursday and friday .
some say the g20 could prove to be an even more important venue to overcome deadlocks between rich nations like the us and developing countries like china … the two issues that are on the agenda here in pittsburgh this week are climate finance .
how do you generate and govern the flows of investment that are needed for clean energy technologies ; reducing the rate of deforestation in tropical rainforest countries ; and for helping the poorest countries adapt to the impacts of climate change .
that 's going to be a big discussion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the g20 be the right venue to broker a compromise ?
the other issue , which the us has put on the agenda , is the issue of fossil fuel subsidies .
it turns out that the world is spending somewhere around 200 billion dollars a year or more encouraging production and consumption on the very things we 're trying to reduce to deal with global warming – that 's coal and oil .
so that topic is on the agenda , we 'll see how far we get with that , that 's obviously a very difficult issue - not only for the united states , but other countries .
it 's very political and there are entrenched interests that benefit from those embedded subsidies and will fight very hard against efforts to reduce or eliminate them .
climate is just one of the topics , but it is the first time that it has been on the agenda in a way like at the g20 and i think that does give us some prospect of movement .
certainly if they do some follow up between pittsburgh and copenhagen and the g20 process , they could help deliver that element of the package on climate finance . interview : nathan witkop editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 25.09.2009 fraud , corruption and espionage on the rise at german firms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two-thirds of corporate crime is committed by top and middle managers damages from white-collar crime at large german companies have almost tripled in recent years , according to a new study released this week .
more and more of the criminals are coming from the ranks of management . white-collar crime in germany has exploded in severity , the consulting firm pricewaterhousecoopers -lrb- pwc -rrb- said thursday , with over 60 percent of german companies reporting cases of industrial espionage , corruption and other offenses .
firms expect crime to worsen as a weak economy makes competition tougher and workers unhappier .
the average cost to a firm per incident has risen from 1.47 million euros four years ago to nearly 4.3 million euros today .
" the direct costs of crime are only the tip of the iceberg , " said pwc partner and former prosecutor steffem salvenmoser .
" above all , the reputational damage to a firm in cases of corruption , data theft or price-fixing is often greater than the measurable financial losses . "
the study 's results are based on a survey of 500 large german companies conducted by pwc in spring of 2009 , after the german economy sank into its deepest recession in over 60 years , propelled in part by the worldwide financial crisis .
over 40 percent of the surveyed firms expect competitors to use espionage or anti-competitive practices such as cartels to gain an advantage in a tough economic climate .
over a third of the companies expected workers to steal from their employers as concerns about holding onto jobs mounts .
crime from the corner office bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only 50 percent of managers accused of criminal deeds are prosecuted over 70 percent of the perpetrators were caught thanks to tipsters , the study said , despite increased investment in internal control measures designed to detect theft and fraud .
those results suggest that preventive measures have little effect according to professor kai bussmann from the martin luther university in halle , who worked on the study .
further tainting a company 's reputation is the finding that the perpetrators often come from the ranks of management .
the study said 29 percent were executives from the very top of the company 's leadership and 38 percent were middle managers .
many perpetrators were long time employees , 45 percent with more than ten years of tenure with the company and over 90 percent were men .
strikingly , despite the size and nature of the crimes , firms pressed charges against malfeasant managers just 50 percent of the time , compared to 61 percent in the pwc 's last survey in 2007 .
one fifth of the top managers who took part in crimes against their employers received no punishment whatsoever .
" although the relative leniency against perpetrators from the leadership level can be explained by the particular legal and factual difficulties of individual cases this practice is extremely problematic from vantage point of the credibility and leadership of management , " salvenmoser said. bn / ap / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , times are changing , and tax evaders from abroad will have to be more careful in future . switzerland has paved the way to be dropped from a so-called grey list of uncooperative tax havens , after signing a necessary 12th new bilateral taxation agreement with qatar .
swiss president hans-rudolf merz signed the treaty with qatar 's prime minister sheikh hamad bin jassim bin jabr al-thani on the sidelines of the un general assembly in new york late on thursday .
the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- demands that countries listed on the grey list sign at least 12 bilateral tax cooperation treaties before they lose that stigma .
switzerland has also signed deals with norway , denmark , finland , the faroe islands , great britain , france , luxembourg , austria , mexico , spain and the united states .
however , oecd head , angel guerria , stressed that switzerland not only had to sign agreements but also work toward " effective implementation . "
the alpine state , which has faced strong international pressure to join the global hunt for tax evaders , caved in earlier this year , saying it would improve cooperation with foreign tax authorities . however , the swiss government emphasized that banking secrecy would be maintained as long as no tax offences were committed .
" banking secrecy offers no protection in the case of tax offences .
as a result of the globalization of financial markets and particularly against the backdrop of the financial crisis , international cooperation in the area of taxes has grown in importance , " the swiss federal department of finance said in a statement upon completion of the 12th deal. nk / dpa / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but , thanks to slow food 's interest in their product , these farmers have had the opportunity to leave their country for the first time and discover first-hand the techniques and traditions of their italian counterparts . a great exchange of skills " it has been a phenomenal learning experience , for both the kenyans and the farmers in italy . " said peter namianya , a kenyan graduate from the university of gastronomy in piedmont , who coordinated the trip . " when the terzoi saw the italian goats they exclaimed ' oh , they 're the size of my cows ! ' , and everybody laughed . "
the kenyan goat and cow herders and their italian counterparts discovered they have a lot in common . the time spent with local dairy farmers , cheese-makers and vets was a real cultural exchange .
" one of them would say , ' back home we do it like this ' , and the other would reply , ' here you do it like this . " kenyans and italians discover how much they have in common bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kenyan cattleherders inspecting italian stables the group spent two and a half days on mario gala 's farm , where he taught them how to improve their hygiene standards and look after their animals ' health . " i think the shepherds from kenya are more similar to me than any italian bank employee ! " , laughed mario gala , " we are the same people .
our day is the same , we pay attention to the seasons , the rain , the pasturing , the good health of our animals , my cheese , their yogurt . " gala 's kenyan visitors were equally enthusiastic .
" there are some things that we have not done well , like milking and cleaning , and we are going to improve our standards , " said simon pkite lochawan .
the group was clearly impressed by the high importance put on hygiene in the stables and the quality of animal fodder in italy . learning the art of cheese making bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a cross-cultural culinary encounter one of the most exciting and precious skills the kenyans have learned is the art of cheese-making .
for countless generations , the terzoi have been making butter and their unusual yogurt , but they 've never turned their milk into cheese .
although you can buy imported cheeses at supermarkets in kenya 's big cities , farmers have no cheesemaking traditions of their own . " they do n't have a culture of cheese but they want to try to make it when they go back home , " said peter namianya .
he added that this is a unique way of conserving milk , instead of just making yogurt and drinking fresh milk . this could also become another way of reducing hunger in the community . " if there is abundant milk , they can make cheese and store it and then use it in a time when there 's no food . " praise for traditional kenyan yoghurt pkite and his colleagues have enjoyed the opportunity to try so many different varieties of cheese at the slow food fair .
they especially like the taste of soft cheeses like ricotta , and are looking forward to experimenting with their own milk when they get back .
the positive reactions to their yoghurt have also made them realize the value of their own traditional product . the kenyans ' visit has also inspired the curiosity of their italian hosts , who are now keen to experience everyday life in west pokot . namianya already envisions a kind of eco-tourism : " you go to the village , taste their food and taste the real culture of the people .

this week witnessed some important meetings for climate negotiations .
world leaders gathered for two high-level conferences in the us .
a leading us scientific advisor gave dw his thoughts on where climate talks stood . alden meyer is director of strategy and policy for the union of concerned scientists – a us organisation which campaigns for tough international action to tackle global warming .
meyer has 30 years experience advising government on environmental and energy issues , and spoke to deutsche welle from the g20 summit in pittsburgh .
he said world leaders made some progress when they met in new york for a special one-day climate summit .
he added that although the united states remains distracted by a struggle over health care reform , the g20 could prove to unblock efforts to get an ambitious agreement at december 's crucial climate conference in copenhagen .
deutsche welle : what struck you about world leaders ' addresses on climate change on tuesday ?
alden meyer : one of the significant developments at the special summit on climate change on tuesday was the commitment by chinese president hu jintao that china would put forward a carbon intensity target for china between now and 2020 that is to reduce the emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases as a proportion of their economic output .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meyer has testified before congress on global warming and energy issues it is the first time china has made that proposal .
he did not put forward a specific number , and obviously we have to wait to see how aggressive that carbon intensity reduction goal is , but it was a meaningful offer by china.i think that added some momentum coming out of new york , going into pittsburgh and on to copenhagen at the end of the year .
also , japan , the new prime minister there , pledging to increase japan 's greenhouse gas reduction target from the minus eight percent below 1990 levels , pledged by the previous government , to 25 percent below 1990 levels .
of course that 's much more in keeping with the proposal that the european union has put forward and begins to be within the range of what the science says we need to do to get a handle on the problem .
some commentators were quite disappointed with the us position , with obama 's remarks , how did you perceive them ?
i think he said a lot of the right things in terms of the urgency of the problem ; that he gets it on the science ; that the us is committed to do its part on this .
he gave a good overview of all the things he and his administration have done in the eight months since he took office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's un address won a luke warm reception from some observers i think what was disappointing to a lot of observers , and particularly to those from other countries , was that he did n't say very much about the need for the senate in our country to take action on domestic climate legislation in advance of copenhagen .
he did mention that the house has already passed a domestic climate bill and that committees in the senate are starting to consider it , but he did n't lay down the gauntlet and say to the senate ' i really need you to do this by copenhagen so that i can go in there with the credibility of the congressional backing for the position i want to take at that meeting . '
i think people understand the situation he is in .
he is fighting very hard for a domestic health care bill .
they are focused on that like a laser and do n't want to be distracting the senate with talk about other issues , but i think there is more and more impatience on the international scene about the fact that one body of our congress is threatening to hold up the whole process in copenhagen .
two years ago countries agreed to reach a new deal to replace the kyoto protocol by the end of this year , yet negotiations remain about as deadlocked as they have been for the better part of a decade .
how likely is it that we 'll see an agreement at the next big round of negotiations in copenhagen in december – especially given , as you said , that the senate in the us seems to be holding up the process ?
i think there are two big issues here .
one is what the state is of the us domestic debate .
if the president comes to copenhagen with the senate moving forward on climate legislation – with a leadership bill having been introduced and expressions of support – i think he 'll have more credibility .
certainly more than president clinton and vice-president gore did in kyoto when everyone knew that congress was not likely to back what they were putting forward .
the other piece , which is equally daunting frankly , is the issue of climate finance : the roughly 100-150 billion euro-a-year estimates for developing countries for mitigation and adaptation activities on climate change .
and there it 's not just the us , but europe and japan as well which have to do much more to advance that issue before copenhagen .
many of the developing countries have made it clear that if there is not the serious financing and technology package on offer in copenhagen that was promised back in bali two years ago , there 's not going to be a deal from their side .
bildunterschrift : western money to pay for clean development could be a deal-breaker there are still critics who question not only whether an international deal is feasible , but whether it is even desirable .
the controversial danish statistician björn lomborg told deutsche welle this week that cutting emissions was too expensive and ultimately futile .
he said the world would get more bang for its buck by investing in super-projects to pump clouds into the atmosphere to cool the planet .
does lomborg have a point ?
we certainly disagree with his premise that cutting carbon emissions is expensive .
as a matter of fact , my organization just completed an analysis of the us potential for emission reductions showing that we could go far beyond the reductions that the president and the congress are talking about , and that -lrb- we could provide -rrb- savings for consumers .
the reality is , particularly energy efficiency investments pay back very quickly , and then you get benefits from that for years to come .
there are also signals that wind energy and other renewable technologies are coming down in price .
wind is taking off in the united states as it is in other parts of the world , so i fundamentally disagree with the premise that cutting emissions has to be expensive .
yes there is some cost , but it is much less than the cost of damages from climate change that we will see if we do n't take action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish statistician bjorn lomborg says money would be better spent elsewhere when it comes to the issue of geo-engineering , this is obviously something the science community is starting to talk about .
it is very controversial , because obviously these are unproven technologies , and more importantly there could be side-effects from these large-scale geo-engineering schemes that we do n't fully understand .
we 're obviously not doing a very good of regulating the planet with our activities now , and to think that we can have some kind of technical fix that works without some kind of unforeseen side-effect is a little bit of hubris on our part .
so i think there is some interest in exploring some of these options , but i think to hang your whole strategy on that would be a grave mistake .
so what are some of the biggest challenges going to be in securing a good deal at copenhagen at the end of the year ?
indeed , what would amount to a good deal ?
i think what you need for a good deal is something that 's ambitious , that 's in line with what the science says we have to do to bend the emissions curve .
this means we need deeper reductions than what most of the industrialized countries are to date putting on the table .
we also need action by the major developing countries to see a deviation from their business-as-usual growth-path in emissions over the next decade or so , with a view towards eventually having an absolute cap and eventual reduction in their emission later this century .
and we need a substantial financing and technology package to help make those countries make the transition – to basically leap-frog across the way the industrialized countries did their development over the last century , and go right to cleaner technologies .
i think that 's going to be a real challenge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : per capita , indians produce a tenth of the co2 that americans do there also has to be a fair agreement .
it has to recognize the different stages of development that different countries are at ; that acknowledges the fact that a country like india , for example , emits two tones of carbon per person or less , whereas my country , the united states , emits 20 tones per person – ten times as much .
so it 's not fair to ask india to do the same as the united states in terms of taking leadership .
it is fair to ask india to do something , and to do more than they have been , and i think they 're showing signals that they 're willing to step up to the plate on that , as is china and other countries , but equity is a key part of this .
the third element is that it has to be binding .
it has to be something that is not just a voluntary commitment , but where countries look each other in the eye and say ' we are going to do this , we are going to have a system of verification , a system of compliance , that assures us that each of is doing our part in what we agreed to in copenhagen .
those are the three basic elements – it has to be fair , it has to be ambitious and it has to be binding .
climate change is also on the agenda when the leaders of the group of 20 major economies meet on thursday and friday .
some say the g20 could prove to be an even more important venue to overcome deadlocks between rich nations like the us and developing countries like china … the two issues that are on the agenda here in pittsburgh this week are climate finance .
how do you generate and govern the flows of investment that are needed for clean energy technologies ; reducing the rate of deforestation in tropical rainforest countries ; and for helping the poorest countries adapt to the impacts of climate change .
that 's going to be a big discussion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the g20 be the right venue to broker a compromise ?
the other issue , which the us has put on the agenda , is the issue of fossil fuel subsidies .
it turns out that the world is spending somewhere around 200 billion dollars a year or more encouraging production and consumption on the very things we 're trying to reduce to deal with global warming – that 's coal and oil .
so that topic is on the agenda , we 'll see how far we get with that , that 's obviously a very difficult issue - not only for the united states , but other countries .
it 's very political and there are entrenched interests that benefit from those embedded subsidies and will fight very hard against efforts to reduce or eliminate them .
climate is just one of the topics , but it is the first time that it has been on the agenda in a way like at the g20 and i think that does give us some prospect of movement .
certainly if they do some follow up between pittsburgh and copenhagen and the g20 process , they could help deliver that element of the package on climate finance . interview : nathan witkop editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 25.09.2009 the climate ball is in the rich world 's court großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g20 could be the place to get a deal on funding to protect rainforests .
this week witnessed some important meetings for climate negotiations .
world leaders gathered for two high-level conferences in the us .
a leading us scientific advisor gave dw his thoughts on where climate talks stood . alden meyer is director of strategy and policy for the union of concerned scientists – a us organisation which campaigns for tough international action to tackle global warming .
meyer has 30 years experience advising government on environmental and energy issues , and spoke to deutsche welle from the g20 summit in pittsburgh .
he said world leaders made some progress when they met in new york for a special one-day climate summit .
he added that although the united states remains distracted by a struggle over health care reform , the g20 could prove to unblock efforts to get an ambitious agreement at december 's crucial climate conference in copenhagen .
deutsche welle : what struck you about world leaders ' addresses on climate change on tuesday ?
alden meyer : one of the significant developments at the special summit on climate change on tuesday was the commitment by chinese president hu jintao that china would put forward a carbon intensity target for china between now and 2020 that is to reduce the emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases as a proportion of their economic output .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meyer has testified before congress on global warming and energy issues it is the first time china has made that proposal .
he did not put forward a specific number , and obviously we have to wait to see how aggressive that carbon intensity reduction goal is , but it was a meaningful offer by china.i think that added some momentum coming out of new york , going into pittsburgh and on to copenhagen at the end of the year .
also , japan , the new prime minister there , pledging to increase japan 's greenhouse gas reduction target from the minus eight percent below 1990 levels , pledged by the previous government , to 25 percent below 1990 levels .
of course that 's much more in keeping with the proposal that the european union has put forward and begins to be within the range of what the science says we need to do to get a handle on the problem .
some commentators were quite disappointed with the us position , with obama 's remarks , how did you perceive them ?
i think he said a lot of the right things in terms of the urgency of the problem ; that he gets it on the science ; that the us is committed to do its part on this .
he gave a good overview of all the things he and his administration have done in the eight months since he took office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's un address won a luke warm reception from some observers i think what was disappointing to a lot of observers , and particularly to those from other countries , was that he did n't say very much about the need for the senate in our country to take action on domestic climate legislation in advance of copenhagen .
he did mention that the house has already passed a domestic climate bill and that committees in the senate are starting to consider it , but he did n't lay down the gauntlet and say to the senate ' i really need you to do this by copenhagen so that i can go in there with the credibility of the congressional backing for the position i want to take at that meeting . '
i think people understand the situation he is in .
he is fighting very hard for a domestic health care bill .
they are focused on that like a laser and do n't want to be distracting the senate with talk about other issues , but i think there is more and more impatience on the international scene about the fact that one body of our congress is threatening to hold up the whole process in copenhagen .
two years ago countries agreed to reach a new deal to replace the kyoto protocol by the end of this year , yet negotiations remain about as deadlocked as they have been for the better part of a decade .
how likely is it that we 'll see an agreement at the next big round of negotiations in copenhagen in december – especially given , as you said , that the senate in the us seems to be holding up the process ?
i think there are two big issues here .
one is what the state is of the us domestic debate .
if the president comes to copenhagen with the senate moving forward on climate legislation – with a leadership bill having been introduced and expressions of support – i think he 'll have more credibility .
certainly more than president clinton and vice-president gore did in kyoto when everyone knew that congress was not likely to back what they were putting forward .
the other piece , which is equally daunting frankly , is the issue of climate finance : the roughly 100-150 billion euro-a-year estimates for developing countries for mitigation and adaptation activities on climate change .
and there it 's not just the us , but europe and japan as well which have to do much more to advance that issue before copenhagen .
many of the developing countries have made it clear that if there is not the serious financing and technology package on offer in copenhagen that was promised back in bali two years ago , there 's not going to be a deal from their side .
bildunterschrift : western money to pay for clean development could be a deal-breaker there are still critics who question not only whether an international deal is feasible , but whether it is even desirable .
the controversial danish statistician björn lomborg told deutsche welle this week that cutting emissions was too expensive and ultimately futile .
he said the world would get more bang for its buck by investing in super-projects to pump clouds into the atmosphere to cool the planet .
does lomborg have a point ?
we certainly disagree with his premise that cutting carbon emissions is expensive .
as a matter of fact , my organization just completed an analysis of the us potential for emission reductions showing that we could go far beyond the reductions that the president and the congress are talking about , and that -lrb- we could provide -rrb- savings for consumers .
the reality is , particularly energy efficiency investments pay back very quickly , and then you get benefits from that for years to come .
there are also signals that wind energy and other renewable technologies are coming down in price .
wind is taking off in the united states as it is in other parts of the world , so i fundamentally disagree with the premise that cutting emissions has to be expensive .
yes there is some cost , but it is much less than the cost of damages from climate change that we will see if we do n't take action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish statistician bjorn lomborg says money would be better spent elsewhere when it comes to the issue of geo-engineering , this is obviously something the science community is starting to talk about .
it is very controversial , because obviously these are unproven technologies , and more importantly there could be side-effects from these large-scale geo-engineering schemes that we do n't fully understand .
we 're obviously not doing a very good of regulating the planet with our activities now , and to think that we can have some kind of technical fix that works without some kind of unforeseen side-effect is a little bit of hubris on our part .
so i think there is some interest in exploring some of these options , but i think to hang your whole strategy on that would be a grave mistake .
so what are some of the biggest challenges going to be in securing a good deal at copenhagen at the end of the year ?
indeed , what would amount to a good deal ?
i think what you need for a good deal is something that 's ambitious , that 's in line with what the science says we have to do to bend the emissions curve .
this means we need deeper reductions than what most of the industrialized countries are to date putting on the table .
we also need action by the major developing countries to see a deviation from their business-as-usual growth-path in emissions over the next decade or so , with a view towards eventually having an absolute cap and eventual reduction in their emission later this century .
and we need a substantial financing and technology package to help make those countries make the transition – to basically leap-frog across the way the industrialized countries did their development over the last century , and go right to cleaner technologies .
i think that 's going to be a real challenge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : per capita , indians produce a tenth of the co2 that americans do there also has to be a fair agreement .
it has to recognize the different stages of development that different countries are at ; that acknowledges the fact that a country like india , for example , emits two tones of carbon per person or less , whereas my country , the united states , emits 20 tones per person – ten times as much .
so it 's not fair to ask india to do the same as the united states in terms of taking leadership .
it is fair to ask india to do something , and to do more than they have been , and i think they 're showing signals that they 're willing to step up to the plate on that , as is china and other countries , but equity is a key part of this .
the third element is that it has to be binding .
it has to be something that is not just a voluntary commitment , but where countries look each other in the eye and say ' we are going to do this , we are going to have a system of verification , a system of compliance , that assures us that each of is doing our part in what we agreed to in copenhagen .
those are the three basic elements – it has to be fair , it has to be ambitious and it has to be binding .
climate change is also on the agenda when the leaders of the group of 20 major economies meet on thursday and friday .
some say the g20 could prove to be an even more important venue to overcome deadlocks between rich nations like the us and developing countries like china … the two issues that are on the agenda here in pittsburgh this week are climate finance .
how do you generate and govern the flows of investment that are needed for clean energy technologies ; reducing the rate of deforestation in tropical rainforest countries ; and for helping the poorest countries adapt to the impacts of climate change .
that 's going to be a big discussion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the g20 be the right venue to broker a compromise ?
the other issue , which the us has put on the agenda , is the issue of fossil fuel subsidies .
it turns out that the world is spending somewhere around 200 billion dollars a year or more encouraging production and consumption on the very things we 're trying to reduce to deal with global warming – that 's coal and oil .
so that topic is on the agenda , we 'll see how far we get with that , that 's obviously a very difficult issue - not only for the united states , but other countries .
it 's very political and there are entrenched interests that benefit from those embedded subsidies and will fight very hard against efforts to reduce or eliminate them .
climate is just one of the topics , but it is the first time that it has been on the agenda in a way like at the g20 and i think that does give us some prospect of movement .
certainly if they do some follow up between pittsburgh and copenhagen and the g20 process , they could help deliver that element of the package on climate finance . interview : nathan witkop editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in germany , politics and pop culture are like chalk and cheese .
but some of the more intrepid candidates in the upcoming parliamentary elections are now going where few have ever dared to tread : late-night tv . german politicians looked on enviously during the last us election campaign as then-presidential-hopeful barack obama managed to mobilize the youth vote .
it was primarily his use of the internet and social networking sites that helped him reach the blasé young people who in this generation have shown little interest in politics .
but media-savvy appearances on tv talk shows also helped propel obama into the forefront of popular culture .
in march , he became the first sitting president to appear on a late-night talk show when he dropped by " the tonight show with jay leno . "
rolling with the punches the strategy has clearly been noticed in germany - where the hope is that young voters will not only help sway the current , close election , but will stay true to their parties for life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tv host stefan raab does not treat his guests with kid gloves so politicians are starting to spread their wings .
appearing on established topical chat shows aired by public broadcasters and hosted by high-minded hosts such as anne will and maybrit illner are obviously nothing new .
but as parliamentary elections loom this weekend , a slew of berlin heavyweights , from the ever-slick economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg to the loquacious left party candidate gregor gysi , have decided to take their cues from obama and appear on prime-time private broadcaster prosieben .
joining them for an election-night panel on a saturday night show will be social democrat chairman franz muentefering , while liberal free democrats and the green party are sending their respective frontrunner candidates guido westerwelle and juergen trittin .
the show ’ s host is none other than stefan raab , enfant terrible of late-night viewing .
as a tv personality , he 's famous for making his interviewees squirm - and a lot more used to grilling guests such as germany 's next top model and kylie minogue than political leaders .
over exposure still , he wo n't be the only one treading new ground . a turn on a show as anchored in youth culture as " tv total bundestagswahl 2009 " certainly marks a departure for senior politicians .
but it is likely to be a canny move .
when an election show hosted by raab aired on the eve of the vote four years ago , it snagged a 29 percent market share of the 14 -29 age group category .
obviously , politicians have decided to do whatever it takes to galvanize young voters out of their living rooms and into the polling stations come sunday , and if that means subjecting themselves to raab 's punishing wit , they 're willing to roll with the punches .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the heavily plugged merkel- steinmeier debate was widely deemed a dud after all , the duller-than-dishwater debate between chancellor angela merkel and her challenger , frank-walter steinmeier , which aired a week ahead of the vote on germany 's first public broadcaster ard , did little to tickle the public 's interest - let alone attract the younger generation .
with the two rivals remaining civil and measured throughout , it could hardly even be termed a debate .
and in terms of ratings , it was a resounding flop : 7 million fewer viewers tuned in than did four years ago , and with 7,86 million watching , it attracted a market share of only 23,4 percent .
but merkel probably feels as though she currently has enough exposure in popular culture , now that a youtube video featuring her getting heckled by a " flash mob " at an election rally in hamburg has been watched by more than a quarter of a million people in the last week .
participants shouted " yeaahh " at every sentence spoken by the conservative leader , and waved placards with the words : " all together : yeaahh . "
" this is our political message and the political meaning of this flash mob - we wo n't swallow election campaign messages anymore and we 'll throw merkel 's rubbish back at her with a ironic ' yeaahh ' , " wrote rene walter on the nerdcore.de blog , according to news agency afp .
serious co-host barring an unexpected appearance , both merkel and steinmeier will be conspicuous in their absence on the raab show , but their colleagues can expect questions on topics chosen to appeal to a younger audience , such as education , youth unemployment and the internet .
co-hosting with raab will be experienced political journalist peter limbourg , who was quoted in the daily tagesspiegel as saying that he " expects some tough talking . "
" the point is to get as many people as possible to vote , " he said .

the video was produced by t-online 's wahlzeit.tv website , after steini-girl offered them the song she wrote together with a friend .
" she just thinks he 's a really nice guy , " wahlzeit spokesman bjoern akstinat said .
steini-girl , whose real name is being kept secret , said her main aim " is to get people voting on sunday , and maybe i 'll get a few lucrative jobs out of it too . "
ironic love declaration in the video , steini-girl dances in front of the various seats of federal government in berlin , including the reichstag and the chancellery , wearing not many clothes and kissing pictures of social democrat chancellor candidate frank-walter steinmeier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's chances against chancellor merkel this sunday are thought to be slim the song itself is mainly an ironic love declaration to steinmeier , described in the lyrics as " coiled masculinity " , while his chief opponent in the election chancellor angela merkel is dismissed as " too masculine " .
the song also deems free liberal party leader guido westerwelle " too feminine " and prominent left party politician gregor gysi " too small " .
steini-girl is consciously based on obama girl , a similar viral video song performed by model amber lee ettinger , which was massively successful in the united states during the 2008 presidential election campaign .
obama girl has attracted over 15 million clicks on youtube to date , and made a minor celebrity of ettinger .
" my friend was in the usa last year when obama girl was totally popular , and she thought we should do that , so we just messed around and made a few rhymes , the way you do , " she told bild .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 25.09.2009 obama-girl-inspired " steini-girl " video goes viral großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steini-girl looks set to become a viral hit an amateur music video showcasing a love song for spd chancellor-candidate frank-walter steinmeier , inspired by 2008 's obama girl , has attracted massive media attention ahead of sunday 's general election . the official video of the song , sung by an unnamed 22-year-old law student from the berlin area , attracted nearly 14,000 views in its first day on the video-hosting website youtube , and the young singer has been interviewed by a host of news sources including big-selling german tabloid bild .
the video was produced by t-online 's wahlzeit.tv website , after steini-girl offered them the song she wrote together with a friend .
" she just thinks he 's a really nice guy , " wahlzeit spokesman bjoern akstinat said .
steini-girl , whose real name is being kept secret , said her main aim " is to get people voting on sunday , and maybe i 'll get a few lucrative jobs out of it too . "
ironic love declaration in the video , steini-girl dances in front of the various seats of federal government in berlin , including the reichstag and the chancellery , wearing not many clothes and kissing pictures of social democrat chancellor candidate frank-walter steinmeier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's chances against chancellor merkel this sunday are thought to be slim the song itself is mainly an ironic love declaration to steinmeier , described in the lyrics as " coiled masculinity " , while his chief opponent in the election chancellor angela merkel is dismissed as " too masculine " .
the song also deems free liberal party leader guido westerwelle " too feminine " and prominent left party politician gregor gysi " too small " .
steini-girl is consciously based on obama girl , a similar viral video song performed by model amber lee ettinger , which was massively successful in the united states during the 2008 presidential election campaign .
obama girl has attracted over 15 million clicks on youtube to date , and made a minor celebrity of ettinger .
" my friend was in the usa last year when obama girl was totally popular , and she thought we should do that , so we just messed around and made a few rhymes , the way you do , " she told bild .
the spd has denied any involvement in making the video , and a spokesman for steinmeier would not reveal whether he had watched it. bk / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , times are changing , and tax evaders from abroad will have to be more careful in future . switzerland has paved the way to be dropped from a so-called grey list of uncooperative tax havens , after signing a necessary 12th new bilateral taxation agreement with qatar .
swiss president hans-rudolf merz signed the treaty with qatar 's prime minister sheikh hamad bin jassim bin jabr al-thani on the sidelines of the un general assembly in new york late on thursday .
the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- demands that countries listed on the grey list sign at least 12 bilateral tax cooperation treaties before they lose that stigma .
switzerland has also signed deals with norway , denmark , finland , the faroe islands , great britain , france , luxembourg , austria , mexico , spain and the united states .
however , oecd head , angel guerria , stressed that switzerland not only had to sign agreements but also work toward " effective implementation . "
the alpine state , which has faced strong international pressure to join the global hunt for tax evaders , caved in earlier this year , saying it would improve cooperation with foreign tax authorities . however , the swiss government emphasized that banking secrecy would be maintained as long as no tax offences were committed .
" banking secrecy offers no protection in the case of tax offences .
as a result of the globalization of financial markets and particularly against the backdrop of the financial crisis , international cooperation in the area of taxes has grown in importance , " the swiss federal department of finance said in a statement upon completion of the 12th deal. nk / dpa / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 25.09.2009 fraud , corruption and espionage on the rise at german firms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two-thirds of corporate crime is committed by top and middle managers damages from white-collar crime at large german companies have almost tripled in recent years , according to a new study released this week .
more and more of the criminals are coming from the ranks of management . white-collar crime in germany has exploded in severity , the consulting firm pricewaterhousecoopers -lrb- pwc -rrb- said thursday , with over 60 percent of german companies reporting cases of industrial espionage , corruption and other offenses .
firms expect crime to worsen as a weak economy makes competition tougher and workers unhappier .
the average cost to a firm per incident has risen from 1.47 million euros four years ago to nearly 4.3 million euros today .
" the direct costs of crime are only the tip of the iceberg , " said pwc partner and former prosecutor steffem salvenmoser .
" above all , the reputational damage to a firm in cases of corruption , data theft or price-fixing is often greater than the measurable financial losses . "
the study 's results are based on a survey of 500 large german companies conducted by pwc in spring of 2009 , after the german economy sank into its deepest recession in over 60 years , propelled in part by the worldwide financial crisis .
over 40 percent of the surveyed firms expect competitors to use espionage or anti-competitive practices such as cartels to gain an advantage in a tough economic climate .
over a third of the companies expected workers to steal from their employers as concerns about holding onto jobs mounts .
crime from the corner office bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only 50 percent of managers accused of criminal deeds are prosecuted over 70 percent of the perpetrators were caught thanks to tipsters , the study said , despite increased investment in internal control measures designed to detect theft and fraud .
those results suggest that preventive measures have little effect according to professor kai bussmann from the martin luther university in halle , who worked on the study .
further tainting a company 's reputation is the finding that the perpetrators often come from the ranks of management .
the study said 29 percent were executives from the very top of the company 's leadership and 38 percent were middle managers .
many perpetrators were long time employees , 45 percent with more than ten years of tenure with the company and over 90 percent were men .
strikingly , despite the size and nature of the crimes , firms pressed charges against malfeasant managers just 50 percent of the time , compared to 61 percent in the pwc 's last survey in 2007 .
one fifth of the top managers who took part in crimes against their employers received no punishment whatsoever .
" although the relative leniency against perpetrators from the leadership level can be explained by the particular legal and factual difficulties of individual cases this practice is extremely problematic from vantage point of the credibility and leadership of management , " salvenmoser said. bn / ap / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the video was produced by t-online 's wahlzeit.tv website , after steini-girl offered them the song she wrote together with a friend .
" she just thinks he 's a really nice guy , " wahlzeit spokesman bjoern akstinat said .
steini-girl , whose real name is being kept secret , said her main aim " is to get people voting on sunday , and maybe i 'll get a few lucrative jobs out of it too . "
ironic love declaration in the video , steini-girl dances in front of the various seats of federal government in berlin , including the reichstag and the chancellery , wearing not many clothes and kissing pictures of social democrat chancellor candidate frank-walter steinmeier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's chances against chancellor merkel this sunday are thought to be slim the song itself is mainly an ironic love declaration to steinmeier , described in the lyrics as " coiled masculinity " , while his chief opponent in the election chancellor angela merkel is dismissed as " too masculine " .
the song also deems free liberal party leader guido westerwelle " too feminine " and prominent left party politician gregor gysi " too small " .
steini-girl is consciously based on obama girl , a similar viral video song performed by model amber lee ettinger , which was massively successful in the united states during the 2008 presidential election campaign .
obama girl has attracted over 15 million clicks on youtube to date , and made a minor celebrity of ettinger .
" my friend was in the usa last year when obama girl was totally popular , and she thought we should do that , so we just messed around and made a few rhymes , the way you do , " she told bild .
the spd has denied any involvement in making the video , and a spokesman for steinmeier would not reveal whether he had watched it. bk / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in germany , politics and pop culture are like chalk and cheese .
but some of the more intrepid candidates in the upcoming parliamentary elections are now going where few have ever dared to tread : late-night tv . german politicians looked on enviously during the last us election campaign as then-presidential-hopeful barack obama managed to mobilize the youth vote .
it was primarily his use of the internet and social networking sites that helped him reach the blasé young people who in this generation have shown little interest in politics .
but media-savvy appearances on tv talk shows also helped propel obama into the forefront of popular culture .
in march , he became the first sitting president to appear on a late-night talk show when he dropped by " the tonight show with jay leno . "
rolling with the punches the strategy has clearly been noticed in germany - where the hope is that young voters will not only help sway the current , close election , but will stay true to their parties for life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tv host stefan raab does not treat his guests with kid gloves so politicians are starting to spread their wings .
appearing on established topical chat shows aired by public broadcasters and hosted by high-minded hosts such as anne will and maybrit illner are obviously nothing new .
but as parliamentary elections loom this weekend , a slew of berlin heavyweights , from the ever-slick economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg to the loquacious left party candidate gregor gysi , have decided to take their cues from obama and appear on prime-time private broadcaster prosieben .
joining them for an election-night panel on a saturday night show will be social democrat chairman franz muentefering , while liberal free democrats and the green party are sending their respective frontrunner candidates guido westerwelle and juergen trittin .
the show ’ s host is none other than stefan raab , enfant terrible of late-night viewing .
as a tv personality , he 's famous for making his interviewees squirm - and a lot more used to grilling guests such as germany 's next top model and kylie minogue than political leaders .
over exposure still , he wo n't be the only one treading new ground . a turn on a show as anchored in youth culture as " tv total bundestagswahl 2009 " certainly marks a departure for senior politicians .
but it is likely to be a canny move .
when an election show hosted by raab aired on the eve of the vote four years ago , it snagged a 29 percent market share of the 14 -29 age group category .
obviously , politicians have decided to do whatever it takes to galvanize young voters out of their living rooms and into the polling stations come sunday , and if that means subjecting themselves to raab 's punishing wit , they 're willing to roll with the punches .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the heavily plugged merkel- steinmeier debate was widely deemed a dud after all , the duller-than-dishwater debate between chancellor angela merkel and her challenger , frank-walter steinmeier , which aired a week ahead of the vote on germany 's first public broadcaster ard , did little to tickle the public 's interest - let alone attract the younger generation .
with the two rivals remaining civil and measured throughout , it could hardly even be termed a debate .
and in terms of ratings , it was a resounding flop : 7 million fewer viewers tuned in than did four years ago , and with 7,86 million watching , it attracted a market share of only 23,4 percent .
but merkel probably feels as though she currently has enough exposure in popular culture , now that a youtube video featuring her getting heckled by a " flash mob " at an election rally in hamburg has been watched by more than a quarter of a million people in the last week .
participants shouted " yeaahh " at every sentence spoken by the conservative leader , and waved placards with the words : " all together : yeaahh . "
" this is our political message and the political meaning of this flash mob - we wo n't swallow election campaign messages anymore and we 'll throw merkel 's rubbish back at her with a ironic ' yeaahh ' , " wrote rene walter on the nerdcore.de blog , according to news agency afp .
serious co-host barring an unexpected appearance , both merkel and steinmeier will be conspicuous in their absence on the raab show , but their colleagues can expect questions on topics chosen to appeal to a younger audience , such as education , youth unemployment and the internet .
co-hosting with raab will be experienced political journalist peter limbourg , who was quoted in the daily tagesspiegel as saying that he " expects some tough talking . "
" the point is to get as many people as possible to vote , " he said .

a new resolution from the polish parliament condemns the invasion - and irks russia . a resolution unanimously approved by the polish parliament this week condemns the soviet invasion of eastern poland in 1939 .
the resolution referred to a series of massacres of poles in russia , as well as mass deportations of over one million poles to siberia .
poland also called on russia to condemn the crimes .
sixteen days after poland was invaded by nazi germany on sept .
1 , 1939 , troops under soviet dictator josef stalin were sent into eastern poland .
a year later , a soviet-led massacre in the katyn forest left over 20,000 polish officers and intellectuals dead .
angry reactions from moscow the response from russia warned that the polish resolution , which said the stalin-era crimes amount to genocide , was a set-back to improving ties between russia and poland .
" the resolution adopted by the parliament deals a serious blow to efforts to develop normal neighborly relations between our countries , " the russian foreign ministry said in a statement , adding that the resolution was " tendentious and politicized . "

" the fact that russia has reacted so nervously to a resolution that has nothing to do with present-day foreign policy is a sign that it is still unable to come to terms with its own history , " komorowski said .
tense relationship with history while the resolution brought a seventy-year old conflict to the forefront , both countries have previously had difficulty in addressing their shared history .
another contentious issue is the non-aggression pact signed between the soviets and the nazis on the eve of world war ii .
during a visit to poland by russian prime minister vladimir putin a few days before the resolution passed , putin made a surprising departure from russia 's previous attitude towards the pact by calling the document " immoral . "
many had hoped putin 's visit marked an improvement in frosty polish-russian relations of the past few years .
but according to commentators , poland and russia appear to have wasted an opportunity on the 70th anniversary of the outbreak of world war ii to use memories of their joint struggle against the nazis to bring them together – and instead decided to dwell on the past to cultivate their differences .

a new resolution from the polish parliament condemns the invasion - and irks russia . a resolution unanimously approved by the polish parliament this week condemns the soviet invasion of eastern poland in 1939 .
the resolution referred to a series of massacres of poles in russia , as well as mass deportations of over one million poles to siberia .
poland also called on russia to condemn the crimes .
sixteen days after poland was invaded by nazi germany on sept .
1 , 1939 , troops under soviet dictator josef stalin were sent into eastern poland .
a year later , a soviet-led massacre in the katyn forest left over 20,000 polish officers and intellectuals dead .
angry reactions from moscow the response from russia warned that the polish resolution , which said the stalin-era crimes amount to genocide , was a set-back to improving ties between russia and poland .
" the resolution adopted by the parliament deals a serious blow to efforts to develop normal neighborly relations between our countries , " the russian foreign ministry said in a statement , adding that the resolution was " tendentious and politicized . "

another contentious issue is the non-aggression pact signed between the soviets and the nazis on the eve of world war ii .
during a visit to poland by russian prime minister vladimir putin a few days before the resolution passed , putin made a surprising departure from russia 's previous attitude towards the pact by calling the document " immoral . "
many had hoped putin 's visit marked an improvement in frosty polish-russian relations of the past few years .
but according to commentators , poland and russia appear to have wasted an opportunity on the 70th anniversary of the outbreak of world war ii to use memories of their joint struggle against the nazis to bring them together – and instead decided to dwell on the past to cultivate their differences .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 25.09.2009 the climate ball is in the rich world 's court großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g20 could be the place to get a deal on funding to protect rainforests .
this week witnessed some important meetings for climate negotiations .
world leaders gathered for two high-level conferences in the us .
a leading us scientific advisor gave dw his thoughts on where climate talks stood . alden meyer is director of strategy and policy for the union of concerned scientists – a us organisation which campaigns for tough international action to tackle global warming .
meyer has 30 years experience advising government on environmental and energy issues , and spoke to deutsche welle from the g20 summit in pittsburgh .
he said world leaders made some progress when they met in new york for a special one-day climate summit .
he added that although the united states remains distracted by a struggle over health care reform , the g20 could prove to unblock efforts to get an ambitious agreement at december 's crucial climate conference in copenhagen .
deutsche welle : what struck you about world leaders ' addresses on climate change on tuesday ?
alden meyer : one of the significant developments at the special summit on climate change on tuesday was the commitment by chinese president hu jintao that china would put forward a carbon intensity target for china between now and 2020 that is to reduce the emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases as a proportion of their economic output .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meyer has testified before congress on global warming and energy issues it is the first time china has made that proposal .
he did not put forward a specific number , and obviously we have to wait to see how aggressive that carbon intensity reduction goal is , but it was a meaningful offer by china.i think that added some momentum coming out of new york , going into pittsburgh and on to copenhagen at the end of the year .
also , japan , the new prime minister there , pledging to increase japan 's greenhouse gas reduction target from the minus eight percent below 1990 levels , pledged by the previous government , to 25 percent below 1990 levels .
of course that 's much more in keeping with the proposal that the european union has put forward and begins to be within the range of what the science says we need to do to get a handle on the problem .
some commentators were quite disappointed with the us position , with obama 's remarks , how did you perceive them ?
i think he said a lot of the right things in terms of the urgency of the problem ; that he gets it on the science ; that the us is committed to do its part on this .
he gave a good overview of all the things he and his administration have done in the eight months since he took office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's un address won a luke warm reception from some observers i think what was disappointing to a lot of observers , and particularly to those from other countries , was that he did n't say very much about the need for the senate in our country to take action on domestic climate legislation in advance of copenhagen .
he did mention that the house has already passed a domestic climate bill and that committees in the senate are starting to consider it , but he did n't lay down the gauntlet and say to the senate ' i really need you to do this by copenhagen so that i can go in there with the credibility of the congressional backing for the position i want to take at that meeting . '
i think people understand the situation he is in .
he is fighting very hard for a domestic health care bill .
they are focused on that like a laser and do n't want to be distracting the senate with talk about other issues , but i think there is more and more impatience on the international scene about the fact that one body of our congress is threatening to hold up the whole process in copenhagen .
two years ago countries agreed to reach a new deal to replace the kyoto protocol by the end of this year , yet negotiations remain about as deadlocked as they have been for the better part of a decade .
how likely is it that we 'll see an agreement at the next big round of negotiations in copenhagen in december – especially given , as you said , that the senate in the us seems to be holding up the process ?
i think there are two big issues here .
one is what the state is of the us domestic debate .
if the president comes to copenhagen with the senate moving forward on climate legislation – with a leadership bill having been introduced and expressions of support – i think he 'll have more credibility .
certainly more than president clinton and vice-president gore did in kyoto when everyone knew that congress was not likely to back what they were putting forward .
the other piece , which is equally daunting frankly , is the issue of climate finance : the roughly 100-150 billion euro-a-year estimates for developing countries for mitigation and adaptation activities on climate change .
and there it 's not just the us , but europe and japan as well which have to do much more to advance that issue before copenhagen .
many of the developing countries have made it clear that if there is not the serious financing and technology package on offer in copenhagen that was promised back in bali two years ago , there 's not going to be a deal from their side .
bildunterschrift : western money to pay for clean development could be a deal-breaker there are still critics who question not only whether an international deal is feasible , but whether it is even desirable .
the controversial danish statistician björn lomborg told deutsche welle this week that cutting emissions was too expensive and ultimately futile .
he said the world would get more bang for its buck by investing in super-projects to pump clouds into the atmosphere to cool the planet .
does lomborg have a point ?
we certainly disagree with his premise that cutting carbon emissions is expensive .
as a matter of fact , my organization just completed an analysis of the us potential for emission reductions showing that we could go far beyond the reductions that the president and the congress are talking about , and that -lrb- we could provide -rrb- savings for consumers .
the reality is , particularly energy efficiency investments pay back very quickly , and then you get benefits from that for years to come .
there are also signals that wind energy and other renewable technologies are coming down in price .
wind is taking off in the united states as it is in other parts of the world , so i fundamentally disagree with the premise that cutting emissions has to be expensive .
yes there is some cost , but it is much less than the cost of damages from climate change that we will see if we do n't take action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish statistician bjorn lomborg says money would be better spent elsewhere when it comes to the issue of geo-engineering , this is obviously something the science community is starting to talk about .
it is very controversial , because obviously these are unproven technologies , and more importantly there could be side-effects from these large-scale geo-engineering schemes that we do n't fully understand .
we 're obviously not doing a very good of regulating the planet with our activities now , and to think that we can have some kind of technical fix that works without some kind of unforeseen side-effect is a little bit of hubris on our part .
so i think there is some interest in exploring some of these options , but i think to hang your whole strategy on that would be a grave mistake .
so what are some of the biggest challenges going to be in securing a good deal at copenhagen at the end of the year ?
indeed , what would amount to a good deal ?
i think what you need for a good deal is something that 's ambitious , that 's in line with what the science says we have to do to bend the emissions curve .
this means we need deeper reductions than what most of the industrialized countries are to date putting on the table .
we also need action by the major developing countries to see a deviation from their business-as-usual growth-path in emissions over the next decade or so , with a view towards eventually having an absolute cap and eventual reduction in their emission later this century .
and we need a substantial financing and technology package to help make those countries make the transition – to basically leap-frog across the way the industrialized countries did their development over the last century , and go right to cleaner technologies .
i think that 's going to be a real challenge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : per capita , indians produce a tenth of the co2 that americans do there also has to be a fair agreement .
it has to recognize the different stages of development that different countries are at ; that acknowledges the fact that a country like india , for example , emits two tones of carbon per person or less , whereas my country , the united states , emits 20 tones per person – ten times as much .
so it 's not fair to ask india to do the same as the united states in terms of taking leadership .
it is fair to ask india to do something , and to do more than they have been , and i think they 're showing signals that they 're willing to step up to the plate on that , as is china and other countries , but equity is a key part of this .
the third element is that it has to be binding .
it has to be something that is not just a voluntary commitment , but where countries look each other in the eye and say ' we are going to do this , we are going to have a system of verification , a system of compliance , that assures us that each of is doing our part in what we agreed to in copenhagen .
those are the three basic elements – it has to be fair , it has to be ambitious and it has to be binding .
climate change is also on the agenda when the leaders of the group of 20 major economies meet on thursday and friday .
some say the g20 could prove to be an even more important venue to overcome deadlocks between rich nations like the us and developing countries like china … the two issues that are on the agenda here in pittsburgh this week are climate finance .
how do you generate and govern the flows of investment that are needed for clean energy technologies ; reducing the rate of deforestation in tropical rainforest countries ; and for helping the poorest countries adapt to the impacts of climate change .
that 's going to be a big discussion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the g20 be the right venue to broker a compromise ?
the other issue , which the us has put on the agenda , is the issue of fossil fuel subsidies .
it turns out that the world is spending somewhere around 200 billion dollars a year or more encouraging production and consumption on the very things we 're trying to reduce to deal with global warming – that 's coal and oil .
so that topic is on the agenda , we 'll see how far we get with that , that 's obviously a very difficult issue - not only for the united states , but other countries .
it 's very political and there are entrenched interests that benefit from those embedded subsidies and will fight very hard against efforts to reduce or eliminate them .
climate is just one of the topics , but it is the first time that it has been on the agenda in a way like at the g20 and i think that does give us some prospect of movement .
certainly if they do some follow up between pittsburgh and copenhagen and the g20 process , they could help deliver that element of the package on climate finance . interview : nathan witkop editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de food and drink -pipe- 25.09.2009 kenyans learn to milk their resources the italian way großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kenyan farmers swapping skills with their italian counterparts the terzoi from western kenya have traditionally made an unusual yogurt , but they 've never turned their milk into cheese .
they presented their produce in italy this year and swapped knowledge with italian farmers . leaving the arid plains of west pokot in kenya for the rolling green hills of piedmont in northern italy , four goat- and cow-herders from the terzoi tribe were among the special guests at cheese 2009 . it is the slow food movement 's biennial fair aimed at protecting and preserving traditional dairy products . the kenyans were presenting their unique yogurt , fermented in colorful hollowed gourds .
what makes it special is ash – made from burning branches of the local cromwo tree – that 's added to it as a disinfectant and preservative , giving it a distinctive aromatic flavor and speckled grey color . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional terzoi yoghurt is fermented in gourds the community is very poor : they live in mud and straw huts , their animals graze freely , and they do n't have any dairy facilities .
but , thanks to slow food 's interest in their product , these farmers have had the opportunity to leave their country for the first time and discover first-hand the techniques and traditions of their italian counterparts . a great exchange of skills " it has been a phenomenal learning experience , for both the kenyans and the farmers in italy . " said peter namianya , a kenyan graduate from the university of gastronomy in piedmont , who coordinated the trip . " when the terzoi saw the italian goats they exclaimed ' oh , they 're the size of my cows ! ' , and everybody laughed . "
the kenyan goat and cow herders and their italian counterparts discovered they have a lot in common . the time spent with local dairy farmers , cheese-makers and vets was a real cultural exchange .
" one of them would say , ' back home we do it like this ' , and the other would reply , ' here you do it like this . " kenyans and italians discover how much they have in common bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kenyan cattleherders inspecting italian stables the group spent two and a half days on mario gala 's farm , where he taught them how to improve their hygiene standards and look after their animals ' health . " i think the shepherds from kenya are more similar to me than any italian bank employee ! " , laughed mario gala , " we are the same people .
our day is the same , we pay attention to the seasons , the rain , the pasturing , the good health of our animals , my cheese , their yogurt . " gala 's kenyan visitors were equally enthusiastic .
" there are some things that we have not done well , like milking and cleaning , and we are going to improve our standards , " said simon pkite lochawan .
the group was clearly impressed by the high importance put on hygiene in the stables and the quality of animal fodder in italy . learning the art of cheese making bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a cross-cultural culinary encounter one of the most exciting and precious skills the kenyans have learned is the art of cheese-making .
for countless generations , the terzoi have been making butter and their unusual yogurt , but they 've never turned their milk into cheese .
although you can buy imported cheeses at supermarkets in kenya 's big cities , farmers have no cheesemaking traditions of their own . " they do n't have a culture of cheese but they want to try to make it when they go back home , " said peter namianya .
he added that this is a unique way of conserving milk , instead of just making yogurt and drinking fresh milk . this could also become another way of reducing hunger in the community . " if there is abundant milk , they can make cheese and store it and then use it in a time when there 's no food . " praise for traditional kenyan yoghurt pkite and his colleagues have enjoyed the opportunity to try so many different varieties of cheese at the slow food fair .
they especially like the taste of soft cheeses like ricotta , and are looking forward to experimenting with their own milk when they get back .
the positive reactions to their yoghurt have also made them realize the value of their own traditional product . the kenyans ' visit has also inspired the curiosity of their italian hosts , who are now keen to experience everyday life in west pokot . namianya already envisions a kind of eco-tourism : " you go to the village , taste their food and taste the real culture of the people .

however , times are changing , and tax evaders from abroad will have to be more careful in future . switzerland has paved the way to be dropped from a so-called grey list of uncooperative tax havens , after signing a necessary 12th new bilateral taxation agreement with qatar .
swiss president hans-rudolf merz signed the treaty with qatar 's prime minister sheikh hamad bin jassim bin jabr al-thani on the sidelines of the un general assembly in new york late on thursday .
the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- demands that countries listed on the grey list sign at least 12 bilateral tax cooperation treaties before they lose that stigma .
switzerland has also signed deals with norway , denmark , finland , the faroe islands , great britain , france , luxembourg , austria , mexico , spain and the united states .
however , oecd head , angel guerria , stressed that switzerland not only had to sign agreements but also work toward " effective implementation . "
the alpine state , which has faced strong international pressure to join the global hunt for tax evaders , caved in earlier this year , saying it would improve cooperation with foreign tax authorities . however , the swiss government emphasized that banking secrecy would be maintained as long as no tax offences were committed .
" banking secrecy offers no protection in the case of tax offences .
as a result of the globalization of financial markets and particularly against the backdrop of the financial crisis , international cooperation in the area of taxes has grown in importance , " the swiss federal department of finance said in a statement upon completion of the 12th deal. nk / dpa / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de entertainment -pipe- 25.09.2009 top german politicians brave youth tv to boost popularity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will germans follow the us strategy for youth votes ?
in germany , politics and pop culture are like chalk and cheese .
but some of the more intrepid candidates in the upcoming parliamentary elections are now going where few have ever dared to tread : late-night tv . german politicians looked on enviously during the last us election campaign as then-presidential-hopeful barack obama managed to mobilize the youth vote .
it was primarily his use of the internet and social networking sites that helped him reach the blasé young people who in this generation have shown little interest in politics .
but media-savvy appearances on tv talk shows also helped propel obama into the forefront of popular culture .
in march , he became the first sitting president to appear on a late-night talk show when he dropped by " the tonight show with jay leno . "
rolling with the punches the strategy has clearly been noticed in germany - where the hope is that young voters will not only help sway the current , close election , but will stay true to their parties for life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tv host stefan raab does not treat his guests with kid gloves so politicians are starting to spread their wings .
appearing on established topical chat shows aired by public broadcasters and hosted by high-minded hosts such as anne will and maybrit illner are obviously nothing new .
but as parliamentary elections loom this weekend , a slew of berlin heavyweights , from the ever-slick economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg to the loquacious left party candidate gregor gysi , have decided to take their cues from obama and appear on prime-time private broadcaster prosieben .
joining them for an election-night panel on a saturday night show will be social democrat chairman franz muentefering , while liberal free democrats and the green party are sending their respective frontrunner candidates guido westerwelle and juergen trittin .
the show ’ s host is none other than stefan raab , enfant terrible of late-night viewing .
as a tv personality , he 's famous for making his interviewees squirm - and a lot more used to grilling guests such as germany 's next top model and kylie minogue than political leaders .
over exposure still , he wo n't be the only one treading new ground . a turn on a show as anchored in youth culture as " tv total bundestagswahl 2009 " certainly marks a departure for senior politicians .
but it is likely to be a canny move .
when an election show hosted by raab aired on the eve of the vote four years ago , it snagged a 29 percent market share of the 14 -29 age group category .
obviously , politicians have decided to do whatever it takes to galvanize young voters out of their living rooms and into the polling stations come sunday , and if that means subjecting themselves to raab 's punishing wit , they 're willing to roll with the punches .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the heavily plugged merkel- steinmeier debate was widely deemed a dud after all , the duller-than-dishwater debate between chancellor angela merkel and her challenger , frank-walter steinmeier , which aired a week ahead of the vote on germany 's first public broadcaster ard , did little to tickle the public 's interest - let alone attract the younger generation .
with the two rivals remaining civil and measured throughout , it could hardly even be termed a debate .
and in terms of ratings , it was a resounding flop : 7 million fewer viewers tuned in than did four years ago , and with 7,86 million watching , it attracted a market share of only 23,4 percent .
but merkel probably feels as though she currently has enough exposure in popular culture , now that a youtube video featuring her getting heckled by a " flash mob " at an election rally in hamburg has been watched by more than a quarter of a million people in the last week .
participants shouted " yeaahh " at every sentence spoken by the conservative leader , and waved placards with the words : " all together : yeaahh . "
" this is our political message and the political meaning of this flash mob - we wo n't swallow election campaign messages anymore and we 'll throw merkel 's rubbish back at her with a ironic ' yeaahh ' , " wrote rene walter on the nerdcore.de blog , according to news agency afp .
serious co-host barring an unexpected appearance , both merkel and steinmeier will be conspicuous in their absence on the raab show , but their colleagues can expect questions on topics chosen to appeal to a younger audience , such as education , youth unemployment and the internet .
co-hosting with raab will be experienced political journalist peter limbourg , who was quoted in the daily tagesspiegel as saying that he " expects some tough talking . "
" the point is to get as many people as possible to vote , " he said .

dw-world.de dull german tv election debate slightly benefits steinmeier two weeks ahead of the general election , a tv debate between chancellor angela merkel , and her challenger , frank walter steinmeier has been described as tepid and bloodless .
-lrb- 15.09.2009 -rrb- german parties try to learn from us campaign , but fail to excite voters ever since barack obama redefined campaigning during the us election , german parties have been eager to adapt his methods .
but despite their best efforts , the german election is a far cry from last year 's obamamania .
-lrb- 07.09.2009 -rrb- germany 's market busting tv star raab goes global imported shows have long been a staple of german tv , but the reverse is rarely true .
now a game show created by an unlikely , if ubiquitous , german tv personality is taking foreign markets by storm .

this year ’ s guest of honour , china , is refusing to allow a writer to exit the country to attend a debate at berlin ’ s house of world cultures .
liao yiwu , who has spent years in prison and whose books are banned in china was supposed to attend the “ frenetic homeland ” series that is part of the asia pacific weeks in the german capital . liao yiwu is 50 years old .
the musician and author has felt the brunt of the chinese state police many times .
he was first arrested in 1990 .
he had written a series of poems criticising the massacre on tiananmen square .
on 4th june 1989 , the chinese army moved in with tanks to disperse protesters who had been calling for more rights and democracy .
a few years later , liao yiwu was again arrested .
this time it was for publishing an article online .
he has spent a total of four years in jail just for criticising the state .
but he is not a broken man .
" i am healthy , ” he says .
“ i have done a lot in my life .
my attitude has changed with time .
at first , i was angry .
i couldn ’ t stand all this injustice .
that has changed .
if you can ’ t stand things , you should learn from them .
i have learnt from my suffering .
in prison , i learnt to play the flute and came into contact with simple people .
that would never have been the case if i hadn ’ t been to jail . ”
speaking up for simple people after his time in jail , liao yiwu developed an interest in china ’ s simple people - in those whose voices are rarely heard - prostitutes , migrant workers and petty criminals , for instance .
these are the protagonists of his books , in which he criticises the fact that the rich have all the power .
his books have been translated and published abroad but are banned in china .
" for people in the west , it ’ s completely normal to be able to write about anything freely , ” he explains .
“ but in china , one has to fight for this .
one has to try to push a closed door inch by inch .
i will keep fighting for the right to publish here .
if i don ’ t manage and continue to be censored i will go on working .
even if only one person reads my book then at least i will have influenced one person . “ china is where he wants to be despite the fact that liao yiwu is unknown to the broad chinese public because the authorities stop him from getting near it , he is not bitter and china remains the place where he wants to be .
" for me , freedom is when the heart is free .
i have yellow skin and sometimes i ’ m engulfed by the feeling that i would like to be somebody else .
but chinese blood flows through my veins .
it would be terrible if i had to live in exile .
that would be worse than being stopped from travelling outside of china .
i can write in my mother tongue here and i have so many people around me who give me warmth .
i can consider myself lucky . ”
perhaps he will even be lucky enough to travel to germany after all .
the head of the frankfurt book fair jürgen boos has said he will try to persuade the chinese authorities .

" fostering a culture of corporate integrity is essential to protect investment , increase commercial success and ensure the stability sought by poor and rich countries alike , particularly as we climb out of an historical crisis , ” said transparency international chair huguette labelle .
the global corruption report documents that in developing and emerging countries , companies paid $ 40 billion -lrb- 27.2 billion euros -rrb- annually in bribes to polticians and government officials .
ultimately it is consumers around the globe who foot the bill .
project costs increase by at least 10 percent , according to a poll of business executives conducted by transparency international .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bribery and corruption are problems in the eurozone corporate integrity " it is not just a question of tackling corruption in business - it is also important for financial and economic stability and the ongoing reforms of the global financial architecture " , the ti report said .
another concern is the sheer economic power of some companies and business sectors , which translates into disproportionate influence on political decision-making .
the report called on companies to publish regular reports on how they are fighting corruption and to disclose information on financial support for political parties , lobbyists and governments .
transparency international also recommended that governments apply anti-corruption regulations with more vigor .
" it is time that corporations face up to the risk of paying millions in fines and the long-term loss of trust from their customers and shareholders " , said labelle .
report discusses siemens , volkswagen scandals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens has now forbidden corrupt practices one of the biggest corruption scandals in recent years in germany involves the electronics giant , siemens .
the ti report reviews the case and lists the heavy fines imposed .
it notes , " with more prosecutions expected , germany 's largest post-war economic scandal is likely to dominate the news for the next few years . "
however , it criticizes germany for not learning from the scandal , noting that one of the former siemens ceos , who was accused of bribery and corruption , was allowed to continue as head of a major government think tank until the institution was dissolved in 2008 .
the report also discusses the more recent vw corruption scandal in which an entire works council accepted large bribes as well as luxury hotel accommodation and , more embarrassingly , visits to brothels to encourage them to accept employer-friendly practices .
indeed , further examples in the report imply that this is one of the major forms of corruption in german society - big business offering inducements to workers ' representatives to push through management decisions , leading to unfair competitive practices to the detriment of the individual employee .
concern remains over tax havens the section of the report concentrating on germany concludes by turning its attention away from big business to wealthy individuals and the widespread use of tax havens such as liechtenstein .
it cites the case of former deutsche post ceo , klaus zumwinkel , who was arrested on charges of evading one million euros in taxes .
as a result , zumwinkel resigned from his post and was later convicted of tax evasion .
that investigation led to the revelation that german officials had spent over four million euros -lrb- $ 6 million -rrb- to obtain information about large sums deposited by wealthy germans in secret bank accounts in liechtenstein .
it 's been argued that the expense was well worthwhile because it 's expected to lead to the recovery of hundreds of millions of euros in back taxes .
transparency international complains of german inaction germany has been sharply criticized by ti for failing to ratify the un convention against corruption during the last legislative period , failing to introduce a corruption register and for not fulfilling transparency requirements when awarding public sector contracts .
last year germany was listed 14th out of 180 countries in ti 's annual corruption and bribery rankings .

" fostering a culture of corporate integrity is essential to protect investment , increase commercial success and ensure the stability sought by poor and rich countries alike , particularly as we climb out of an historical crisis , ” said transparency international chair huguette labelle .
the global corruption report documents that in developing and emerging countries , companies paid $ 40 billion -lrb- 27.2 billion euros -rrb- annually in bribes to polticians and government officials .
ultimately it is consumers around the globe who foot the bill .
project costs increase by at least 10 percent , according to a poll of business executives conducted by transparency international .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bribery and corruption are problems in the eurozone corporate integrity " it is not just a question of tackling corruption in business - it is also important for financial and economic stability and the ongoing reforms of the global financial architecture " , the ti report said .
another concern is the sheer economic power of some companies and business sectors , which translates into disproportionate influence on political decision-making .
the report called on companies to publish regular reports on how they are fighting corruption and to disclose information on financial support for political parties , lobbyists and governments .
transparency international also recommended that governments apply anti-corruption regulations with more vigor .
" it is time that corporations face up to the risk of paying millions in fines and the long-term loss of trust from their customers and shareholders " , said labelle .
report discusses siemens , volkswagen scandals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens has now forbidden corrupt practices one of the biggest corruption scandals in recent years in germany involves the electronics giant , siemens .
the ti report reviews the case and lists the heavy fines imposed .
it notes , " with more prosecutions expected , germany 's largest post-war economic scandal is likely to dominate the news for the next few years . "
however , it criticizes germany for not learning from the scandal , noting that one of the former siemens ceos , who was accused of bribery and corruption , was allowed to continue as head of a major government think tank until the institution was dissolved in 2008 .
the report also discusses the more recent vw corruption scandal in which an entire works council accepted large bribes as well as luxury hotel accommodation and , more embarrassingly , visits to brothels to encourage them to accept employer-friendly practices .
indeed , further examples in the report imply that this is one of the major forms of corruption in german society - big business offering inducements to workers ' representatives to push through management decisions , leading to unfair competitive practices to the detriment of the individual employee .
concern remains over tax havens the section of the report concentrating on germany concludes by turning its attention away from big business to wealthy individuals and the widespread use of tax havens such as liechtenstein .
it cites the case of former deutsche post ceo , klaus zumwinkel , who was arrested on charges of evading one million euros in taxes .
as a result , zumwinkel resigned from his post and was later convicted of tax evasion .
that investigation led to the revelation that german officials had spent over four million euros -lrb- $ 6 million -rrb- to obtain information about large sums deposited by wealthy germans in secret bank accounts in liechtenstein .
it 's been argued that the expense was well worthwhile because it 's expected to lead to the recovery of hundreds of millions of euros in back taxes .
transparency international complains of german inaction germany has been sharply criticized by ti for failing to ratify the un convention against corruption during the last legislative period , failing to introduce a corruption register and for not fulfilling transparency requirements when awarding public sector contracts .
last year germany was listed 14th out of 180 countries in ti 's annual corruption and bribery rankings .

they presented their produce in italy this year and swapped knowledge with italian farmers . leaving the arid plains of west pokot in kenya for the rolling green hills of piedmont in northern italy , four goat- and cow-herders from the terzoi tribe were among the special guests at cheese 2009 . it is the slow food movement 's biennial fair aimed at protecting and preserving traditional dairy products . the kenyans were presenting their unique yogurt , fermented in colorful hollowed gourds .
what makes it special is ash – made from burning branches of the local cromwo tree – that 's added to it as a disinfectant and preservative , giving it a distinctive aromatic flavor and speckled grey color . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional terzoi yoghurt is fermented in gourds the community is very poor : they live in mud and straw huts , their animals graze freely , and they do n't have any dairy facilities .
but , thanks to slow food 's interest in their product , these farmers have had the opportunity to leave their country for the first time and discover first-hand the techniques and traditions of their italian counterparts . a great exchange of skills " it has been a phenomenal learning experience , for both the kenyans and the farmers in italy . " said peter namianya , a kenyan graduate from the university of gastronomy in piedmont , who coordinated the trip . " when the terzoi saw the italian goats they exclaimed ' oh , they 're the size of my cows ! ' , and everybody laughed . "
the kenyan goat and cow herders and their italian counterparts discovered they have a lot in common . the time spent with local dairy farmers , cheese-makers and vets was a real cultural exchange .
" one of them would say , ' back home we do it like this ' , and the other would reply , ' here you do it like this . " kenyans and italians discover how much they have in common bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kenyan cattleherders inspecting italian stables the group spent two and a half days on mario gala 's farm , where he taught them how to improve their hygiene standards and look after their animals ' health . " i think the shepherds from kenya are more similar to me than any italian bank employee ! " , laughed mario gala , " we are the same people .
our day is the same , we pay attention to the seasons , the rain , the pasturing , the good health of our animals , my cheese , their yogurt . " gala 's kenyan visitors were equally enthusiastic .
" there are some things that we have not done well , like milking and cleaning , and we are going to improve our standards , " said simon pkite lochawan .
the group was clearly impressed by the high importance put on hygiene in the stables and the quality of animal fodder in italy . learning the art of cheese making bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a cross-cultural culinary encounter one of the most exciting and precious skills the kenyans have learned is the art of cheese-making .
for countless generations , the terzoi have been making butter and their unusual yogurt , but they 've never turned their milk into cheese .
although you can buy imported cheeses at supermarkets in kenya 's big cities , farmers have no cheesemaking traditions of their own . " they do n't have a culture of cheese but they want to try to make it when they go back home , " said peter namianya .
he added that this is a unique way of conserving milk , instead of just making yogurt and drinking fresh milk . this could also become another way of reducing hunger in the community . " if there is abundant milk , they can make cheese and store it and then use it in a time when there 's no food . " praise for traditional kenyan yoghurt pkite and his colleagues have enjoyed the opportunity to try so many different varieties of cheese at the slow food fair .
they especially like the taste of soft cheeses like ricotta , and are looking forward to experimenting with their own milk when they get back .
the positive reactions to their yoghurt have also made them realize the value of their own traditional product . the kenyans ' visit has also inspired the curiosity of their italian hosts , who are now keen to experience everyday life in west pokot . namianya already envisions a kind of eco-tourism : " you go to the village , taste their food and taste the real culture of the people .

they presented their produce in italy this year and swapped knowledge with italian farmers . leaving the arid plains of west pokot in kenya for the rolling green hills of piedmont in northern italy , four goat- and cow-herders from the terzoi tribe were among the special guests at cheese 2009 . it is the slow food movement 's biennial fair aimed at protecting and preserving traditional dairy products . the kenyans were presenting their unique yogurt , fermented in colorful hollowed gourds .
what makes it special is ash – made from burning branches of the local cromwo tree – that 's added to it as a disinfectant and preservative , giving it a distinctive aromatic flavor and speckled grey color . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional terzoi yoghurt is fermented in gourds the community is very poor : they live in mud and straw huts , their animals graze freely , and they do n't have any dairy facilities .
but , thanks to slow food 's interest in their product , these farmers have had the opportunity to leave their country for the first time and discover first-hand the techniques and traditions of their italian counterparts . a great exchange of skills " it has been a phenomenal learning experience , for both the kenyans and the farmers in italy . " said peter namianya , a kenyan graduate from the university of gastronomy in piedmont , who coordinated the trip . " when the terzoi saw the italian goats they exclaimed ' oh , they 're the size of my cows ! ' , and everybody laughed . "
the kenyan goat and cow herders and their italian counterparts discovered they have a lot in common . the time spent with local dairy farmers , cheese-makers and vets was a real cultural exchange .
" one of them would say , ' back home we do it like this ' , and the other would reply , ' here you do it like this . " kenyans and italians discover how much they have in common bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kenyan cattleherders inspecting italian stables the group spent two and a half days on mario gala 's farm , where he taught them how to improve their hygiene standards and look after their animals ' health . " i think the shepherds from kenya are more similar to me than any italian bank employee ! " , laughed mario gala , " we are the same people .
our day is the same , we pay attention to the seasons , the rain , the pasturing , the good health of our animals , my cheese , their yogurt . " gala 's kenyan visitors were equally enthusiastic .
" there are some things that we have not done well , like milking and cleaning , and we are going to improve our standards , " said simon pkite lochawan .
the group was clearly impressed by the high importance put on hygiene in the stables and the quality of animal fodder in italy . learning the art of cheese making bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a cross-cultural culinary encounter one of the most exciting and precious skills the kenyans have learned is the art of cheese-making .
for countless generations , the terzoi have been making butter and their unusual yogurt , but they 've never turned their milk into cheese .
although you can buy imported cheeses at supermarkets in kenya 's big cities , farmers have no cheesemaking traditions of their own . " they do n't have a culture of cheese but they want to try to make it when they go back home , " said peter namianya .
he added that this is a unique way of conserving milk , instead of just making yogurt and drinking fresh milk . this could also become another way of reducing hunger in the community . " if there is abundant milk , they can make cheese and store it and then use it in a time when there 's no food . " praise for traditional kenyan yoghurt pkite and his colleagues have enjoyed the opportunity to try so many different varieties of cheese at the slow food fair .
they especially like the taste of soft cheeses like ricotta , and are looking forward to experimenting with their own milk when they get back .
the positive reactions to their yoghurt have also made them realize the value of their own traditional product . the kenyans ' visit has also inspired the curiosity of their italian hosts , who are now keen to experience everyday life in west pokot . namianya already envisions a kind of eco-tourism : " you go to the village , taste their food and taste the real culture of the people .

in germany , politics and pop culture are like chalk and cheese .
but some of the more intrepid candidates in the upcoming parliamentary elections are now going where few have ever dared to tread : late-night tv . german politicians looked on enviously during the last us election campaign as then-presidential-hopeful barack obama managed to mobilize the youth vote .
it was primarily his use of the internet and social networking sites that helped him reach the blasé young people who in this generation have shown little interest in politics .
but media-savvy appearances on tv talk shows also helped propel obama into the forefront of popular culture .
in march , he became the first sitting president to appear on a late-night talk show when he dropped by " the tonight show with jay leno . "
rolling with the punches the strategy has clearly been noticed in germany - where the hope is that young voters will not only help sway the current , close election , but will stay true to their parties for life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tv host stefan raab does not treat his guests with kid gloves so politicians are starting to spread their wings .
appearing on established topical chat shows aired by public broadcasters and hosted by high-minded hosts such as anne will and maybrit illner are obviously nothing new .
but as parliamentary elections loom this weekend , a slew of berlin heavyweights , from the ever-slick economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg to the loquacious left party candidate gregor gysi , have decided to take their cues from obama and appear on prime-time private broadcaster prosieben .
joining them for an election-night panel on a saturday night show will be social democrat chairman franz muentefering , while liberal free democrats and the green party are sending their respective frontrunner candidates guido westerwelle and juergen trittin .
the show ’ s host is none other than stefan raab , enfant terrible of late-night viewing .
as a tv personality , he 's famous for making his interviewees squirm - and a lot more used to grilling guests such as germany 's next top model and kylie minogue than political leaders .
over exposure still , he wo n't be the only one treading new ground . a turn on a show as anchored in youth culture as " tv total bundestagswahl 2009 " certainly marks a departure for senior politicians .
but it is likely to be a canny move .
when an election show hosted by raab aired on the eve of the vote four years ago , it snagged a 29 percent market share of the 14 -29 age group category .
obviously , politicians have decided to do whatever it takes to galvanize young voters out of their living rooms and into the polling stations come sunday , and if that means subjecting themselves to raab 's punishing wit , they 're willing to roll with the punches .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the heavily plugged merkel- steinmeier debate was widely deemed a dud after all , the duller-than-dishwater debate between chancellor angela merkel and her challenger , frank-walter steinmeier , which aired a week ahead of the vote on germany 's first public broadcaster ard , did little to tickle the public 's interest - let alone attract the younger generation .
with the two rivals remaining civil and measured throughout , it could hardly even be termed a debate .
and in terms of ratings , it was a resounding flop : 7 million fewer viewers tuned in than did four years ago , and with 7,86 million watching , it attracted a market share of only 23,4 percent .
but merkel probably feels as though she currently has enough exposure in popular culture , now that a youtube video featuring her getting heckled by a " flash mob " at an election rally in hamburg has been watched by more than a quarter of a million people in the last week .
participants shouted " yeaahh " at every sentence spoken by the conservative leader , and waved placards with the words : " all together : yeaahh . "
" this is our political message and the political meaning of this flash mob - we wo n't swallow election campaign messages anymore and we 'll throw merkel 's rubbish back at her with a ironic ' yeaahh ' , " wrote rene walter on the nerdcore.de blog , according to news agency afp .
serious co-host barring an unexpected appearance , both merkel and steinmeier will be conspicuous in their absence on the raab show , but their colleagues can expect questions on topics chosen to appeal to a younger audience , such as education , youth unemployment and the internet .
co-hosting with raab will be experienced political journalist peter limbourg , who was quoted in the daily tagesspiegel as saying that he " expects some tough talking . "
" the point is to get as many people as possible to vote , " he said .

however , times are changing , and tax evaders from abroad will have to be more careful in future . switzerland has paved the way to be dropped from a so-called grey list of uncooperative tax havens , after signing a necessary 12th new bilateral taxation agreement with qatar .
swiss president hans-rudolf merz signed the treaty with qatar 's prime minister sheikh hamad bin jassim bin jabr al-thani on the sidelines of the un general assembly in new york late on thursday .
the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- demands that countries listed on the grey list sign at least 12 bilateral tax cooperation treaties before they lose that stigma .
switzerland has also signed deals with norway , denmark , finland , the faroe islands , great britain , france , luxembourg , austria , mexico , spain and the united states .
however , oecd head , angel guerria , stressed that switzerland not only had to sign agreements but also work toward " effective implementation . "
the alpine state , which has faced strong international pressure to join the global hunt for tax evaders , caved in earlier this year , saying it would improve cooperation with foreign tax authorities . however , the swiss government emphasized that banking secrecy would be maintained as long as no tax offences were committed .
" banking secrecy offers no protection in the case of tax offences .
as a result of the globalization of financial markets and particularly against the backdrop of the financial crisis , international cooperation in the area of taxes has grown in importance , " the swiss federal department of finance said in a statement upon completion of the 12th deal. nk / dpa / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in germany , politics and pop culture are like chalk and cheese .
but some of the more intrepid candidates in the upcoming parliamentary elections are now going where few have ever dared to tread : late-night tv . german politicians looked on enviously during the last us election campaign as then-presidential-hopeful barack obama managed to mobilize the youth vote .
it was primarily his use of the internet and social networking sites that helped him reach the blasé young people who in this generation have shown little interest in politics .
but media-savvy appearances on tv talk shows also helped propel obama into the forefront of popular culture .
in march , he became the first sitting president to appear on a late-night talk show when he dropped by " the tonight show with jay leno . "
rolling with the punches the strategy has clearly been noticed in germany - where the hope is that young voters will not only help sway the current , close election , but will stay true to their parties for life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tv host stefan raab does not treat his guests with kid gloves so politicians are starting to spread their wings .
appearing on established topical chat shows aired by public broadcasters and hosted by high-minded hosts such as anne will and maybrit illner are obviously nothing new .
but as parliamentary elections loom this weekend , a slew of berlin heavyweights , from the ever-slick economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg to the loquacious left party candidate gregor gysi , have decided to take their cues from obama and appear on prime-time private broadcaster prosieben .
joining them for an election-night panel on a saturday night show will be social democrat chairman franz muentefering , while liberal free democrats and the green party are sending their respective frontrunner candidates guido westerwelle and juergen trittin .
the show ’ s host is none other than stefan raab , enfant terrible of late-night viewing .
as a tv personality , he 's famous for making his interviewees squirm - and a lot more used to grilling guests such as germany 's next top model and kylie minogue than political leaders .
over exposure still , he wo n't be the only one treading new ground . a turn on a show as anchored in youth culture as " tv total bundestagswahl 2009 " certainly marks a departure for senior politicians .
but it is likely to be a canny move .
when an election show hosted by raab aired on the eve of the vote four years ago , it snagged a 29 percent market share of the 14 -29 age group category .
obviously , politicians have decided to do whatever it takes to galvanize young voters out of their living rooms and into the polling stations come sunday , and if that means subjecting themselves to raab 's punishing wit , they 're willing to roll with the punches .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the heavily plugged merkel- steinmeier debate was widely deemed a dud after all , the duller-than-dishwater debate between chancellor angela merkel and her challenger , frank-walter steinmeier , which aired a week ahead of the vote on germany 's first public broadcaster ard , did little to tickle the public 's interest - let alone attract the younger generation .

however , times are changing , and tax evaders from abroad will have to be more careful in future . switzerland has paved the way to be dropped from a so-called grey list of uncooperative tax havens , after signing a necessary 12th new bilateral taxation agreement with qatar .
swiss president hans-rudolf merz signed the treaty with qatar 's prime minister sheikh hamad bin jassim bin jabr al-thani on the sidelines of the un general assembly in new york late on thursday .
the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- demands that countries listed on the grey list sign at least 12 bilateral tax cooperation treaties before they lose that stigma .
switzerland has also signed deals with norway , denmark , finland , the faroe islands , great britain , france , luxembourg , austria , mexico , spain and the united states .
however , oecd head , angel guerria , stressed that switzerland not only had to sign agreements but also work toward " effective implementation . "
the alpine state , which has faced strong international pressure to join the global hunt for tax evaders , caved in earlier this year , saying it would improve cooperation with foreign tax authorities . however , the swiss government emphasized that banking secrecy would be maintained as long as no tax offences were committed .
" banking secrecy offers no protection in the case of tax offences .
as a result of the globalization of financial markets and particularly against the backdrop of the financial crisis , international cooperation in the area of taxes has grown in importance , " the swiss federal department of finance said in a statement upon completion of the 12th deal. nk / dpa / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de latin america -pipe- 25.09.2009 brazil shows south american neighbors how to trade with africa großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's president lula da silva has increased trade with africa one goal of the second south america-africa summit this weekend in venezuela is to increase cooperation between the continents .
most countries could learn a lesson or two on how to do that from brazil . a new geography of international trade called " south-south " - that is the ambitious goal of brazilian president luiz inácio “ lula ” da silva .
the former trade union leader wants to better connect his country with other developing and emerging nations , a vision he already announced back in 2004 at a un trade conference in sao paulo .
while he wanted to continue to export to industrial nations , he also emphasized that he was looking for new opportunities .
" we want to foster partnerships , which enable better cooperation between the economies of the south , " lula said .
that strategy seems to work .
today brazil sells more goods to developing and emerging countries than to countries in the northern hemisphere .
china has become brazil 's third largest trade partner , after the us , and close behind neighboring argentina .
aside from china , brazilian companies have increasingly focused on africa , a continent , which in the past was regarded mainly as the home of former slaves .
lula himself already has travelled to africa eleven times and does n't get tired of repeating that brazil is home to the largest population of african descent outside of africa .
the official export agency apex has also intensified its efforts and earlier this month a delegation of brazilian businessmen visited south africa .
maurício manfré , who leads the project within apex , does n't view himself merely as a representative of brazilian companies .
he is also on the look out for products , which he can import .
" we want to expand and intensify this relationship , " he says .
rapid increase in exports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angola is brasil 's number one african trading partner in the past ten years brazilian exports to sub-saharan africa have increased almost eightfold .
last year they reached more than ten billion us dollars , five percent of all brazilian exports .
angola was brazil 's number one export destination with two billion us dollars , followed by south africa with 1.8 billion dollars and nigeria with 1.5 billion dollars respectively .
especially in the midst of the global financial and economic crisis new markets in africa are more than welcome , says jorge duarte de oliveira , the director of exportaminas , the export agency of the south eastern brazilian state of minas gerais : " the emerging countries have suffered considerably less from the international crisis , " he explains .
" they offer very attractive markets to small companies , which produce consumer goods here in brazil for the middle and lower class . "
jorge duarte de oliveira is convinced that those smaller brazilian producers will find the same kind of customers in africa and the middle east .
wide range of brasilian exports to africa while two thirds of chinese imports from brazil are commodities like soy and iron ore and bejing has little interest in industrial products , brazil 's range of exports to africa is more diverse .
only one third are commodities , two thirds consist of assembled products , from textiles and furniture to agricultural machines .
" africa has n't been able yet to develop its own industries .
that 's why the africans buy a large part of brazil 's industrial exports , " says carlos abijaodi , a trade expert with the industrial association of the federal state of minas gerais .
that is the reason why brazil 's range of products is broad , he explains brazil is also closely related to africa , adds abijaodi and says that he noticed that through his international contacts .
" they have similar customs and in the portuguese speaking countries in africa like angola and mozambique we share the same language . "
brazilian multinationals invest billions in africa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mozambique could also see a surge in brazilian investments brazil 's most important trading partner in africa is angola .
the oil-rich country which boasted double-digit growth rates in recent years has attracted investments by many brazilian companies .
petrobrás , the state-run oil concern , is surveying angola 's coast for possible oil fields while construction firm odebrecht maintains roads and brazilian conglomerate camargo corrêa builds a 370 million dollar cement plant in angola .
but in the near future , mozambique , africa 's most populous portuguese speaking country , is likely to also become more attractive for brazil .
vale , the leading brazilian mining company , invests 1.3 billion dollars there to exploit coal near moatize in central mozambique .
moatize is considered to be one of the largest unexploited coal reserves in the world .
it could provide high quality coal for more than a hundred years .

a new resolution from the polish parliament condemns the invasion - and irks russia . a resolution unanimously approved by the polish parliament this week condemns the soviet invasion of eastern poland in 1939 .
the resolution referred to a series of massacres of poles in russia , as well as mass deportations of over one million poles to siberia .
poland also called on russia to condemn the crimes .
sixteen days after poland was invaded by nazi germany on sept .
1 , 1939 , troops under soviet dictator josef stalin were sent into eastern poland .
a year later , a soviet-led massacre in the katyn forest left over 20,000 polish officers and intellectuals dead .
angry reactions from moscow the response from russia warned that the polish resolution , which said the stalin-era crimes amount to genocide , was a set-back to improving ties between russia and poland .
" the resolution adopted by the parliament deals a serious blow to efforts to develop normal neighborly relations between our countries , " the russian foreign ministry said in a statement , adding that the resolution was " tendentious and politicized . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bronislaw komorowski says russia has trouble dealing with its past polish parliamentary speaker bronislaw komorowski said russia 's reaction indicates the country is still coming to grips with its past .
" the fact that russia has reacted so nervously to a resolution that has nothing to do with present-day foreign policy is a sign that it is still unable to come to terms with its own history , " komorowski said .
tense relationship with history while the resolution brought a seventy-year old conflict to the forefront , both countries have previously had difficulty in addressing their shared history .
another contentious issue is the non-aggression pact signed between the soviets and the nazis on the eve of world war ii .
during a visit to poland by russian prime minister vladimir putin a few days before the resolution passed , putin made a surprising departure from russia 's previous attitude towards the pact by calling the document " immoral . "
many had hoped putin 's visit marked an improvement in frosty polish-russian relations of the past few years .
but according to commentators , poland and russia appear to have wasted an opportunity on the 70th anniversary of the outbreak of world war ii to use memories of their joint struggle against the nazis to bring them together – and instead decided to dwell on the past to cultivate their differences .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corruption -pipe- 25.09.2009 watchdog says corruption partly to blame for global financial crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : transparency international is the world 's most important corruption watchdog a new report by corruption watchdog transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- concludes that corrupt business practices cost society billions and preventing sustainable economic growth . in its 2009 global corruption report the berlin-based organization transparency international said corruption undermines fair competition , stifles economic growth and ultimately undercuts a business 's own existence .
" fostering a culture of corporate integrity is essential to protect investment , increase commercial success and ensure the stability sought by poor and rich countries alike , particularly as we climb out of an historical crisis , ” said transparency international chair huguette labelle .
the global corruption report documents that in developing and emerging countries , companies paid $ 40 billion -lrb- 27.2 billion euros -rrb- annually in bribes to polticians and government officials .
ultimately it is consumers around the globe who foot the bill .
project costs increase by at least 10 percent , according to a poll of business executives conducted by transparency international .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bribery and corruption are problems in the eurozone corporate integrity " it is not just a question of tackling corruption in business - it is also important for financial and economic stability and the ongoing reforms of the global financial architecture " , the ti report said .
another concern is the sheer economic power of some companies and business sectors , which translates into disproportionate influence on political decision-making .
the report called on companies to publish regular reports on how they are fighting corruption and to disclose information on financial support for political parties , lobbyists and governments .
transparency international also recommended that governments apply anti-corruption regulations with more vigor .
" it is time that corporations face up to the risk of paying millions in fines and the long-term loss of trust from their customers and shareholders " , said labelle .
report discusses siemens , volkswagen scandals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens has now forbidden corrupt practices one of the biggest corruption scandals in recent years in germany involves the electronics giant , siemens .
the ti report reviews the case and lists the heavy fines imposed .
it notes , " with more prosecutions expected , germany 's largest post-war economic scandal is likely to dominate the news for the next few years . "
however , it criticizes germany for not learning from the scandal , noting that one of the former siemens ceos , who was accused of bribery and corruption , was allowed to continue as head of a major government think tank until the institution was dissolved in 2008 .
the report also discusses the more recent vw corruption scandal in which an entire works council accepted large bribes as well as luxury hotel accommodation and , more embarrassingly , visits to brothels to encourage them to accept employer-friendly practices .
indeed , further examples in the report imply that this is one of the major forms of corruption in german society - big business offering inducements to workers ' representatives to push through management decisions , leading to unfair competitive practices to the detriment of the individual employee .
concern remains over tax havens the section of the report concentrating on germany concludes by turning its attention away from big business to wealthy individuals and the widespread use of tax havens such as liechtenstein .
it cites the case of former deutsche post ceo , klaus zumwinkel , who was arrested on charges of evading one million euros in taxes .
as a result , zumwinkel resigned from his post and was later convicted of tax evasion .
that investigation led to the revelation that german officials had spent over four million euros -lrb- $ 6 million -rrb- to obtain information about large sums deposited by wealthy germans in secret bank accounts in liechtenstein .
it 's been argued that the expense was well worthwhile because it 's expected to lead to the recovery of hundreds of millions of euros in back taxes .
transparency international complains of german inaction germany has been sharply criticized by ti for failing to ratify the un convention against corruption during the last legislative period , failing to introduce a corruption register and for not fulfilling transparency requirements when awarding public sector contracts .
last year germany was listed 14th out of 180 countries in ti 's annual corruption and bribery rankings .

the video was produced by t-online 's wahlzeit.tv website , after steini-girl offered them the song she wrote together with a friend .
" she just thinks he 's a really nice guy , " wahlzeit spokesman bjoern akstinat said .
steini-girl , whose real name is being kept secret , said her main aim " is to get people voting on sunday , and maybe i 'll get a few lucrative jobs out of it too . "
ironic love declaration in the video , steini-girl dances in front of the various seats of federal government in berlin , including the reichstag and the chancellery , wearing not many clothes and kissing pictures of social democrat chancellor candidate frank-walter steinmeier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's chances against chancellor merkel this sunday are thought to be slim the song itself is mainly an ironic love declaration to steinmeier , described in the lyrics as " coiled masculinity " , while his chief opponent in the election chancellor angela merkel is dismissed as " too masculine " .
the song also deems free liberal party leader guido westerwelle " too feminine " and prominent left party politician gregor gysi " too small " .
steini-girl is consciously based on obama girl , a similar viral video song performed by model amber lee ettinger , which was massively successful in the united states during the 2008 presidential election campaign .
obama girl has attracted over 15 million clicks on youtube to date , and made a minor celebrity of ettinger .
" my friend was in the usa last year when obama girl was totally popular , and she thought we should do that , so we just messed around and made a few rhymes , the way you do , " she told bild .
the spd has denied any involvement in making the video , and a spokesman for steinmeier would not reveal whether he had watched it. bk / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corruption -pipe- 25.09.2009 watchdog says corruption partly to blame for global financial crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : transparency international is the world 's most important corruption watchdog a new report by corruption watchdog transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- concludes that corrupt business practices cost society billions and preventing sustainable economic growth . in its 2009 global corruption report the berlin-based organization transparency international said corruption undermines fair competition , stifles economic growth and ultimately undercuts a business 's own existence .
" fostering a culture of corporate integrity is essential to protect investment , increase commercial success and ensure the stability sought by poor and rich countries alike , particularly as we climb out of an historical crisis , ” said transparency international chair huguette labelle .
the global corruption report documents that in developing and emerging countries , companies paid $ 40 billion -lrb- 27.2 billion euros -rrb- annually in bribes to polticians and government officials .
ultimately it is consumers around the globe who foot the bill .
project costs increase by at least 10 percent , according to a poll of business executives conducted by transparency international .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bribery and corruption are problems in the eurozone corporate integrity " it is not just a question of tackling corruption in business - it is also important for financial and economic stability and the ongoing reforms of the global financial architecture " , the ti report said .
another concern is the sheer economic power of some companies and business sectors , which translates into disproportionate influence on political decision-making .
the report called on companies to publish regular reports on how they are fighting corruption and to disclose information on financial support for political parties , lobbyists and governments .
transparency international also recommended that governments apply anti-corruption regulations with more vigor .
" it is time that corporations face up to the risk of paying millions in fines and the long-term loss of trust from their customers and shareholders " , said labelle .
report discusses siemens , volkswagen scandals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens has now forbidden corrupt practices one of the biggest corruption scandals in recent years in germany involves the electronics giant , siemens .
the ti report reviews the case and lists the heavy fines imposed .
it notes , " with more prosecutions expected , germany 's largest post-war economic scandal is likely to dominate the news for the next few years . "
however , it criticizes germany for not learning from the scandal , noting that one of the former siemens ceos , who was accused of bribery and corruption , was allowed to continue as head of a major government think tank until the institution was dissolved in 2008 .
the report also discusses the more recent vw corruption scandal in which an entire works council accepted large bribes as well as luxury hotel accommodation and , more embarrassingly , visits to brothels to encourage them to accept employer-friendly practices .
indeed , further examples in the report imply that this is one of the major forms of corruption in german society - big business offering inducements to workers ' representatives to push through management decisions , leading to unfair competitive practices to the detriment of the individual employee .
concern remains over tax havens the section of the report concentrating on germany concludes by turning its attention away from big business to wealthy individuals and the widespread use of tax havens such as liechtenstein .
it cites the case of former deutsche post ceo , klaus zumwinkel , who was arrested on charges of evading one million euros in taxes .
as a result , zumwinkel resigned from his post and was later convicted of tax evasion .
that investigation led to the revelation that german officials had spent over four million euros -lrb- $ 6 million -rrb- to obtain information about large sums deposited by wealthy germans in secret bank accounts in liechtenstein .
it 's been argued that the expense was well worthwhile because it 's expected to lead to the recovery of hundreds of millions of euros in back taxes .
transparency international complains of german inaction germany has been sharply criticized by ti for failing to ratify the un convention against corruption during the last legislative period , failing to introduce a corruption register and for not fulfilling transparency requirements when awarding public sector contracts .
last year germany was listed 14th out of 180 countries in ti 's annual corruption and bribery rankings .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 25.09.2009 the climate ball is in the rich world 's court großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g20 could be the place to get a deal on funding to protect rainforests .
this week witnessed some important meetings for climate negotiations .
world leaders gathered for two high-level conferences in the us .
a leading us scientific advisor gave dw his thoughts on where climate talks stood . alden meyer is director of strategy and policy for the union of concerned scientists – a us organisation which campaigns for tough international action to tackle global warming .
meyer has 30 years experience advising government on environmental and energy issues , and spoke to deutsche welle from the g20 summit in pittsburgh .
he said world leaders made some progress when they met in new york for a special one-day climate summit .
he added that although the united states remains distracted by a struggle over health care reform , the g20 could prove to unblock efforts to get an ambitious agreement at december 's crucial climate conference in copenhagen .
deutsche welle : what struck you about world leaders ' addresses on climate change on tuesday ?
alden meyer : one of the significant developments at the special summit on climate change on tuesday was the commitment by chinese president hu jintao that china would put forward a carbon intensity target for china between now and 2020 that is to reduce the emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases as a proportion of their economic output .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meyer has testified before congress on global warming and energy issues it is the first time china has made that proposal .
he did not put forward a specific number , and obviously we have to wait to see how aggressive that carbon intensity reduction goal is , but it was a meaningful offer by china.i think that added some momentum coming out of new york , going into pittsburgh and on to copenhagen at the end of the year .
also , japan , the new prime minister there , pledging to increase japan 's greenhouse gas reduction target from the minus eight percent below 1990 levels , pledged by the previous government , to 25 percent below 1990 levels .
of course that 's much more in keeping with the proposal that the european union has put forward and begins to be within the range of what the science says we need to do to get a handle on the problem .
some commentators were quite disappointed with the us position , with obama 's remarks , how did you perceive them ?
i think he said a lot of the right things in terms of the urgency of the problem ; that he gets it on the science ; that the us is committed to do its part on this .
he gave a good overview of all the things he and his administration have done in the eight months since he took office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's un address won a luke warm reception from some observers i think what was disappointing to a lot of observers , and particularly to those from other countries , was that he did n't say very much about the need for the senate in our country to take action on domestic climate legislation in advance of copenhagen .
he did mention that the house has already passed a domestic climate bill and that committees in the senate are starting to consider it , but he did n't lay down the gauntlet and say to the senate ' i really need you to do this by copenhagen so that i can go in there with the credibility of the congressional backing for the position i want to take at that meeting . '
i think people understand the situation he is in .
he is fighting very hard for a domestic health care bill .
they are focused on that like a laser and do n't want to be distracting the senate with talk about other issues , but i think there is more and more impatience on the international scene about the fact that one body of our congress is threatening to hold up the whole process in copenhagen .
two years ago countries agreed to reach a new deal to replace the kyoto protocol by the end of this year , yet negotiations remain about as deadlocked as they have been for the better part of a decade .
how likely is it that we 'll see an agreement at the next big round of negotiations in copenhagen in december – especially given , as you said , that the senate in the us seems to be holding up the process ?
i think there are two big issues here .
one is what the state is of the us domestic debate .
if the president comes to copenhagen with the senate moving forward on climate legislation – with a leadership bill having been introduced and expressions of support – i think he 'll have more credibility .
certainly more than president clinton and vice-president gore did in kyoto when everyone knew that congress was not likely to back what they were putting forward .
the other piece , which is equally daunting frankly , is the issue of climate finance : the roughly 100-150 billion euro-a-year estimates for developing countries for mitigation and adaptation activities on climate change .
and there it 's not just the us , but europe and japan as well which have to do much more to advance that issue before copenhagen .
many of the developing countries have made it clear that if there is not the serious financing and technology package on offer in copenhagen that was promised back in bali two years ago , there 's not going to be a deal from their side .
bildunterschrift : western money to pay for clean development could be a deal-breaker there are still critics who question not only whether an international deal is feasible , but whether it is even desirable .
the controversial danish statistician björn lomborg told deutsche welle this week that cutting emissions was too expensive and ultimately futile .
he said the world would get more bang for its buck by investing in super-projects to pump clouds into the atmosphere to cool the planet .
does lomborg have a point ?
we certainly disagree with his premise that cutting carbon emissions is expensive .
as a matter of fact , my organization just completed an analysis of the us potential for emission reductions showing that we could go far beyond the reductions that the president and the congress are talking about , and that -lrb- we could provide -rrb- savings for consumers .
the reality is , particularly energy efficiency investments pay back very quickly , and then you get benefits from that for years to come .
there are also signals that wind energy and other renewable technologies are coming down in price .
wind is taking off in the united states as it is in other parts of the world , so i fundamentally disagree with the premise that cutting emissions has to be expensive .
yes there is some cost , but it is much less than the cost of damages from climate change that we will see if we do n't take action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish statistician bjorn lomborg says money would be better spent elsewhere when it comes to the issue of geo-engineering , this is obviously something the science community is starting to talk about .
it is very controversial , because obviously these are unproven technologies , and more importantly there could be side-effects from these large-scale geo-engineering schemes that we do n't fully understand .
we 're obviously not doing a very good of regulating the planet with our activities now , and to think that we can have some kind of technical fix that works without some kind of unforeseen side-effect is a little bit of hubris on our part .
so i think there is some interest in exploring some of these options , but i think to hang your whole strategy on that would be a grave mistake .
so what are some of the biggest challenges going to be in securing a good deal at copenhagen at the end of the year ?
indeed , what would amount to a good deal ?
i think what you need for a good deal is something that 's ambitious , that 's in line with what the science says we have to do to bend the emissions curve .
this means we need deeper reductions than what most of the industrialized countries are to date putting on the table .
we also need action by the major developing countries to see a deviation from their business-as-usual growth-path in emissions over the next decade or so , with a view towards eventually having an absolute cap and eventual reduction in their emission later this century .
and we need a substantial financing and technology package to help make those countries make the transition – to basically leap-frog across the way the industrialized countries did their development over the last century , and go right to cleaner technologies .
i think that 's going to be a real challenge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : per capita , indians produce a tenth of the co2 that americans do there also has to be a fair agreement .
it has to recognize the different stages of development that different countries are at ; that acknowledges the fact that a country like india , for example , emits two tones of carbon per person or less , whereas my country , the united states , emits 20 tones per person – ten times as much .
so it 's not fair to ask india to do the same as the united states in terms of taking leadership .
it is fair to ask india to do something , and to do more than they have been , and i think they 're showing signals that they 're willing to step up to the plate on that , as is china and other countries , but equity is a key part of this .
the third element is that it has to be binding .
it has to be something that is not just a voluntary commitment , but where countries look each other in the eye and say ' we are going to do this , we are going to have a system of verification , a system of compliance , that assures us that each of is doing our part in what we agreed to in copenhagen .
those are the three basic elements – it has to be fair , it has to be ambitious and it has to be binding .
climate change is also on the agenda when the leaders of the group of 20 major economies meet on thursday and friday .
some say the g20 could prove to be an even more important venue to overcome deadlocks between rich nations like the us and developing countries like china … the two issues that are on the agenda here in pittsburgh this week are climate finance .
how do you generate and govern the flows of investment that are needed for clean energy technologies ; reducing the rate of deforestation in tropical rainforest countries ; and for helping the poorest countries adapt to the impacts of climate change .
that 's going to be a big discussion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the g20 be the right venue to broker a compromise ?
the other issue , which the us has put on the agenda , is the issue of fossil fuel subsidies .
it turns out that the world is spending somewhere around 200 billion dollars a year or more encouraging production and consumption on the very things we 're trying to reduce to deal with global warming – that 's coal and oil .
so that topic is on the agenda , we 'll see how far we get with that , that 's obviously a very difficult issue - not only for the united states , but other countries .
it 's very political and there are entrenched interests that benefit from those embedded subsidies and will fight very hard against efforts to reduce or eliminate them .
climate is just one of the topics , but it is the first time that it has been on the agenda in a way like at the g20 and i think that does give us some prospect of movement .
certainly if they do some follow up between pittsburgh and copenhagen and the g20 process , they could help deliver that element of the package on climate finance . interview : nathan witkop editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

sixteen days after poland was invaded by nazi germany on sept .
1 , 1939 , troops under soviet dictator josef stalin were sent into eastern poland .
a year later , a soviet-led massacre in the katyn forest left over 20,000 polish officers and intellectuals dead .
angry reactions from moscow the response from russia warned that the polish resolution , which said the stalin-era crimes amount to genocide , was a set-back to improving ties between russia and poland .
" the resolution adopted by the parliament deals a serious blow to efforts to develop normal neighborly relations between our countries , " the russian foreign ministry said in a statement , adding that the resolution was " tendentious and politicized . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bronislaw komorowski says russia has trouble dealing with its past polish parliamentary speaker bronislaw komorowski said russia 's reaction indicates the country is still coming to grips with its past .
" the fact that russia has reacted so nervously to a resolution that has nothing to do with present-day foreign policy is a sign that it is still unable to come to terms with its own history , " komorowski said .
tense relationship with history while the resolution brought a seventy-year old conflict to the forefront , both countries have previously had difficulty in addressing their shared history .
another contentious issue is the non-aggression pact signed between the soviets and the nazis on the eve of world war ii .
during a visit to poland by russian prime minister vladimir putin a few days before the resolution passed , putin made a surprising departure from russia 's previous attitude towards the pact by calling the document " immoral . "
many had hoped putin 's visit marked an improvement in frosty polish-russian relations of the past few years .
but according to commentators , poland and russia appear to have wasted an opportunity on the 70th anniversary of the outbreak of world war ii to use memories of their joint struggle against the nazis to bring them together – and instead decided to dwell on the past to cultivate their differences .

more and more of the criminals are coming from the ranks of management . white-collar crime in germany has exploded in severity , the consulting firm pricewaterhousecoopers -lrb- pwc -rrb- said thursday , with over 60 percent of german companies reporting cases of industrial espionage , corruption and other offenses .
firms expect crime to worsen as a weak economy makes competition tougher and workers unhappier .
the average cost to a firm per incident has risen from 1.47 million euros four years ago to nearly 4.3 million euros today .
" the direct costs of crime are only the tip of the iceberg , " said pwc partner and former prosecutor steffem salvenmoser .
" above all , the reputational damage to a firm in cases of corruption , data theft or price-fixing is often greater than the measurable financial losses . "
the study 's results are based on a survey of 500 large german companies conducted by pwc in spring of 2009 , after the german economy sank into its deepest recession in over 60 years , propelled in part by the worldwide financial crisis .
over 40 percent of the surveyed firms expect competitors to use espionage or anti-competitive practices such as cartels to gain an advantage in a tough economic climate .
over a third of the companies expected workers to steal from their employers as concerns about holding onto jobs mounts .
crime from the corner office bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only 50 percent of managers accused of criminal deeds are prosecuted over 70 percent of the perpetrators were caught thanks to tipsters , the study said , despite increased investment in internal control measures designed to detect theft and fraud .
those results suggest that preventive measures have little effect according to professor kai bussmann from the martin luther university in halle , who worked on the study .
further tainting a company 's reputation is the finding that the perpetrators often come from the ranks of management .
the study said 29 percent were executives from the very top of the company 's leadership and 38 percent were middle managers .
many perpetrators were long time employees , 45 percent with more than ten years of tenure with the company and over 90 percent were men .
strikingly , despite the size and nature of the crimes , firms pressed charges against malfeasant managers just 50 percent of the time , compared to 61 percent in the pwc 's last survey in 2007 .
one fifth of the top managers who took part in crimes against their employers received no punishment whatsoever .
" although the relative leniency against perpetrators from the leadership level can be explained by the particular legal and factual difficulties of individual cases this practice is extremely problematic from vantage point of the credibility and leadership of management , " salvenmoser said. bn / ap / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the video was produced by t-online 's wahlzeit.tv website , after steini-girl offered them the song she wrote together with a friend .
" she just thinks he 's a really nice guy , " wahlzeit spokesman bjoern akstinat said .
steini-girl , whose real name is being kept secret , said her main aim " is to get people voting on sunday , and maybe i 'll get a few lucrative jobs out of it too . "
ironic love declaration in the video , steini-girl dances in front of the various seats of federal government in berlin , including the reichstag and the chancellery , wearing not many clothes and kissing pictures of social democrat chancellor candidate frank-walter steinmeier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's chances against chancellor merkel this sunday are thought to be slim the song itself is mainly an ironic love declaration to steinmeier , described in the lyrics as " coiled masculinity " , while his chief opponent in the election chancellor angela merkel is dismissed as " too masculine " .
the song also deems free liberal party leader guido westerwelle " too feminine " and prominent left party politician gregor gysi " too small " .
steini-girl is consciously based on obama girl , a similar viral video song performed by model amber lee ettinger , which was massively successful in the united states during the 2008 presidential election campaign .
obama girl has attracted over 15 million clicks on youtube to date , and made a minor celebrity of ettinger .
" my friend was in the usa last year when obama girl was totally popular , and she thought we should do that , so we just messed around and made a few rhymes , the way you do , " she told bild .
the spd has denied any involvement in making the video , and a spokesman for steinmeier would not reveal whether he had watched it. bk / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a new resolution from the polish parliament condemns the invasion - and irks russia . a resolution unanimously approved by the polish parliament this week condemns the soviet invasion of eastern poland in 1939 .
the resolution referred to a series of massacres of poles in russia , as well as mass deportations of over one million poles to siberia .
poland also called on russia to condemn the crimes .
sixteen days after poland was invaded by nazi germany on sept .
1 , 1939 , troops under soviet dictator josef stalin were sent into eastern poland .
a year later , a soviet-led massacre in the katyn forest left over 20,000 polish officers and intellectuals dead .
angry reactions from moscow the response from russia warned that the polish resolution , which said the stalin-era crimes amount to genocide , was a set-back to improving ties between russia and poland .
" the resolution adopted by the parliament deals a serious blow to efforts to develop normal neighborly relations between our countries , " the russian foreign ministry said in a statement , adding that the resolution was " tendentious and politicized . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bronislaw komorowski says russia has trouble dealing with its past polish parliamentary speaker bronislaw komorowski said russia 's reaction indicates the country is still coming to grips with its past .
" the fact that russia has reacted so nervously to a resolution that has nothing to do with present-day foreign policy is a sign that it is still unable to come to terms with its own history , " komorowski said .
tense relationship with history while the resolution brought a seventy-year old conflict to the forefront , both countries have previously had difficulty in addressing their shared history .
another contentious issue is the non-aggression pact signed between the soviets and the nazis on the eve of world war ii .
during a visit to poland by russian prime minister vladimir putin a few days before the resolution passed , putin made a surprising departure from russia 's previous attitude towards the pact by calling the document " immoral . "
many had hoped putin 's visit marked an improvement in frosty polish-russian relations of the past few years .
but according to commentators , poland and russia appear to have wasted an opportunity on the 70th anniversary of the outbreak of world war ii to use memories of their joint struggle against the nazis to bring them together – and instead decided to dwell on the past to cultivate their differences .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de entertainment -pipe- 25.09.2009 top german politicians brave youth tv to boost popularity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will germans follow the us strategy for youth votes ?
in germany , politics and pop culture are like chalk and cheese .
but some of the more intrepid candidates in the upcoming parliamentary elections are now going where few have ever dared to tread : late-night tv . german politicians looked on enviously during the last us election campaign as then-presidential-hopeful barack obama managed to mobilize the youth vote .
it was primarily his use of the internet and social networking sites that helped him reach the blasé young people who in this generation have shown little interest in politics .
but media-savvy appearances on tv talk shows also helped propel obama into the forefront of popular culture .
in march , he became the first sitting president to appear on a late-night talk show when he dropped by " the tonight show with jay leno . "
rolling with the punches the strategy has clearly been noticed in germany - where the hope is that young voters will not only help sway the current , close election , but will stay true to their parties for life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tv host stefan raab does not treat his guests with kid gloves so politicians are starting to spread their wings .
appearing on established topical chat shows aired by public broadcasters and hosted by high-minded hosts such as anne will and maybrit illner are obviously nothing new .
but as parliamentary elections loom this weekend , a slew of berlin heavyweights , from the ever-slick economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg to the loquacious left party candidate gregor gysi , have decided to take their cues from obama and appear on prime-time private broadcaster prosieben .
joining them for an election-night panel on a saturday night show will be social democrat chairman franz muentefering , while liberal free democrats and the green party are sending their respective frontrunner candidates guido westerwelle and juergen trittin .
the show ’ s host is none other than stefan raab , enfant terrible of late-night viewing .
as a tv personality , he 's famous for making his interviewees squirm - and a lot more used to grilling guests such as germany 's next top model and kylie minogue than political leaders .
over exposure still , he wo n't be the only one treading new ground . a turn on a show as anchored in youth culture as " tv total bundestagswahl 2009 " certainly marks a departure for senior politicians .
but it is likely to be a canny move .
when an election show hosted by raab aired on the eve of the vote four years ago , it snagged a 29 percent market share of the 14 -29 age group category .
obviously , politicians have decided to do whatever it takes to galvanize young voters out of their living rooms and into the polling stations come sunday , and if that means subjecting themselves to raab 's punishing wit , they 're willing to roll with the punches .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the heavily plugged merkel- steinmeier debate was widely deemed a dud after all , the duller-than-dishwater debate between chancellor angela merkel and her challenger , frank-walter steinmeier , which aired a week ahead of the vote on germany 's first public broadcaster ard , did little to tickle the public 's interest - let alone attract the younger generation .
with the two rivals remaining civil and measured throughout , it could hardly even be termed a debate .
and in terms of ratings , it was a resounding flop : 7 million fewer viewers tuned in than did four years ago , and with 7,86 million watching , it attracted a market share of only 23,4 percent .
but merkel probably feels as though she currently has enough exposure in popular culture , now that a youtube video featuring her getting heckled by a " flash mob " at an election rally in hamburg has been watched by more than a quarter of a million people in the last week .
participants shouted " yeaahh " at every sentence spoken by the conservative leader , and waved placards with the words : " all together : yeaahh . "
" this is our political message and the political meaning of this flash mob - we wo n't swallow election campaign messages anymore and we 'll throw merkel 's rubbish back at her with a ironic ' yeaahh ' , " wrote rene walter on the nerdcore.de blog , according to news agency afp .
serious co-host barring an unexpected appearance , both merkel and steinmeier will be conspicuous in their absence on the raab show , but their colleagues can expect questions on topics chosen to appeal to a younger audience , such as education , youth unemployment and the internet .
co-hosting with raab will be experienced political journalist peter limbourg , who was quoted in the daily tagesspiegel as saying that he " expects some tough talking . "
" the point is to get as many people as possible to vote , " he said .

the video was produced by t-online 's wahlzeit.tv website , after steini-girl offered them the song she wrote together with a friend .
" she just thinks he 's a really nice guy , " wahlzeit spokesman bjoern akstinat said .
steini-girl , whose real name is being kept secret , said her main aim " is to get people voting on sunday , and maybe i 'll get a few lucrative jobs out of it too . "
ironic love declaration in the video , steini-girl dances in front of the various seats of federal government in berlin , including the reichstag and the chancellery , wearing not many clothes and kissing pictures of social democrat chancellor candidate frank-walter steinmeier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's chances against chancellor merkel this sunday are thought to be slim the song itself is mainly an ironic love declaration to steinmeier , described in the lyrics as " coiled masculinity " , while his chief opponent in the election chancellor angela merkel is dismissed as " too masculine " .
the song also deems free liberal party leader guido westerwelle " too feminine " and prominent left party politician gregor gysi " too small " .
steini-girl is consciously based on obama girl , a similar viral video song performed by model amber lee ettinger , which was massively successful in the united states during the 2008 presidential election campaign .
obama girl has attracted over 15 million clicks on youtube to date , and made a minor celebrity of ettinger .
" my friend was in the usa last year when obama girl was totally popular , and she thought we should do that , so we just messed around and made a few rhymes , the way you do , " she told bild .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 25.09.2009 the climate ball is in the rich world 's court großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g20 could be the place to get a deal on funding to protect rainforests .
this week witnessed some important meetings for climate negotiations .
world leaders gathered for two high-level conferences in the us .
a leading us scientific advisor gave dw his thoughts on where climate talks stood . alden meyer is director of strategy and policy for the union of concerned scientists – a us organisation which campaigns for tough international action to tackle global warming .
meyer has 30 years experience advising government on environmental and energy issues , and spoke to deutsche welle from the g20 summit in pittsburgh .
he said world leaders made some progress when they met in new york for a special one-day climate summit .
he added that although the united states remains distracted by a struggle over health care reform , the g20 could prove to unblock efforts to get an ambitious agreement at december 's crucial climate conference in copenhagen .
deutsche welle : what struck you about world leaders ' addresses on climate change on tuesday ?
alden meyer : one of the significant developments at the special summit on climate change on tuesday was the commitment by chinese president hu jintao that china would put forward a carbon intensity target for china between now and 2020 that is to reduce the emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases as a proportion of their economic output .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meyer has testified before congress on global warming and energy issues it is the first time china has made that proposal .
he did not put forward a specific number , and obviously we have to wait to see how aggressive that carbon intensity reduction goal is , but it was a meaningful offer by china.i think that added some momentum coming out of new york , going into pittsburgh and on to copenhagen at the end of the year .
also , japan , the new prime minister there , pledging to increase japan 's greenhouse gas reduction target from the minus eight percent below 1990 levels , pledged by the previous government , to 25 percent below 1990 levels .
of course that 's much more in keeping with the proposal that the european union has put forward and begins to be within the range of what the science says we need to do to get a handle on the problem .
some commentators were quite disappointed with the us position , with obama 's remarks , how did you perceive them ?
i think he said a lot of the right things in terms of the urgency of the problem ; that he gets it on the science ; that the us is committed to do its part on this .
he gave a good overview of all the things he and his administration have done in the eight months since he took office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's un address won a luke warm reception from some observers i think what was disappointing to a lot of observers , and particularly to those from other countries , was that he did n't say very much about the need for the senate in our country to take action on domestic climate legislation in advance of copenhagen .
he did mention that the house has already passed a domestic climate bill and that committees in the senate are starting to consider it , but he did n't lay down the gauntlet and say to the senate ' i really need you to do this by copenhagen so that i can go in there with the credibility of the congressional backing for the position i want to take at that meeting . '
i think people understand the situation he is in .
he is fighting very hard for a domestic health care bill .
they are focused on that like a laser and do n't want to be distracting the senate with talk about other issues , but i think there is more and more impatience on the international scene about the fact that one body of our congress is threatening to hold up the whole process in copenhagen .
two years ago countries agreed to reach a new deal to replace the kyoto protocol by the end of this year , yet negotiations remain about as deadlocked as they have been for the better part of a decade .
how likely is it that we 'll see an agreement at the next big round of negotiations in copenhagen in december – especially given , as you said , that the senate in the us seems to be holding up the process ?
i think there are two big issues here .
one is what the state is of the us domestic debate .
if the president comes to copenhagen with the senate moving forward on climate legislation – with a leadership bill having been introduced and expressions of support – i think he 'll have more credibility .
certainly more than president clinton and vice-president gore did in kyoto when everyone knew that congress was not likely to back what they were putting forward .
the other piece , which is equally daunting frankly , is the issue of climate finance : the roughly 100-150 billion euro-a-year estimates for developing countries for mitigation and adaptation activities on climate change .
and there it 's not just the us , but europe and japan as well which have to do much more to advance that issue before copenhagen .
many of the developing countries have made it clear that if there is not the serious financing and technology package on offer in copenhagen that was promised back in bali two years ago , there 's not going to be a deal from their side .
bildunterschrift : western money to pay for clean development could be a deal-breaker there are still critics who question not only whether an international deal is feasible , but whether it is even desirable .
the controversial danish statistician björn lomborg told deutsche welle this week that cutting emissions was too expensive and ultimately futile .
he said the world would get more bang for its buck by investing in super-projects to pump clouds into the atmosphere to cool the planet .
does lomborg have a point ?
we certainly disagree with his premise that cutting carbon emissions is expensive .
as a matter of fact , my organization just completed an analysis of the us potential for emission reductions showing that we could go far beyond the reductions that the president and the congress are talking about , and that -lrb- we could provide -rrb- savings for consumers .
the reality is , particularly energy efficiency investments pay back very quickly , and then you get benefits from that for years to come .
there are also signals that wind energy and other renewable technologies are coming down in price .
wind is taking off in the united states as it is in other parts of the world , so i fundamentally disagree with the premise that cutting emissions has to be expensive .
yes there is some cost , but it is much less than the cost of damages from climate change that we will see if we do n't take action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish statistician bjorn lomborg says money would be better spent elsewhere when it comes to the issue of geo-engineering , this is obviously something the science community is starting to talk about .
it is very controversial , because obviously these are unproven technologies , and more importantly there could be side-effects from these large-scale geo-engineering schemes that we do n't fully understand .
we 're obviously not doing a very good of regulating the planet with our activities now , and to think that we can have some kind of technical fix that works without some kind of unforeseen side-effect is a little bit of hubris on our part .
so i think there is some interest in exploring some of these options , but i think to hang your whole strategy on that would be a grave mistake .
so what are some of the biggest challenges going to be in securing a good deal at copenhagen at the end of the year ?
indeed , what would amount to a good deal ?
i think what you need for a good deal is something that 's ambitious , that 's in line with what the science says we have to do to bend the emissions curve .
this means we need deeper reductions than what most of the industrialized countries are to date putting on the table .
we also need action by the major developing countries to see a deviation from their business-as-usual growth-path in emissions over the next decade or so , with a view towards eventually having an absolute cap and eventual reduction in their emission later this century .
and we need a substantial financing and technology package to help make those countries make the transition – to basically leap-frog across the way the industrialized countries did their development over the last century , and go right to cleaner technologies .
i think that 's going to be a real challenge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : per capita , indians produce a tenth of the co2 that americans do there also has to be a fair agreement .
it has to recognize the different stages of development that different countries are at ; that acknowledges the fact that a country like india , for example , emits two tones of carbon per person or less , whereas my country , the united states , emits 20 tones per person – ten times as much .
so it 's not fair to ask india to do the same as the united states in terms of taking leadership .
it is fair to ask india to do something , and to do more than they have been , and i think they 're showing signals that they 're willing to step up to the plate on that , as is china and other countries , but equity is a key part of this .
the third element is that it has to be binding .
it has to be something that is not just a voluntary commitment , but where countries look each other in the eye and say ' we are going to do this , we are going to have a system of verification , a system of compliance , that assures us that each of is doing our part in what we agreed to in copenhagen .
those are the three basic elements – it has to be fair , it has to be ambitious and it has to be binding .
climate change is also on the agenda when the leaders of the group of 20 major economies meet on thursday and friday .
some say the g20 could prove to be an even more important venue to overcome deadlocks between rich nations like the us and developing countries like china … the two issues that are on the agenda here in pittsburgh this week are climate finance .
how do you generate and govern the flows of investment that are needed for clean energy technologies ; reducing the rate of deforestation in tropical rainforest countries ; and for helping the poorest countries adapt to the impacts of climate change .
that 's going to be a big discussion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the g20 be the right venue to broker a compromise ?
the other issue , which the us has put on the agenda , is the issue of fossil fuel subsidies .
it turns out that the world is spending somewhere around 200 billion dollars a year or more encouraging production and consumption on the very things we 're trying to reduce to deal with global warming – that 's coal and oil .
so that topic is on the agenda , we 'll see how far we get with that , that 's obviously a very difficult issue - not only for the united states , but other countries .
it 's very political and there are entrenched interests that benefit from those embedded subsidies and will fight very hard against efforts to reduce or eliminate them .
climate is just one of the topics , but it is the first time that it has been on the agenda in a way like at the g20 and i think that does give us some prospect of movement .
certainly if they do some follow up between pittsburgh and copenhagen and the g20 process , they could help deliver that element of the package on climate finance . interview : nathan witkop editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this week witnessed some important meetings for climate negotiations .
world leaders gathered for two high-level conferences in the us .
a leading us scientific advisor gave dw his thoughts on where climate talks stood . alden meyer is director of strategy and policy for the union of concerned scientists – a us organisation which campaigns for tough international action to tackle global warming .
meyer has 30 years experience advising government on environmental and energy issues , and spoke to deutsche welle from the g20 summit in pittsburgh .
he said world leaders made some progress when they met in new york for a special one-day climate summit .
he added that although the united states remains distracted by a struggle over health care reform , the g20 could prove to unblock efforts to get an ambitious agreement at december 's crucial climate conference in copenhagen .
deutsche welle : what struck you about world leaders ' addresses on climate change on tuesday ?
alden meyer : one of the significant developments at the special summit on climate change on tuesday was the commitment by chinese president hu jintao that china would put forward a carbon intensity target for china between now and 2020 that is to reduce the emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases as a proportion of their economic output .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meyer has testified before congress on global warming and energy issues it is the first time china has made that proposal .
he did not put forward a specific number , and obviously we have to wait to see how aggressive that carbon intensity reduction goal is , but it was a meaningful offer by china.i think that added some momentum coming out of new york , going into pittsburgh and on to copenhagen at the end of the year .
also , japan , the new prime minister there , pledging to increase japan 's greenhouse gas reduction target from the minus eight percent below 1990 levels , pledged by the previous government , to 25 percent below 1990 levels .
of course that 's much more in keeping with the proposal that the european union has put forward and begins to be within the range of what the science says we need to do to get a handle on the problem .
some commentators were quite disappointed with the us position , with obama 's remarks , how did you perceive them ?
i think he said a lot of the right things in terms of the urgency of the problem ; that he gets it on the science ; that the us is committed to do its part on this .
he gave a good overview of all the things he and his administration have done in the eight months since he took office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's un address won a luke warm reception from some observers i think what was disappointing to a lot of observers , and particularly to those from other countries , was that he did n't say very much about the need for the senate in our country to take action on domestic climate legislation in advance of copenhagen .
he did mention that the house has already passed a domestic climate bill and that committees in the senate are starting to consider it , but he did n't lay down the gauntlet and say to the senate ' i really need you to do this by copenhagen so that i can go in there with the credibility of the congressional backing for the position i want to take at that meeting . '
i think people understand the situation he is in .
he is fighting very hard for a domestic health care bill .
they are focused on that like a laser and do n't want to be distracting the senate with talk about other issues , but i think there is more and more impatience on the international scene about the fact that one body of our congress is threatening to hold up the whole process in copenhagen .
two years ago countries agreed to reach a new deal to replace the kyoto protocol by the end of this year , yet negotiations remain about as deadlocked as they have been for the better part of a decade .
how likely is it that we 'll see an agreement at the next big round of negotiations in copenhagen in december – especially given , as you said , that the senate in the us seems to be holding up the process ?
i think there are two big issues here .
one is what the state is of the us domestic debate .
if the president comes to copenhagen with the senate moving forward on climate legislation – with a leadership bill having been introduced and expressions of support – i think he 'll have more credibility .
certainly more than president clinton and vice-president gore did in kyoto when everyone knew that congress was not likely to back what they were putting forward .
the other piece , which is equally daunting frankly , is the issue of climate finance : the roughly 100-150 billion euro-a-year estimates for developing countries for mitigation and adaptation activities on climate change .
and there it 's not just the us , but europe and japan as well which have to do much more to advance that issue before copenhagen .
many of the developing countries have made it clear that if there is not the serious financing and technology package on offer in copenhagen that was promised back in bali two years ago , there 's not going to be a deal from their side .
bildunterschrift : western money to pay for clean development could be a deal-breaker there are still critics who question not only whether an international deal is feasible , but whether it is even desirable .
the controversial danish statistician björn lomborg told deutsche welle this week that cutting emissions was too expensive and ultimately futile .
he said the world would get more bang for its buck by investing in super-projects to pump clouds into the atmosphere to cool the planet .
does lomborg have a point ?
we certainly disagree with his premise that cutting carbon emissions is expensive .
as a matter of fact , my organization just completed an analysis of the us potential for emission reductions showing that we could go far beyond the reductions that the president and the congress are talking about , and that -lrb- we could provide -rrb- savings for consumers .
the reality is , particularly energy efficiency investments pay back very quickly , and then you get benefits from that for years to come .
there are also signals that wind energy and other renewable technologies are coming down in price .
wind is taking off in the united states as it is in other parts of the world , so i fundamentally disagree with the premise that cutting emissions has to be expensive .
yes there is some cost , but it is much less than the cost of damages from climate change that we will see if we do n't take action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish statistician bjorn lomborg says money would be better spent elsewhere when it comes to the issue of geo-engineering , this is obviously something the science community is starting to talk about .
it is very controversial , because obviously these are unproven technologies , and more importantly there could be side-effects from these large-scale geo-engineering schemes that we do n't fully understand .
we 're obviously not doing a very good of regulating the planet with our activities now , and to think that we can have some kind of technical fix that works without some kind of unforeseen side-effect is a little bit of hubris on our part .
so i think there is some interest in exploring some of these options , but i think to hang your whole strategy on that would be a grave mistake .
so what are some of the biggest challenges going to be in securing a good deal at copenhagen at the end of the year ?
indeed , what would amount to a good deal ?
i think what you need for a good deal is something that 's ambitious , that 's in line with what the science says we have to do to bend the emissions curve .
this means we need deeper reductions than what most of the industrialized countries are to date putting on the table .
we also need action by the major developing countries to see a deviation from their business-as-usual growth-path in emissions over the next decade or so , with a view towards eventually having an absolute cap and eventual reduction in their emission later this century .
and we need a substantial financing and technology package to help make those countries make the transition – to basically leap-frog across the way the industrialized countries did their development over the last century , and go right to cleaner technologies .
i think that 's going to be a real challenge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : per capita , indians produce a tenth of the co2 that americans do there also has to be a fair agreement .
it has to recognize the different stages of development that different countries are at ; that acknowledges the fact that a country like india , for example , emits two tones of carbon per person or less , whereas my country , the united states , emits 20 tones per person – ten times as much .
so it 's not fair to ask india to do the same as the united states in terms of taking leadership .
it is fair to ask india to do something , and to do more than they have been , and i think they 're showing signals that they 're willing to step up to the plate on that , as is china and other countries , but equity is a key part of this .
the third element is that it has to be binding .
it has to be something that is not just a voluntary commitment , but where countries look each other in the eye and say ' we are going to do this , we are going to have a system of verification , a system of compliance , that assures us that each of is doing our part in what we agreed to in copenhagen .
those are the three basic elements – it has to be fair , it has to be ambitious and it has to be binding .
climate change is also on the agenda when the leaders of the group of 20 major economies meet on thursday and friday .
some say the g20 could prove to be an even more important venue to overcome deadlocks between rich nations like the us and developing countries like china … the two issues that are on the agenda here in pittsburgh this week are climate finance .
how do you generate and govern the flows of investment that are needed for clean energy technologies ; reducing the rate of deforestation in tropical rainforest countries ; and for helping the poorest countries adapt to the impacts of climate change .
that 's going to be a big discussion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the g20 be the right venue to broker a compromise ?
the other issue , which the us has put on the agenda , is the issue of fossil fuel subsidies .
it turns out that the world is spending somewhere around 200 billion dollars a year or more encouraging production and consumption on the very things we 're trying to reduce to deal with global warming – that 's coal and oil .
so that topic is on the agenda , we 'll see how far we get with that , that 's obviously a very difficult issue - not only for the united states , but other countries .
it 's very political and there are entrenched interests that benefit from those embedded subsidies and will fight very hard against efforts to reduce or eliminate them .
climate is just one of the topics , but it is the first time that it has been on the agenda in a way like at the g20 and i think that does give us some prospect of movement .
certainly if they do some follow up between pittsburgh and copenhagen and the g20 process , they could help deliver that element of the package on climate finance . interview : nathan witkop editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in germany , politics and pop culture are like chalk and cheese .
but some of the more intrepid candidates in the upcoming parliamentary elections are now going where few have ever dared to tread : late-night tv . german politicians looked on enviously during the last us election campaign as then-presidential-hopeful barack obama managed to mobilize the youth vote .
it was primarily his use of the internet and social networking sites that helped him reach the blasé young people who in this generation have shown little interest in politics .
but media-savvy appearances on tv talk shows also helped propel obama into the forefront of popular culture .
in march , he became the first sitting president to appear on a late-night talk show when he dropped by " the tonight show with jay leno . "
rolling with the punches the strategy has clearly been noticed in germany - where the hope is that young voters will not only help sway the current , close election , but will stay true to their parties for life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tv host stefan raab does not treat his guests with kid gloves so politicians are starting to spread their wings .
appearing on established topical chat shows aired by public broadcasters and hosted by high-minded hosts such as anne will and maybrit illner are obviously nothing new .
but as parliamentary elections loom this weekend , a slew of berlin heavyweights , from the ever-slick economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg to the loquacious left party candidate gregor gysi , have decided to take their cues from obama and appear on prime-time private broadcaster prosieben .
joining them for an election-night panel on a saturday night show will be social democrat chairman franz muentefering , while liberal free democrats and the green party are sending their respective frontrunner candidates guido westerwelle and juergen trittin .
the show ’ s host is none other than stefan raab , enfant terrible of late-night viewing .
as a tv personality , he 's famous for making his interviewees squirm - and a lot more used to grilling guests such as germany 's next top model and kylie minogue than political leaders .
over exposure still , he wo n't be the only one treading new ground . a turn on a show as anchored in youth culture as " tv total bundestagswahl 2009 " certainly marks a departure for senior politicians .
but it is likely to be a canny move .
when an election show hosted by raab aired on the eve of the vote four years ago , it snagged a 29 percent market share of the 14 -29 age group category .
obviously , politicians have decided to do whatever it takes to galvanize young voters out of their living rooms and into the polling stations come sunday , and if that means subjecting themselves to raab 's punishing wit , they 're willing to roll with the punches .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the heavily plugged merkel- steinmeier debate was widely deemed a dud after all , the duller-than-dishwater debate between chancellor angela merkel and her challenger , frank-walter steinmeier , which aired a week ahead of the vote on germany 's first public broadcaster ard , did little to tickle the public 's interest - let alone attract the younger generation .
with the two rivals remaining civil and measured throughout , it could hardly even be termed a debate .
and in terms of ratings , it was a resounding flop : 7 million fewer viewers tuned in than did four years ago , and with 7,86 million watching , it attracted a market share of only 23,4 percent .
but merkel probably feels as though she currently has enough exposure in popular culture , now that a youtube video featuring her getting heckled by a " flash mob " at an election rally in hamburg has been watched by more than a quarter of a million people in the last week .
participants shouted " yeaahh " at every sentence spoken by the conservative leader , and waved placards with the words : " all together : yeaahh . "
" this is our political message and the political meaning of this flash mob - we wo n't swallow election campaign messages anymore and we 'll throw merkel 's rubbish back at her with a ironic ' yeaahh ' , " wrote rene walter on the nerdcore.de blog , according to news agency afp .
serious co-host barring an unexpected appearance , both merkel and steinmeier will be conspicuous in their absence on the raab show , but their colleagues can expect questions on topics chosen to appeal to a younger audience , such as education , youth unemployment and the internet .
co-hosting with raab will be experienced political journalist peter limbourg , who was quoted in the daily tagesspiegel as saying that he " expects some tough talking . "
" the point is to get as many people as possible to vote , " he said .

this week witnessed some important meetings for climate negotiations .
world leaders gathered for two high-level conferences in the us .
a leading us scientific advisor gave dw his thoughts on where climate talks stood . alden meyer is director of strategy and policy for the union of concerned scientists – a us organisation which campaigns for tough international action to tackle global warming .
meyer has 30 years experience advising government on environmental and energy issues , and spoke to deutsche welle from the g20 summit in pittsburgh .
he said world leaders made some progress when they met in new york for a special one-day climate summit .
he added that although the united states remains distracted by a struggle over health care reform , the g20 could prove to unblock efforts to get an ambitious agreement at december 's crucial climate conference in copenhagen .
deutsche welle : what struck you about world leaders ' addresses on climate change on tuesday ?
alden meyer : one of the significant developments at the special summit on climate change on tuesday was the commitment by chinese president hu jintao that china would put forward a carbon intensity target for china between now and 2020 that is to reduce the emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases as a proportion of their economic output .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meyer has testified before congress on global warming and energy issues it is the first time china has made that proposal .
he did not put forward a specific number , and obviously we have to wait to see how aggressive that carbon intensity reduction goal is , but it was a meaningful offer by china.i think that added some momentum coming out of new york , going into pittsburgh and on to copenhagen at the end of the year .
also , japan , the new prime minister there , pledging to increase japan 's greenhouse gas reduction target from the minus eight percent below 1990 levels , pledged by the previous government , to 25 percent below 1990 levels .
of course that 's much more in keeping with the proposal that the european union has put forward and begins to be within the range of what the science says we need to do to get a handle on the problem .
some commentators were quite disappointed with the us position , with obama 's remarks , how did you perceive them ?
i think he said a lot of the right things in terms of the urgency of the problem ; that he gets it on the science ; that the us is committed to do its part on this .
he gave a good overview of all the things he and his administration have done in the eight months since he took office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's un address won a luke warm reception from some observers i think what was disappointing to a lot of observers , and particularly to those from other countries , was that he did n't say very much about the need for the senate in our country to take action on domestic climate legislation in advance of copenhagen .
he did mention that the house has already passed a domestic climate bill and that committees in the senate are starting to consider it , but he did n't lay down the gauntlet and say to the senate ' i really need you to do this by copenhagen so that i can go in there with the credibility of the congressional backing for the position i want to take at that meeting . '
i think people understand the situation he is in .
he is fighting very hard for a domestic health care bill .
they are focused on that like a laser and do n't want to be distracting the senate with talk about other issues , but i think there is more and more impatience on the international scene about the fact that one body of our congress is threatening to hold up the whole process in copenhagen .
two years ago countries agreed to reach a new deal to replace the kyoto protocol by the end of this year , yet negotiations remain about as deadlocked as they have been for the better part of a decade .
how likely is it that we 'll see an agreement at the next big round of negotiations in copenhagen in december – especially given , as you said , that the senate in the us seems to be holding up the process ?
i think there are two big issues here .
one is what the state is of the us domestic debate .
if the president comes to copenhagen with the senate moving forward on climate legislation – with a leadership bill having been introduced and expressions of support – i think he 'll have more credibility .
certainly more than president clinton and vice-president gore did in kyoto when everyone knew that congress was not likely to back what they were putting forward .
the other piece , which is equally daunting frankly , is the issue of climate finance : the roughly 100-150 billion euro-a-year estimates for developing countries for mitigation and adaptation activities on climate change .
and there it 's not just the us , but europe and japan as well which have to do much more to advance that issue before copenhagen .
many of the developing countries have made it clear that if there is not the serious financing and technology package on offer in copenhagen that was promised back in bali two years ago , there 's not going to be a deal from their side .
bildunterschrift : western money to pay for clean development could be a deal-breaker there are still critics who question not only whether an international deal is feasible , but whether it is even desirable .
the controversial danish statistician björn lomborg told deutsche welle this week that cutting emissions was too expensive and ultimately futile .
he said the world would get more bang for its buck by investing in super-projects to pump clouds into the atmosphere to cool the planet .
does lomborg have a point ?
we certainly disagree with his premise that cutting carbon emissions is expensive .
as a matter of fact , my organization just completed an analysis of the us potential for emission reductions showing that we could go far beyond the reductions that the president and the congress are talking about , and that -lrb- we could provide -rrb- savings for consumers .
the reality is , particularly energy efficiency investments pay back very quickly , and then you get benefits from that for years to come .
there are also signals that wind energy and other renewable technologies are coming down in price .
wind is taking off in the united states as it is in other parts of the world , so i fundamentally disagree with the premise that cutting emissions has to be expensive .
yes there is some cost , but it is much less than the cost of damages from climate change that we will see if we do n't take action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish statistician bjorn lomborg says money would be better spent elsewhere when it comes to the issue of geo-engineering , this is obviously something the science community is starting to talk about .
it is very controversial , because obviously these are unproven technologies , and more importantly there could be side-effects from these large-scale geo-engineering schemes that we do n't fully understand .
we 're obviously not doing a very good of regulating the planet with our activities now , and to think that we can have some kind of technical fix that works without some kind of unforeseen side-effect is a little bit of hubris on our part .
so i think there is some interest in exploring some of these options , but i think to hang your whole strategy on that would be a grave mistake .
so what are some of the biggest challenges going to be in securing a good deal at copenhagen at the end of the year ?
indeed , what would amount to a good deal ?
i think what you need for a good deal is something that 's ambitious , that 's in line with what the science says we have to do to bend the emissions curve .
this means we need deeper reductions than what most of the industrialized countries are to date putting on the table .
we also need action by the major developing countries to see a deviation from their business-as-usual growth-path in emissions over the next decade or so , with a view towards eventually having an absolute cap and eventual reduction in their emission later this century .
and we need a substantial financing and technology package to help make those countries make the transition – to basically leap-frog across the way the industrialized countries did their development over the last century , and go right to cleaner technologies .
i think that 's going to be a real challenge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : per capita , indians produce a tenth of the co2 that americans do there also has to be a fair agreement .
it has to recognize the different stages of development that different countries are at ; that acknowledges the fact that a country like india , for example , emits two tones of carbon per person or less , whereas my country , the united states , emits 20 tones per person – ten times as much .
so it 's not fair to ask india to do the same as the united states in terms of taking leadership .
it is fair to ask india to do something , and to do more than they have been , and i think they 're showing signals that they 're willing to step up to the plate on that , as is china and other countries , but equity is a key part of this .
the third element is that it has to be binding .
it has to be something that is not just a voluntary commitment , but where countries look each other in the eye and say ' we are going to do this , we are going to have a system of verification , a system of compliance , that assures us that each of is doing our part in what we agreed to in copenhagen .
those are the three basic elements – it has to be fair , it has to be ambitious and it has to be binding .
climate change is also on the agenda when the leaders of the group of 20 major economies meet on thursday and friday .
some say the g20 could prove to be an even more important venue to overcome deadlocks between rich nations like the us and developing countries like china … the two issues that are on the agenda here in pittsburgh this week are climate finance .
how do you generate and govern the flows of investment that are needed for clean energy technologies ; reducing the rate of deforestation in tropical rainforest countries ; and for helping the poorest countries adapt to the impacts of climate change .
that 's going to be a big discussion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the g20 be the right venue to broker a compromise ?
the other issue , which the us has put on the agenda , is the issue of fossil fuel subsidies .
it turns out that the world is spending somewhere around 200 billion dollars a year or more encouraging production and consumption on the very things we 're trying to reduce to deal with global warming – that 's coal and oil .
so that topic is on the agenda , we 'll see how far we get with that , that 's obviously a very difficult issue - not only for the united states , but other countries .
it 's very political and there are entrenched interests that benefit from those embedded subsidies and will fight very hard against efforts to reduce or eliminate them .
climate is just one of the topics , but it is the first time that it has been on the agenda in a way like at the g20 and i think that does give us some prospect of movement .
certainly if they do some follow up between pittsburgh and copenhagen and the g20 process , they could help deliver that element of the package on climate finance . interview : nathan witkop editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he did mention that the house has already passed a domestic climate bill and that committees in the senate are starting to consider it , but he did n't lay down the gauntlet and say to the senate ' i really need you to do this by copenhagen so that i can go in there with the credibility of the congressional backing for the position i want to take at that meeting . '
i think people understand the situation he is in .
he is fighting very hard for a domestic health care bill .
they are focused on that like a laser and do n't want to be distracting the senate with talk about other issues , but i think there is more and more impatience on the international scene about the fact that one body of our congress is threatening to hold up the whole process in copenhagen .
two years ago countries agreed to reach a new deal to replace the kyoto protocol by the end of this year , yet negotiations remain about as deadlocked as they have been for the better part of a decade .
how likely is it that we 'll see an agreement at the next big round of negotiations in copenhagen in december – especially given , as you said , that the senate in the us seems to be holding up the process ?
i think there are two big issues here .
one is what the state is of the us domestic debate .
if the president comes to copenhagen with the senate moving forward on climate legislation – with a leadership bill having been introduced and expressions of support – i think he 'll have more credibility .
certainly more than president clinton and vice-president gore did in kyoto when everyone knew that congress was not likely to back what they were putting forward .
the other piece , which is equally daunting frankly , is the issue of climate finance : the roughly 100-150 billion euro-a-year estimates for developing countries for mitigation and adaptation activities on climate change .
and there it 's not just the us , but europe and japan as well which have to do much more to advance that issue before copenhagen .
many of the developing countries have made it clear that if there is not the serious financing and technology package on offer in copenhagen that was promised back in bali two years ago , there 's not going to be a deal from their side .
bildunterschrift : western money to pay for clean development could be a deal-breaker there are still critics who question not only whether an international deal is feasible , but whether it is even desirable .
the controversial danish statistician björn lomborg told deutsche welle this week that cutting emissions was too expensive and ultimately futile .
he said the world would get more bang for its buck by investing in super-projects to pump clouds into the atmosphere to cool the planet .
does lomborg have a point ?
we certainly disagree with his premise that cutting carbon emissions is expensive .
as a matter of fact , my organization just completed an analysis of the us potential for emission reductions showing that we could go far beyond the reductions that the president and the congress are talking about , and that -lrb- we could provide -rrb- savings for consumers .
the reality is , particularly energy efficiency investments pay back very quickly , and then you get benefits from that for years to come .
there are also signals that wind energy and other renewable technologies are coming down in price .
wind is taking off in the united states as it is in other parts of the world , so i fundamentally disagree with the premise that cutting emissions has to be expensive .
yes there is some cost , but it is much less than the cost of damages from climate change that we will see if we do n't take action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish statistician bjorn lomborg says money would be better spent elsewhere when it comes to the issue of geo-engineering , this is obviously something the science community is starting to talk about .
it is very controversial , because obviously these are unproven technologies , and more importantly there could be side-effects from these large-scale geo-engineering schemes that we do n't fully understand .
we 're obviously not doing a very good of regulating the planet with our activities now , and to think that we can have some kind of technical fix that works without some kind of unforeseen side-effect is a little bit of hubris on our part .
so i think there is some interest in exploring some of these options , but i think to hang your whole strategy on that would be a grave mistake .
so what are some of the biggest challenges going to be in securing a good deal at copenhagen at the end of the year ?
indeed , what would amount to a good deal ?
i think what you need for a good deal is something that 's ambitious , that 's in line with what the science says we have to do to bend the emissions curve .
this means we need deeper reductions than what most of the industrialized countries are to date putting on the table .
we also need action by the major developing countries to see a deviation from their business-as-usual growth-path in emissions over the next decade or so , with a view towards eventually having an absolute cap and eventual reduction in their emission later this century .
and we need a substantial financing and technology package to help make those countries make the transition – to basically leap-frog across the way the industrialized countries did their development over the last century , and go right to cleaner technologies .
i think that 's going to be a real challenge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : per capita , indians produce a tenth of the co2 that americans do there also has to be a fair agreement .
it has to recognize the different stages of development that different countries are at ; that acknowledges the fact that a country like india , for example , emits two tones of carbon per person or less , whereas my country , the united states , emits 20 tones per person – ten times as much .
so it 's not fair to ask india to do the same as the united states in terms of taking leadership .
it is fair to ask india to do something , and to do more than they have been , and i think they 're showing signals that they 're willing to step up to the plate on that , as is china and other countries , but equity is a key part of this .
the third element is that it has to be binding .
it has to be something that is not just a voluntary commitment , but where countries look each other in the eye and say ' we are going to do this , we are going to have a system of verification , a system of compliance , that assures us that each of is doing our part in what we agreed to in copenhagen .
those are the three basic elements – it has to be fair , it has to be ambitious and it has to be binding .
climate change is also on the agenda when the leaders of the group of 20 major economies meet on thursday and friday .
some say the g20 could prove to be an even more important venue to overcome deadlocks between rich nations like the us and developing countries like china … the two issues that are on the agenda here in pittsburgh this week are climate finance .
how do you generate and govern the flows of investment that are needed for clean energy technologies ; reducing the rate of deforestation in tropical rainforest countries ; and for helping the poorest countries adapt to the impacts of climate change .
that 's going to be a big discussion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the g20 be the right venue to broker a compromise ?
the other issue , which the us has put on the agenda , is the issue of fossil fuel subsidies .
it turns out that the world is spending somewhere around 200 billion dollars a year or more encouraging production and consumption on the very things we 're trying to reduce to deal with global warming – that 's coal and oil .
so that topic is on the agenda , we 'll see how far we get with that , that 's obviously a very difficult issue - not only for the united states , but other countries .
it 's very political and there are entrenched interests that benefit from those embedded subsidies and will fight very hard against efforts to reduce or eliminate them .
climate is just one of the topics , but it is the first time that it has been on the agenda in a way like at the g20 and i think that does give us some prospect of movement .
certainly if they do some follow up between pittsburgh and copenhagen and the g20 process , they could help deliver that element of the package on climate finance . interview : nathan witkop editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this week witnessed some important meetings for climate negotiations .
world leaders gathered for two high-level conferences in the us .
a leading us scientific advisor gave dw his thoughts on where climate talks stood . alden meyer is director of strategy and policy for the union of concerned scientists – a us organisation which campaigns for tough international action to tackle global warming .
meyer has 30 years experience advising government on environmental and energy issues , and spoke to deutsche welle from the g20 summit in pittsburgh .
he said world leaders made some progress when they met in new york for a special one-day climate summit .
he added that although the united states remains distracted by a struggle over health care reform , the g20 could prove to unblock efforts to get an ambitious agreement at december 's crucial climate conference in copenhagen .
deutsche welle : what struck you about world leaders ' addresses on climate change on tuesday ?
alden meyer : one of the significant developments at the special summit on climate change on tuesday was the commitment by chinese president hu jintao that china would put forward a carbon intensity target for china between now and 2020 that is to reduce the emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases as a proportion of their economic output .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meyer has testified before congress on global warming and energy issues it is the first time china has made that proposal .
he did not put forward a specific number , and obviously we have to wait to see how aggressive that carbon intensity reduction goal is , but it was a meaningful offer by china.i think that added some momentum coming out of new york , going into pittsburgh and on to copenhagen at the end of the year .
also , japan , the new prime minister there , pledging to increase japan 's greenhouse gas reduction target from the minus eight percent below 1990 levels , pledged by the previous government , to 25 percent below 1990 levels .
of course that 's much more in keeping with the proposal that the european union has put forward and begins to be within the range of what the science says we need to do to get a handle on the problem .
some commentators were quite disappointed with the us position , with obama 's remarks , how did you perceive them ?
i think he said a lot of the right things in terms of the urgency of the problem ; that he gets it on the science ; that the us is committed to do its part on this .
he gave a good overview of all the things he and his administration have done in the eight months since he took office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's un address won a luke warm reception from some observers i think what was disappointing to a lot of observers , and particularly to those from other countries , was that he did n't say very much about the need for the senate in our country to take action on domestic climate legislation in advance of copenhagen .

the video was produced by t-online 's wahlzeit.tv website , after steini-girl offered them the song she wrote together with a friend .
" she just thinks he 's a really nice guy , " wahlzeit spokesman bjoern akstinat said .
steini-girl , whose real name is being kept secret , said her main aim " is to get people voting on sunday , and maybe i 'll get a few lucrative jobs out of it too . "
ironic love declaration in the video , steini-girl dances in front of the various seats of federal government in berlin , including the reichstag and the chancellery , wearing not many clothes and kissing pictures of social democrat chancellor candidate frank-walter steinmeier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's chances against chancellor merkel this sunday are thought to be slim the song itself is mainly an ironic love declaration to steinmeier , described in the lyrics as " coiled masculinity " , while his chief opponent in the election chancellor angela merkel is dismissed as " too masculine " .
the song also deems free liberal party leader guido westerwelle " too feminine " and prominent left party politician gregor gysi " too small " .
steini-girl is consciously based on obama girl , a similar viral video song performed by model amber lee ettinger , which was massively successful in the united states during the 2008 presidential election campaign .
obama girl has attracted over 15 million clicks on youtube to date , and made a minor celebrity of ettinger .
" my friend was in the usa last year when obama girl was totally popular , and she thought we should do that , so we just messed around and made a few rhymes , the way you do , " she told bild .

in germany , politics and pop culture are like chalk and cheese .
but some of the more intrepid candidates in the upcoming parliamentary elections are now going where few have ever dared to tread : late-night tv . german politicians looked on enviously during the last us election campaign as then-presidential-hopeful barack obama managed to mobilize the youth vote .
it was primarily his use of the internet and social networking sites that helped him reach the blasé young people who in this generation have shown little interest in politics .
but media-savvy appearances on tv talk shows also helped propel obama into the forefront of popular culture .
in march , he became the first sitting president to appear on a late-night talk show when he dropped by " the tonight show with jay leno . "
rolling with the punches the strategy has clearly been noticed in germany - where the hope is that young voters will not only help sway the current , close election , but will stay true to their parties for life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tv host stefan raab does not treat his guests with kid gloves so politicians are starting to spread their wings .
appearing on established topical chat shows aired by public broadcasters and hosted by high-minded hosts such as anne will and maybrit illner are obviously nothing new .
but as parliamentary elections loom this weekend , a slew of berlin heavyweights , from the ever-slick economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg to the loquacious left party candidate gregor gysi , have decided to take their cues from obama and appear on prime-time private broadcaster prosieben .
joining them for an election-night panel on a saturday night show will be social democrat chairman franz muentefering , while liberal free democrats and the green party are sending their respective frontrunner candidates guido westerwelle and juergen trittin .
the show ’ s host is none other than stefan raab , enfant terrible of late-night viewing .
as a tv personality , he 's famous for making his interviewees squirm - and a lot more used to grilling guests such as germany 's next top model and kylie minogue than political leaders .
over exposure still , he wo n't be the only one treading new ground . a turn on a show as anchored in youth culture as " tv total bundestagswahl 2009 " certainly marks a departure for senior politicians .
but it is likely to be a canny move .
when an election show hosted by raab aired on the eve of the vote four years ago , it snagged a 29 percent market share of the 14 -29 age group category .
obviously , politicians have decided to do whatever it takes to galvanize young voters out of their living rooms and into the polling stations come sunday , and if that means subjecting themselves to raab 's punishing wit , they 're willing to roll with the punches .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the heavily plugged merkel- steinmeier debate was widely deemed a dud after all , the duller-than-dishwater debate between chancellor angela merkel and her challenger , frank-walter steinmeier , which aired a week ahead of the vote on germany 's first public broadcaster ard , did little to tickle the public 's interest - let alone attract the younger generation .
with the two rivals remaining civil and measured throughout , it could hardly even be termed a debate .
and in terms of ratings , it was a resounding flop : 7 million fewer viewers tuned in than did four years ago , and with 7,86 million watching , it attracted a market share of only 23,4 percent .
but merkel probably feels as though she currently has enough exposure in popular culture , now that a youtube video featuring her getting heckled by a " flash mob " at an election rally in hamburg has been watched by more than a quarter of a million people in the last week .
participants shouted " yeaahh " at every sentence spoken by the conservative leader , and waved placards with the words : " all together : yeaahh . "
" this is our political message and the political meaning of this flash mob - we wo n't swallow election campaign messages anymore and we 'll throw merkel 's rubbish back at her with a ironic ' yeaahh ' , " wrote rene walter on the nerdcore.de blog , according to news agency afp .
serious co-host barring an unexpected appearance , both merkel and steinmeier will be conspicuous in their absence on the raab show , but their colleagues can expect questions on topics chosen to appeal to a younger audience , such as education , youth unemployment and the internet .
co-hosting with raab will be experienced political journalist peter limbourg , who was quoted in the daily tagesspiegel as saying that he " expects some tough talking . "
" the point is to get as many people as possible to vote , " he said .

a new resolution from the polish parliament condemns the invasion - and irks russia . a resolution unanimously approved by the polish parliament this week condemns the soviet invasion of eastern poland in 1939 .
the resolution referred to a series of massacres of poles in russia , as well as mass deportations of over one million poles to siberia .
poland also called on russia to condemn the crimes .
sixteen days after poland was invaded by nazi germany on sept .
1 , 1939 , troops under soviet dictator josef stalin were sent into eastern poland .
a year later , a soviet-led massacre in the katyn forest left over 20,000 polish officers and intellectuals dead .
angry reactions from moscow the response from russia warned that the polish resolution , which said the stalin-era crimes amount to genocide , was a set-back to improving ties between russia and poland .
" the resolution adopted by the parliament deals a serious blow to efforts to develop normal neighborly relations between our countries , " the russian foreign ministry said in a statement , adding that the resolution was " tendentious and politicized . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bronislaw komorowski says russia has trouble dealing with its past polish parliamentary speaker bronislaw komorowski said russia 's reaction indicates the country is still coming to grips with its past .
" the fact that russia has reacted so nervously to a resolution that has nothing to do with present-day foreign policy is a sign that it is still unable to come to terms with its own history , " komorowski said .
tense relationship with history while the resolution brought a seventy-year old conflict to the forefront , both countries have previously had difficulty in addressing their shared history .
another contentious issue is the non-aggression pact signed between the soviets and the nazis on the eve of world war ii .
during a visit to poland by russian prime minister vladimir putin a few days before the resolution passed , putin made a surprising departure from russia 's previous attitude towards the pact by calling the document " immoral . "
many had hoped putin 's visit marked an improvement in frosty polish-russian relations of the past few years .
but according to commentators , poland and russia appear to have wasted an opportunity on the 70th anniversary of the outbreak of world war ii to use memories of their joint struggle against the nazis to bring them together – and instead decided to dwell on the past to cultivate their differences .

however , times are changing , and tax evaders from abroad will have to be more careful in future . switzerland has paved the way to be dropped from a so-called grey list of uncooperative tax havens , after signing a necessary 12th new bilateral taxation agreement with qatar .
swiss president hans-rudolf merz signed the treaty with qatar 's prime minister sheikh hamad bin jassim bin jabr al-thani on the sidelines of the un general assembly in new york late on thursday .
the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- demands that countries listed on the grey list sign at least 12 bilateral tax cooperation treaties before they lose that stigma .
switzerland has also signed deals with norway , denmark , finland , the faroe islands , great britain , france , luxembourg , austria , mexico , spain and the united states .
however , oecd head , angel guerria , stressed that switzerland not only had to sign agreements but also work toward " effective implementation . "
the alpine state , which has faced strong international pressure to join the global hunt for tax evaders , caved in earlier this year , saying it would improve cooperation with foreign tax authorities . however , the swiss government emphasized that banking secrecy would be maintained as long as no tax offences were committed .
" banking secrecy offers no protection in the case of tax offences .
as a result of the globalization of financial markets and particularly against the backdrop of the financial crisis , international cooperation in the area of taxes has grown in importance , " the swiss federal department of finance said in a statement upon completion of the 12th deal. nk / dpa / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

more and more of the criminals are coming from the ranks of management . white-collar crime in germany has exploded in severity , the consulting firm pricewaterhousecoopers -lrb- pwc -rrb- said thursday , with over 60 percent of german companies reporting cases of industrial espionage , corruption and other offenses .
firms expect crime to worsen as a weak economy makes competition tougher and workers unhappier .
the average cost to a firm per incident has risen from 1.47 million euros four years ago to nearly 4.3 million euros today .
" the direct costs of crime are only the tip of the iceberg , " said pwc partner and former prosecutor steffem salvenmoser .
" above all , the reputational damage to a firm in cases of corruption , data theft or price-fixing is often greater than the measurable financial losses . "
the study 's results are based on a survey of 500 large german companies conducted by pwc in spring of 2009 , after the german economy sank into its deepest recession in over 60 years , propelled in part by the worldwide financial crisis .
over 40 percent of the surveyed firms expect competitors to use espionage or anti-competitive practices such as cartels to gain an advantage in a tough economic climate .
over a third of the companies expected workers to steal from their employers as concerns about holding onto jobs mounts .
crime from the corner office bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only 50 percent of managers accused of criminal deeds are prosecuted over 70 percent of the perpetrators were caught thanks to tipsters , the study said , despite increased investment in internal control measures designed to detect theft and fraud .
those results suggest that preventive measures have little effect according to professor kai bussmann from the martin luther university in halle , who worked on the study .
further tainting a company 's reputation is the finding that the perpetrators often come from the ranks of management .
the study said 29 percent were executives from the very top of the company 's leadership and 38 percent were middle managers .
many perpetrators were long time employees , 45 percent with more than ten years of tenure with the company and over 90 percent were men .
strikingly , despite the size and nature of the crimes , firms pressed charges against malfeasant managers just 50 percent of the time , compared to 61 percent in the pwc 's last survey in 2007 .
one fifth of the top managers who took part in crimes against their employers received no punishment whatsoever .
" although the relative leniency against perpetrators from the leadership level can be explained by the particular legal and factual difficulties of individual cases this practice is extremely problematic from vantage point of the credibility and leadership of management , " salvenmoser said. bn / ap / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" above all , the reputational damage to a firm in cases of corruption , data theft or price-fixing is often greater than the measurable financial losses . "
the study 's results are based on a survey of 500 large german companies conducted by pwc in spring of 2009 , after the german economy sank into its deepest recession in over 60 years , propelled in part by the worldwide financial crisis .
over 40 percent of the surveyed firms expect competitors to use espionage or anti-competitive practices such as cartels to gain an advantage in a tough economic climate .
over a third of the companies expected workers to steal from their employers as concerns about holding onto jobs mounts .
crime from the corner office bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only 50 percent of managers accused of criminal deeds are prosecuted over 70 percent of the perpetrators were caught thanks to tipsters , the study said , despite increased investment in internal control measures designed to detect theft and fraud .
those results suggest that preventive measures have little effect according to professor kai bussmann from the martin luther university in halle , who worked on the study .
further tainting a company 's reputation is the finding that the perpetrators often come from the ranks of management .
the study said 29 percent were executives from the very top of the company 's leadership and 38 percent were middle managers .
many perpetrators were long time employees , 45 percent with more than ten years of tenure with the company and over 90 percent were men .
strikingly , despite the size and nature of the crimes , firms pressed charges against malfeasant managers just 50 percent of the time , compared to 61 percent in the pwc 's last survey in 2007 .
one fifth of the top managers who took part in crimes against their employers received no punishment whatsoever .
" although the relative leniency against perpetrators from the leadership level can be explained by the particular legal and factual difficulties of individual cases this practice is extremely problematic from vantage point of the credibility and leadership of management , " salvenmoser said. bn / ap / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" said peter namianya , a kenyan graduate from the university of gastronomy in piedmont , who coordinated the trip . " when the terzoi saw the italian goats they exclaimed ' oh , they 're the size of my cows ! ' , and everybody laughed . "

although you can buy imported cheeses at supermarkets in kenya 's big cities , farmers have no cheesemaking traditions of their own . " they do n't have a culture of cheese but they want to try to make it when they go back home , " said peter namianya .
he added that this is a unique way of conserving milk , instead of just making yogurt and drinking fresh milk . this could also become another way of reducing hunger in the community .

however , times are changing , and tax evaders from abroad will have to be more careful in future . switzerland has paved the way to be dropped from a so-called grey list of uncooperative tax havens , after signing a necessary 12th new bilateral taxation agreement with qatar .
swiss president hans-rudolf merz signed the treaty with qatar 's prime minister sheikh hamad bin jassim bin jabr al-thani on the sidelines of the un general assembly in new york late on thursday .
the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- demands that countries listed on the grey list sign at least 12 bilateral tax cooperation treaties before they lose that stigma .
switzerland has also signed deals with norway , denmark , finland , the faroe islands , great britain , france , luxembourg , austria , mexico , spain and the united states .
however , oecd head , angel guerria , stressed that switzerland not only had to sign agreements but also work toward " effective implementation . "
the alpine state , which has faced strong international pressure to join the global hunt for tax evaders , caved in earlier this year , saying it would improve cooperation with foreign tax authorities . however , the swiss government emphasized that banking secrecy would be maintained as long as no tax offences were committed .
" banking secrecy offers no protection in the case of tax offences .
as a result of the globalization of financial markets and particularly against the backdrop of the financial crisis , international cooperation in the area of taxes has grown in importance , " the swiss federal department of finance said in a statement upon completion of the 12th deal. nk / dpa / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" fostering a culture of corporate integrity is essential to protect investment , increase commercial success and ensure the stability sought by poor and rich countries alike , particularly as we climb out of an historical crisis , ” said transparency international chair huguette labelle .
the global corruption report documents that in developing and emerging countries , companies paid $ 40 billion -lrb- 27.2 billion euros -rrb- annually in bribes to polticians and government officials .
ultimately it is consumers around the globe who foot the bill .
project costs increase by at least 10 percent , according to a poll of business executives conducted by transparency international .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bribery and corruption are problems in the eurozone corporate integrity " it is not just a question of tackling corruption in business - it is also important for financial and economic stability and the ongoing reforms of the global financial architecture " , the ti report said .
another concern is the sheer economic power of some companies and business sectors , which translates into disproportionate influence on political decision-making .
the report called on companies to publish regular reports on how they are fighting corruption and to disclose information on financial support for political parties , lobbyists and governments .
transparency international also recommended that governments apply anti-corruption regulations with more vigor .
" it is time that corporations face up to the risk of paying millions in fines and the long-term loss of trust from their customers and shareholders " , said labelle .
report discusses siemens , volkswagen scandals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens has now forbidden corrupt practices one of the biggest corruption scandals in recent years in germany involves the electronics giant , siemens .
the ti report reviews the case and lists the heavy fines imposed .
it notes , " with more prosecutions expected , germany 's largest post-war economic scandal is likely to dominate the news for the next few years . "
however , it criticizes germany for not learning from the scandal , noting that one of the former siemens ceos , who was accused of bribery and corruption , was allowed to continue as head of a major government think tank until the institution was dissolved in 2008 .
the report also discusses the more recent vw corruption scandal in which an entire works council accepted large bribes as well as luxury hotel accommodation and , more embarrassingly , visits to brothels to encourage them to accept employer-friendly practices .
indeed , further examples in the report imply that this is one of the major forms of corruption in german society - big business offering inducements to workers ' representatives to push through management decisions , leading to unfair competitive practices to the detriment of the individual employee .
concern remains over tax havens the section of the report concentrating on germany concludes by turning its attention away from big business to wealthy individuals and the widespread use of tax havens such as liechtenstein .
it cites the case of former deutsche post ceo , klaus zumwinkel , who was arrested on charges of evading one million euros in taxes .
as a result , zumwinkel resigned from his post and was later convicted of tax evasion .
that investigation led to the revelation that german officials had spent over four million euros -lrb- $ 6 million -rrb- to obtain information about large sums deposited by wealthy germans in secret bank accounts in liechtenstein .
it 's been argued that the expense was well worthwhile because it 's expected to lead to the recovery of hundreds of millions of euros in back taxes .
transparency international complains of german inaction germany has been sharply criticized by ti for failing to ratify the un convention against corruption during the last legislative period , failing to introduce a corruption register and for not fulfilling transparency requirements when awarding public sector contracts .
last year germany was listed 14th out of 180 countries in ti 's annual corruption and bribery rankings .

project costs increase by at least 10 percent , according to a poll of business executives conducted by transparency international .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bribery and corruption are problems in the eurozone corporate integrity " it is not just a question of tackling corruption in business - it is also important for financial and economic stability and the ongoing reforms of the global financial architecture " , the ti report said .
another concern is the sheer economic power of some companies and business sectors , which translates into disproportionate influence on political decision-making .
the report called on companies to publish regular reports on how they are fighting corruption and to disclose information on financial support for political parties , lobbyists and governments .
transparency international also recommended that governments apply anti-corruption regulations with more vigor .
" it is time that corporations face up to the risk of paying millions in fines and the long-term loss of trust from their customers and shareholders " , said labelle .
report discusses siemens , volkswagen scandals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens has now forbidden corrupt practices one of the biggest corruption scandals in recent years in germany involves the electronics giant , siemens .
the ti report reviews the case and lists the heavy fines imposed .
it notes , " with more prosecutions expected , germany 's largest post-war economic scandal is likely to dominate the news for the next few years . "
however , it criticizes germany for not learning from the scandal , noting that one of the former siemens ceos , who was accused of bribery and corruption , was allowed to continue as head of a major government think tank until the institution was dissolved in 2008 .
the report also discusses the more recent vw corruption scandal in which an entire works council accepted large bribes as well as luxury hotel accommodation and , more embarrassingly , visits to brothels to encourage them to accept employer-friendly practices .
indeed , further examples in the report imply that this is one of the major forms of corruption in german society - big business offering inducements to workers ' representatives to push through management decisions , leading to unfair competitive practices to the detriment of the individual employee .
concern remains over tax havens the section of the report concentrating on germany concludes by turning its attention away from big business to wealthy individuals and the widespread use of tax havens such as liechtenstein .
it cites the case of former deutsche post ceo , klaus zumwinkel , who was arrested on charges of evading one million euros in taxes .
as a result , zumwinkel resigned from his post and was later convicted of tax evasion .
that investigation led to the revelation that german officials had spent over four million euros -lrb- $ 6 million -rrb- to obtain information about large sums deposited by wealthy germans in secret bank accounts in liechtenstein .
it 's been argued that the expense was well worthwhile because it 's expected to lead to the recovery of hundreds of millions of euros in back taxes .
transparency international complains of german inaction germany has been sharply criticized by ti for failing to ratify the un convention against corruption during the last legislative period , failing to introduce a corruption register and for not fulfilling transparency requirements when awarding public sector contracts .
last year germany was listed 14th out of 180 countries in ti 's annual corruption and bribery rankings .

this week witnessed some important meetings for climate negotiations .
world leaders gathered for two high-level conferences in the us .
a leading us scientific advisor gave dw his thoughts on where climate talks stood . alden meyer is director of strategy and policy for the union of concerned scientists – a us organisation which campaigns for tough international action to tackle global warming .
meyer has 30 years experience advising government on environmental and energy issues , and spoke to deutsche welle from the g20 summit in pittsburgh .
he said world leaders made some progress when they met in new york for a special one-day climate summit .
he added that although the united states remains distracted by a struggle over health care reform , the g20 could prove to unblock efforts to get an ambitious agreement at december 's crucial climate conference in copenhagen .
deutsche welle : what struck you about world leaders ' addresses on climate change on tuesday ?
alden meyer : one of the significant developments at the special summit on climate change on tuesday was the commitment by chinese president hu jintao that china would put forward a carbon intensity target for china between now and 2020 that is to reduce the emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases as a proportion of their economic output .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meyer has testified before congress on global warming and energy issues it is the first time china has made that proposal .
he did not put forward a specific number , and obviously we have to wait to see how aggressive that carbon intensity reduction goal is , but it was a meaningful offer by china.i think that added some momentum coming out of new york , going into pittsburgh and on to copenhagen at the end of the year .
also , japan , the new prime minister there , pledging to increase japan 's greenhouse gas reduction target from the minus eight percent below 1990 levels , pledged by the previous government , to 25 percent below 1990 levels .
of course that 's much more in keeping with the proposal that the european union has put forward and begins to be within the range of what the science says we need to do to get a handle on the problem .
some commentators were quite disappointed with the us position , with obama 's remarks , how did you perceive them ?
i think he said a lot of the right things in terms of the urgency of the problem ; that he gets it on the science ; that the us is committed to do its part on this .
he gave a good overview of all the things he and his administration have done in the eight months since he took office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's un address won a luke warm reception from some observers i think what was disappointing to a lot of observers , and particularly to those from other countries , was that he did n't say very much about the need for the senate in our country to take action on domestic climate legislation in advance of copenhagen .
he did mention that the house has already passed a domestic climate bill and that committees in the senate are starting to consider it , but he did n't lay down the gauntlet and say to the senate ' i really need you to do this by copenhagen so that i can go in there with the credibility of the congressional backing for the position i want to take at that meeting . '
i think people understand the situation he is in .
he is fighting very hard for a domestic health care bill .
they are focused on that like a laser and do n't want to be distracting the senate with talk about other issues , but i think there is more and more impatience on the international scene about the fact that one body of our congress is threatening to hold up the whole process in copenhagen .
two years ago countries agreed to reach a new deal to replace the kyoto protocol by the end of this year , yet negotiations remain about as deadlocked as they have been for the better part of a decade .
how likely is it that we 'll see an agreement at the next big round of negotiations in copenhagen in december – especially given , as you said , that the senate in the us seems to be holding up the process ?
i think there are two big issues here .
one is what the state is of the us domestic debate .
if the president comes to copenhagen with the senate moving forward on climate legislation – with a leadership bill having been introduced and expressions of support – i think he 'll have more credibility .
certainly more than president clinton and vice-president gore did in kyoto when everyone knew that congress was not likely to back what they were putting forward .
the other piece , which is equally daunting frankly , is the issue of climate finance : the roughly 100-150 billion euro-a-year estimates for developing countries for mitigation and adaptation activities on climate change .
and there it 's not just the us , but europe and japan as well which have to do much more to advance that issue before copenhagen .
many of the developing countries have made it clear that if there is not the serious financing and technology package on offer in copenhagen that was promised back in bali two years ago , there 's not going to be a deal from their side .
bildunterschrift : western money to pay for clean development could be a deal-breaker there are still critics who question not only whether an international deal is feasible , but whether it is even desirable .
the controversial danish statistician björn lomborg told deutsche welle this week that cutting emissions was too expensive and ultimately futile .
he said the world would get more bang for its buck by investing in super-projects to pump clouds into the atmosphere to cool the planet .
does lomborg have a point ?
we certainly disagree with his premise that cutting carbon emissions is expensive .
as a matter of fact , my organization just completed an analysis of the us potential for emission reductions showing that we could go far beyond the reductions that the president and the congress are talking about , and that -lrb- we could provide -rrb- savings for consumers .
the reality is , particularly energy efficiency investments pay back very quickly , and then you get benefits from that for years to come .
there are also signals that wind energy and other renewable technologies are coming down in price .
wind is taking off in the united states as it is in other parts of the world , so i fundamentally disagree with the premise that cutting emissions has to be expensive .
yes there is some cost , but it is much less than the cost of damages from climate change that we will see if we do n't take action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish statistician bjorn lomborg says money would be better spent elsewhere when it comes to the issue of geo-engineering , this is obviously something the science community is starting to talk about .
it is very controversial , because obviously these are unproven technologies , and more importantly there could be side-effects from these large-scale geo-engineering schemes that we do n't fully understand .
we 're obviously not doing a very good of regulating the planet with our activities now , and to think that we can have some kind of technical fix that works without some kind of unforeseen side-effect is a little bit of hubris on our part .
so i think there is some interest in exploring some of these options , but i think to hang your whole strategy on that would be a grave mistake .
so what are some of the biggest challenges going to be in securing a good deal at copenhagen at the end of the year ?
indeed , what would amount to a good deal ?
i think what you need for a good deal is something that 's ambitious , that 's in line with what the science says we have to do to bend the emissions curve .
this means we need deeper reductions than what most of the industrialized countries are to date putting on the table .
we also need action by the major developing countries to see a deviation from their business-as-usual growth-path in emissions over the next decade or so , with a view towards eventually having an absolute cap and eventual reduction in their emission later this century .
and we need a substantial financing and technology package to help make those countries make the transition – to basically leap-frog across the way the industrialized countries did their development over the last century , and go right to cleaner technologies .
i think that 's going to be a real challenge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : per capita , indians produce a tenth of the co2 that americans do there also has to be a fair agreement .
it has to recognize the different stages of development that different countries are at ; that acknowledges the fact that a country like india , for example , emits two tones of carbon per person or less , whereas my country , the united states , emits 20 tones per person – ten times as much .
so it 's not fair to ask india to do the same as the united states in terms of taking leadership .
it is fair to ask india to do something , and to do more than they have been , and i think they 're showing signals that they 're willing to step up to the plate on that , as is china and other countries , but equity is a key part of this .
the third element is that it has to be binding .
it has to be something that is not just a voluntary commitment , but where countries look each other in the eye and say ' we are going to do this , we are going to have a system of verification , a system of compliance , that assures us that each of is doing our part in what we agreed to in copenhagen .
those are the three basic elements – it has to be fair , it has to be ambitious and it has to be binding .
climate change is also on the agenda when the leaders of the group of 20 major economies meet on thursday and friday .
some say the g20 could prove to be an even more important venue to overcome deadlocks between rich nations like the us and developing countries like china … the two issues that are on the agenda here in pittsburgh this week are climate finance .
how do you generate and govern the flows of investment that are needed for clean energy technologies ; reducing the rate of deforestation in tropical rainforest countries ; and for helping the poorest countries adapt to the impacts of climate change .
that 's going to be a big discussion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the g20 be the right venue to broker a compromise ?
the other issue , which the us has put on the agenda , is the issue of fossil fuel subsidies .
it turns out that the world is spending somewhere around 200 billion dollars a year or more encouraging production and consumption on the very things we 're trying to reduce to deal with global warming – that 's coal and oil .
so that topic is on the agenda , we 'll see how far we get with that , that 's obviously a very difficult issue - not only for the united states , but other countries .
it 's very political and there are entrenched interests that benefit from those embedded subsidies and will fight very hard against efforts to reduce or eliminate them .
climate is just one of the topics , but it is the first time that it has been on the agenda in a way like at the g20 and i think that does give us some prospect of movement .
certainly if they do some follow up between pittsburgh and copenhagen and the g20 process , they could help deliver that element of the package on climate finance . interview : nathan witkop editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de latin america -pipe- 25.09.2009 brazil shows south american neighbors how to trade with africa großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's president lula da silva has increased trade with africa one goal of the second south america-africa summit this weekend in venezuela is to increase cooperation between the continents .
most countries could learn a lesson or two on how to do that from brazil . a new geography of international trade called " south-south " - that is the ambitious goal of brazilian president luiz inácio “ lula ” da silva .
the former trade union leader wants to better connect his country with other developing and emerging nations , a vision he already announced back in 2004 at a un trade conference in sao paulo .
while he wanted to continue to export to industrial nations , he also emphasized that he was looking for new opportunities .
" we want to foster partnerships , which enable better cooperation between the economies of the south , " lula said .
that strategy seems to work .
today brazil sells more goods to developing and emerging countries than to countries in the northern hemisphere .
china has become brazil 's third largest trade partner , after the us , and close behind neighboring argentina .
aside from china , brazilian companies have increasingly focused on africa , a continent , which in the past was regarded mainly as the home of former slaves .
lula himself already has travelled to africa eleven times and does n't get tired of repeating that brazil is home to the largest population of african descent outside of africa .
the official export agency apex has also intensified its efforts and earlier this month a delegation of brazilian businessmen visited south africa .
maurício manfré , who leads the project within apex , does n't view himself merely as a representative of brazilian companies .
he is also on the look out for products , which he can import .
" we want to expand and intensify this relationship , " he says .
rapid increase in exports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angola is brasil 's number one african trading partner in the past ten years brazilian exports to sub-saharan africa have increased almost eightfold .
last year they reached more than ten billion us dollars , five percent of all brazilian exports .
angola was brazil 's number one export destination with two billion us dollars , followed by south africa with 1.8 billion dollars and nigeria with 1.5 billion dollars respectively .
especially in the midst of the global financial and economic crisis new markets in africa are more than welcome , says jorge duarte de oliveira , the director of exportaminas , the export agency of the south eastern brazilian state of minas gerais : " the emerging countries have suffered considerably less from the international crisis , " he explains .
" they offer very attractive markets to small companies , which produce consumer goods here in brazil for the middle and lower class . "
jorge duarte de oliveira is convinced that those smaller brazilian producers will find the same kind of customers in africa and the middle east .
wide range of brasilian exports to africa while two thirds of chinese imports from brazil are commodities like soy and iron ore and bejing has little interest in industrial products , brazil 's range of exports to africa is more diverse .
only one third are commodities , two thirds consist of assembled products , from textiles and furniture to agricultural machines .
" africa has n't been able yet to develop its own industries .
that 's why the africans buy a large part of brazil 's industrial exports , " says carlos abijaodi , a trade expert with the industrial association of the federal state of minas gerais .
that is the reason why brazil 's range of products is broad , he explains brazil is also closely related to africa , adds abijaodi and says that he noticed that through his international contacts .
" they have similar customs and in the portuguese speaking countries in africa like angola and mozambique we share the same language . "
brazilian multinationals invest billions in africa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mozambique could also see a surge in brazilian investments brazil 's most important trading partner in africa is angola .
the oil-rich country which boasted double-digit growth rates in recent years has attracted investments by many brazilian companies .
petrobrás , the state-run oil concern , is surveying angola 's coast for possible oil fields while construction firm odebrecht maintains roads and brazilian conglomerate camargo corrêa builds a 370 million dollar cement plant in angola .
but in the near future , mozambique , africa 's most populous portuguese speaking country , is likely to also become more attractive for brazil .
vale , the leading brazilian mining company , invests 1.3 billion dollars there to exploit coal near moatize in central mozambique .
moatize is considered to be one of the largest unexploited coal reserves in the world .
it could provide high quality coal for more than a hundred years .

treorchy male choir was formed in the rhondda town in 1883 at the red cow hotel , where a plaque will commemorate its cultural contribution to wales .
the choir has also bought a plaque for its home of almost a century , treorchy primary school .

the choir , which has performed all over the world , has also moved with the times making recordings of football anthems and bob marley classics alongside the more traditional welsh choral music of its origins .
for norman martin , who has been in the choir for 62 years and is its longest-serving member , it is the sheer pleasure of performing that has kept him going .
" it 's been the best thing i 've ever done and it 's given me complete happiness and joy in my social life , " he said .
" although we 're 100 men , we 're like a family .

the choir , which has performed all over the world , has also moved with the times making recordings of football anthems and bob marley classics alongside the more traditional welsh choral music of its origins .
for norman martin , who has been in the choir for 62 years and is its longest-serving member , it is the sheer pleasure of performing that has kept him going .
" it 's been the best thing i 've ever done and it 's given me complete happiness and joy in my social life , " he said .
" although we 're 100 men , we 're like a family .
everybody knows everybody and it 's a lovely atmosphere to be in . "
he said it was important to recognise the achievements of any people or organisations that promoted treorchy to a wider audience .
" the choir has got the complete support of the town - i 'm sure they 're very proud of the choir , " he said .
" we 've been to all parts of the world taking the name of treorchy to all parts of the world . "

" by raising this much capital now , they wo n't have to worry about meeting new global capital regulations , and on top of that they will still be able to expand their business , " said azuma ohno , an analyst at credit suisse in tokyo .
but the announcement of the sale , which could dilute existing shares by up to 30 % , led to a rush of sell orders , which created such an imbalance that it was impossible to trade the shares during the morning session in tokyo .
nomura reported a net profit of 11.4bn yen in the three months from april to june , which was a turnaround from last year 's record losses , caused by the costs of buying the asian and european operations of lehman brothers .

mr zelaya said his meeting with an unnamed official was a positive first step , but little progress was made .
interim deputy foreign minister martha lorena alvarado said the talks were not aimed at restoring mr zelaya to power .
mr zelaya remains holed up at the brazilian embassy , which is surrounded by police and troops .
he has been sheltering there since making a surprise return to honduras on monday , after three months in exile .
a brazilian diplomat told the bbc that those inside the embassy were being forced to survive on a diet of biscuits .
" i 'm not saying that we are going to starve , but the situation is very precarious .
we have no clothes , soap or towels , " he said , adding that embassy staff were finding it very difficult to leave the building .
the united nations security council is due to discuss the situation in honduras on friday , following a request from the brazilian government .
' intimidate us ' mr zelaya told tv channel 36 that the official from the interim government took an " extremely hard " stand during their meeting , the ap reports .

we are looking for a solution as soon as possible . "
interim leader roberto micheletti is reported to have said he is open to talks with mr zelaya .
but the interim deputy foreign minister told the bbc the talks were not aimed at restoring mr zelaya to power .
ms alvarado accused the international community of misunderstanding the fact that the interim authorities acted within the country 's constitution in removing him from power .
" they have not had the time to study the situation before the transition , or the succession if i may say , and to this point we are like a small country in the hands of big donors of the world trying to intimidate us , " she said .
curfew lifted the us , the european union and the organization of american states -lrb- oas -rrb- have all urged dialogue to end the crisis .
brazilian president luiz inacio lula da silva used his address at the un general assembly in new york on wednesday to call for mr zelaya to be reinstated .
manuel zelaya -lrb- left -rrb- remains at the brazilian embassy in tegucigalpa " the international community demands that mr zelaya immediately return to the presidency of his country and must be alert to ensure the inviolability of brazil 's diplomatic mission in the capital of honduras , " he said .
the un has suspended any assistance for elections scheduled for 29 november .
a statement said secretary general ban ki-moon did not not believe conditions were right for " credible elections " .
earlier on thursday , mr micheletti lifted a curfew the government imposed following mr zelaya 's return .
the three-day curfew is estimated to have cost honduras , one of the poorest countries in the region , $ 50m -lrb- £ 30m -rrb- a day in lost trade and business .
many ordinary people are growing tired of the seemingly endless stalemate and want to see some kind of settlement soon , the bbc 's andy gallagher in tegucigalpa says .
the political crisis erupted after mr zelaya tried to hold a non-binding public consultation in july , asking people whether they supported moves to change the constitution .
his opponents said the move was unconstitutional and was aimed at removing the current one-term limit on serving as president , so paving the way for mr zelaya 's possible re-election .

mr zelaya said his meeting with an unnamed official was a positive first step , but little progress was made .
interim deputy foreign minister martha lorena alvarado said the talks were not aimed at restoring mr zelaya to power .
mr zelaya remains holed up at the brazilian embassy , which is surrounded by police and troops .
he has been sheltering there since making a surprise return to honduras on monday , after three months in exile .
a brazilian diplomat told the bbc that those inside the embassy were being forced to survive on a diet of biscuits .
" i 'm not saying that we are going to starve , but the situation is very precarious .
we have no clothes , soap or towels , " he said , adding that embassy staff were finding it very difficult to leave the building .
the united nations security council is due to discuss the situation in honduras on friday , following a request from the brazilian government .
' intimidate us ' mr zelaya told tv channel 36 that the official from the interim government took an " extremely hard " stand during their meeting , the ap reports .

we are looking for a solution as soon as possible . "
interim leader roberto micheletti is reported to have said he is open to talks with mr zelaya .
but the interim deputy foreign minister told the bbc the talks were not aimed at restoring mr zelaya to power .
ms alvarado accused the international community of misunderstanding the fact that the interim authorities acted within the country 's constitution in removing him from power .
" they have not had the time to study the situation before the transition , or the succession if i may say , and to this point we are like a small country in the hands of big donors of the world trying to intimidate us , " she said .
curfew lifted the us , the european union and the organization of american states -lrb- oas -rrb- have all urged dialogue to end the crisis .
brazilian president luiz inacio lula da silva used his address at the un general assembly in new york on wednesday to call for mr zelaya to be reinstated .
manuel zelaya -lrb- left -rrb- remains at the brazilian embassy in tegucigalpa " the international community demands that mr zelaya immediately return to the presidency of his country and must be alert to ensure the inviolability of brazil 's diplomatic mission in the capital of honduras , " he said .
the un has suspended any assistance for elections scheduled for 29 november .
a statement said secretary general ban ki-moon did not not believe conditions were right for " credible elections " .
earlier on thursday , mr micheletti lifted a curfew the government imposed following mr zelaya 's return .
the three-day curfew is estimated to have cost honduras , one of the poorest countries in the region , $ 50m -lrb- £ 30m -rrb- a day in lost trade and business .
many ordinary people are growing tired of the seemingly endless stalemate and want to see some kind of settlement soon , the bbc 's andy gallagher in tegucigalpa says .
the political crisis erupted after mr zelaya tried to hold a non-binding public consultation in july , asking people whether they supported moves to change the constitution .
his opponents said the move was unconstitutional and was aimed at removing the current one-term limit on serving as president , so paving the way for mr zelaya 's possible re-election .
he has denied this .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- q & a : the g20 pittsburgh summit british broadcasting corporation home accessibility links mobile version skip to content skip to local navigation skip to bbc.co.uk navigation skip to bbc.co.uk search help accessibility help bbc news updated every minute of every day one-minute world news news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk business market data economy companies health science & environment technology entertainment also in the news - video and audio - programmes have your say in pictures country profiles special reports related bbc sites sport weather on this day editors ' blog bbc world service page last updated at 07:35 gmt , friday , 25 september 2009 08:35 uk e-mail this to a friend printable version q & a : the g20 pittsburgh summit world leaders will gather in pittsburgh on thursday and friday for the latest g20 summit .
the event costs tens of millions of dollars to stage and attracts the attention of campaigners and the world 's media .
this guide looks at what to expect .
what is the g20 ?
it is costing pittsburgh an estimated $ 20m to stage the event the group of twenty , to give it its full title , was originally set up after the asian financial crisis in 1999 as a forum for finance ministers and central bankers to get their heads together .
the first top-tier g20 summit involving heads of government was held in washington last year to discuss an international response to what was developing into the worst recession in 60 years .
officially , its 20 members are : argentina , australia , brazil , canada , china , france , germany , india , indonesia , italy , japan , mexico , russia , saudi arabia , south africa , south korea , turkey , united kingdom and the united states of america .
but they are also regularly joined by spain and the netherlands as well as representatives from international institutions including the world bank , the international monetary fund and the world trade organisation .
what does it do ?
as financial crises tend not to respect international borders , the meetings are a way for leaders to come together to discuss - and hopefully agree - coordinated responses to financial problems whose effects ripple across the globe .
security will be tight around the summit at the time of the last major g20 leaders ' summit in april , some feared the world was facing a 1930s-style depression , so the focus was on bringing about economic recovery ... and quick .
together , they said they would spend $ 5 trillion on measures to stimulate their economies and came up with funding pledges worth more than $ 1tn to help struggling nations .
but the g20 also turned its attention to what could be done to prevent a similar crisis happening in future .
did they do what they said they would ?
g20 pittsburgh summit leaders of the world 's biggest economies will gather in pittsburgh on thursday and friday for the latest g20 meeting in the wake of the global financial crisis see whether they are fulfilling the pledges made at the last meeting in london this time they will be deciding what limits should be put on bankers ' bonuses and debating who should run the global economy for full coverage of the g20 and the global recession go to our in-depth guide it 's a mixed picture .
by and large the financial pledges seem to be on track .
much of the money pledged to the international monetary fund for them to distribute - which makes up a large chunk of the $ 1tn - has found its way there .
though in one or two cases , accurate figures are hard to come by .
not surprisingly , there is still a lot of work to be done on the thornier and more complex issues of reforming how the global economy is run , and regulating bankers and hedge funds .
bbc news online has put together a pledge tracker so you can assess the g20 's progress against a number of key promises .
so what should we expect from this summit ?
many of the major economies are beginning to climb out of recession or are expected to do so very soon - and that 's due in part to government stimulus packages .
so there is n't the same need for big spending commitments , but they will talk about the need to follow through with the ones already made .
attention will be focused on reform and regulation .
cracking down on bankers ' bonuses has popular appeal , so an agreement should be reached on that .
less catchy is " regulatory harmonisation " - making sure countries sing from the same hymn sheet and do n't try to attract companies with looser rules .
that is on the agenda , too .
discussions will continue over whether china and india should be better represented on the board of the international monetary fund .
and ideas about " rebalancing " the world economy , which have been floated by the us , will be debated .
that 's big stuff , changing the relationship between developed and developing economies that the world economy is built on .
on a much more practical level , the leaders will be mindful of the fact that although recovery may be starting , there are still very large numbers of people unemployed .
expect this to feature prominently .
and so , why pittsburgh ?
first of all convenience .
many of the leaders will have been in new york for the united nations general assembly , so it is is just a short hop to pennsylvania for them .
secondly , pittsburgh ticks a number of presidential boxes .
pittsburgh , the grimy old steel town that was once a powerhouse of american heavy industry has transformed itself - after the industry 's decline - into a clean , green example of regeneration .
it tells a positive story about obama 's america our correspondent kevin connolly says .
just the sort of financial recovery a president would want to show off to visitors .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- q & a : the g20 pittsburgh summit accessibility links low graphics skip to content skip to local navigation skip to bbc.co.uk navigation skip to bbc.co.uk search help accessibility help access keys help bbc news updated every minute of every day one-minute world news news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk business market data economy companies health science & environment technology entertainment also in the news - video and audio - programmes have your say in pictures country profiles special reports related bbc sites sport weather on this day editors ' blog bbc world service page last updated at 07:35 gmt , friday , 25 september 2009 08:35 uk e-mail this to a friend printable version q & a : the g20 pittsburgh summit world leaders will gather in pittsburgh on thursday and friday for the latest g20 summit .
the event costs tens of millions of dollars to stage and attracts the attention of campaigners and the world 's media .
this guide looks at what to expect .
what is the g20 ?
it is costing pittsburgh an estimated $ 20m to stage the event the group of twenty , to give it its full title , was originally set up after the asian financial crisis in 1999 as a forum for finance ministers and central bankers to get their heads together .
the first top-tier g20 summit involving heads of government was held in washington last year to discuss an international response to what was developing into the worst recession in 60 years .
officially , its 20 members are : argentina , australia , brazil , canada , china , france , germany , india , indonesia , italy , japan , mexico , russia , saudi arabia , south africa , south korea , turkey , united kingdom and the united states of america .
but they are also regularly joined by spain and the netherlands as well as representatives from international institutions including the world bank , the international monetary fund and the world trade organisation .
what does it do ?
as financial crises tend not to respect international borders , the meetings are a way for leaders to come together to discuss - and hopefully agree - coordinated responses to financial problems whose effects ripple across the globe .
security will be tight around the summit at the time of the last major g20 leaders ' summit in april , some feared the world was facing a 1930s-style depression , so the focus was on bringing about economic recovery ... and quick .
together , they said they would spend $ 5 trillion on measures to stimulate their economies and came up with funding pledges worth more than $ 1tn to help struggling nations .
but the g20 also turned its attention to what could be done to prevent a similar crisis happening in future .
did they do what they said they would ?
g20 pittsburgh summit leaders of the world 's biggest economies will gather in pittsburgh on thursday and friday for the latest g20 meeting in the wake of the global financial crisis see whether they are fulfilling the pledges made at the last meeting in london this time they will be deciding what limits should be put on bankers ' bonuses and debating who should run the global economy for full coverage of the g20 and the global recession go to our in-depth guide it 's a mixed picture .
by and large the financial pledges seem to be on track .
much of the money pledged to the international monetary fund for them to distribute - which makes up a large chunk of the $ 1tn - has found its way there .
though in one or two cases , accurate figures are hard to come by .
not surprisingly , there is still a lot of work to be done on the thornier and more complex issues of reforming how the global economy is run , and regulating bankers and hedge funds .
bbc news online has put together a pledge tracker so you can assess the g20 's progress against a number of key promises .
so what should we expect from this summit ?
many of the major economies are beginning to climb out of recession or are expected to do so very soon - and that 's due in part to government stimulus packages .
so there is n't the same need for big spending commitments , but they will talk about the need to follow through with the ones already made .
attention will be focused on reform and regulation .
cracking down on bankers ' bonuses has popular appeal , so an agreement should be reached on that .
less catchy is " regulatory harmonisation " - making sure countries sing from the same hymn sheet and do n't try to attract companies with looser rules .
that is on the agenda , too .
discussions will continue over whether china and india should be better represented on the board of the international monetary fund .
and ideas about " rebalancing " the world economy , which have been floated by the us , will be debated .
that 's big stuff , changing the relationship between developed and developing economies that the world economy is built on .
on a much more practical level , the leaders will be mindful of the fact that although recovery may be starting , there are still very large numbers of people unemployed .
expect this to feature prominently .
and so , why pittsburgh ?
first of all convenience .
many of the leaders will have been in new york for the united nations general assembly , so it is is just a short hop to pennsylvania for them .
secondly , pittsburgh ticks a number of presidential boxes .
pittsburgh , the grimy old steel town that was once a powerhouse of american heavy industry has transformed itself - after the industry 's decline - into a clean , green example of regeneration .
it tells a positive story about obama 's america our correspondent kevin connolly says .
just the sort of financial recovery a president would want to show off to visitors .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- q & a : the g20 pittsburgh summit british broadcasting corporation home accessibility links skip to content skip to local navigation skip to bbc.co.uk navigation skip to bbc.co.uk search help accessibility help bbc news updated every minute of every day one-minute world news news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk business market data economy companies health science & environment technology entertainment also in the news - video and audio - programmes have your say in pictures country profiles special reports related bbc sites sport weather on this day editors ' blog bbc world service page last updated at 07:35 gmt , friday , 25 september 2009 08:35 uk e-mail this to a friend printable version q & a : the g20 pittsburgh summit world leaders will gather in pittsburgh on thursday and friday for the latest g20 summit .
the event costs tens of millions of dollars to stage and attracts the attention of campaigners and the world 's media .
this guide looks at what to expect .
what is the g20 ?
it is costing pittsburgh an estimated $ 20m to stage the event the group of twenty , to give it its full title , was originally set up after the asian financial crisis in 1999 as a forum for finance ministers and central bankers to get their heads together .
the first top-tier g20 summit involving heads of government was held in washington last year to discuss an international response to what was developing into the worst recession in 60 years .
officially , its 20 members are : argentina , australia , brazil , canada , china , france , germany , india , indonesia , italy , japan , mexico , russia , saudi arabia , south africa , south korea , turkey , united kingdom and the united states of america .
but they are also regularly joined by spain and the netherlands as well as representatives from international institutions including the world bank , the international monetary fund and the world trade organisation .
what does it do ?
as financial crises tend not to respect international borders , the meetings are a way for leaders to come together to discuss - and hopefully agree - coordinated responses to financial problems whose effects ripple across the globe .
security will be tight around the summit at the time of the last major g20 leaders ' summit in april , some feared the world was facing a 1930s-style depression , so the focus was on bringing about economic recovery ... and quick .
together , they said they would spend $ 5 trillion on measures to stimulate their economies and came up with funding pledges worth more than $ 1tn to help struggling nations .
but the g20 also turned its attention to what could be done to prevent a similar crisis happening in future .
did they do what they said they would ?
g20 pittsburgh summit leaders of the world 's biggest economies will gather in pittsburgh on thursday and friday for the latest g20 meeting in the wake of the global financial crisis see whether they are fulfilling the pledges made at the last meeting in london this time they will be deciding what limits should be put on bankers ' bonuses and debating who should run the global economy for full coverage of the g20 and the global recession go to our in-depth guide it 's a mixed picture .
by and large the financial pledges seem to be on track .
much of the money pledged to the international monetary fund for them to distribute - which makes up a large chunk of the $ 1tn - has found its way there .
though in one or two cases , accurate figures are hard to come by .
not surprisingly , there is still a lot of work to be done on the thornier and more complex issues of reforming how the global economy is run , and regulating bankers and hedge funds .
bbc news online has put together a pledge tracker so you can assess the g20 's progress against a number of key promises .
so what should we expect from this summit ?
many of the major economies are beginning to climb out of recession or are expected to do so very soon - and that 's due in part to government stimulus packages .
so there is n't the same need for big spending commitments , but they will talk about the need to follow through with the ones already made .
attention will be focused on reform and regulation .
cracking down on bankers ' bonuses has popular appeal , so an agreement should be reached on that .
less catchy is " regulatory harmonisation " - making sure countries sing from the same hymn sheet and do n't try to attract companies with looser rules .
that is on the agenda , too .
discussions will continue over whether china and india should be better represented on the board of the international monetary fund .
and ideas about " rebalancing " the world economy , which have been floated by the us , will be debated .
that 's big stuff , changing the relationship between developed and developing economies that the world economy is built on .
on a much more practical level , the leaders will be mindful of the fact that although recovery may be starting , there are still very large numbers of people unemployed .
expect this to feature prominently .
and so , why pittsburgh ?
first of all convenience .
many of the leaders will have been in new york for the united nations general assembly , so it is is just a short hop to pennsylvania for them .
secondly , pittsburgh ticks a number of presidential boxes .
pittsburgh , the grimy old steel town that was once a powerhouse of american heavy industry has transformed itself - after the industry 's decline - into a clean , green example of regeneration .
it tells a positive story about obama 's america our correspondent kevin connolly says .
just the sort of financial recovery a president would want to show off to visitors .

none of the babies are ill , although in some cases it has caused skin spots and , in fewer cases , stickiness in the eyes , the lancashire hospital said .
the bacteria are methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus -lrb- mssa -rrb- and can occur naturally on the skin .

" we have identified the bacteria at an early stage and are dealing with it appropriately , working with colleagues in the health protection agency and following its guidance .
" other babies within the unit are being screened on a regular basis to ensure we keep control of the situation . "
parents whose babies have been on the unit within the past two to three weeks should contact their gp if they notice a rash or spots on their child 's skin or have any other concerns .
colonisation means the organism is present in or on the body but is not causing illness .

none of the babies are ill , although in some cases it has caused skin spots and , in fewer cases , stickiness in the eyes , the lancashire hospital said .
the bacteria are methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus -lrb- mssa -rrb- and can occur naturally on the skin .
new admissions needing high dependency care will be sent to burnley hospital .
unlike the more familiar mrsa -lrb- methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus -rrb- , mssa can be treated with a wide range of antibiotics .

rineke schram , from east lancashire hospitals nhs trust , said : " while we are concerned that these babies are colonised , we are confident that the bacteria can be contained quickly .
" we have identified the bacteria at an early stage and are dealing with it appropriately , working with colleagues in the health protection agency and following its guidance .
" other babies within the unit are being screened on a regular basis to ensure we keep control of the situation . "
parents whose babies have been on the unit within the past two to three weeks should contact their gp if they notice a rash or spots on their child 's skin or have any other concerns .
colonisation means the organism is present in or on the body but is not causing illness .
infection means the organism is present and is causing illness .

rineke schram , from east lancashire hospitals nhs trust , said : " while we are concerned that these babies are colonised , we are confident that the bacteria can be contained quickly .
" we have identified the bacteria at an early stage and are dealing with it appropriately , working with colleagues in the health protection agency and following its guidance .
" other babies within the unit are being screened on a regular basis to ensure we keep control of the situation . "
parents whose babies have been on the unit within the past two to three weeks should contact their gp if they notice a rash or spots on their child 's skin or have any other concerns .
colonisation means the organism is present in or on the body but is not causing illness .
infection means the organism is present and is causing illness .
