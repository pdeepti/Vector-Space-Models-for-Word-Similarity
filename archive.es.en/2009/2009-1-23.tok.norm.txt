dw 's daniel scheschkewitz says the two-pronged approach is the only way to get the country on track . afghanistan is teetering on the edge of collapse .
that 's the opinion of all military leaders , reconstruction workers and informed politicians who have visited the country in recent months .
the taliban has regrouped and has extended its influence from the south of afghanistan to the north and west .
troops of the multinational nato-led isaf -lrb- international security and assistance force -rrb- force , including german soldiers , have increasingly come under attacks by insurgent groups .
aid workers have been leaving the region due to the worsening security situation .
at the same time , afghan president hamid karzai has failed to extend his centralized rule to the whole country .
the drug trade continues to flourish , providing a source of finance for the taliban and islamist terrorism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel scheschkewitz nato 's top commander , general john craddock , has for months been urging that the afghanistan force needs to be bolstered by a further 20,000 soldiers .
this week nato sources said the german army plans to send an additional 600 soldiers to afghanistan 's north where german troops are already stationed .
raising the number of troops makes sense provided it 's meant to provide military cover for the civilian reconstruction of the country and not the senseless bombing of alleged taliban targets which usually kills innocent civilians .
human rights groups say over 1,000 civilians were killed last year alone as a result of such attacks by international troops .
a similar number of people were killed in suicide bombings carried out by islamist terrorists .
that leads to an escalating spiral of violence in the region which can only be stopped if significant progress is made in rebuilding afghanistan .
any attempt at reconstruction however remains piecemeal if there is no security , law and order .
efforts to create institutions such as a justice system and a functioning afghan police force , which has been ignored for too long , need to be urgently stepped up .
the military , which is responsible for maintaining order , needs to have an afghan face .
the german army is already making a valuable contribution by training the ana or afghan national army .
but the army still rarely patrols remote parts of the country where former warlords and the taliban seal drug deals and the opium harvest continues unchecked .
the planned deployment of nato reconnaissance planes , in which germany will contribute a third of the needed personnel , could help to tackle the problem .
in the past , the us successfully used such planes to fight drug smuggling in colombia .
the problem is that these aircraft can also be used to coordinate combat operations .
it would be good if a german parliamentary mandate , which is needed for such operations , would be limited to using the reconnaissance jets only for patrolling purposes .
it would thus prevent innocent civilians from being killed during the deployment of the spy planes and german soldiers being involved in their deaths .
as opposed to former us president george w. bush , afghanistan is a priority for new us president barack obama .
that can only be welcomed .
at the same time , the situation would improve if in addition to raising the number of troops , the quality of the civilian-military engagement were improved .
more soldiers alone wo n't be able to secure peace .
but a targeted involvement in reconstructing the country just might achieve that .

dw 's daniel scheschkewitz says the two-pronged approach is the only way to get the country on track . afghanistan is teetering on the edge of collapse .
that 's the opinion of all military leaders , reconstruction workers and informed politicians who have visited the country in recent months .
the taliban has regrouped and has extended its influence from the south of afghanistan to the north and west .
troops of the multinational nato-led isaf -lrb- international security and assistance force -rrb- force , including german soldiers , have increasingly come under attacks by insurgent groups .
aid workers have been leaving the region due to the worsening security situation .
at the same time , afghan president hamid karzai has failed to extend his centralized rule to the whole country .
the drug trade continues to flourish , providing a source of finance for the taliban and islamist terrorism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel scheschkewitz nato 's top commander , general john craddock , has for months been urging that the afghanistan force needs to be bolstered by a further 20,000 soldiers .
this week nato sources said the german army plans to send an additional 600 soldiers to afghanistan 's north where german troops are already stationed .
raising the number of troops makes sense provided it 's meant to provide military cover for the civilian reconstruction of the country and not the senseless bombing of alleged taliban targets which usually kills innocent civilians .
human rights groups say over 1,000 civilians were killed last year alone as a result of such attacks by international troops .
a similar number of people were killed in suicide bombings carried out by islamist terrorists .
that leads to an escalating spiral of violence in the region which can only be stopped if significant progress is made in rebuilding afghanistan .
any attempt at reconstruction however remains piecemeal if there is no security , law and order .
efforts to create institutions such as a justice system and a functioning afghan police force , which has been ignored for too long , need to be urgently stepped up .
the military , which is responsible for maintaining order , needs to have an afghan face .
the german army is already making a valuable contribution by training the ana or afghan national army .
but the army still rarely patrols remote parts of the country where former warlords and the taliban seal drug deals and the opium harvest continues unchecked .
the planned deployment of nato reconnaissance planes , in which germany will contribute a third of the needed personnel , could help to tackle the problem .
in the past , the us successfully used such planes to fight drug smuggling in colombia .
the problem is that these aircraft can also be used to coordinate combat operations .
it would be good if a german parliamentary mandate , which is needed for such operations , would be limited to using the reconnaissance jets only for patrolling purposes .
it would thus prevent innocent civilians from being killed during the deployment of the spy planes and german soldiers being involved in their deaths .
as opposed to former us president george w. bush , afghanistan is a priority for new us president barack obama .
that can only be welcomed .
at the same time , the situation would improve if in addition to raising the number of troops , the quality of the civilian-military engagement were improved .
more soldiers alone wo n't be able to secure peace .
but a targeted involvement in reconstructing the country just might achieve that .

the assembly voted 140-48 for the motion to prod the government into trying to negotiate a new lease of life for two of the four decommissioned soviet-era reactors at the kozloduy power plant .
the 2006 closure of two of the 440-megawatt reactors , considered unsafe by the european union , was one of the conditions bulgaria had to meet to join the bloc in 2007 .
the two other soviet-era reactors had already been switched off in 2002 .
kozloduy , bulgaria 's only nuclear plant , continues to operate on two modern , russian-built 1,000-megawatt reactors .
bulgaria has also revived plans to build another nuclear plant at belene , 100 kilometers downstream on the danube .

the project is financed by a compensation fund set up by the german government and major companies in 2001 for survivors of the nazi forced labor program .
" their suffering should not be forgotten , " the head of the " remembrance , responsibility and future " foundation managing the 4.4-billion-euro -lrb- $ 5.7 billion -rrb- fund , guenther saathoff , told reporters in berlin during a press conference on thursday , jan 22 .
keeping alive painful memories some 1.66 million people from nearly 100 countries received compensation ranging from 500 to 7,700 euros from the german fund between 2001 and 2007 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the web site has an international dimension the fund said on the project 's web site , www.zwangsarbeit-archiv.de , that beyond the compensation payouts which ended in 2007 , it remained important to keep alive the memory of forced labor under the nazis for future generations .
" the victims did not want only money that was owed to them - they also wanted to tell about things that no one wanted to hear about for decades , " saathoff said .
the creators of the project say on the web site that most of the interviews were conducted in ukraine , poland and russia .
but the organizers also spoke to survivors in the us , israel and south africa among other countries .
the survivors include prominent personalities such as spanish author jose semprun as well as members of largely forgotten groups of victims such as the roma , according to the portal .
in addition to the testimonies , short biographies of the survivors and in some cases audio interviews , transcripts , photographs and other personal documents are also included .
" victims will get public recognition " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a photo of miroslav d , a former forced laborer under the nazis many of the accounts describe degrading work and living conditions and a life marked by hunger and disease .
felix kolmer , a former slave laborer , said at the news conference on thursday that the online archive would provide increasingly rare personal accounts of the nazi forced labor program to researchers , teachers and students .
" victims will finally get the public recognition and attention for which they have often waited in vain over the last decades , " kolmer , who is also vice president of the international auschwitz committee , a holocaust survivors group , said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 23.01.2009 opinion : afghanistan needs more civilian and military help großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new us president obama is to push international allies to boost their civilian and military engagement in afghanistan .
dw 's daniel scheschkewitz says the two-pronged approach is the only way to get the country on track . afghanistan is teetering on the edge of collapse .
that 's the opinion of all military leaders , reconstruction workers and informed politicians who have visited the country in recent months .
the taliban has regrouped and has extended its influence from the south of afghanistan to the north and west .
troops of the multinational nato-led isaf -lrb- international security and assistance force -rrb- force , including german soldiers , have increasingly come under attacks by insurgent groups .
aid workers have been leaving the region due to the worsening security situation .
at the same time , afghan president hamid karzai has failed to extend his centralized rule to the whole country .
the drug trade continues to flourish , providing a source of finance for the taliban and islamist terrorism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel scheschkewitz nato 's top commander , general john craddock , has for months been urging that the afghanistan force needs to be bolstered by a further 20,000 soldiers .
this week nato sources said the german army plans to send an additional 600 soldiers to afghanistan 's north where german troops are already stationed .
raising the number of troops makes sense provided it 's meant to provide military cover for the civilian reconstruction of the country and not the senseless bombing of alleged taliban targets which usually kills innocent civilians .
human rights groups say over 1,000 civilians were killed last year alone as a result of such attacks by international troops .
a similar number of people were killed in suicide bombings carried out by islamist terrorists .
that leads to an escalating spiral of violence in the region which can only be stopped if significant progress is made in rebuilding afghanistan .
any attempt at reconstruction however remains piecemeal if there is no security , law and order .
efforts to create institutions such as a justice system and a functioning afghan police force , which has been ignored for too long , need to be urgently stepped up .
the military , which is responsible for maintaining order , needs to have an afghan face .
the german army is already making a valuable contribution by training the ana or afghan national army .
but the army still rarely patrols remote parts of the country where former warlords and the taliban seal drug deals and the opium harvest continues unchecked .
the planned deployment of nato reconnaissance planes , in which germany will contribute a third of the needed personnel , could help to tackle the problem .
in the past , the us successfully used such planes to fight drug smuggling in colombia .
the problem is that these aircraft can also be used to coordinate combat operations .
it would be good if a german parliamentary mandate , which is needed for such operations , would be limited to using the reconnaissance jets only for patrolling purposes .
it would thus prevent innocent civilians from being killed during the deployment of the spy planes and german soldiers being involved in their deaths .
as opposed to former us president george w. bush , afghanistan is a priority for new us president barack obama .
that can only be welcomed .
at the same time , the situation would improve if in addition to raising the number of troops , the quality of the civilian-military engagement were improved .
more soldiers alone wo n't be able to secure peace .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european ties -pipe- 23.01.2009 analysis : eu in disarray over guantanamo inmate relocation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are still around 250 inmates at guantanamo bay after us president barack obama has ordered the infamous detention camp for terror suspects shut , europeans are struggling to figure out whether they can offer to assist the americans . the notorious guantanamo bay prison camp in cuba epitomized for many europeans the arrogance with which former us president george w. bush trampled on basic civil rights in the name of his nebulous " war on terrorism . " now that barack obama has announced his intention of shutting the facility down , european union governments are being urged to lend a hand to the new us president by absorbing a portion of guantanamo 's inmates .
as martin schulz , leader of the european parliament 's socialist group , put it thursday : " the obama administration has started on the right foot by announcing the closure within a year of this outrageous detention camp ...
eu governments must now play their part and support president obama 's decision by accepting inmates . "
eu foreign ministers are to talk it over during a meeting monday in brussels .
guantanamo currently holds about 250 detainees , hardly any of which are european .
most of the remaining prisoners come from countries with poor human rights records such as yemen .
if sent home , many would almost certainly face torture and abuse .
us looks to eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama will be hoping europe will lend a hand with guantanamo inmates a senior official in the new obama administration , speaking on condition of anonymity , said that washington is hopeful that other governments will be more " forthcoming " towards helping deal with guantanamo inmates in light of there being a new us president in office .
while europe would in all likelihood be asked to host only a few of those eligible for release , international relations experts say that a positive and unified response from the " old continent " would have significant implications .
in fact , the fate of the men in orange jumpsuits offers european leaders a first opportunity to show that they really do mean it when they profess to seek " a new era in transatlantic relations . "
internal divisions and acrimony , on the other hand , would seriously jeopardize the european honeymoon with obama , even before he starts asking allied governments to contribute more troops to afghanistan .
so far , the omens do n't look good .
portuguese offer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal 's foreign minister luis amado says his country will only take ' harmless ' inmates ahead of monday 's meeting in brussels , eu governments were roughly divided into three camps : those willing to host guantanamo 's lost souls ; those categorically against it ; and those who remain undecided .
the first camp is desolately empty .
in december , portuguese foreign minister luis amado became the first to offer to take some inmates , but only as long as they were deemed harmless and likely to be subject to persecution in their home countries .
since then , france , spain and sweden have said they might be willing to do the same , but only on a " case by case basis . "
the " absolutely not " camp features austria and old bush friends such as poland , which once had a conservative government but is now ruled by the centre-left .
polish , danish reluctance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister donald tusk wants to steer clear of accepting gitmo prisoners in december , current foreign minister radek sikorski said : " guantanamo is n't in poland 's center of attention .
" besides , prisoners from foreign countries who speak exotic languages would be no small challenge for our prison system .
hence i would n't be too eager , " he said .
poland is currently embroiled in a major prison scandal following the suicide of a high-profile convict .
the last thing prime minister donald tusk wants on his mind is more prisoners .
the government in denmark , which like poland 's former administration supported bush 's unpopular war in iraq , is under intense pressure to make amends with obama .
villy sovndal , leader of the opposition socialist people 's party , recently told daily politiken that denmark had a " special responsibility " as a backer of the bush administration 's " war on terror . "
but danish premier anders fogh rasmussen , while claiming he personally tried to convince bush to close guantanamo , says he has no plans to accept any prisoners .
eu powers ambivalent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier is willing to follow the us lead on gitmo detainees perhaps even more worrying is how undecided two of europe 's heavyweights seem to be .
in britain , plans by foreign minister david miliband to take in guantanamo detainees were reportedly vetoed by the home office on grounds of difficulties with the suspects ' immigration status , housing and benefits .
london has previously taken in british subjects who had been held in guantanamo , but having foreign terror suspects with no links to the uk is a different matter .
in germany , where the governing right-left coalition is set for electoral battle later this year , ministers have been contradicting each other .
while foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , a social democrat , is in favor , interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , a conservative , is against .
the czech presidency of the eu , whose government has still not taken a clear position on the matter , will attempt to forge a common position during monday 's talks in brussels .
a group of human-rights organizations has , meanwhile , written a letter urging eu ministers to " send a common message on their willingness to help close guantanamo and - most important - follow it up with concrete action to find homes for detainees who can not be returned to their countries of origin .

" now that barack obama has announced his intention of shutting the facility down , european union governments are being urged to lend a hand to the new us president by absorbing a portion of guantanamo 's inmates .
as martin schulz , leader of the european parliament 's socialist group , put it thursday : " the obama administration has started on the right foot by announcing the closure within a year of this outrageous detention camp ...
eu governments must now play their part and support president obama 's decision by accepting inmates . "
eu foreign ministers are to talk it over during a meeting monday in brussels .
guantanamo currently holds about 250 detainees , hardly any of which are european .
most of the remaining prisoners come from countries with poor human rights records such as yemen .
if sent home , many would almost certainly face torture and abuse .
us looks to eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama will be hoping europe will lend a hand with guantanamo inmates a senior official in the new obama administration , speaking on condition of anonymity , said that washington is hopeful that other governments will be more " forthcoming " towards helping deal with guantanamo inmates in light of there being a new us president in office .
while europe would in all likelihood be asked to host only a few of those eligible for release , international relations experts say that a positive and unified response from the " old continent " would have significant implications .
in fact , the fate of the men in orange jumpsuits offers european leaders a first opportunity to show that they really do mean it when they profess to seek " a new era in transatlantic relations . "
internal divisions and acrimony , on the other hand , would seriously jeopardize the european honeymoon with obama , even before he starts asking allied governments to contribute more troops to afghanistan .
so far , the omens do n't look good .

the first camp is desolately empty .
in december , portuguese foreign minister luis amado became the first to offer to take some inmates , but only as long as they were deemed harmless and likely to be subject to persecution in their home countries .
since then , france , spain and sweden have said they might be willing to do the same , but only on a " case by case basis . "
the " absolutely not " camp features austria and old bush friends such as poland , which once had a conservative government but is now ruled by the centre-left .

" besides , prisoners from foreign countries who speak exotic languages would be no small challenge for our prison system .
hence i would n't be too eager , " he said .
poland is currently embroiled in a major prison scandal following the suicide of a high-profile convict .

the project is financed by a compensation fund set up by the german government and major companies in 2001 for survivors of the nazi forced labor program .
" their suffering should not be forgotten , " the head of the " remembrance , responsibility and future " foundation managing the 4.4-billion-euro -lrb- $ 5.7 billion -rrb- fund , guenther saathoff , told reporters in berlin during a press conference on thursday , jan 22 .
keeping alive painful memories some 1.66 million people from nearly 100 countries received compensation ranging from 500 to 7,700 euros from the german fund between 2001 and 2007 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the web site has an international dimension the fund said on the project 's web site , www.zwangsarbeit-archiv.de , that beyond the compensation payouts which ended in 2007 , it remained important to keep alive the memory of forced labor under the nazis for future generations .
" the victims did not want only money that was owed to them - they also wanted to tell about things that no one wanted to hear about for decades , " saathoff said .
the creators of the project say on the web site that most of the interviews were conducted in ukraine , poland and russia .
but the organizers also spoke to survivors in the us , israel and south africa among other countries .
the survivors include prominent personalities such as spanish author jose semprun as well as members of largely forgotten groups of victims such as the roma , according to the portal .
in addition to the testimonies , short biographies of the survivors and in some cases audio interviews , transcripts , photographs and other personal documents are also included .

the project is financed by a compensation fund set up by the german government and major companies in 2001 for survivors of the nazi forced labor program .
" their suffering should not be forgotten , " the head of the " remembrance , responsibility and future " foundation managing the 4.4-billion-euro -lrb- $ 5.7 billion -rrb- fund , guenther saathoff , told reporters in berlin during a press conference on thursday , jan 22 .
keeping alive painful memories some 1.66 million people from nearly 100 countries received compensation ranging from 500 to 7,700 euros from the german fund between 2001 and 2007 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the web site has an international dimension the fund said on the project 's web site , www.zwangsarbeit-archiv.de , that beyond the compensation payouts which ended in 2007 , it remained important to keep alive the memory of forced labor under the nazis for future generations .
" the victims did not want only money that was owed to them - they also wanted to tell about things that no one wanted to hear about for decades , " saathoff said .
the creators of the project say on the web site that most of the interviews were conducted in ukraine , poland and russia .
but the organizers also spoke to survivors in the us , israel and south africa among other countries .
the survivors include prominent personalities such as spanish author jose semprun as well as members of largely forgotten groups of victims such as the roma , according to the portal .
in addition to the testimonies , short biographies of the survivors and in some cases audio interviews , transcripts , photographs and other personal documents are also included .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european ties -pipe- 23.01.2009 analysis : eu in disarray over guantanamo inmate relocation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are still around 250 inmates at guantanamo bay after us president barack obama has ordered the infamous detention camp for terror suspects shut , europeans are struggling to figure out whether they can offer to assist the americans . the notorious guantanamo bay prison camp in cuba epitomized for many europeans the arrogance with which former us president george w. bush trampled on basic civil rights in the name of his nebulous " war on terrorism . " now that barack obama has announced his intention of shutting the facility down , european union governments are being urged to lend a hand to the new us president by absorbing a portion of guantanamo 's inmates .
as martin schulz , leader of the european parliament 's socialist group , put it thursday : " the obama administration has started on the right foot by announcing the closure within a year of this outrageous detention camp ...
eu governments must now play their part and support president obama 's decision by accepting inmates . "
eu foreign ministers are to talk it over during a meeting monday in brussels .
guantanamo currently holds about 250 detainees , hardly any of which are european .
most of the remaining prisoners come from countries with poor human rights records such as yemen .
if sent home , many would almost certainly face torture and abuse .
us looks to eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama will be hoping europe will lend a hand with guantanamo inmates a senior official in the new obama administration , speaking on condition of anonymity , said that washington is hopeful that other governments will be more " forthcoming " towards helping deal with guantanamo inmates in light of there being a new us president in office .
while europe would in all likelihood be asked to host only a few of those eligible for release , international relations experts say that a positive and unified response from the " old continent " would have significant implications .
in fact , the fate of the men in orange jumpsuits offers european leaders a first opportunity to show that they really do mean it when they profess to seek " a new era in transatlantic relations . "
internal divisions and acrimony , on the other hand , would seriously jeopardize the european honeymoon with obama , even before he starts asking allied governments to contribute more troops to afghanistan .
so far , the omens do n't look good .
portuguese offer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal 's foreign minister luis amado says his country will only take ' harmless ' inmates ahead of monday 's meeting in brussels , eu governments were roughly divided into three camps : those willing to host guantanamo 's lost souls ; those categorically against it ; and those who remain undecided .
the first camp is desolately empty .
in december , portuguese foreign minister luis amado became the first to offer to take some inmates , but only as long as they were deemed harmless and likely to be subject to persecution in their home countries .
since then , france , spain and sweden have said they might be willing to do the same , but only on a " case by case basis . "
the " absolutely not " camp features austria and old bush friends such as poland , which once had a conservative government but is now ruled by the centre-left .
polish , danish reluctance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister donald tusk wants to steer clear of accepting gitmo prisoners in december , current foreign minister radek sikorski said : " guantanamo is n't in poland 's center of attention .
" besides , prisoners from foreign countries who speak exotic languages would be no small challenge for our prison system .
hence i would n't be too eager , " he said .
poland is currently embroiled in a major prison scandal following the suicide of a high-profile convict .
the last thing prime minister donald tusk wants on his mind is more prisoners .
the government in denmark , which like poland 's former administration supported bush 's unpopular war in iraq , is under intense pressure to make amends with obama .
villy sovndal , leader of the opposition socialist people 's party , recently told daily politiken that denmark had a " special responsibility " as a backer of the bush administration 's " war on terror . "
but danish premier anders fogh rasmussen , while claiming he personally tried to convince bush to close guantanamo , says he has no plans to accept any prisoners .
eu powers ambivalent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier is willing to follow the us lead on gitmo detainees perhaps even more worrying is how undecided two of europe 's heavyweights seem to be .
in britain , plans by foreign minister david miliband to take in guantanamo detainees were reportedly vetoed by the home office on grounds of difficulties with the suspects ' immigration status , housing and benefits .
london has previously taken in british subjects who had been held in guantanamo , but having foreign terror suspects with no links to the uk is a different matter .
in germany , where the governing right-left coalition is set for electoral battle later this year , ministers have been contradicting each other .
while foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , a social democrat , is in favor , interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , a conservative , is against .
the czech presidency of the eu , whose government has still not taken a clear position on the matter , will attempt to forge a common position during monday 's talks in brussels .
a group of human-rights organizations has , meanwhile , written a letter urging eu ministers to " send a common message on their willingness to help close guantanamo and - most important - follow it up with concrete action to find homes for detainees who can not be returned to their countries of origin .

they now want an apology and compensation .
but the government is sending mixed signals . they were beaten , humiliated , sexually abused and forced to do compulsory labor - while wards of the state .
over half a million children brought up in church and state institutions between 1945 and 1975 suffered this fate in what one survivor called " child welfare hellholes . " " i was beaten and kicked into a cripple while in a home , " said dietmar krone .
" i still suffer from this today . " for 30 years , krone kept his experiences to himself - as did most victims of such institutional abuse .
but when other former wards of the state began publicly calling attention to their plight , the 55-year-old joined them .
he wrote a book about his experiences in an institution in suechteln , today a part of viersen near the dutch border . decades after the fact , victims ' groups are finally supposed to sit down in the next weeks with government , state and church representatives for a round table discussion of the situation .
in december , the german parliament bundestag unanimously passed a recommendation to the government to set up such a panel . a petitions committee had previously recommended such action to the bundestag after two years of deliberation . material compensation the round table is intended to serve as a platform for all parties to clarify the background and consequences for victims .
this includes rehabilitation possibilities , psychological support and compensation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : play time , if any , was limited " we 'd like some form of material compensation , " said hans-siegfried wiegand , head of the german association of former institutionalized wards of the state verein ehemaliger heimkinder -lrb- veh -rrb- .
he said many children were forced to compulsory labor during their time in these homes . " we are talking about 10 to 12 hours a day of hard labor for which they received no noticeable , if any , pay , " wiegand said .
" the institutions themselves , as well as companies such as braun and miele , profited from this . " since these adolescents were forced to work , they were refused schooling or vocational training . " the director at my institution told me when i arrived : ' there 's no school instruction here , we just need nimble workers ' , " krone said .
" two hours later , i was sitting at one of the workbenches . "
he received monthly wages of 7.20 deutsche marks -lrb- 3.60 euros , $ 4.75 -rrb- . " and if you made an error , there were deductions - and you were beaten or thrown into a dark cell , " krone said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few children in homes were able to take field trips in addition , the work these adolescents did was not officially recognized and therefore not credited in their pensions . " ironically enough , only voluntary work can be considered for pension benefits - and this was n't voluntary , " wiegand said .
he said many former wards of the state , who are today between 50 and 70 years of age , are financially struggling due to their past . " many are ailing or very ill , either physically or mentally , " wiegand said .
" most are poor as a result of their lives , for example by going into early retirement .
they did n't have the strength anymore to continue working . " mental compensation in addition to financial compensation , wiegand said it would mean a lot to these victims to receive an " explicit recognition " of their suffering .
krone said an official apology would make a difference to him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the catholic church has yet to apologize for its past " it would restore my sense of honor and dignity , " said krone .
but the regional authority responsible for his case has yet to do so , he said . " the word apology does n't cross their lips , " krone said .
" they ca n't apologize ; that would be a confession of their conduct . " round table the petitions committee 's recommendation had recognized " injustice and suffering " and " regretted this deeply . "
yet a dispute has arisen on several points after german family minister ursula von der leyen presented a counter draft of necessary action . " she up front decided to rule out certain aspects , " wiegand said .
this included setting up a contact point for victims and eliminating a compensation fund . " the minister did so without consulting us at all and these decisions are actually the task of the round table , " wiegand said .
" we ca n't put up with this . " but the ministry contradicted these statements .
press officer marc kinert said the ministry had not ruled out anything ahead of time , but rather would leave that up to the discussions at the round table . " there will be open-ended negotiations on possible compensation payments at that time , " kinert said . protestant church apologizes the protestant church in germany is the only organization to take responsibility for its past .
hanover 's regional bishop margot kaessmann earlier this month officially apologized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bishop kaessmann has been straightforward in taking responsibility for the church 's past " i can say publicly that i apologize , " kaessmann told german television ndr .
" but i would say even more : i am ashamed that these things occurred in our institutions and that children were truly broken in their wills and their dignity hurt to such an extent . " kaessmann said she welcomed the parliamentary decision to set up a round table .
she said she supported the idea of a compensation fund . " i personally think that we have to talk about compensation for people who were forced to compulsory labor in these institutions without being paid and are in dire situations today , " she said .
she said it was also necessary to discuss therapeutic support to help former state wards process and deal with their pasts . but kaessmann remains alone in her response .
catholic and state organizations , while offering their unconditional help in clarifying the situation , have yet to make formal apologies to the estimated 500,000 to 800,000 adults who spent their childhood and / or adolescence in institutionalized homes between 1945 and 1975 . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they now want an apology and compensation .
but the government is sending mixed signals . they were beaten , humiliated , sexually abused and forced to do compulsory labor - while wards of the state .
over half a million children brought up in church and state institutions between 1945 and 1975 suffered this fate in what one survivor called " child welfare hellholes . " " i was beaten and kicked into a cripple while in a home , " said dietmar krone .
" i still suffer from this today . " for 30 years , krone kept his experiences to himself - as did most victims of such institutional abuse .
but when other former wards of the state began publicly calling attention to their plight , the 55-year-old joined them .
he wrote a book about his experiences in an institution in suechteln , today a part of viersen near the dutch border . decades after the fact , victims ' groups are finally supposed to sit down in the next weeks with government , state and church representatives for a round table discussion of the situation .
in december , the german parliament bundestag unanimously passed a recommendation to the government to set up such a panel . a petitions committee had previously recommended such action to the bundestag after two years of deliberation . material compensation the round table is intended to serve as a platform for all parties to clarify the background and consequences for victims .
this includes rehabilitation possibilities , psychological support and compensation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : play time , if any , was limited " we 'd like some form of material compensation , " said hans-siegfried wiegand , head of the german association of former institutionalized wards of the state verein ehemaliger heimkinder -lrb- veh -rrb- .
he said many children were forced to compulsory labor during their time in these homes . " we are talking about 10 to 12 hours a day of hard labor for which they received no noticeable , if any , pay , " wiegand said .
" the institutions themselves , as well as companies such as braun and miele , profited from this . " since these adolescents were forced to work , they were refused schooling or vocational training . " the director at my institution told me when i arrived : ' there 's no school instruction here , we just need nimble workers ' , " krone said .
" two hours later , i was sitting at one of the workbenches . "
he received monthly wages of 7.20 deutsche marks -lrb- 3.60 euros , $ 4.75 -rrb- . " and if you made an error , there were deductions - and you were beaten or thrown into a dark cell , " krone said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few children in homes were able to take field trips in addition , the work these adolescents did was not officially recognized and therefore not credited in their pensions . " ironically enough , only voluntary work can be considered for pension benefits - and this was n't voluntary , " wiegand said .
he said many former wards of the state , who are today between 50 and 70 years of age , are financially struggling due to their past . " many are ailing or very ill , either physically or mentally , " wiegand said .
" most are poor as a result of their lives , for example by going into early retirement .
they did n't have the strength anymore to continue working . " mental compensation in addition to financial compensation , wiegand said it would mean a lot to these victims to receive an " explicit recognition " of their suffering .
krone said an official apology would make a difference to him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the catholic church has yet to apologize for its past " it would restore my sense of honor and dignity , " said krone .
but the regional authority responsible for his case has yet to do so , he said . " the word apology does n't cross their lips , " krone said .
" they ca n't apologize ; that would be a confession of their conduct . " round table the petitions committee 's recommendation had recognized " injustice and suffering " and " regretted this deeply . "
yet a dispute has arisen on several points after german family minister ursula von der leyen presented a counter draft of necessary action . " she up front decided to rule out certain aspects , " wiegand said .
this included setting up a contact point for victims and eliminating a compensation fund . " the minister did so without consulting us at all and these decisions are actually the task of the round table , " wiegand said .
" we ca n't put up with this . " but the ministry contradicted these statements .
press officer marc kinert said the ministry had not ruled out anything ahead of time , but rather would leave that up to the discussions at the round table . " there will be open-ended negotiations on possible compensation payments at that time , " kinert said . protestant church apologizes the protestant church in germany is the only organization to take responsibility for its past .
hanover 's regional bishop margot kaessmann earlier this month officially apologized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bishop kaessmann has been straightforward in taking responsibility for the church 's past " i can say publicly that i apologize , " kaessmann told german television ndr .
" but i would say even more : i am ashamed that these things occurred in our institutions and that children were truly broken in their wills and their dignity hurt to such an extent . " kaessmann said she welcomed the parliamentary decision to set up a round table .
she said she supported the idea of a compensation fund . " i personally think that we have to talk about compensation for people who were forced to compulsory labor in these institutions without being paid and are in dire situations today , " she said .
she said it was also necessary to discuss therapeutic support to help former state wards process and deal with their pasts . but kaessmann remains alone in her response .
catholic and state organizations , while offering their unconditional help in clarifying the situation , have yet to make formal apologies to the estimated 500,000 to 800,000 adults who spent their childhood and / or adolescence in institutionalized homes between 1945 and 1975 . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they now want an apology and compensation .
but the government is sending mixed signals . they were beaten , humiliated , sexually abused and forced to do compulsory labor - while wards of the state .
over half a million children brought up in church and state institutions between 1945 and 1975 suffered this fate in what one survivor called " child welfare hellholes . " " i was beaten and kicked into a cripple while in a home , " said dietmar krone .
" i still suffer from this today . " for 30 years , krone kept his experiences to himself - as did most victims of such institutional abuse .
but when other former wards of the state began publicly calling attention to their plight , the 55-year-old joined them .
he wrote a book about his experiences in an institution in suechteln , today a part of viersen near the dutch border . decades after the fact , victims ' groups are finally supposed to sit down in the next weeks with government , state and church representatives for a round table discussion of the situation .
in december , the german parliament bundestag unanimously passed a recommendation to the government to set up such a panel . a petitions committee had previously recommended such action to the bundestag after two years of deliberation . material compensation the round table is intended to serve as a platform for all parties to clarify the background and consequences for victims .
this includes rehabilitation possibilities , psychological support and compensation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : play time , if any , was limited " we 'd like some form of material compensation , " said hans-siegfried wiegand , head of the german association of former institutionalized wards of the state verein ehemaliger heimkinder -lrb- veh -rrb- .
he said many children were forced to compulsory labor during their time in these homes . " we are talking about 10 to 12 hours a day of hard labor for which they received no noticeable , if any , pay , " wiegand said .
" the institutions themselves , as well as companies such as braun and miele , profited from this . " since these adolescents were forced to work , they were refused schooling or vocational training . " the director at my institution told me when i arrived : ' there 's no school instruction here , we just need nimble workers ' , " krone said .
" two hours later , i was sitting at one of the workbenches . "
he received monthly wages of 7.20 deutsche marks -lrb- 3.60 euros , $ 4.75 -rrb- . " and if you made an error , there were deductions - and you were beaten or thrown into a dark cell , " krone said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few children in homes were able to take field trips in addition , the work these adolescents did was not officially recognized and therefore not credited in their pensions . " ironically enough , only voluntary work can be considered for pension benefits - and this was n't voluntary , " wiegand said .
he said many former wards of the state , who are today between 50 and 70 years of age , are financially struggling due to their past . " many are ailing or very ill , either physically or mentally , " wiegand said .
" most are poor as a result of their lives , for example by going into early retirement .
they did n't have the strength anymore to continue working . " mental compensation in addition to financial compensation , wiegand said it would mean a lot to these victims to receive an " explicit recognition " of their suffering .
krone said an official apology would make a difference to him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the catholic church has yet to apologize for its past " it would restore my sense of honor and dignity , " said krone .
but the regional authority responsible for his case has yet to do so , he said . " the word apology does n't cross their lips , " krone said .
" they ca n't apologize ; that would be a confession of their conduct . " round table the petitions committee 's recommendation had recognized " injustice and suffering " and " regretted this deeply . "
yet a dispute has arisen on several points after german family minister ursula von der leyen presented a counter draft of necessary action . " she up front decided to rule out certain aspects , " wiegand said .
this included setting up a contact point for victims and eliminating a compensation fund . " the minister did so without consulting us at all and these decisions are actually the task of the round table , " wiegand said .
" we ca n't put up with this . " but the ministry contradicted these statements .
press officer marc kinert said the ministry had not ruled out anything ahead of time , but rather would leave that up to the discussions at the round table . " there will be open-ended negotiations on possible compensation payments at that time , " kinert said . protestant church apologizes the protestant church in germany is the only organization to take responsibility for its past .
hanover 's regional bishop margot kaessmann earlier this month officially apologized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bishop kaessmann has been straightforward in taking responsibility for the church 's past " i can say publicly that i apologize , " kaessmann told german television ndr .
" but i would say even more : i am ashamed that these things occurred in our institutions and that children were truly broken in their wills and their dignity hurt to such an extent . " kaessmann said she welcomed the parliamentary decision to set up a round table .
she said she supported the idea of a compensation fund . " i personally think that we have to talk about compensation for people who were forced to compulsory labor in these institutions without being paid and are in dire situations today , " she said .
she said it was also necessary to discuss therapeutic support to help former state wards process and deal with their pasts . but kaessmann remains alone in her response .
catholic and state organizations , while offering their unconditional help in clarifying the situation , have yet to make formal apologies to the estimated 500,000 to 800,000 adults who spent their childhood and / or adolescence in institutionalized homes between 1945 and 1975 . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

we expect this to occur with the necessary urgency and thoroughness , " foreign ministry spokesman andreas peschke said . peschke however emphasized that now is not the right time for an international , independent probe of the matter .

" germany ’ s call on israel to conduct the probe comes at a time when european influence over israel is proving itself to be minimal if not obsolete . europe 's dilemma the european union has been frustrated in the past by being forced to stand on the sidelines and watch as building projects they funded in palestine were destroyed by israeli bombs .
the european union has been a major aid partner to palestine , but has very little political influence in the middle east , experts say . but with new us president barack obama signaling that his administration will make the middle east a top foreign policy priority , europe hopes for a greater influence on israel .

they now want an apology and compensation .
but the government is sending mixed signals . they were beaten , humiliated , sexually abused and forced to do compulsory labor - while wards of the state .
over half a million children brought up in church and state institutions between 1945 and 1975 suffered this fate in what one survivor called " child welfare hellholes . " " i was beaten and kicked into a cripple while in a home , " said dietmar krone .
" i still suffer from this today . " for 30 years , krone kept his experiences to himself - as did most victims of such institutional abuse .
but when other former wards of the state began publicly calling attention to their plight , the 55-year-old joined them .
he wrote a book about his experiences in an institution in suechteln , today a part of viersen near the dutch border . decades after the fact , victims ' groups are finally supposed to sit down in the next weeks with government , state and church representatives for a round table discussion of the situation .
in december , the german parliament bundestag unanimously passed a recommendation to the government to set up such a panel . a petitions committee had previously recommended such action to the bundestag after two years of deliberation . material compensation the round table is intended to serve as a platform for all parties to clarify the background and consequences for victims .
this includes rehabilitation possibilities , psychological support and compensation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : play time , if any , was limited " we 'd like some form of material compensation , " said hans-siegfried wiegand , head of the german association of former institutionalized wards of the state verein ehemaliger heimkinder -lrb- veh -rrb- .
he said many children were forced to compulsory labor during their time in these homes . " we are talking about 10 to 12 hours a day of hard labor for which they received no noticeable , if any , pay , " wiegand said .
" the institutions themselves , as well as companies such as braun and miele , profited from this . " since these adolescents were forced to work , they were refused schooling or vocational training . " the director at my institution told me when i arrived : ' there 's no school instruction here , we just need nimble workers ' , " krone said .
" two hours later , i was sitting at one of the workbenches . "
he received monthly wages of 7.20 deutsche marks -lrb- 3.60 euros , $ 4.75 -rrb- . " and if you made an error , there were deductions - and you were beaten or thrown into a dark cell , " krone said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few children in homes were able to take field trips in addition , the work these adolescents did was not officially recognized and therefore not credited in their pensions . " ironically enough , only voluntary work can be considered for pension benefits - and this was n't voluntary , " wiegand said .
he said many former wards of the state , who are today between 50 and 70 years of age , are financially struggling due to their past . " many are ailing or very ill , either physically or mentally , " wiegand said .
" most are poor as a result of their lives , for example by going into early retirement .
they did n't have the strength anymore to continue working . " mental compensation in addition to financial compensation , wiegand said it would mean a lot to these victims to receive an " explicit recognition " of their suffering .
krone said an official apology would make a difference to him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the catholic church has yet to apologize for its past " it would restore my sense of honor and dignity , " said krone .
but the regional authority responsible for his case has yet to do so , he said . " the word apology does n't cross their lips , " krone said .
" they ca n't apologize ; that would be a confession of their conduct . " round table the petitions committee 's recommendation had recognized " injustice and suffering " and " regretted this deeply . "
yet a dispute has arisen on several points after german family minister ursula von der leyen presented a counter draft of necessary action . " she up front decided to rule out certain aspects , " wiegand said .
this included setting up a contact point for victims and eliminating a compensation fund . " the minister did so without consulting us at all and these decisions are actually the task of the round table , " wiegand said .
" we ca n't put up with this . " but the ministry contradicted these statements .
press officer marc kinert said the ministry had not ruled out anything ahead of time , but rather would leave that up to the discussions at the round table . " there will be open-ended negotiations on possible compensation payments at that time , " kinert said . protestant church apologizes the protestant church in germany is the only organization to take responsibility for its past .
hanover 's regional bishop margot kaessmann earlier this month officially apologized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bishop kaessmann has been straightforward in taking responsibility for the church 's past " i can say publicly that i apologize , " kaessmann told german television ndr .
" but i would say even more : i am ashamed that these things occurred in our institutions and that children were truly broken in their wills and their dignity hurt to such an extent . " kaessmann said she welcomed the parliamentary decision to set up a round table .
she said she supported the idea of a compensation fund . " i personally think that we have to talk about compensation for people who were forced to compulsory labor in these institutions without being paid and are in dire situations today , " she said .
she said it was also necessary to discuss therapeutic support to help former state wards process and deal with their pasts . but kaessmann remains alone in her response .
catholic and state organizations , while offering their unconditional help in clarifying the situation , have yet to make formal apologies to the estimated 500,000 to 800,000 adults who spent their childhood and / or adolescence in institutionalized homes between 1945 and 1975 . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

over half a million children brought up in church and state institutions between 1945 and 1975 suffered this fate in what one survivor called " child welfare hellholes . " " i was beaten and kicked into a cripple while in a home , " said dietmar krone .
" i still suffer from this today . " for 30 years , krone kept his experiences to himself - as did most victims of such institutional abuse .

he wrote a book about his experiences in an institution in suechteln , today a part of viersen near the dutch border . decades after the fact , victims ' groups are finally supposed to sit down in the next weeks with government , state and church representatives for a round table discussion of the situation .

the union , which represents 70 percent of lufthansa 's 16,000 cabin crew , is seeking a 15-percent pay hike over the next 12 months .

dw 's daniel scheschkewitz says the two-pronged approach is the only way to get the country on track . afghanistan is teetering on the edge of collapse .
that 's the opinion of all military leaders , reconstruction workers and informed politicians who have visited the country in recent months .
the taliban has regrouped and has extended its influence from the south of afghanistan to the north and west .
troops of the multinational nato-led isaf -lrb- international security and assistance force -rrb- force , including german soldiers , have increasingly come under attacks by insurgent groups .
aid workers have been leaving the region due to the worsening security situation .
at the same time , afghan president hamid karzai has failed to extend his centralized rule to the whole country .
the drug trade continues to flourish , providing a source of finance for the taliban and islamist terrorism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel scheschkewitz nato 's top commander , general john craddock , has for months been urging that the afghanistan force needs to be bolstered by a further 20,000 soldiers .
this week nato sources said the german army plans to send an additional 600 soldiers to afghanistan 's north where german troops are already stationed .
raising the number of troops makes sense provided it 's meant to provide military cover for the civilian reconstruction of the country and not the senseless bombing of alleged taliban targets which usually kills innocent civilians .
human rights groups say over 1,000 civilians were killed last year alone as a result of such attacks by international troops .
a similar number of people were killed in suicide bombings carried out by islamist terrorists .
that leads to an escalating spiral of violence in the region which can only be stopped if significant progress is made in rebuilding afghanistan .
any attempt at reconstruction however remains piecemeal if there is no security , law and order .
efforts to create institutions such as a justice system and a functioning afghan police force , which has been ignored for too long , need to be urgently stepped up .
the military , which is responsible for maintaining order , needs to have an afghan face .
the german army is already making a valuable contribution by training the ana or afghan national army .
but the army still rarely patrols remote parts of the country where former warlords and the taliban seal drug deals and the opium harvest continues unchecked .
the planned deployment of nato reconnaissance planes , in which germany will contribute a third of the needed personnel , could help to tackle the problem .
in the past , the us successfully used such planes to fight drug smuggling in colombia .
the problem is that these aircraft can also be used to coordinate combat operations .
it would be good if a german parliamentary mandate , which is needed for such operations , would be limited to using the reconnaissance jets only for patrolling purposes .
it would thus prevent innocent civilians from being killed during the deployment of the spy planes and german soldiers being involved in their deaths .
as opposed to former us president george w. bush , afghanistan is a priority for new us president barack obama .
that can only be welcomed .
at the same time , the situation would improve if in addition to raising the number of troops , the quality of the civilian-military engagement were improved .
more soldiers alone wo n't be able to secure peace .
but a targeted involvement in reconstructing the country just might achieve that .

dw 's daniel scheschkewitz says the two-pronged approach is the only way to get the country on track . afghanistan is teetering on the edge of collapse .
that 's the opinion of all military leaders , reconstruction workers and informed politicians who have visited the country in recent months .
the taliban has regrouped and has extended its influence from the south of afghanistan to the north and west .
troops of the multinational nato-led isaf -lrb- international security and assistance force -rrb- force , including german soldiers , have increasingly come under attacks by insurgent groups .
aid workers have been leaving the region due to the worsening security situation .
at the same time , afghan president hamid karzai has failed to extend his centralized rule to the whole country .
the drug trade continues to flourish , providing a source of finance for the taliban and islamist terrorism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel scheschkewitz nato 's top commander , general john craddock , has for months been urging that the afghanistan force needs to be bolstered by a further 20,000 soldiers .
this week nato sources said the german army plans to send an additional 600 soldiers to afghanistan 's north where german troops are already stationed .
raising the number of troops makes sense provided it 's meant to provide military cover for the civilian reconstruction of the country and not the senseless bombing of alleged taliban targets which usually kills innocent civilians .
human rights groups say over 1,000 civilians were killed last year alone as a result of such attacks by international troops .
a similar number of people were killed in suicide bombings carried out by islamist terrorists .
that leads to an escalating spiral of violence in the region which can only be stopped if significant progress is made in rebuilding afghanistan .
any attempt at reconstruction however remains piecemeal if there is no security , law and order .
efforts to create institutions such as a justice system and a functioning afghan police force , which has been ignored for too long , need to be urgently stepped up .
the military , which is responsible for maintaining order , needs to have an afghan face .
the german army is already making a valuable contribution by training the ana or afghan national army .
but the army still rarely patrols remote parts of the country where former warlords and the taliban seal drug deals and the opium harvest continues unchecked .
the planned deployment of nato reconnaissance planes , in which germany will contribute a third of the needed personnel , could help to tackle the problem .
in the past , the us successfully used such planes to fight drug smuggling in colombia .
the problem is that these aircraft can also be used to coordinate combat operations .
it would be good if a german parliamentary mandate , which is needed for such operations , would be limited to using the reconnaissance jets only for patrolling purposes .
it would thus prevent innocent civilians from being killed during the deployment of the spy planes and german soldiers being involved in their deaths .
as opposed to former us president george w. bush , afghanistan is a priority for new us president barack obama .
that can only be welcomed .
at the same time , the situation would improve if in addition to raising the number of troops , the quality of the civilian-military engagement were improved .
more soldiers alone wo n't be able to secure peace .
but a targeted involvement in reconstructing the country just might achieve that .

but the army still rarely patrols remote parts of the country where former warlords and the taliban seal drug deals and the opium harvest continues unchecked .
the planned deployment of nato reconnaissance planes , in which germany will contribute a third of the needed personnel , could help to tackle the problem .
in the past , the us successfully used such planes to fight drug smuggling in colombia .
the problem is that these aircraft can also be used to coordinate combat operations .
it would be good if a german parliamentary mandate , which is needed for such operations , would be limited to using the reconnaissance jets only for patrolling purposes .
it would thus prevent innocent civilians from being killed during the deployment of the spy planes and german soldiers being involved in their deaths .
as opposed to former us president george w. bush , afghanistan is a priority for new us president barack obama .
that can only be welcomed .
at the same time , the situation would improve if in addition to raising the number of troops , the quality of the civilian-military engagement were improved .
more soldiers alone wo n't be able to secure peace .
but a targeted involvement in reconstructing the country just might achieve that .

the request comes at a time when the influence that germany and the eu have over israel is viewed as minimal . " the israeli side has itself announced that it will carry out an inquiry into these allegations .
we expect this to occur with the necessary urgency and thoroughness , " foreign ministry spokesman andreas peschke said . peschke however emphasized that now is not the right time for an international , independent probe of the matter . " in the current situation we should be focused on turning the very fragile peace there into a sustainable ceasefire ... so that it is possible to give concrete help to people , to organize reconstruction and of course to return to a political process , " he told a regular news conference on friday , jan .
23 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a vicious cycle : europe finances infrastructure only to have it destroyed although white phosphorus is permitted for creating a smokescreen , it is banned under international law for use near civilians because it can cause severe burns .
according to israeli newspaper haaretz , the country ’ s army has begun an inquiry to determine whether paratroopers used the banned shells close to civilians during the gaza offensive . amesty international has alleged that israel could be guilty of war crimes , saying the use of the shells in civilian areas was " clear and undeniable . " germany ’ s call on israel to conduct the probe comes at a time when european influence over israel is proving itself to be minimal if not obsolete . europe 's dilemma the european union has been frustrated in the past by being forced to stand on the sidelines and watch as building projects they funded in palestine were destroyed by israeli bombs .
the european union has been a major aid partner to palestine , but has very little political influence in the middle east , experts say . but with new us president barack obama signaling that his administration will make the middle east a top foreign policy priority , europe hopes for a greater influence on israel .

they now want an apology and compensation .
but the government is sending mixed signals . they were beaten , humiliated , sexually abused and forced to do compulsory labor - while wards of the state .
over half a million children brought up in church and state institutions between 1945 and 1975 suffered this fate in what one survivor called " child welfare hellholes . " " i was beaten and kicked into a cripple while in a home , " said dietmar krone .
" i still suffer from this today . " for 30 years , krone kept his experiences to himself - as did most victims of such institutional abuse .
but when other former wards of the state began publicly calling attention to their plight , the 55-year-old joined them .
he wrote a book about his experiences in an institution in suechteln , today a part of viersen near the dutch border . decades after the fact , victims ' groups are finally supposed to sit down in the next weeks with government , state and church representatives for a round table discussion of the situation .
in december , the german parliament bundestag unanimously passed a recommendation to the government to set up such a panel . a petitions committee had previously recommended such action to the bundestag after two years of deliberation . material compensation the round table is intended to serve as a platform for all parties to clarify the background and consequences for victims .
this includes rehabilitation possibilities , psychological support and compensation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : play time , if any , was limited " we 'd like some form of material compensation , " said hans-siegfried wiegand , head of the german association of former institutionalized wards of the state verein ehemaliger heimkinder -lrb- veh -rrb- .
he said many children were forced to compulsory labor during their time in these homes . " we are talking about 10 to 12 hours a day of hard labor for which they received no noticeable , if any , pay , " wiegand said .
" the institutions themselves , as well as companies such as braun and miele , profited from this . " since these adolescents were forced to work , they were refused schooling or vocational training . " the director at my institution told me when i arrived : ' there 's no school instruction here , we just need nimble workers ' , " krone said .
" two hours later , i was sitting at one of the workbenches . "
he received monthly wages of 7.20 deutsche marks -lrb- 3.60 euros , $ 4.75 -rrb- . " and if you made an error , there were deductions - and you were beaten or thrown into a dark cell , " krone said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few children in homes were able to take field trips in addition , the work these adolescents did was not officially recognized and therefore not credited in their pensions . " ironically enough , only voluntary work can be considered for pension benefits - and this was n't voluntary , " wiegand said .
he said many former wards of the state , who are today between 50 and 70 years of age , are financially struggling due to their past . " many are ailing or very ill , either physically or mentally , " wiegand said .
" most are poor as a result of their lives , for example by going into early retirement .
they did n't have the strength anymore to continue working . " mental compensation in addition to financial compensation , wiegand said it would mean a lot to these victims to receive an " explicit recognition " of their suffering .
krone said an official apology would make a difference to him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the catholic church has yet to apologize for its past " it would restore my sense of honor and dignity , " said krone .
but the regional authority responsible for his case has yet to do so , he said . " the word apology does n't cross their lips , " krone said .
" they ca n't apologize ; that would be a confession of their conduct . " round table the petitions committee 's recommendation had recognized " injustice and suffering " and " regretted this deeply . "
yet a dispute has arisen on several points after german family minister ursula von der leyen presented a counter draft of necessary action . " she up front decided to rule out certain aspects , " wiegand said .
this included setting up a contact point for victims and eliminating a compensation fund . " the minister did so without consulting us at all and these decisions are actually the task of the round table , " wiegand said .
" we ca n't put up with this . " but the ministry contradicted these statements .
press officer marc kinert said the ministry had not ruled out anything ahead of time , but rather would leave that up to the discussions at the round table . " there will be open-ended negotiations on possible compensation payments at that time , " kinert said . protestant church apologizes the protestant church in germany is the only organization to take responsibility for its past .
hanover 's regional bishop margot kaessmann earlier this month officially apologized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bishop kaessmann has been straightforward in taking responsibility for the church 's past " i can say publicly that i apologize , " kaessmann told german television ndr .
" but i would say even more : i am ashamed that these things occurred in our institutions and that children were truly broken in their wills and their dignity hurt to such an extent . " kaessmann said she welcomed the parliamentary decision to set up a round table .
she said she supported the idea of a compensation fund . " i personally think that we have to talk about compensation for people who were forced to compulsory labor in these institutions without being paid and are in dire situations today , " she said .
she said it was also necessary to discuss therapeutic support to help former state wards process and deal with their pasts . but kaessmann remains alone in her response .
catholic and state organizations , while offering their unconditional help in clarifying the situation , have yet to make formal apologies to the estimated 500,000 to 800,000 adults who spent their childhood and / or adolescence in institutionalized homes between 1945 and 1975 . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

over half a million children brought up in church and state institutions between 1945 and 1975 suffered this fate in what one survivor called " child welfare hellholes . " " i was beaten and kicked into a cripple while in a home , " said dietmar krone .
" i still suffer from this today . " for 30 years , krone kept his experiences to himself - as did most victims of such institutional abuse .
but when other former wards of the state began publicly calling attention to their plight , the 55-year-old joined them .
he wrote a book about his experiences in an institution in suechteln , today a part of viersen near the dutch border . decades after the fact , victims ' groups are finally supposed to sit down in the next weeks with government , state and church representatives for a round table discussion of the situation .
in december , the german parliament bundestag unanimously passed a recommendation to the government to set up such a panel . a petitions committee had previously recommended such action to the bundestag after two years of deliberation . material compensation the round table is intended to serve as a platform for all parties to clarify the background and consequences for victims .
this includes rehabilitation possibilities , psychological support and compensation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : play time , if any , was limited " we 'd like some form of material compensation , " said hans-siegfried wiegand , head of the german association of former institutionalized wards of the state verein ehemaliger heimkinder -lrb- veh -rrb- .
he said many children were forced to compulsory labor during their time in these homes . " we are talking about 10 to 12 hours a day of hard labor for which they received no noticeable , if any , pay , " wiegand said .
" the institutions themselves , as well as companies such as braun and miele , profited from this . " since these adolescents were forced to work , they were refused schooling or vocational training . " the director at my institution told me when i arrived : ' there 's no school instruction here , we just need nimble workers ' , " krone said .
" two hours later , i was sitting at one of the workbenches . "
he received monthly wages of 7.20 deutsche marks -lrb- 3.60 euros , $ 4.75 -rrb- . " and if you made an error , there were deductions - and you were beaten or thrown into a dark cell , " krone said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few children in homes were able to take field trips in addition , the work these adolescents did was not officially recognized and therefore not credited in their pensions . " ironically enough , only voluntary work can be considered for pension benefits - and this was n't voluntary , " wiegand said .
he said many former wards of the state , who are today between 50 and 70 years of age , are financially struggling due to their past . " many are ailing or very ill , either physically or mentally , " wiegand said .
" most are poor as a result of their lives , for example by going into early retirement .
they did n't have the strength anymore to continue working . " mental compensation in addition to financial compensation , wiegand said it would mean a lot to these victims to receive an " explicit recognition " of their suffering .
krone said an official apology would make a difference to him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the catholic church has yet to apologize for its past " it would restore my sense of honor and dignity , " said krone .
but the regional authority responsible for his case has yet to do so , he said . " the word apology does n't cross their lips , " krone said .
" they ca n't apologize ; that would be a confession of their conduct . " round table the petitions committee 's recommendation had recognized " injustice and suffering " and " regretted this deeply . "
yet a dispute has arisen on several points after german family minister ursula von der leyen presented a counter draft of necessary action . " she up front decided to rule out certain aspects , " wiegand said .
this included setting up a contact point for victims and eliminating a compensation fund . " the minister did so without consulting us at all and these decisions are actually the task of the round table , " wiegand said .
" we ca n't put up with this . " but the ministry contradicted these statements .
press officer marc kinert said the ministry had not ruled out anything ahead of time , but rather would leave that up to the discussions at the round table . " there will be open-ended negotiations on possible compensation payments at that time , " kinert said . protestant church apologizes the protestant church in germany is the only organization to take responsibility for its past .
hanover 's regional bishop margot kaessmann earlier this month officially apologized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bishop kaessmann has been straightforward in taking responsibility for the church 's past " i can say publicly that i apologize , " kaessmann told german television ndr .
" but i would say even more : i am ashamed that these things occurred in our institutions and that children were truly broken in their wills and their dignity hurt to such an extent . " kaessmann said she welcomed the parliamentary decision to set up a round table .
she said she supported the idea of a compensation fund . " i personally think that we have to talk about compensation for people who were forced to compulsory labor in these institutions without being paid and are in dire situations today , " she said .
she said it was also necessary to discuss therapeutic support to help former state wards process and deal with their pasts . but kaessmann remains alone in her response .
catholic and state organizations , while offering their unconditional help in clarifying the situation , have yet to make formal apologies to the estimated 500,000 to 800,000 adults who spent their childhood and / or adolescence in institutionalized homes between 1945 and 1975 . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" now that barack obama has announced his intention of shutting the facility down , european union governments are being urged to lend a hand to the new us president by absorbing a portion of guantanamo 's inmates .
as martin schulz , leader of the european parliament 's socialist group , put it thursday : " the obama administration has started on the right foot by announcing the closure within a year of this outrageous detention camp ...
eu governments must now play their part and support president obama 's decision by accepting inmates . "
eu foreign ministers are to talk it over during a meeting monday in brussels .
guantanamo currently holds about 250 detainees , hardly any of which are european .
most of the remaining prisoners come from countries with poor human rights records such as yemen .
if sent home , many would almost certainly face torture and abuse .
us looks to eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama will be hoping europe will lend a hand with guantanamo inmates a senior official in the new obama administration , speaking on condition of anonymity , said that washington is hopeful that other governments will be more " forthcoming " towards helping deal with guantanamo inmates in light of there being a new us president in office .
while europe would in all likelihood be asked to host only a few of those eligible for release , international relations experts say that a positive and unified response from the " old continent " would have significant implications .
in fact , the fate of the men in orange jumpsuits offers european leaders a first opportunity to show that they really do mean it when they profess to seek " a new era in transatlantic relations . "
internal divisions and acrimony , on the other hand , would seriously jeopardize the european honeymoon with obama , even before he starts asking allied governments to contribute more troops to afghanistan .
so far , the omens do n't look good .
portuguese offer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal 's foreign minister luis amado says his country will only take ' harmless ' inmates ahead of monday 's meeting in brussels , eu governments were roughly divided into three camps : those willing to host guantanamo 's lost souls ; those categorically against it ; and those who remain undecided .
the first camp is desolately empty .
in december , portuguese foreign minister luis amado became the first to offer to take some inmates , but only as long as they were deemed harmless and likely to be subject to persecution in their home countries .
since then , france , spain and sweden have said they might be willing to do the same , but only on a " case by case basis . "
the " absolutely not " camp features austria and old bush friends such as poland , which once had a conservative government but is now ruled by the centre-left .

" besides , prisoners from foreign countries who speak exotic languages would be no small challenge for our prison system .
hence i would n't be too eager , " he said .
poland is currently embroiled in a major prison scandal following the suicide of a high-profile convict .
the last thing prime minister donald tusk wants on his mind is more prisoners .
the government in denmark , which like poland 's former administration supported bush 's unpopular war in iraq , is under intense pressure to make amends with obama .
villy sovndal , leader of the opposition socialist people 's party , recently told daily politiken that denmark had a " special responsibility " as a backer of the bush administration 's " war on terror . "
but danish premier anders fogh rasmussen , while claiming he personally tried to convince bush to close guantanamo , says he has no plans to accept any prisoners .
eu powers ambivalent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier is willing to follow the us lead on gitmo detainees perhaps even more worrying is how undecided two of europe 's heavyweights seem to be .
in britain , plans by foreign minister david miliband to take in guantanamo detainees were reportedly vetoed by the home office on grounds of difficulties with the suspects ' immigration status , housing and benefits .
london has previously taken in british subjects who had been held in guantanamo , but having foreign terror suspects with no links to the uk is a different matter .

" now that barack obama has announced his intention of shutting the facility down , european union governments are being urged to lend a hand to the new us president by absorbing a portion of guantanamo 's inmates .
as martin schulz , leader of the european parliament 's socialist group , put it thursday : " the obama administration has started on the right foot by announcing the closure within a year of this outrageous detention camp ...
eu governments must now play their part and support president obama 's decision by accepting inmates . "
eu foreign ministers are to talk it over during a meeting monday in brussels .
guantanamo currently holds about 250 detainees , hardly any of which are european .
most of the remaining prisoners come from countries with poor human rights records such as yemen .
if sent home , many would almost certainly face torture and abuse .
us looks to eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama will be hoping europe will lend a hand with guantanamo inmates a senior official in the new obama administration , speaking on condition of anonymity , said that washington is hopeful that other governments will be more " forthcoming " towards helping deal with guantanamo inmates in light of there being a new us president in office .
while europe would in all likelihood be asked to host only a few of those eligible for release , international relations experts say that a positive and unified response from the " old continent " would have significant implications .
in fact , the fate of the men in orange jumpsuits offers european leaders a first opportunity to show that they really do mean it when they profess to seek " a new era in transatlantic relations . "
internal divisions and acrimony , on the other hand , would seriously jeopardize the european honeymoon with obama , even before he starts asking allied governments to contribute more troops to afghanistan .
so far , the omens do n't look good .
portuguese offer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal 's foreign minister luis amado says his country will only take ' harmless ' inmates ahead of monday 's meeting in brussels , eu governments were roughly divided into three camps : those willing to host guantanamo 's lost souls ; those categorically against it ; and those who remain undecided .
the first camp is desolately empty .
in december , portuguese foreign minister luis amado became the first to offer to take some inmates , but only as long as they were deemed harmless and likely to be subject to persecution in their home countries .
since then , france , spain and sweden have said they might be willing to do the same , but only on a " case by case basis . "
the " absolutely not " camp features austria and old bush friends such as poland , which once had a conservative government but is now ruled by the centre-left .
polish , danish reluctance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister donald tusk wants to steer clear of accepting gitmo prisoners in december , current foreign minister radek sikorski said : " guantanamo is n't in poland 's center of attention .
" besides , prisoners from foreign countries who speak exotic languages would be no small challenge for our prison system .
hence i would n't be too eager , " he said .
poland is currently embroiled in a major prison scandal following the suicide of a high-profile convict .
the last thing prime minister donald tusk wants on his mind is more prisoners .
the government in denmark , which like poland 's former administration supported bush 's unpopular war in iraq , is under intense pressure to make amends with obama .
villy sovndal , leader of the opposition socialist people 's party , recently told daily politiken that denmark had a " special responsibility " as a backer of the bush administration 's " war on terror . "
but danish premier anders fogh rasmussen , while claiming he personally tried to convince bush to close guantanamo , says he has no plans to accept any prisoners .
eu powers ambivalent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier is willing to follow the us lead on gitmo detainees perhaps even more worrying is how undecided two of europe 's heavyweights seem to be .
in britain , plans by foreign minister david miliband to take in guantanamo detainees were reportedly vetoed by the home office on grounds of difficulties with the suspects ' immigration status , housing and benefits .
london has previously taken in british subjects who had been held in guantanamo , but having foreign terror suspects with no links to the uk is a different matter .
in germany , where the governing right-left coalition is set for electoral battle later this year , ministers have been contradicting each other .
while foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , a social democrat , is in favor , interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , a conservative , is against .
the czech presidency of the eu , whose government has still not taken a clear position on the matter , will attempt to forge a common position during monday 's talks in brussels .
a group of human-rights organizations has , meanwhile , written a letter urging eu ministers to " send a common message on their willingness to help close guantanamo and - most important - follow it up with concrete action to find homes for detainees who can not be returned to their countries of origin .

dw 's daniel scheschkewitz says the two-pronged approach is the only way to get the country on track . afghanistan is teetering on the edge of collapse .
that 's the opinion of all military leaders , reconstruction workers and informed politicians who have visited the country in recent months .
the taliban has regrouped and has extended its influence from the south of afghanistan to the north and west .
troops of the multinational nato-led isaf -lrb- international security and assistance force -rrb- force , including german soldiers , have increasingly come under attacks by insurgent groups .
aid workers have been leaving the region due to the worsening security situation .
at the same time , afghan president hamid karzai has failed to extend his centralized rule to the whole country .
the drug trade continues to flourish , providing a source of finance for the taliban and islamist terrorism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel scheschkewitz nato 's top commander , general john craddock , has for months been urging that the afghanistan force needs to be bolstered by a further 20,000 soldiers .
this week nato sources said the german army plans to send an additional 600 soldiers to afghanistan 's north where german troops are already stationed .
raising the number of troops makes sense provided it 's meant to provide military cover for the civilian reconstruction of the country and not the senseless bombing of alleged taliban targets which usually kills innocent civilians .
human rights groups say over 1,000 civilians were killed last year alone as a result of such attacks by international troops .
a similar number of people were killed in suicide bombings carried out by islamist terrorists .
that leads to an escalating spiral of violence in the region which can only be stopped if significant progress is made in rebuilding afghanistan .
any attempt at reconstruction however remains piecemeal if there is no security , law and order .
efforts to create institutions such as a justice system and a functioning afghan police force , which has been ignored for too long , need to be urgently stepped up .
the military , which is responsible for maintaining order , needs to have an afghan face .
the german army is already making a valuable contribution by training the ana or afghan national army .
but the army still rarely patrols remote parts of the country where former warlords and the taliban seal drug deals and the opium harvest continues unchecked .
the planned deployment of nato reconnaissance planes , in which germany will contribute a third of the needed personnel , could help to tackle the problem .
in the past , the us successfully used such planes to fight drug smuggling in colombia .
the problem is that these aircraft can also be used to coordinate combat operations .
it would be good if a german parliamentary mandate , which is needed for such operations , would be limited to using the reconnaissance jets only for patrolling purposes .
it would thus prevent innocent civilians from being killed during the deployment of the spy planes and german soldiers being involved in their deaths .
as opposed to former us president george w. bush , afghanistan is a priority for new us president barack obama .
that can only be welcomed .
at the same time , the situation would improve if in addition to raising the number of troops , the quality of the civilian-military engagement were improved .
more soldiers alone wo n't be able to secure peace .
but a targeted involvement in reconstructing the country just might achieve that .

the planned deployment of nato reconnaissance planes , in which germany will contribute a third of the needed personnel , could help to tackle the problem .
in the past , the us successfully used such planes to fight drug smuggling in colombia .
the problem is that these aircraft can also be used to coordinate combat operations .
it would be good if a german parliamentary mandate , which is needed for such operations , would be limited to using the reconnaissance jets only for patrolling purposes .
it would thus prevent innocent civilians from being killed during the deployment of the spy planes and german soldiers being involved in their deaths .
as opposed to former us president george w. bush , afghanistan is a priority for new us president barack obama .
that can only be welcomed .
at the same time , the situation would improve if in addition to raising the number of troops , the quality of the civilian-military engagement were improved .
more soldiers alone wo n't be able to secure peace .
but a targeted involvement in reconstructing the country just might achieve that .

dw 's daniel scheschkewitz says the two-pronged approach is the only way to get the country on track . afghanistan is teetering on the edge of collapse .
that 's the opinion of all military leaders , reconstruction workers and informed politicians who have visited the country in recent months .
the taliban has regrouped and has extended its influence from the south of afghanistan to the north and west .
troops of the multinational nato-led isaf -lrb- international security and assistance force -rrb- force , including german soldiers , have increasingly come under attacks by insurgent groups .
aid workers have been leaving the region due to the worsening security situation .
at the same time , afghan president hamid karzai has failed to extend his centralized rule to the whole country .
the drug trade continues to flourish , providing a source of finance for the taliban and islamist terrorism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel scheschkewitz nato 's top commander , general john craddock , has for months been urging that the afghanistan force needs to be bolstered by a further 20,000 soldiers .
this week nato sources said the german army plans to send an additional 600 soldiers to afghanistan 's north where german troops are already stationed .
raising the number of troops makes sense provided it 's meant to provide military cover for the civilian reconstruction of the country and not the senseless bombing of alleged taliban targets which usually kills innocent civilians .
human rights groups say over 1,000 civilians were killed last year alone as a result of such attacks by international troops .
a similar number of people were killed in suicide bombings carried out by islamist terrorists .
that leads to an escalating spiral of violence in the region which can only be stopped if significant progress is made in rebuilding afghanistan .
any attempt at reconstruction however remains piecemeal if there is no security , law and order .
efforts to create institutions such as a justice system and a functioning afghan police force , which has been ignored for too long , need to be urgently stepped up .
the military , which is responsible for maintaining order , needs to have an afghan face .

the assembly voted 140-48 for the motion to prod the government into trying to negotiate a new lease of life for two of the four decommissioned soviet-era reactors at the kozloduy power plant .
the 2006 closure of two of the 440-megawatt reactors , considered unsafe by the european union , was one of the conditions bulgaria had to meet to join the bloc in 2007 .
the two other soviet-era reactors had already been switched off in 2002 .

bulgaria has also revived plans to build another nuclear plant at belene , 100 kilometers downstream on the danube .
friday 's parliamentary decision posited that bulgaria should consider bringing the newer generators back online in cooperation with brussels .

the assembly voted 140-48 for the motion to prod the government into trying to negotiate a new lease of life for two of the four decommissioned soviet-era reactors at the kozloduy power plant .
the 2006 closure of two of the 440-megawatt reactors , considered unsafe by the european union , was one of the conditions bulgaria had to meet to join the bloc in 2007 .
the two other soviet-era reactors had already been switched off in 2002 .
kozloduy , bulgaria 's only nuclear plant , continues to operate on two modern , russian-built 1,000-megawatt reactors .
bulgaria has also revived plans to build another nuclear plant at belene , 100 kilometers downstream on the danube .
friday 's parliamentary decision posited that bulgaria should consider bringing the newer generators back online in cooperation with brussels .
bulgarian officials , including president georgi parvanov , argued for the restart of the old kozloduy installations during the recent russia-ukraine gas row , which hit bulgaria hard causing industry loses in excess of 196 million leva -lrb- $ 130 million -rrb- . dpa news agency -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the project is financed by a compensation fund set up by the german government and major companies in 2001 for survivors of the nazi forced labor program .
" their suffering should not be forgotten , " the head of the " remembrance , responsibility and future " foundation managing the 4.4-billion-euro -lrb- $ 5.7 billion -rrb- fund , guenther saathoff , told reporters in berlin during a press conference on thursday , jan 22 .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the web site has an international dimension the fund said on the project 's web site , www.zwangsarbeit-archiv.de , that beyond the compensation payouts which ended in 2007 , it remained important to keep alive the memory of forced labor under the nazis for future generations .
" the victims did not want only money that was owed to them - they also wanted to tell about things that no one wanted to hear about for decades , " saathoff said .
the creators of the project say on the web site that most of the interviews were conducted in ukraine , poland and russia .
but the organizers also spoke to survivors in the us , israel and south africa among other countries .
the survivors include prominent personalities such as spanish author jose semprun as well as members of largely forgotten groups of victims such as the roma , according to the portal .
in addition to the testimonies , short biographies of the survivors and in some cases audio interviews , transcripts , photographs and other personal documents are also included .
" victims will get public recognition " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a photo of miroslav d , a former forced laborer under the nazis many of the accounts describe degrading work and living conditions and a life marked by hunger and disease .
felix kolmer , a former slave laborer , said at the news conference on thursday that the online archive would provide increasingly rare personal accounts of the nazi forced labor program to researchers , teachers and students .
" victims will finally get the public recognition and attention for which they have often waited in vain over the last decades , " kolmer , who is also vice president of the international auschwitz committee , a holocaust survivors group , said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 23.01.2009 abused wards of the state demand reparation in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reading was the exception in many institutions scores of children in postwar germany were abused in institutions while wards of the state well into the 1970s .
they now want an apology and compensation .
but the government is sending mixed signals . they were beaten , humiliated , sexually abused and forced to do compulsory labor - while wards of the state .
over half a million children brought up in church and state institutions between 1945 and 1975 suffered this fate in what one survivor called " child welfare hellholes . " " i was beaten and kicked into a cripple while in a home , " said dietmar krone .
" i still suffer from this today . " for 30 years , krone kept his experiences to himself - as did most victims of such institutional abuse .
but when other former wards of the state began publicly calling attention to their plight , the 55-year-old joined them .
he wrote a book about his experiences in an institution in suechteln , today a part of viersen near the dutch border . decades after the fact , victims ' groups are finally supposed to sit down in the next weeks with government , state and church representatives for a round table discussion of the situation .
in december , the german parliament bundestag unanimously passed a recommendation to the government to set up such a panel . a petitions committee had previously recommended such action to the bundestag after two years of deliberation . material compensation the round table is intended to serve as a platform for all parties to clarify the background and consequences for victims .
this includes rehabilitation possibilities , psychological support and compensation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : play time , if any , was limited " we 'd like some form of material compensation , " said hans-siegfried wiegand , head of the german association of former institutionalized wards of the state verein ehemaliger heimkinder -lrb- veh -rrb- .
he said many children were forced to compulsory labor during their time in these homes . " we are talking about 10 to 12 hours a day of hard labor for which they received no noticeable , if any , pay , " wiegand said .
" the institutions themselves , as well as companies such as braun and miele , profited from this . " since these adolescents were forced to work , they were refused schooling or vocational training . " the director at my institution told me when i arrived : ' there 's no school instruction here , we just need nimble workers ' , " krone said .
" two hours later , i was sitting at one of the workbenches . "
he received monthly wages of 7.20 deutsche marks -lrb- 3.60 euros , $ 4.75 -rrb- . " and if you made an error , there were deductions - and you were beaten or thrown into a dark cell , " krone said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few children in homes were able to take field trips in addition , the work these adolescents did was not officially recognized and therefore not credited in their pensions . " ironically enough , only voluntary work can be considered for pension benefits - and this was n't voluntary , " wiegand said .
he said many former wards of the state , who are today between 50 and 70 years of age , are financially struggling due to their past . " many are ailing or very ill , either physically or mentally , " wiegand said .
" most are poor as a result of their lives , for example by going into early retirement .
they did n't have the strength anymore to continue working . " mental compensation in addition to financial compensation , wiegand said it would mean a lot to these victims to receive an " explicit recognition " of their suffering .
krone said an official apology would make a difference to him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the catholic church has yet to apologize for its past " it would restore my sense of honor and dignity , " said krone .
but the regional authority responsible for his case has yet to do so , he said . " the word apology does n't cross their lips , " krone said .
" they ca n't apologize ; that would be a confession of their conduct . " round table the petitions committee 's recommendation had recognized " injustice and suffering " and " regretted this deeply . "
yet a dispute has arisen on several points after german family minister ursula von der leyen presented a counter draft of necessary action . " she up front decided to rule out certain aspects , " wiegand said .
this included setting up a contact point for victims and eliminating a compensation fund . " the minister did so without consulting us at all and these decisions are actually the task of the round table , " wiegand said .
" we ca n't put up with this . " but the ministry contradicted these statements .
press officer marc kinert said the ministry had not ruled out anything ahead of time , but rather would leave that up to the discussions at the round table . " there will be open-ended negotiations on possible compensation payments at that time , " kinert said . protestant church apologizes the protestant church in germany is the only organization to take responsibility for its past .
hanover 's regional bishop margot kaessmann earlier this month officially apologized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bishop kaessmann has been straightforward in taking responsibility for the church 's past " i can say publicly that i apologize , " kaessmann told german television ndr .
" but i would say even more : i am ashamed that these things occurred in our institutions and that children were truly broken in their wills and their dignity hurt to such an extent . " kaessmann said she welcomed the parliamentary decision to set up a round table .
she said she supported the idea of a compensation fund . " i personally think that we have to talk about compensation for people who were forced to compulsory labor in these institutions without being paid and are in dire situations today , " she said .
she said it was also necessary to discuss therapeutic support to help former state wards process and deal with their pasts . but kaessmann remains alone in her response .
catholic and state organizations , while offering their unconditional help in clarifying the situation , have yet to make formal apologies to the estimated 500,000 to 800,000 adults who spent their childhood and / or adolescence in institutionalized homes between 1945 and 1975 . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the latest edition has also enraged jewish groups in the country . the project , which focuses on reprinting newspapers from 1933 to 1945 , is meant to educate germans but has instead sparked outrage from jewish groups and authorities worried about the possible offence to holocaust survivors and the potential misuse of the material by neo-nazis . on thursday , the bavarian finance ministry , which says it holds the rights to all publications from the main nazi publishing house , said it would resort to the courts to stop future papers being published .
it added it was pressing charges against the british publisher , peter mcgee , for copyright infringement . the latest edition of the paper , the voelkischer beobachter -lrb- people 's observer -rrb- , greeted germans at newsstands thursday with a headline proclaiming " huge fire in the reichstag " with a photograph of the reichstag parliament building in flames , seen as a pivotal moment in the rise to power of the nazis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler 's propaganda minister joseph goebbels " murder , terror , fire and destruction : these are the terrible things this fanatical party -lrb- the communists -rrb- leaves behind it , " joseph goebbels writes in the commentary on the first page .
" we 've had enough , " says the headline .
" now we 're going to take ruthless and dramatic measures . " jewish group slams " hitler sells " concept the project called " zeitungszeugen , " a word play on the german words for " newspaper " and " witness , " is supported by some german historians who have annotated the articles . but the central council of jews in germany said on thursday it backed bavaria 's decision to ban the newspapers , complaining it was " left to complete chance " whether people also read the historical commentary or just the papers in isolation . " this is not what serious political education looks like , " stephan kramer , the general secretary of the organization said in a statement , adding the project seemed to be irresponsibly driven by the motto " hitler sells . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the row over the nazi papers follows a similar spat last year over the republication of hitler 's " mein kampf " charlotte knobloch , president of the central council for jews in germany said it was vital people read the historians ' comments included in the package with the papers . " as a holocaust survivor , these texts are much more to me than just interesting historical documents .
they are part of a harrowing reality that i can still recall , " she said in a commentary on the publishers ' web site .
if people read only the propaganda , she acknowledged , it could be " disastrous . " creators insist on educational value the makers of the project have however rebuffed the criticism , calling it an attack on press freedom . sandra paweronschitz , chief editor of the series , was quoted by news agency afp as saying the argument that the papers could fuel extremist activity was " as short-sighted as it is wrong . " she pointed out that the series was accompanied by commentary from leading historians putting the papers in their proper historical context . " we will fight this attack on the freedom of the press with all legal means - if necessary not only in civil courts but also before the federal constitutional court , " she said . several german historians have also defended the project . wolfgang benz , a professor at the berlin technical university 's center for research on anti-semitism , told news agency dpa recently that the edited copies were more educational and less harmful than german television history programs about the nazis , which include nazi film footage and images of swastikas . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it added it was pressing charges against the british publisher , peter mcgee , for copyright infringement . the latest edition of the paper , the voelkischer beobachter -lrb- people 's observer -rrb- , greeted germans at newsstands thursday with a headline proclaiming " huge fire in the reichstag " with a photograph of the reichstag parliament building in flames , seen as a pivotal moment in the rise to power of the nazis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler 's propaganda minister joseph goebbels " murder , terror , fire and destruction : these are the terrible things this fanatical party -lrb- the communists -rrb- leaves behind it , " joseph goebbels writes in the commentary on the first page .

if people read only the propaganda , she acknowledged , it could be " disastrous . " creators insist on educational value the makers of the project have however rebuffed the criticism , calling it an attack on press freedom . sandra paweronschitz , chief editor of the series , was quoted by news agency afp as saying the argument that the papers could fuel extremist activity was " as short-sighted as it is wrong .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 23.01.2009 bavaria seeks to ban reprinting of nazi newspapers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the latest edition featuring fiery remarks by goebbels has stirred controversy in germany fearing misuse by neo-nazis , bavaria is taking legal action against a british publisher reprinting and selling nazi-era newspapers .
the latest edition has also enraged jewish groups in the country . the project , which focuses on reprinting newspapers from 1933 to 1945 , is meant to educate germans but has instead sparked outrage from jewish groups and authorities worried about the possible offence to holocaust survivors and the potential misuse of the material by neo-nazis . on thursday , the bavarian finance ministry , which says it holds the rights to all publications from the main nazi publishing house , said it would resort to the courts to stop future papers being published .
it added it was pressing charges against the british publisher , peter mcgee , for copyright infringement . the latest edition of the paper , the voelkischer beobachter -lrb- people 's observer -rrb- , greeted germans at newsstands thursday with a headline proclaiming " huge fire in the reichstag " with a photograph of the reichstag parliament building in flames , seen as a pivotal moment in the rise to power of the nazis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler 's propaganda minister joseph goebbels " murder , terror , fire and destruction : these are the terrible things this fanatical party -lrb- the communists -rrb- leaves behind it , " joseph goebbels writes in the commentary on the first page .
" we 've had enough , " says the headline .
" now we 're going to take ruthless and dramatic measures . " jewish group slams " hitler sells " concept the project called " zeitungszeugen , " a word play on the german words for " newspaper " and " witness , " is supported by some german historians who have annotated the articles . but the central council of jews in germany said on thursday it backed bavaria 's decision to ban the newspapers , complaining it was " left to complete chance " whether people also read the historical commentary or just the papers in isolation . " this is not what serious political education looks like , " stephan kramer , the general secretary of the organization said in a statement , adding the project seemed to be irresponsibly driven by the motto " hitler sells . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the row over the nazi papers follows a similar spat last year over the republication of hitler 's " mein kampf " charlotte knobloch , president of the central council for jews in germany said it was vital people read the historians ' comments included in the package with the papers . " as a holocaust survivor , these texts are much more to me than just interesting historical documents .
they are part of a harrowing reality that i can still recall , " she said in a commentary on the publishers ' web site .
if people read only the propaganda , she acknowledged , it could be " disastrous . " creators insist on educational value the makers of the project have however rebuffed the criticism , calling it an attack on press freedom . sandra paweronschitz , chief editor of the series , was quoted by news agency afp as saying the argument that the papers could fuel extremist activity was " as short-sighted as it is wrong . " she pointed out that the series was accompanied by commentary from leading historians putting the papers in their proper historical context . " we will fight this attack on the freedom of the press with all legal means - if necessary not only in civil courts but also before the federal constitutional court , " she said . several german historians have also defended the project . wolfgang benz , a professor at the berlin technical university 's center for research on anti-semitism , told news agency dpa recently that the edited copies were more educational and less harmful than german television history programs about the nazis , which include nazi film footage and images of swastikas . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they now want an apology and compensation .
but the government is sending mixed signals . they were beaten , humiliated , sexually abused and forced to do compulsory labor - while wards of the state .
over half a million children brought up in church and state institutions between 1945 and 1975 suffered this fate in what one survivor called " child welfare hellholes . " " i was beaten and kicked into a cripple while in a home , " said dietmar krone .
" i still suffer from this today . " for 30 years , krone kept his experiences to himself - as did most victims of such institutional abuse .
but when other former wards of the state began publicly calling attention to their plight , the 55-year-old joined them .
he wrote a book about his experiences in an institution in suechteln , today a part of viersen near the dutch border . decades after the fact , victims ' groups are finally supposed to sit down in the next weeks with government , state and church representatives for a round table discussion of the situation .
in december , the german parliament bundestag unanimously passed a recommendation to the government to set up such a panel . a petitions committee had previously recommended such action to the bundestag after two years of deliberation . material compensation the round table is intended to serve as a platform for all parties to clarify the background and consequences for victims .
this includes rehabilitation possibilities , psychological support and compensation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : play time , if any , was limited " we 'd like some form of material compensation , " said hans-siegfried wiegand , head of the german association of former institutionalized wards of the state verein ehemaliger heimkinder -lrb- veh -rrb- .
he said many children were forced to compulsory labor during their time in these homes . " we are talking about 10 to 12 hours a day of hard labor for which they received no noticeable , if any , pay , " wiegand said .
" the institutions themselves , as well as companies such as braun and miele , profited from this . " since these adolescents were forced to work , they were refused schooling or vocational training . " the director at my institution told me when i arrived : ' there 's no school instruction here , we just need nimble workers ' , " krone said .
" two hours later , i was sitting at one of the workbenches . "
he received monthly wages of 7.20 deutsche marks -lrb- 3.60 euros , $ 4.75 -rrb- . " and if you made an error , there were deductions - and you were beaten or thrown into a dark cell , " krone said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few children in homes were able to take field trips in addition , the work these adolescents did was not officially recognized and therefore not credited in their pensions . " ironically enough , only voluntary work can be considered for pension benefits - and this was n't voluntary , " wiegand said .
he said many former wards of the state , who are today between 50 and 70 years of age , are financially struggling due to their past . " many are ailing or very ill , either physically or mentally , " wiegand said .
" most are poor as a result of their lives , for example by going into early retirement .
they did n't have the strength anymore to continue working . " mental compensation in addition to financial compensation , wiegand said it would mean a lot to these victims to receive an " explicit recognition " of their suffering .
krone said an official apology would make a difference to him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the catholic church has yet to apologize for its past " it would restore my sense of honor and dignity , " said krone .
but the regional authority responsible for his case has yet to do so , he said . " the word apology does n't cross their lips , " krone said .
" they ca n't apologize ; that would be a confession of their conduct . " round table the petitions committee 's recommendation had recognized " injustice and suffering " and " regretted this deeply . "
yet a dispute has arisen on several points after german family minister ursula von der leyen presented a counter draft of necessary action . " she up front decided to rule out certain aspects , " wiegand said .
this included setting up a contact point for victims and eliminating a compensation fund . " the minister did so without consulting us at all and these decisions are actually the task of the round table , " wiegand said .
" we ca n't put up with this . " but the ministry contradicted these statements .
press officer marc kinert said the ministry had not ruled out anything ahead of time , but rather would leave that up to the discussions at the round table . " there will be open-ended negotiations on possible compensation payments at that time , " kinert said . protestant church apologizes the protestant church in germany is the only organization to take responsibility for its past .

they now want an apology and compensation .
but the government is sending mixed signals . they were beaten , humiliated , sexually abused and forced to do compulsory labor - while wards of the state .
over half a million children brought up in church and state institutions between 1945 and 1975 suffered this fate in what one survivor called " child welfare hellholes . " " i was beaten and kicked into a cripple while in a home , " said dietmar krone .
" i still suffer from this today . " for 30 years , krone kept his experiences to himself - as did most victims of such institutional abuse .
but when other former wards of the state began publicly calling attention to their plight , the 55-year-old joined them .
he wrote a book about his experiences in an institution in suechteln , today a part of viersen near the dutch border . decades after the fact , victims ' groups are finally supposed to sit down in the next weeks with government , state and church representatives for a round table discussion of the situation .
in december , the german parliament bundestag unanimously passed a recommendation to the government to set up such a panel . a petitions committee had previously recommended such action to the bundestag after two years of deliberation . material compensation the round table is intended to serve as a platform for all parties to clarify the background and consequences for victims .

" ironically enough , only voluntary work can be considered for pension benefits - and this was n't voluntary , " wiegand said .
he said many former wards of the state , who are today between 50 and 70 years of age , are financially struggling due to their past . " many are ailing or very ill , either physically or mentally , " wiegand said .

this included setting up a contact point for victims and eliminating a compensation fund . " the minister did so without consulting us at all and these decisions are actually the task of the round table , " wiegand said .

" the director at my institution told me when i arrived : ' there 's no school instruction here , we just need nimble workers ' , " krone said .
" two hours later , i was sitting at one of the workbenches . "
he received monthly wages of 7.20 deutsche marks -lrb- 3.60 euros , $ 4.75 -rrb- . " and if you made an error , there were deductions - and you were beaten or thrown into a dark cell , " krone said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few children in homes were able to take field trips in addition , the work these adolescents did was not officially recognized and therefore not credited in their pensions . " ironically enough , only voluntary work can be considered for pension benefits - and this was n't voluntary , " wiegand said .
he said many former wards of the state , who are today between 50 and 70 years of age , are financially struggling due to their past . " many are ailing or very ill , either physically or mentally , " wiegand said .
" most are poor as a result of their lives , for example by going into early retirement .
they did n't have the strength anymore to continue working . " mental compensation in addition to financial compensation , wiegand said it would mean a lot to these victims to receive an " explicit recognition " of their suffering .
krone said an official apology would make a difference to him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the catholic church has yet to apologize for its past " it would restore my sense of honor and dignity , " said krone .
but the regional authority responsible for his case has yet to do so , he said . " the word apology does n't cross their lips , " krone said .
" they ca n't apologize ; that would be a confession of their conduct . " round table the petitions committee 's recommendation had recognized " injustice and suffering " and " regretted this deeply . "
yet a dispute has arisen on several points after german family minister ursula von der leyen presented a counter draft of necessary action . " she up front decided to rule out certain aspects , " wiegand said .
this included setting up a contact point for victims and eliminating a compensation fund . " the minister did so without consulting us at all and these decisions are actually the task of the round table , " wiegand said .
" we ca n't put up with this . " but the ministry contradicted these statements .
press officer marc kinert said the ministry had not ruled out anything ahead of time , but rather would leave that up to the discussions at the round table . " there will be open-ended negotiations on possible compensation payments at that time , " kinert said . protestant church apologizes the protestant church in germany is the only organization to take responsibility for its past .
hanover 's regional bishop margot kaessmann earlier this month officially apologized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bishop kaessmann has been straightforward in taking responsibility for the church 's past " i can say publicly that i apologize , " kaessmann told german television ndr .
" but i would say even more : i am ashamed that these things occurred in our institutions and that children were truly broken in their wills and their dignity hurt to such an extent . " kaessmann said she welcomed the parliamentary decision to set up a round table .
she said she supported the idea of a compensation fund . " i personally think that we have to talk about compensation for people who were forced to compulsory labor in these institutions without being paid and are in dire situations today , " she said .
she said it was also necessary to discuss therapeutic support to help former state wards process and deal with their pasts . but kaessmann remains alone in her response .
catholic and state organizations , while offering their unconditional help in clarifying the situation , have yet to make formal apologies to the estimated 500,000 to 800,000 adults who spent their childhood and / or adolescence in institutionalized homes between 1945 and 1975 . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw 's daniel scheschkewitz says the two-pronged approach is the only way to get the country on track . afghanistan is teetering on the edge of collapse .
that 's the opinion of all military leaders , reconstruction workers and informed politicians who have visited the country in recent months .
the taliban has regrouped and has extended its influence from the south of afghanistan to the north and west .
troops of the multinational nato-led isaf -lrb- international security and assistance force -rrb- force , including german soldiers , have increasingly come under attacks by insurgent groups .
aid workers have been leaving the region due to the worsening security situation .
at the same time , afghan president hamid karzai has failed to extend his centralized rule to the whole country .
the drug trade continues to flourish , providing a source of finance for the taliban and islamist terrorism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel scheschkewitz nato 's top commander , general john craddock , has for months been urging that the afghanistan force needs to be bolstered by a further 20,000 soldiers .
this week nato sources said the german army plans to send an additional 600 soldiers to afghanistan 's north where german troops are already stationed .
raising the number of troops makes sense provided it 's meant to provide military cover for the civilian reconstruction of the country and not the senseless bombing of alleged taliban targets which usually kills innocent civilians .
human rights groups say over 1,000 civilians were killed last year alone as a result of such attacks by international troops .
a similar number of people were killed in suicide bombings carried out by islamist terrorists .
that leads to an escalating spiral of violence in the region which can only be stopped if significant progress is made in rebuilding afghanistan .
any attempt at reconstruction however remains piecemeal if there is no security , law and order .
efforts to create institutions such as a justice system and a functioning afghan police force , which has been ignored for too long , need to be urgently stepped up .
the military , which is responsible for maintaining order , needs to have an afghan face .
the german army is already making a valuable contribution by training the ana or afghan national army .
but the army still rarely patrols remote parts of the country where former warlords and the taliban seal drug deals and the opium harvest continues unchecked .
the planned deployment of nato reconnaissance planes , in which germany will contribute a third of the needed personnel , could help to tackle the problem .
in the past , the us successfully used such planes to fight drug smuggling in colombia .
the problem is that these aircraft can also be used to coordinate combat operations .
it would be good if a german parliamentary mandate , which is needed for such operations , would be limited to using the reconnaissance jets only for patrolling purposes .
it would thus prevent innocent civilians from being killed during the deployment of the spy planes and german soldiers being involved in their deaths .
as opposed to former us president george w. bush , afghanistan is a priority for new us president barack obama .
that can only be welcomed .
at the same time , the situation would improve if in addition to raising the number of troops , the quality of the civilian-military engagement were improved .
more soldiers alone wo n't be able to secure peace .
but a targeted involvement in reconstructing the country just might achieve that .

dw 's daniel scheschkewitz says the two-pronged approach is the only way to get the country on track . afghanistan is teetering on the edge of collapse .
that 's the opinion of all military leaders , reconstruction workers and informed politicians who have visited the country in recent months .
the taliban has regrouped and has extended its influence from the south of afghanistan to the north and west .
troops of the multinational nato-led isaf -lrb- international security and assistance force -rrb- force , including german soldiers , have increasingly come under attacks by insurgent groups .
aid workers have been leaving the region due to the worsening security situation .
at the same time , afghan president hamid karzai has failed to extend his centralized rule to the whole country .
the drug trade continues to flourish , providing a source of finance for the taliban and islamist terrorism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel scheschkewitz nato 's top commander , general john craddock , has for months been urging that the afghanistan force needs to be bolstered by a further 20,000 soldiers .
this week nato sources said the german army plans to send an additional 600 soldiers to afghanistan 's north where german troops are already stationed .
raising the number of troops makes sense provided it 's meant to provide military cover for the civilian reconstruction of the country and not the senseless bombing of alleged taliban targets which usually kills innocent civilians .
human rights groups say over 1,000 civilians were killed last year alone as a result of such attacks by international troops .
a similar number of people were killed in suicide bombings carried out by islamist terrorists .
that leads to an escalating spiral of violence in the region which can only be stopped if significant progress is made in rebuilding afghanistan .
any attempt at reconstruction however remains piecemeal if there is no security , law and order .
efforts to create institutions such as a justice system and a functioning afghan police force , which has been ignored for too long , need to be urgently stepped up .
the military , which is responsible for maintaining order , needs to have an afghan face .
the german army is already making a valuable contribution by training the ana or afghan national army .
but the army still rarely patrols remote parts of the country where former warlords and the taliban seal drug deals and the opium harvest continues unchecked .
the planned deployment of nato reconnaissance planes , in which germany will contribute a third of the needed personnel , could help to tackle the problem .
in the past , the us successfully used such planes to fight drug smuggling in colombia .
the problem is that these aircraft can also be used to coordinate combat operations .
it would be good if a german parliamentary mandate , which is needed for such operations , would be limited to using the reconnaissance jets only for patrolling purposes .
it would thus prevent innocent civilians from being killed during the deployment of the spy planes and german soldiers being involved in their deaths .
as opposed to former us president george w. bush , afghanistan is a priority for new us president barack obama .
that can only be welcomed .
at the same time , the situation would improve if in addition to raising the number of troops , the quality of the civilian-military engagement were improved .
more soldiers alone wo n't be able to secure peace .
but a targeted involvement in reconstructing the country just might achieve that .

keeping alive painful memories some 1.66 million people from nearly 100 countries received compensation ranging from 500 to 7,700 euros from the german fund between 2001 and 2007 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the web site has an international dimension the fund said on the project 's web site , www.zwangsarbeit-archiv.de , that beyond the compensation payouts which ended in 2007 , it remained important to keep alive the memory of forced labor under the nazis for future generations .
" the victims did not want only money that was owed to them - they also wanted to tell about things that no one wanted to hear about for decades , " saathoff said .
the creators of the project say on the web site that most of the interviews were conducted in ukraine , poland and russia .
but the organizers also spoke to survivors in the us , israel and south africa among other countries .
the survivors include prominent personalities such as spanish author jose semprun as well as members of largely forgotten groups of victims such as the roma , according to the portal .
in addition to the testimonies , short biographies of the survivors and in some cases audio interviews , transcripts , photographs and other personal documents are also included .
" victims will get public recognition " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a photo of miroslav d , a former forced laborer under the nazis many of the accounts describe degrading work and living conditions and a life marked by hunger and disease .
felix kolmer , a former slave laborer , said at the news conference on thursday that the online archive would provide increasingly rare personal accounts of the nazi forced labor program to researchers , teachers and students .
" victims will finally get the public recognition and attention for which they have often waited in vain over the last decades , " kolmer , who is also vice president of the international auschwitz committee , a holocaust survivors group , said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 23.01.2009 opinion : afghanistan needs more civilian and military help großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new us president obama is to push international allies to boost their civilian and military engagement in afghanistan .
dw 's daniel scheschkewitz says the two-pronged approach is the only way to get the country on track . afghanistan is teetering on the edge of collapse .
that 's the opinion of all military leaders , reconstruction workers and informed politicians who have visited the country in recent months .
the taliban has regrouped and has extended its influence from the south of afghanistan to the north and west .
troops of the multinational nato-led isaf -lrb- international security and assistance force -rrb- force , including german soldiers , have increasingly come under attacks by insurgent groups .
aid workers have been leaving the region due to the worsening security situation .
at the same time , afghan president hamid karzai has failed to extend his centralized rule to the whole country .
the drug trade continues to flourish , providing a source of finance for the taliban and islamist terrorism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel scheschkewitz nato 's top commander , general john craddock , has for months been urging that the afghanistan force needs to be bolstered by a further 20,000 soldiers .
this week nato sources said the german army plans to send an additional 600 soldiers to afghanistan 's north where german troops are already stationed .
raising the number of troops makes sense provided it 's meant to provide military cover for the civilian reconstruction of the country and not the senseless bombing of alleged taliban targets which usually kills innocent civilians .
human rights groups say over 1,000 civilians were killed last year alone as a result of such attacks by international troops .
a similar number of people were killed in suicide bombings carried out by islamist terrorists .
that leads to an escalating spiral of violence in the region which can only be stopped if significant progress is made in rebuilding afghanistan .
any attempt at reconstruction however remains piecemeal if there is no security , law and order .
efforts to create institutions such as a justice system and a functioning afghan police force , which has been ignored for too long , need to be urgently stepped up .
the military , which is responsible for maintaining order , needs to have an afghan face .
the german army is already making a valuable contribution by training the ana or afghan national army .
but the army still rarely patrols remote parts of the country where former warlords and the taliban seal drug deals and the opium harvest continues unchecked .
the planned deployment of nato reconnaissance planes , in which germany will contribute a third of the needed personnel , could help to tackle the problem .
in the past , the us successfully used such planes to fight drug smuggling in colombia .
the problem is that these aircraft can also be used to coordinate combat operations .
it would be good if a german parliamentary mandate , which is needed for such operations , would be limited to using the reconnaissance jets only for patrolling purposes .
it would thus prevent innocent civilians from being killed during the deployment of the spy planes and german soldiers being involved in their deaths .
as opposed to former us president george w. bush , afghanistan is a priority for new us president barack obama .
that can only be welcomed .
at the same time , the situation would improve if in addition to raising the number of troops , the quality of the civilian-military engagement were improved .
more soldiers alone wo n't be able to secure peace .
but a targeted involvement in reconstructing the country just might achieve that .

" this is not the biggest case in germany 's history , " the prosecution said , " but it has an extraordinary dimension " the search , codenamed " operation susi " , started after the mobile phone of a 33-year-old man was found to contain the telephone numbers of 465 men and women with whom he had exchanged pornographic images of children . around 1000 police were involved in the nationwide search tuesday and wednesday , seizing telephones , computers , videos and storage devices such as hard drives , usb sticks and cds . no arrests so far to date , nobody has been arrested in connection with the raids .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 23.01.2009 opinion : afghanistan needs more civilian and military help großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new us president obama is to push international allies to boost their civilian and military engagement in afghanistan .
dw 's daniel scheschkewitz says the two-pronged approach is the only way to get the country on track . afghanistan is teetering on the edge of collapse .
that 's the opinion of all military leaders , reconstruction workers and informed politicians who have visited the country in recent months .
the taliban has regrouped and has extended its influence from the south of afghanistan to the north and west .
troops of the multinational nato-led isaf -lrb- international security and assistance force -rrb- force , including german soldiers , have increasingly come under attacks by insurgent groups .
aid workers have been leaving the region due to the worsening security situation .
at the same time , afghan president hamid karzai has failed to extend his centralized rule to the whole country .
the drug trade continues to flourish , providing a source of finance for the taliban and islamist terrorism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel scheschkewitz nato 's top commander , general john craddock , has for months been urging that the afghanistan force needs to be bolstered by a further 20,000 soldiers .
this week nato sources said the german army plans to send an additional 600 soldiers to afghanistan 's north where german troops are already stationed .
raising the number of troops makes sense provided it 's meant to provide military cover for the civilian reconstruction of the country and not the senseless bombing of alleged taliban targets which usually kills innocent civilians .
human rights groups say over 1,000 civilians were killed last year alone as a result of such attacks by international troops .
a similar number of people were killed in suicide bombings carried out by islamist terrorists .
that leads to an escalating spiral of violence in the region which can only be stopped if significant progress is made in rebuilding afghanistan .
any attempt at reconstruction however remains piecemeal if there is no security , law and order .
efforts to create institutions such as a justice system and a functioning afghan police force , which has been ignored for too long , need to be urgently stepped up .
the military , which is responsible for maintaining order , needs to have an afghan face .
the german army is already making a valuable contribution by training the ana or afghan national army .
but the army still rarely patrols remote parts of the country where former warlords and the taliban seal drug deals and the opium harvest continues unchecked .
the planned deployment of nato reconnaissance planes , in which germany will contribute a third of the needed personnel , could help to tackle the problem .
in the past , the us successfully used such planes to fight drug smuggling in colombia .
the problem is that these aircraft can also be used to coordinate combat operations .
it would be good if a german parliamentary mandate , which is needed for such operations , would be limited to using the reconnaissance jets only for patrolling purposes .
it would thus prevent innocent civilians from being killed during the deployment of the spy planes and german soldiers being involved in their deaths .
as opposed to former us president george w. bush , afghanistan is a priority for new us president barack obama .
that can only be welcomed .
at the same time , the situation would improve if in addition to raising the number of troops , the quality of the civilian-military engagement were improved .
more soldiers alone wo n't be able to secure peace .
but a targeted involvement in reconstructing the country just might achieve that .

" now that barack obama has announced his intention of shutting the facility down , european union governments are being urged to lend a hand to the new us president by absorbing a portion of guantanamo 's inmates .
as martin schulz , leader of the european parliament 's socialist group , put it thursday : " the obama administration has started on the right foot by announcing the closure within a year of this outrageous detention camp ...
eu governments must now play their part and support president obama 's decision by accepting inmates . "
eu foreign ministers are to talk it over during a meeting monday in brussels .
guantanamo currently holds about 250 detainees , hardly any of which are european .
most of the remaining prisoners come from countries with poor human rights records such as yemen .
if sent home , many would almost certainly face torture and abuse .
us looks to eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama will be hoping europe will lend a hand with guantanamo inmates a senior official in the new obama administration , speaking on condition of anonymity , said that washington is hopeful that other governments will be more " forthcoming " towards helping deal with guantanamo inmates in light of there being a new us president in office .
while europe would in all likelihood be asked to host only a few of those eligible for release , international relations experts say that a positive and unified response from the " old continent " would have significant implications .
in fact , the fate of the men in orange jumpsuits offers european leaders a first opportunity to show that they really do mean it when they profess to seek " a new era in transatlantic relations . "
internal divisions and acrimony , on the other hand , would seriously jeopardize the european honeymoon with obama , even before he starts asking allied governments to contribute more troops to afghanistan .
so far , the omens do n't look good .

the first camp is desolately empty .
in december , portuguese foreign minister luis amado became the first to offer to take some inmates , but only as long as they were deemed harmless and likely to be subject to persecution in their home countries .
since then , france , spain and sweden have said they might be willing to do the same , but only on a " case by case basis . "
the " absolutely not " camp features austria and old bush friends such as poland , which once had a conservative government but is now ruled by the centre-left .

" besides , prisoners from foreign countries who speak exotic languages would be no small challenge for our prison system .
hence i would n't be too eager , " he said .
poland is currently embroiled in a major prison scandal following the suicide of a high-profile convict .
the last thing prime minister donald tusk wants on his mind is more prisoners .
the government in denmark , which like poland 's former administration supported bush 's unpopular war in iraq , is under intense pressure to make amends with obama .
villy sovndal , leader of the opposition socialist people 's party , recently told daily politiken that denmark had a " special responsibility " as a backer of the bush administration 's " war on terror . "
but danish premier anders fogh rasmussen , while claiming he personally tried to convince bush to close guantanamo , says he has no plans to accept any prisoners .

" now that barack obama has announced his intention of shutting the facility down , european union governments are being urged to lend a hand to the new us president by absorbing a portion of guantanamo 's inmates .
as martin schulz , leader of the european parliament 's socialist group , put it thursday : " the obama administration has started on the right foot by announcing the closure within a year of this outrageous detention camp ...
eu governments must now play their part and support president obama 's decision by accepting inmates . "
eu foreign ministers are to talk it over during a meeting monday in brussels .
guantanamo currently holds about 250 detainees , hardly any of which are european .
most of the remaining prisoners come from countries with poor human rights records such as yemen .
if sent home , many would almost certainly face torture and abuse .
us looks to eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama will be hoping europe will lend a hand with guantanamo inmates a senior official in the new obama administration , speaking on condition of anonymity , said that washington is hopeful that other governments will be more " forthcoming " towards helping deal with guantanamo inmates in light of there being a new us president in office .
while europe would in all likelihood be asked to host only a few of those eligible for release , international relations experts say that a positive and unified response from the " old continent " would have significant implications .
in fact , the fate of the men in orange jumpsuits offers european leaders a first opportunity to show that they really do mean it when they profess to seek " a new era in transatlantic relations . "
internal divisions and acrimony , on the other hand , would seriously jeopardize the european honeymoon with obama , even before he starts asking allied governments to contribute more troops to afghanistan .
so far , the omens do n't look good .
portuguese offer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal 's foreign minister luis amado says his country will only take ' harmless ' inmates ahead of monday 's meeting in brussels , eu governments were roughly divided into three camps : those willing to host guantanamo 's lost souls ; those categorically against it ; and those who remain undecided .
the first camp is desolately empty .
in december , portuguese foreign minister luis amado became the first to offer to take some inmates , but only as long as they were deemed harmless and likely to be subject to persecution in their home countries .
since then , france , spain and sweden have said they might be willing to do the same , but only on a " case by case basis . "
the " absolutely not " camp features austria and old bush friends such as poland , which once had a conservative government but is now ruled by the centre-left .
polish , danish reluctance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister donald tusk wants to steer clear of accepting gitmo prisoners in december , current foreign minister radek sikorski said : " guantanamo is n't in poland 's center of attention .
" besides , prisoners from foreign countries who speak exotic languages would be no small challenge for our prison system .
hence i would n't be too eager , " he said .
poland is currently embroiled in a major prison scandal following the suicide of a high-profile convict .
the last thing prime minister donald tusk wants on his mind is more prisoners .
the government in denmark , which like poland 's former administration supported bush 's unpopular war in iraq , is under intense pressure to make amends with obama .
villy sovndal , leader of the opposition socialist people 's party , recently told daily politiken that denmark had a " special responsibility " as a backer of the bush administration 's " war on terror . "
but danish premier anders fogh rasmussen , while claiming he personally tried to convince bush to close guantanamo , says he has no plans to accept any prisoners .
eu powers ambivalent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier is willing to follow the us lead on gitmo detainees perhaps even more worrying is how undecided two of europe 's heavyweights seem to be .
in britain , plans by foreign minister david miliband to take in guantanamo detainees were reportedly vetoed by the home office on grounds of difficulties with the suspects ' immigration status , housing and benefits .
london has previously taken in british subjects who had been held in guantanamo , but having foreign terror suspects with no links to the uk is a different matter .
in germany , where the governing right-left coalition is set for electoral battle later this year , ministers have been contradicting each other .
while foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , a social democrat , is in favor , interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , a conservative , is against .
the czech presidency of the eu , whose government has still not taken a clear position on the matter , will attempt to forge a common position during monday 's talks in brussels .
a group of human-rights organizations has , meanwhile , written a letter urging eu ministers to " send a common message on their willingness to help close guantanamo and - most important - follow it up with concrete action to find homes for detainees who can not be returned to their countries of origin .

" now that barack obama has announced his intention of shutting the facility down , european union governments are being urged to lend a hand to the new us president by absorbing a portion of guantanamo 's inmates .
as martin schulz , leader of the european parliament 's socialist group , put it thursday : " the obama administration has started on the right foot by announcing the closure within a year of this outrageous detention camp ...
eu governments must now play their part and support president obama 's decision by accepting inmates . "
eu foreign ministers are to talk it over during a meeting monday in brussels .
guantanamo currently holds about 250 detainees , hardly any of which are european .
most of the remaining prisoners come from countries with poor human rights records such as yemen .
if sent home , many would almost certainly face torture and abuse .
us looks to eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama will be hoping europe will lend a hand with guantanamo inmates a senior official in the new obama administration , speaking on condition of anonymity , said that washington is hopeful that other governments will be more " forthcoming " towards helping deal with guantanamo inmates in light of there being a new us president in office .
while europe would in all likelihood be asked to host only a few of those eligible for release , international relations experts say that a positive and unified response from the " old continent " would have significant implications .
in fact , the fate of the men in orange jumpsuits offers european leaders a first opportunity to show that they really do mean it when they profess to seek " a new era in transatlantic relations . "
internal divisions and acrimony , on the other hand , would seriously jeopardize the european honeymoon with obama , even before he starts asking allied governments to contribute more troops to afghanistan .
so far , the omens do n't look good .
portuguese offer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal 's foreign minister luis amado says his country will only take ' harmless ' inmates ahead of monday 's meeting in brussels , eu governments were roughly divided into three camps : those willing to host guantanamo 's lost souls ; those categorically against it ; and those who remain undecided .
the first camp is desolately empty .
in december , portuguese foreign minister luis amado became the first to offer to take some inmates , but only as long as they were deemed harmless and likely to be subject to persecution in their home countries .
since then , france , spain and sweden have said they might be willing to do the same , but only on a " case by case basis . "
the " absolutely not " camp features austria and old bush friends such as poland , which once had a conservative government but is now ruled by the centre-left .
polish , danish reluctance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister donald tusk wants to steer clear of accepting gitmo prisoners in december , current foreign minister radek sikorski said : " guantanamo is n't in poland 's center of attention .
" besides , prisoners from foreign countries who speak exotic languages would be no small challenge for our prison system .
hence i would n't be too eager , " he said .
poland is currently embroiled in a major prison scandal following the suicide of a high-profile convict .
the last thing prime minister donald tusk wants on his mind is more prisoners .
the government in denmark , which like poland 's former administration supported bush 's unpopular war in iraq , is under intense pressure to make amends with obama .
villy sovndal , leader of the opposition socialist people 's party , recently told daily politiken that denmark had a " special responsibility " as a backer of the bush administration 's " war on terror . "
but danish premier anders fogh rasmussen , while claiming he personally tried to convince bush to close guantanamo , says he has no plans to accept any prisoners .
eu powers ambivalent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier is willing to follow the us lead on gitmo detainees perhaps even more worrying is how undecided two of europe 's heavyweights seem to be .
in britain , plans by foreign minister david miliband to take in guantanamo detainees were reportedly vetoed by the home office on grounds of difficulties with the suspects ' immigration status , housing and benefits .
london has previously taken in british subjects who had been held in guantanamo , but having foreign terror suspects with no links to the uk is a different matter .

dw 's daniel scheschkewitz says the two-pronged approach is the only way to get the country on track . afghanistan is teetering on the edge of collapse .
that 's the opinion of all military leaders , reconstruction workers and informed politicians who have visited the country in recent months .
the taliban has regrouped and has extended its influence from the south of afghanistan to the north and west .
troops of the multinational nato-led isaf -lrb- international security and assistance force -rrb- force , including german soldiers , have increasingly come under attacks by insurgent groups .
aid workers have been leaving the region due to the worsening security situation .
at the same time , afghan president hamid karzai has failed to extend his centralized rule to the whole country .
the drug trade continues to flourish , providing a source of finance for the taliban and islamist terrorism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel scheschkewitz nato 's top commander , general john craddock , has for months been urging that the afghanistan force needs to be bolstered by a further 20,000 soldiers .
this week nato sources said the german army plans to send an additional 600 soldiers to afghanistan 's north where german troops are already stationed .
raising the number of troops makes sense provided it 's meant to provide military cover for the civilian reconstruction of the country and not the senseless bombing of alleged taliban targets which usually kills innocent civilians .
human rights groups say over 1,000 civilians were killed last year alone as a result of such attacks by international troops .
a similar number of people were killed in suicide bombings carried out by islamist terrorists .
that leads to an escalating spiral of violence in the region which can only be stopped if significant progress is made in rebuilding afghanistan .
any attempt at reconstruction however remains piecemeal if there is no security , law and order .
efforts to create institutions such as a justice system and a functioning afghan police force , which has been ignored for too long , need to be urgently stepped up .
the military , which is responsible for maintaining order , needs to have an afghan face .
the german army is already making a valuable contribution by training the ana or afghan national army .
but the army still rarely patrols remote parts of the country where former warlords and the taliban seal drug deals and the opium harvest continues unchecked .
the planned deployment of nato reconnaissance planes , in which germany will contribute a third of the needed personnel , could help to tackle the problem .
in the past , the us successfully used such planes to fight drug smuggling in colombia .
the problem is that these aircraft can also be used to coordinate combat operations .
it would be good if a german parliamentary mandate , which is needed for such operations , would be limited to using the reconnaissance jets only for patrolling purposes .
it would thus prevent innocent civilians from being killed during the deployment of the spy planes and german soldiers being involved in their deaths .
as opposed to former us president george w. bush , afghanistan is a priority for new us president barack obama .
that can only be welcomed .
at the same time , the situation would improve if in addition to raising the number of troops , the quality of the civilian-military engagement were improved .
more soldiers alone wo n't be able to secure peace .
but a targeted involvement in reconstructing the country just might achieve that .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 23.01.2009 opinion : afghanistan needs more civilian and military help großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new us president obama is to push international allies to boost their civilian and military engagement in afghanistan .
dw 's daniel scheschkewitz says the two-pronged approach is the only way to get the country on track . afghanistan is teetering on the edge of collapse .
that 's the opinion of all military leaders , reconstruction workers and informed politicians who have visited the country in recent months .
the taliban has regrouped and has extended its influence from the south of afghanistan to the north and west .
troops of the multinational nato-led isaf -lrb- international security and assistance force -rrb- force , including german soldiers , have increasingly come under attacks by insurgent groups .
aid workers have been leaving the region due to the worsening security situation .
at the same time , afghan president hamid karzai has failed to extend his centralized rule to the whole country .
the drug trade continues to flourish , providing a source of finance for the taliban and islamist terrorism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel scheschkewitz nato 's top commander , general john craddock , has for months been urging that the afghanistan force needs to be bolstered by a further 20,000 soldiers .
this week nato sources said the german army plans to send an additional 600 soldiers to afghanistan 's north where german troops are already stationed .
raising the number of troops makes sense provided it 's meant to provide military cover for the civilian reconstruction of the country and not the senseless bombing of alleged taliban targets which usually kills innocent civilians .
human rights groups say over 1,000 civilians were killed last year alone as a result of such attacks by international troops .
a similar number of people were killed in suicide bombings carried out by islamist terrorists .
that leads to an escalating spiral of violence in the region which can only be stopped if significant progress is made in rebuilding afghanistan .
any attempt at reconstruction however remains piecemeal if there is no security , law and order .
efforts to create institutions such as a justice system and a functioning afghan police force , which has been ignored for too long , need to be urgently stepped up .
the military , which is responsible for maintaining order , needs to have an afghan face .
the german army is already making a valuable contribution by training the ana or afghan national army .
but the army still rarely patrols remote parts of the country where former warlords and the taliban seal drug deals and the opium harvest continues unchecked .
the planned deployment of nato reconnaissance planes , in which germany will contribute a third of the needed personnel , could help to tackle the problem .
in the past , the us successfully used such planes to fight drug smuggling in colombia .
the problem is that these aircraft can also be used to coordinate combat operations .
it would be good if a german parliamentary mandate , which is needed for such operations , would be limited to using the reconnaissance jets only for patrolling purposes .
it would thus prevent innocent civilians from being killed during the deployment of the spy planes and german soldiers being involved in their deaths .
as opposed to former us president george w. bush , afghanistan is a priority for new us president barack obama .
that can only be welcomed .
at the same time , the situation would improve if in addition to raising the number of troops , the quality of the civilian-military engagement were improved .
more soldiers alone wo n't be able to secure peace .
but a targeted involvement in reconstructing the country just might achieve that .

the assembly voted 140-48 for the motion to prod the government into trying to negotiate a new lease of life for two of the four decommissioned soviet-era reactors at the kozloduy power plant .
the 2006 closure of two of the 440-megawatt reactors , considered unsafe by the european union , was one of the conditions bulgaria had to meet to join the bloc in 2007 .
the two other soviet-era reactors had already been switched off in 2002 .
kozloduy , bulgaria 's only nuclear plant , continues to operate on two modern , russian-built 1,000-megawatt reactors .
bulgaria has also revived plans to build another nuclear plant at belene , 100 kilometers downstream on the danube .
friday 's parliamentary decision posited that bulgaria should consider bringing the newer generators back online in cooperation with brussels .

the request comes at a time when the influence that germany and the eu have over israel is viewed as minimal . " the israeli side has itself announced that it will carry out an inquiry into these allegations .
we expect this to occur with the necessary urgency and thoroughness , " foreign ministry spokesman andreas peschke said . peschke however emphasized that now is not the right time for an international , independent probe of the matter .

23 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a vicious cycle : europe finances infrastructure only to have it destroyed although white phosphorus is permitted for creating a smokescreen , it is banned under international law for use near civilians because it can cause severe burns .
according to israeli newspaper haaretz , the country ’ s army has begun an inquiry to determine whether paratroopers used the banned shells close to civilians during the gaza offensive . amesty international has alleged that israel could be guilty of war crimes , saying the use of the shells in civilian areas was " clear and undeniable . " germany ’ s call on israel to conduct the probe comes at a time when european influence over israel is proving itself to be minimal if not obsolete . europe 's dilemma the european union has been frustrated in the past by being forced to stand on the sidelines and watch as building projects they funded in palestine were destroyed by israeli bombs .
the european union has been a major aid partner to palestine , but has very little political influence in the middle east , experts say . but with new us president barack obama signaling that his administration will make the middle east a top foreign policy priority , europe hopes for a greater influence on israel . " the government believes that progress in the middle east is only possible with a strong and sustainable contribution of the united states , " german government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said recently . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 23.01.2009 abused wards of the state demand reparation in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reading was the exception in many institutions scores of children in postwar germany were abused in institutions while wards of the state well into the 1970s .
they now want an apology and compensation .
but the government is sending mixed signals . they were beaten , humiliated , sexually abused and forced to do compulsory labor - while wards of the state .
over half a million children brought up in church and state institutions between 1945 and 1975 suffered this fate in what one survivor called " child welfare hellholes . " " i was beaten and kicked into a cripple while in a home , " said dietmar krone .
" i still suffer from this today . " for 30 years , krone kept his experiences to himself - as did most victims of such institutional abuse .
but when other former wards of the state began publicly calling attention to their plight , the 55-year-old joined them .
he wrote a book about his experiences in an institution in suechteln , today a part of viersen near the dutch border . decades after the fact , victims ' groups are finally supposed to sit down in the next weeks with government , state and church representatives for a round table discussion of the situation .
in december , the german parliament bundestag unanimously passed a recommendation to the government to set up such a panel . a petitions committee had previously recommended such action to the bundestag after two years of deliberation . material compensation the round table is intended to serve as a platform for all parties to clarify the background and consequences for victims .
this includes rehabilitation possibilities , psychological support and compensation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : play time , if any , was limited " we 'd like some form of material compensation , " said hans-siegfried wiegand , head of the german association of former institutionalized wards of the state verein ehemaliger heimkinder -lrb- veh -rrb- .
he said many children were forced to compulsory labor during their time in these homes . " we are talking about 10 to 12 hours a day of hard labor for which they received no noticeable , if any , pay , " wiegand said .
" the institutions themselves , as well as companies such as braun and miele , profited from this . " since these adolescents were forced to work , they were refused schooling or vocational training . " the director at my institution told me when i arrived : ' there 's no school instruction here , we just need nimble workers ' , " krone said .
" two hours later , i was sitting at one of the workbenches . "
he received monthly wages of 7.20 deutsche marks -lrb- 3.60 euros , $ 4.75 -rrb- . " and if you made an error , there were deductions - and you were beaten or thrown into a dark cell , " krone said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few children in homes were able to take field trips in addition , the work these adolescents did was not officially recognized and therefore not credited in their pensions . " ironically enough , only voluntary work can be considered for pension benefits - and this was n't voluntary , " wiegand said .
he said many former wards of the state , who are today between 50 and 70 years of age , are financially struggling due to their past . " many are ailing or very ill , either physically or mentally , " wiegand said .
" most are poor as a result of their lives , for example by going into early retirement .
they did n't have the strength anymore to continue working . " mental compensation in addition to financial compensation , wiegand said it would mean a lot to these victims to receive an " explicit recognition " of their suffering .
krone said an official apology would make a difference to him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the catholic church has yet to apologize for its past " it would restore my sense of honor and dignity , " said krone .
but the regional authority responsible for his case has yet to do so , he said . " the word apology does n't cross their lips , " krone said .
" they ca n't apologize ; that would be a confession of their conduct . " round table the petitions committee 's recommendation had recognized " injustice and suffering " and " regretted this deeply . "
yet a dispute has arisen on several points after german family minister ursula von der leyen presented a counter draft of necessary action . " she up front decided to rule out certain aspects , " wiegand said .
this included setting up a contact point for victims and eliminating a compensation fund . " the minister did so without consulting us at all and these decisions are actually the task of the round table , " wiegand said .
" we ca n't put up with this . " but the ministry contradicted these statements .
press officer marc kinert said the ministry had not ruled out anything ahead of time , but rather would leave that up to the discussions at the round table . " there will be open-ended negotiations on possible compensation payments at that time , " kinert said . protestant church apologizes the protestant church in germany is the only organization to take responsibility for its past .
hanover 's regional bishop margot kaessmann earlier this month officially apologized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bishop kaessmann has been straightforward in taking responsibility for the church 's past " i can say publicly that i apologize , " kaessmann told german television ndr .
" but i would say even more : i am ashamed that these things occurred in our institutions and that children were truly broken in their wills and their dignity hurt to such an extent . " kaessmann said she welcomed the parliamentary decision to set up a round table .
she said she supported the idea of a compensation fund . " i personally think that we have to talk about compensation for people who were forced to compulsory labor in these institutions without being paid and are in dire situations today , " she said .
she said it was also necessary to discuss therapeutic support to help former state wards process and deal with their pasts . but kaessmann remains alone in her response .
catholic and state organizations , while offering their unconditional help in clarifying the situation , have yet to make formal apologies to the estimated 500,000 to 800,000 adults who spent their childhood and / or adolescence in institutionalized homes between 1945 and 1975 . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 23.01.2009 abused wards of the state demand reparation in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reading was the exception in many institutions scores of children in postwar germany were abused in institutions while wards of the state well into the 1970s .
they now want an apology and compensation .
but the government is sending mixed signals . they were beaten , humiliated , sexually abused and forced to do compulsory labor - while wards of the state .
over half a million children brought up in church and state institutions between 1945 and 1975 suffered this fate in what one survivor called " child welfare hellholes . " " i was beaten and kicked into a cripple while in a home , " said dietmar krone .
" i still suffer from this today . " for 30 years , krone kept his experiences to himself - as did most victims of such institutional abuse .
but when other former wards of the state began publicly calling attention to their plight , the 55-year-old joined them .
he wrote a book about his experiences in an institution in suechteln , today a part of viersen near the dutch border . decades after the fact , victims ' groups are finally supposed to sit down in the next weeks with government , state and church representatives for a round table discussion of the situation .
in december , the german parliament bundestag unanimously passed a recommendation to the government to set up such a panel . a petitions committee had previously recommended such action to the bundestag after two years of deliberation . material compensation the round table is intended to serve as a platform for all parties to clarify the background and consequences for victims .
this includes rehabilitation possibilities , psychological support and compensation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : play time , if any , was limited " we 'd like some form of material compensation , " said hans-siegfried wiegand , head of the german association of former institutionalized wards of the state verein ehemaliger heimkinder -lrb- veh -rrb- .
he said many children were forced to compulsory labor during their time in these homes . " we are talking about 10 to 12 hours a day of hard labor for which they received no noticeable , if any , pay , " wiegand said .
" the institutions themselves , as well as companies such as braun and miele , profited from this . " since these adolescents were forced to work , they were refused schooling or vocational training . " the director at my institution told me when i arrived : ' there 's no school instruction here , we just need nimble workers ' , " krone said .
" two hours later , i was sitting at one of the workbenches . "
he received monthly wages of 7.20 deutsche marks -lrb- 3.60 euros , $ 4.75 -rrb- . " and if you made an error , there were deductions - and you were beaten or thrown into a dark cell , " krone said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few children in homes were able to take field trips in addition , the work these adolescents did was not officially recognized and therefore not credited in their pensions . " ironically enough , only voluntary work can be considered for pension benefits - and this was n't voluntary , " wiegand said .
he said many former wards of the state , who are today between 50 and 70 years of age , are financially struggling due to their past . " many are ailing or very ill , either physically or mentally , " wiegand said .
" most are poor as a result of their lives , for example by going into early retirement .
they did n't have the strength anymore to continue working . " mental compensation in addition to financial compensation , wiegand said it would mean a lot to these victims to receive an " explicit recognition " of their suffering .
krone said an official apology would make a difference to him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the catholic church has yet to apologize for its past " it would restore my sense of honor and dignity , " said krone .
but the regional authority responsible for his case has yet to do so , he said . " the word apology does n't cross their lips , " krone said .
" they ca n't apologize ; that would be a confession of their conduct . " round table the petitions committee 's recommendation had recognized " injustice and suffering " and " regretted this deeply . "
yet a dispute has arisen on several points after german family minister ursula von der leyen presented a counter draft of necessary action . " she up front decided to rule out certain aspects , " wiegand said .
this included setting up a contact point for victims and eliminating a compensation fund . " the minister did so without consulting us at all and these decisions are actually the task of the round table , " wiegand said .
" we ca n't put up with this . " but the ministry contradicted these statements .
press officer marc kinert said the ministry had not ruled out anything ahead of time , but rather would leave that up to the discussions at the round table . " there will be open-ended negotiations on possible compensation payments at that time , " kinert said . protestant church apologizes the protestant church in germany is the only organization to take responsibility for its past .
hanover 's regional bishop margot kaessmann earlier this month officially apologized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bishop kaessmann has been straightforward in taking responsibility for the church 's past " i can say publicly that i apologize , " kaessmann told german television ndr .
" but i would say even more : i am ashamed that these things occurred in our institutions and that children were truly broken in their wills and their dignity hurt to such an extent . " kaessmann said she welcomed the parliamentary decision to set up a round table .
she said she supported the idea of a compensation fund . " i personally think that we have to talk about compensation for people who were forced to compulsory labor in these institutions without being paid and are in dire situations today , " she said .
she said it was also necessary to discuss therapeutic support to help former state wards process and deal with their pasts . but kaessmann remains alone in her response .
catholic and state organizations , while offering their unconditional help in clarifying the situation , have yet to make formal apologies to the estimated 500,000 to 800,000 adults who spent their childhood and / or adolescence in institutionalized homes between 1945 and 1975 . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 23.01.2009 abused wards of the state demand reparation in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reading was the exception in many institutions scores of children in postwar germany were abused in institutions while wards of the state well into the 1970s .
they now want an apology and compensation .
but the government is sending mixed signals . they were beaten , humiliated , sexually abused and forced to do compulsory labor - while wards of the state .
over half a million children brought up in church and state institutions between 1945 and 1975 suffered this fate in what one survivor called " child welfare hellholes . " " i was beaten and kicked into a cripple while in a home , " said dietmar krone .
" i still suffer from this today . " for 30 years , krone kept his experiences to himself - as did most victims of such institutional abuse .
but when other former wards of the state began publicly calling attention to their plight , the 55-year-old joined them .
he wrote a book about his experiences in an institution in suechteln , today a part of viersen near the dutch border . decades after the fact , victims ' groups are finally supposed to sit down in the next weeks with government , state and church representatives for a round table discussion of the situation .
in december , the german parliament bundestag unanimously passed a recommendation to the government to set up such a panel . a petitions committee had previously recommended such action to the bundestag after two years of deliberation . material compensation the round table is intended to serve as a platform for all parties to clarify the background and consequences for victims .
this includes rehabilitation possibilities , psychological support and compensation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : play time , if any , was limited " we 'd like some form of material compensation , " said hans-siegfried wiegand , head of the german association of former institutionalized wards of the state verein ehemaliger heimkinder -lrb- veh -rrb- .
he said many children were forced to compulsory labor during their time in these homes . " we are talking about 10 to 12 hours a day of hard labor for which they received no noticeable , if any , pay , " wiegand said .
" the institutions themselves , as well as companies such as braun and miele , profited from this . " since these adolescents were forced to work , they were refused schooling or vocational training . " the director at my institution told me when i arrived : ' there 's no school instruction here , we just need nimble workers ' , " krone said .
" two hours later , i was sitting at one of the workbenches . "
he received monthly wages of 7.20 deutsche marks -lrb- 3.60 euros , $ 4.75 -rrb- . " and if you made an error , there were deductions - and you were beaten or thrown into a dark cell , " krone said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few children in homes were able to take field trips in addition , the work these adolescents did was not officially recognized and therefore not credited in their pensions . " ironically enough , only voluntary work can be considered for pension benefits - and this was n't voluntary , " wiegand said .
he said many former wards of the state , who are today between 50 and 70 years of age , are financially struggling due to their past . " many are ailing or very ill , either physically or mentally , " wiegand said .
" most are poor as a result of their lives , for example by going into early retirement .
they did n't have the strength anymore to continue working . " mental compensation in addition to financial compensation , wiegand said it would mean a lot to these victims to receive an " explicit recognition " of their suffering .
krone said an official apology would make a difference to him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the catholic church has yet to apologize for its past " it would restore my sense of honor and dignity , " said krone .
but the regional authority responsible for his case has yet to do so , he said . " the word apology does n't cross their lips , " krone said .
" they ca n't apologize ; that would be a confession of their conduct . " round table the petitions committee 's recommendation had recognized " injustice and suffering " and " regretted this deeply . "
yet a dispute has arisen on several points after german family minister ursula von der leyen presented a counter draft of necessary action . " she up front decided to rule out certain aspects , " wiegand said .
this included setting up a contact point for victims and eliminating a compensation fund . " the minister did so without consulting us at all and these decisions are actually the task of the round table , " wiegand said .
" we ca n't put up with this . " but the ministry contradicted these statements .
press officer marc kinert said the ministry had not ruled out anything ahead of time , but rather would leave that up to the discussions at the round table . " there will be open-ended negotiations on possible compensation payments at that time , " kinert said . protestant church apologizes the protestant church in germany is the only organization to take responsibility for its past .
hanover 's regional bishop margot kaessmann earlier this month officially apologized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bishop kaessmann has been straightforward in taking responsibility for the church 's past " i can say publicly that i apologize , " kaessmann told german television ndr .
" but i would say even more : i am ashamed that these things occurred in our institutions and that children were truly broken in their wills and their dignity hurt to such an extent . " kaessmann said she welcomed the parliamentary decision to set up a round table .
she said she supported the idea of a compensation fund . " i personally think that we have to talk about compensation for people who were forced to compulsory labor in these institutions without being paid and are in dire situations today , " she said .
she said it was also necessary to discuss therapeutic support to help former state wards process and deal with their pasts . but kaessmann remains alone in her response .
catholic and state organizations , while offering their unconditional help in clarifying the situation , have yet to make formal apologies to the estimated 500,000 to 800,000 adults who spent their childhood and / or adolescence in institutionalized homes between 1945 and 1975 . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the latest edition has also enraged jewish groups in the country . the project , which focuses on reprinting newspapers from 1933 to 1945 , is meant to educate germans but has instead sparked outrage from jewish groups and authorities worried about the possible offence to holocaust survivors and the potential misuse of the material by neo-nazis . on thursday , the bavarian finance ministry , which says it holds the rights to all publications from the main nazi publishing house , said it would resort to the courts to stop future papers being published .
it added it was pressing charges against the british publisher , peter mcgee , for copyright infringement . the latest edition of the paper , the voelkischer beobachter -lrb- people 's observer -rrb- , greeted germans at newsstands thursday with a headline proclaiming " huge fire in the reichstag " with a photograph of the reichstag parliament building in flames , seen as a pivotal moment in the rise to power of the nazis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler 's propaganda minister joseph goebbels " murder , terror , fire and destruction : these are the terrible things this fanatical party -lrb- the communists -rrb- leaves behind it , " joseph goebbels writes in the commentary on the first page .

" as a holocaust survivor , these texts are much more to me than just interesting historical documents .
they are part of a harrowing reality that i can still recall , " she said in a commentary on the publishers ' web site .
if people read only the propaganda , she acknowledged , it could be " disastrous . " creators insist on educational value the makers of the project have however rebuffed the criticism , calling it an attack on press freedom . sandra paweronschitz , chief editor of the series , was quoted by news agency afp as saying the argument that the papers could fuel extremist activity was " as short-sighted as it is wrong .

the latest edition has also enraged jewish groups in the country . the project , which focuses on reprinting newspapers from 1933 to 1945 , is meant to educate germans but has instead sparked outrage from jewish groups and authorities worried about the possible offence to holocaust survivors and the potential misuse of the material by neo-nazis . on thursday , the bavarian finance ministry , which says it holds the rights to all publications from the main nazi publishing house , said it would resort to the courts to stop future papers being published .
it added it was pressing charges against the british publisher , peter mcgee , for copyright infringement . the latest edition of the paper , the voelkischer beobachter -lrb- people 's observer -rrb- , greeted germans at newsstands thursday with a headline proclaiming " huge fire in the reichstag " with a photograph of the reichstag parliament building in flames , seen as a pivotal moment in the rise to power of the nazis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler 's propaganda minister joseph goebbels " murder , terror , fire and destruction : these are the terrible things this fanatical party -lrb- the communists -rrb- leaves behind it , " joseph goebbels writes in the commentary on the first page .

the latest edition has also enraged jewish groups in the country . the project , which focuses on reprinting newspapers from 1933 to 1945 , is meant to educate germans but has instead sparked outrage from jewish groups and authorities worried about the possible offence to holocaust survivors and the potential misuse of the material by neo-nazis . on thursday , the bavarian finance ministry , which says it holds the rights to all publications from the main nazi publishing house , said it would resort to the courts to stop future papers being published .
it added it was pressing charges against the british publisher , peter mcgee , for copyright infringement . the latest edition of the paper , the voelkischer beobachter -lrb- people 's observer -rrb- , greeted germans at newsstands thursday with a headline proclaiming " huge fire in the reichstag " with a photograph of the reichstag parliament building in flames , seen as a pivotal moment in the rise to power of the nazis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler 's propaganda minister joseph goebbels " murder , terror , fire and destruction : these are the terrible things this fanatical party -lrb- the communists -rrb- leaves behind it , " joseph goebbels writes in the commentary on the first page .
" we 've had enough , " says the headline .
" now we 're going to take ruthless and dramatic measures . " jewish group slams " hitler sells " concept the project called " zeitungszeugen , " a word play on the german words for " newspaper " and " witness , " is supported by some german historians who have annotated the articles . but the central council of jews in germany said on thursday it backed bavaria 's decision to ban the newspapers , complaining it was " left to complete chance " whether people also read the historical commentary or just the papers in isolation . " this is not what serious political education looks like , " stephan kramer , the general secretary of the organization said in a statement , adding the project seemed to be irresponsibly driven by the motto " hitler sells . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the row over the nazi papers follows a similar spat last year over the republication of hitler 's " mein kampf " charlotte knobloch , president of the central council for jews in germany said it was vital people read the historians ' comments included in the package with the papers . " as a holocaust survivor , these texts are much more to me than just interesting historical documents .
they are part of a harrowing reality that i can still recall , " she said in a commentary on the publishers ' web site .
if people read only the propaganda , she acknowledged , it could be " disastrous . " creators insist on educational value the makers of the project have however rebuffed the criticism , calling it an attack on press freedom . sandra paweronschitz , chief editor of the series , was quoted by news agency afp as saying the argument that the papers could fuel extremist activity was " as short-sighted as it is wrong . " she pointed out that the series was accompanied by commentary from leading historians putting the papers in their proper historical context . " we will fight this attack on the freedom of the press with all legal means - if necessary not only in civil courts but also before the federal constitutional court , " she said . several german historians have also defended the project . wolfgang benz , a professor at the berlin technical university 's center for research on anti-semitism , told news agency dpa recently that the edited copies were more educational and less harmful than german television history programs about the nazis , which include nazi film footage and images of swastikas . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the latest edition has also enraged jewish groups in the country . the project , which focuses on reprinting newspapers from 1933 to 1945 , is meant to educate germans but has instead sparked outrage from jewish groups and authorities worried about the possible offence to holocaust survivors and the potential misuse of the material by neo-nazis . on thursday , the bavarian finance ministry , which says it holds the rights to all publications from the main nazi publishing house , said it would resort to the courts to stop future papers being published .
it added it was pressing charges against the british publisher , peter mcgee , for copyright infringement . the latest edition of the paper , the voelkischer beobachter -lrb- people 's observer -rrb- , greeted germans at newsstands thursday with a headline proclaiming " huge fire in the reichstag " with a photograph of the reichstag parliament building in flames , seen as a pivotal moment in the rise to power of the nazis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler 's propaganda minister joseph goebbels " murder , terror , fire and destruction : these are the terrible things this fanatical party -lrb- the communists -rrb- leaves behind it , " joseph goebbels writes in the commentary on the first page .

the latest edition has also enraged jewish groups in the country . the project , which focuses on reprinting newspapers from 1933 to 1945 , is meant to educate germans but has instead sparked outrage from jewish groups and authorities worried about the possible offence to holocaust survivors and the potential misuse of the material by neo-nazis . on thursday , the bavarian finance ministry , which says it holds the rights to all publications from the main nazi publishing house , said it would resort to the courts to stop future papers being published .
it added it was pressing charges against the british publisher , peter mcgee , for copyright infringement . the latest edition of the paper , the voelkischer beobachter -lrb- people 's observer -rrb- , greeted germans at newsstands thursday with a headline proclaiming " huge fire in the reichstag " with a photograph of the reichstag parliament building in flames , seen as a pivotal moment in the rise to power of the nazis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler 's propaganda minister joseph goebbels " murder , terror , fire and destruction : these are the terrible things this fanatical party -lrb- the communists -rrb- leaves behind it , " joseph goebbels writes in the commentary on the first page .
" we 've had enough , " says the headline .
" now we 're going to take ruthless and dramatic measures . " jewish group slams " hitler sells " concept the project called " zeitungszeugen , " a word play on the german words for " newspaper " and " witness , " is supported by some german historians who have annotated the articles . but the central council of jews in germany said on thursday it backed bavaria 's decision to ban the newspapers , complaining it was " left to complete chance " whether people also read the historical commentary or just the papers in isolation . " this is not what serious political education looks like , " stephan kramer , the general secretary of the organization said in a statement , adding the project seemed to be irresponsibly driven by the motto " hitler sells . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the row over the nazi papers follows a similar spat last year over the republication of hitler 's " mein kampf " charlotte knobloch , president of the central council for jews in germany said it was vital people read the historians ' comments included in the package with the papers . " as a holocaust survivor , these texts are much more to me than just interesting historical documents .
they are part of a harrowing reality that i can still recall , " she said in a commentary on the publishers ' web site .
if people read only the propaganda , she acknowledged , it could be " disastrous . " creators insist on educational value the makers of the project have however rebuffed the criticism , calling it an attack on press freedom . sandra paweronschitz , chief editor of the series , was quoted by news agency afp as saying the argument that the papers could fuel extremist activity was " as short-sighted as it is wrong . " she pointed out that the series was accompanied by commentary from leading historians putting the papers in their proper historical context . " we will fight this attack on the freedom of the press with all legal means - if necessary not only in civil courts but also before the federal constitutional court , " she said . several german historians have also defended the project . wolfgang benz , a professor at the berlin technical university 's center for research on anti-semitism , told news agency dpa recently that the edited copies were more educational and less harmful than german television history programs about the nazis , which include nazi film footage and images of swastikas . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 23.01.2009 opinion : afghanistan needs more civilian and military help großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new us president obama is to push international allies to boost their civilian and military engagement in afghanistan .
dw 's daniel scheschkewitz says the two-pronged approach is the only way to get the country on track . afghanistan is teetering on the edge of collapse .
that 's the opinion of all military leaders , reconstruction workers and informed politicians who have visited the country in recent months .
the taliban has regrouped and has extended its influence from the south of afghanistan to the north and west .
troops of the multinational nato-led isaf -lrb- international security and assistance force -rrb- force , including german soldiers , have increasingly come under attacks by insurgent groups .
aid workers have been leaving the region due to the worsening security situation .
at the same time , afghan president hamid karzai has failed to extend his centralized rule to the whole country .
the drug trade continues to flourish , providing a source of finance for the taliban and islamist terrorism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel scheschkewitz nato 's top commander , general john craddock , has for months been urging that the afghanistan force needs to be bolstered by a further 20,000 soldiers .
this week nato sources said the german army plans to send an additional 600 soldiers to afghanistan 's north where german troops are already stationed .
raising the number of troops makes sense provided it 's meant to provide military cover for the civilian reconstruction of the country and not the senseless bombing of alleged taliban targets which usually kills innocent civilians .
human rights groups say over 1,000 civilians were killed last year alone as a result of such attacks by international troops .
a similar number of people were killed in suicide bombings carried out by islamist terrorists .
that leads to an escalating spiral of violence in the region which can only be stopped if significant progress is made in rebuilding afghanistan .
any attempt at reconstruction however remains piecemeal if there is no security , law and order .
efforts to create institutions such as a justice system and a functioning afghan police force , which has been ignored for too long , need to be urgently stepped up .
the military , which is responsible for maintaining order , needs to have an afghan face .
the german army is already making a valuable contribution by training the ana or afghan national army .
but the army still rarely patrols remote parts of the country where former warlords and the taliban seal drug deals and the opium harvest continues unchecked .
the planned deployment of nato reconnaissance planes , in which germany will contribute a third of the needed personnel , could help to tackle the problem .
in the past , the us successfully used such planes to fight drug smuggling in colombia .
the problem is that these aircraft can also be used to coordinate combat operations .
it would be good if a german parliamentary mandate , which is needed for such operations , would be limited to using the reconnaissance jets only for patrolling purposes .
it would thus prevent innocent civilians from being killed during the deployment of the spy planes and german soldiers being involved in their deaths .
as opposed to former us president george w. bush , afghanistan is a priority for new us president barack obama .
that can only be welcomed .
at the same time , the situation would improve if in addition to raising the number of troops , the quality of the civilian-military engagement were improved .
more soldiers alone wo n't be able to secure peace .
but a targeted involvement in reconstructing the country just might achieve that .

dw 's daniel scheschkewitz says the two-pronged approach is the only way to get the country on track . afghanistan is teetering on the edge of collapse .
that 's the opinion of all military leaders , reconstruction workers and informed politicians who have visited the country in recent months .
the taliban has regrouped and has extended its influence from the south of afghanistan to the north and west .
troops of the multinational nato-led isaf -lrb- international security and assistance force -rrb- force , including german soldiers , have increasingly come under attacks by insurgent groups .
aid workers have been leaving the region due to the worsening security situation .
at the same time , afghan president hamid karzai has failed to extend his centralized rule to the whole country .
the drug trade continues to flourish , providing a source of finance for the taliban and islamist terrorism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel scheschkewitz nato 's top commander , general john craddock , has for months been urging that the afghanistan force needs to be bolstered by a further 20,000 soldiers .
this week nato sources said the german army plans to send an additional 600 soldiers to afghanistan 's north where german troops are already stationed .
raising the number of troops makes sense provided it 's meant to provide military cover for the civilian reconstruction of the country and not the senseless bombing of alleged taliban targets which usually kills innocent civilians .
human rights groups say over 1,000 civilians were killed last year alone as a result of such attacks by international troops .
a similar number of people were killed in suicide bombings carried out by islamist terrorists .
that leads to an escalating spiral of violence in the region which can only be stopped if significant progress is made in rebuilding afghanistan .
any attempt at reconstruction however remains piecemeal if there is no security , law and order .
efforts to create institutions such as a justice system and a functioning afghan police force , which has been ignored for too long , need to be urgently stepped up .
the military , which is responsible for maintaining order , needs to have an afghan face .
the german army is already making a valuable contribution by training the ana or afghan national army .
but the army still rarely patrols remote parts of the country where former warlords and the taliban seal drug deals and the opium harvest continues unchecked .
the planned deployment of nato reconnaissance planes , in which germany will contribute a third of the needed personnel , could help to tackle the problem .
in the past , the us successfully used such planes to fight drug smuggling in colombia .
the problem is that these aircraft can also be used to coordinate combat operations .
it would be good if a german parliamentary mandate , which is needed for such operations , would be limited to using the reconnaissance jets only for patrolling purposes .
it would thus prevent innocent civilians from being killed during the deployment of the spy planes and german soldiers being involved in their deaths .
as opposed to former us president george w. bush , afghanistan is a priority for new us president barack obama .
that can only be welcomed .
at the same time , the situation would improve if in addition to raising the number of troops , the quality of the civilian-military engagement were improved .
more soldiers alone wo n't be able to secure peace .
but a targeted involvement in reconstructing the country just might achieve that .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 23.01.2009 abused wards of the state demand reparation in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reading was the exception in many institutions scores of children in postwar germany were abused in institutions while wards of the state well into the 1970s .
they now want an apology and compensation .
but the government is sending mixed signals . they were beaten , humiliated , sexually abused and forced to do compulsory labor - while wards of the state .
over half a million children brought up in church and state institutions between 1945 and 1975 suffered this fate in what one survivor called " child welfare hellholes . " " i was beaten and kicked into a cripple while in a home , " said dietmar krone .
" i still suffer from this today . " for 30 years , krone kept his experiences to himself - as did most victims of such institutional abuse .
but when other former wards of the state began publicly calling attention to their plight , the 55-year-old joined them .
he wrote a book about his experiences in an institution in suechteln , today a part of viersen near the dutch border . decades after the fact , victims ' groups are finally supposed to sit down in the next weeks with government , state and church representatives for a round table discussion of the situation .
in december , the german parliament bundestag unanimously passed a recommendation to the government to set up such a panel . a petitions committee had previously recommended such action to the bundestag after two years of deliberation . material compensation the round table is intended to serve as a platform for all parties to clarify the background and consequences for victims .
this includes rehabilitation possibilities , psychological support and compensation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : play time , if any , was limited " we 'd like some form of material compensation , " said hans-siegfried wiegand , head of the german association of former institutionalized wards of the state verein ehemaliger heimkinder -lrb- veh -rrb- .
he said many children were forced to compulsory labor during their time in these homes . " we are talking about 10 to 12 hours a day of hard labor for which they received no noticeable , if any , pay , " wiegand said .
" the institutions themselves , as well as companies such as braun and miele , profited from this . " since these adolescents were forced to work , they were refused schooling or vocational training . " the director at my institution told me when i arrived : ' there 's no school instruction here , we just need nimble workers ' , " krone said .
" two hours later , i was sitting at one of the workbenches . "
he received monthly wages of 7.20 deutsche marks -lrb- 3.60 euros , $ 4.75 -rrb- . " and if you made an error , there were deductions - and you were beaten or thrown into a dark cell , " krone said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few children in homes were able to take field trips in addition , the work these adolescents did was not officially recognized and therefore not credited in their pensions . " ironically enough , only voluntary work can be considered for pension benefits - and this was n't voluntary , " wiegand said .
he said many former wards of the state , who are today between 50 and 70 years of age , are financially struggling due to their past . " many are ailing or very ill , either physically or mentally , " wiegand said .
" most are poor as a result of their lives , for example by going into early retirement .
they did n't have the strength anymore to continue working . " mental compensation in addition to financial compensation , wiegand said it would mean a lot to these victims to receive an " explicit recognition " of their suffering .
krone said an official apology would make a difference to him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the catholic church has yet to apologize for its past " it would restore my sense of honor and dignity , " said krone .
but the regional authority responsible for his case has yet to do so , he said . " the word apology does n't cross their lips , " krone said .
" they ca n't apologize ; that would be a confession of their conduct . " round table the petitions committee 's recommendation had recognized " injustice and suffering " and " regretted this deeply . "
yet a dispute has arisen on several points after german family minister ursula von der leyen presented a counter draft of necessary action . " she up front decided to rule out certain aspects , " wiegand said .
this included setting up a contact point for victims and eliminating a compensation fund . " the minister did so without consulting us at all and these decisions are actually the task of the round table , " wiegand said .
" we ca n't put up with this . " but the ministry contradicted these statements .
press officer marc kinert said the ministry had not ruled out anything ahead of time , but rather would leave that up to the discussions at the round table . " there will be open-ended negotiations on possible compensation payments at that time , " kinert said . protestant church apologizes the protestant church in germany is the only organization to take responsibility for its past .
hanover 's regional bishop margot kaessmann earlier this month officially apologized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bishop kaessmann has been straightforward in taking responsibility for the church 's past " i can say publicly that i apologize , " kaessmann told german television ndr .
" but i would say even more : i am ashamed that these things occurred in our institutions and that children were truly broken in their wills and their dignity hurt to such an extent . " kaessmann said she welcomed the parliamentary decision to set up a round table .
she said she supported the idea of a compensation fund . " i personally think that we have to talk about compensation for people who were forced to compulsory labor in these institutions without being paid and are in dire situations today , " she said .
she said it was also necessary to discuss therapeutic support to help former state wards process and deal with their pasts . but kaessmann remains alone in her response .
catholic and state organizations , while offering their unconditional help in clarifying the situation , have yet to make formal apologies to the estimated 500,000 to 800,000 adults who spent their childhood and / or adolescence in institutionalized homes between 1945 and 1975 . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they now want an apology and compensation .
but the government is sending mixed signals . they were beaten , humiliated , sexually abused and forced to do compulsory labor - while wards of the state .
over half a million children brought up in church and state institutions between 1945 and 1975 suffered this fate in what one survivor called " child welfare hellholes . " " i was beaten and kicked into a cripple while in a home , " said dietmar krone .
" i still suffer from this today . " for 30 years , krone kept his experiences to himself - as did most victims of such institutional abuse .
but when other former wards of the state began publicly calling attention to their plight , the 55-year-old joined them .
he wrote a book about his experiences in an institution in suechteln , today a part of viersen near the dutch border . decades after the fact , victims ' groups are finally supposed to sit down in the next weeks with government , state and church representatives for a round table discussion of the situation .
in december , the german parliament bundestag unanimously passed a recommendation to the government to set up such a panel . a petitions committee had previously recommended such action to the bundestag after two years of deliberation . material compensation the round table is intended to serve as a platform for all parties to clarify the background and consequences for victims .
this includes rehabilitation possibilities , psychological support and compensation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : play time , if any , was limited " we 'd like some form of material compensation , " said hans-siegfried wiegand , head of the german association of former institutionalized wards of the state verein ehemaliger heimkinder -lrb- veh -rrb- .
he said many children were forced to compulsory labor during their time in these homes . " we are talking about 10 to 12 hours a day of hard labor for which they received no noticeable , if any , pay , " wiegand said .
" the institutions themselves , as well as companies such as braun and miele , profited from this . " since these adolescents were forced to work , they were refused schooling or vocational training . " the director at my institution told me when i arrived : ' there 's no school instruction here , we just need nimble workers ' , " krone said .
" two hours later , i was sitting at one of the workbenches . "
he received monthly wages of 7.20 deutsche marks -lrb- 3.60 euros , $ 4.75 -rrb- . " and if you made an error , there were deductions - and you were beaten or thrown into a dark cell , " krone said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few children in homes were able to take field trips in addition , the work these adolescents did was not officially recognized and therefore not credited in their pensions . " ironically enough , only voluntary work can be considered for pension benefits - and this was n't voluntary , " wiegand said .
he said many former wards of the state , who are today between 50 and 70 years of age , are financially struggling due to their past . " many are ailing or very ill , either physically or mentally , " wiegand said .
" most are poor as a result of their lives , for example by going into early retirement .
they did n't have the strength anymore to continue working . " mental compensation in addition to financial compensation , wiegand said it would mean a lot to these victims to receive an " explicit recognition " of their suffering .
krone said an official apology would make a difference to him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the catholic church has yet to apologize for its past " it would restore my sense of honor and dignity , " said krone .
but the regional authority responsible for his case has yet to do so , he said . " the word apology does n't cross their lips , " krone said .
" they ca n't apologize ; that would be a confession of their conduct . " round table the petitions committee 's recommendation had recognized " injustice and suffering " and " regretted this deeply . "
yet a dispute has arisen on several points after german family minister ursula von der leyen presented a counter draft of necessary action . " she up front decided to rule out certain aspects , " wiegand said .
this included setting up a contact point for victims and eliminating a compensation fund . " the minister did so without consulting us at all and these decisions are actually the task of the round table , " wiegand said .
" we ca n't put up with this . " but the ministry contradicted these statements .
press officer marc kinert said the ministry had not ruled out anything ahead of time , but rather would leave that up to the discussions at the round table . " there will be open-ended negotiations on possible compensation payments at that time , " kinert said . protestant church apologizes the protestant church in germany is the only organization to take responsibility for its past .
hanover 's regional bishop margot kaessmann earlier this month officially apologized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bishop kaessmann has been straightforward in taking responsibility for the church 's past " i can say publicly that i apologize , " kaessmann told german television ndr .
" but i would say even more : i am ashamed that these things occurred in our institutions and that children were truly broken in their wills and their dignity hurt to such an extent . " kaessmann said she welcomed the parliamentary decision to set up a round table .
she said she supported the idea of a compensation fund . " i personally think that we have to talk about compensation for people who were forced to compulsory labor in these institutions without being paid and are in dire situations today , " she said .
she said it was also necessary to discuss therapeutic support to help former state wards process and deal with their pasts . but kaessmann remains alone in her response .
catholic and state organizations , while offering their unconditional help in clarifying the situation , have yet to make formal apologies to the estimated 500,000 to 800,000 adults who spent their childhood and / or adolescence in institutionalized homes between 1945 and 1975 . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they now want an apology and compensation .
but the government is sending mixed signals . they were beaten , humiliated , sexually abused and forced to do compulsory labor - while wards of the state .
over half a million children brought up in church and state institutions between 1945 and 1975 suffered this fate in what one survivor called " child welfare hellholes . " " i was beaten and kicked into a cripple while in a home , " said dietmar krone .
" i still suffer from this today . " for 30 years , krone kept his experiences to himself - as did most victims of such institutional abuse .
but when other former wards of the state began publicly calling attention to their plight , the 55-year-old joined them .
he wrote a book about his experiences in an institution in suechteln , today a part of viersen near the dutch border . decades after the fact , victims ' groups are finally supposed to sit down in the next weeks with government , state and church representatives for a round table discussion of the situation .
in december , the german parliament bundestag unanimously passed a recommendation to the government to set up such a panel . a petitions committee had previously recommended such action to the bundestag after two years of deliberation . material compensation the round table is intended to serve as a platform for all parties to clarify the background and consequences for victims .
this includes rehabilitation possibilities , psychological support and compensation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : play time , if any , was limited " we 'd like some form of material compensation , " said hans-siegfried wiegand , head of the german association of former institutionalized wards of the state verein ehemaliger heimkinder -lrb- veh -rrb- .
he said many children were forced to compulsory labor during their time in these homes . " we are talking about 10 to 12 hours a day of hard labor for which they received no noticeable , if any , pay , " wiegand said .
" the institutions themselves , as well as companies such as braun and miele , profited from this . " since these adolescents were forced to work , they were refused schooling or vocational training . " the director at my institution told me when i arrived : ' there 's no school instruction here , we just need nimble workers ' , " krone said .
" two hours later , i was sitting at one of the workbenches . "
he received monthly wages of 7.20 deutsche marks -lrb- 3.60 euros , $ 4.75 -rrb- . " and if you made an error , there were deductions - and you were beaten or thrown into a dark cell , " krone said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few children in homes were able to take field trips in addition , the work these adolescents did was not officially recognized and therefore not credited in their pensions . " ironically enough , only voluntary work can be considered for pension benefits - and this was n't voluntary , " wiegand said .
he said many former wards of the state , who are today between 50 and 70 years of age , are financially struggling due to their past . " many are ailing or very ill , either physically or mentally , " wiegand said .
" most are poor as a result of their lives , for example by going into early retirement .
they did n't have the strength anymore to continue working . " mental compensation in addition to financial compensation , wiegand said it would mean a lot to these victims to receive an " explicit recognition " of their suffering .
krone said an official apology would make a difference to him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the catholic church has yet to apologize for its past " it would restore my sense of honor and dignity , " said krone .
but the regional authority responsible for his case has yet to do so , he said . " the word apology does n't cross their lips , " krone said .
" they ca n't apologize ; that would be a confession of their conduct . " round table the petitions committee 's recommendation had recognized " injustice and suffering " and " regretted this deeply . "
yet a dispute has arisen on several points after german family minister ursula von der leyen presented a counter draft of necessary action . " she up front decided to rule out certain aspects , " wiegand said .
this included setting up a contact point for victims and eliminating a compensation fund . " the minister did so without consulting us at all and these decisions are actually the task of the round table , " wiegand said .
" we ca n't put up with this . " but the ministry contradicted these statements .
press officer marc kinert said the ministry had not ruled out anything ahead of time , but rather would leave that up to the discussions at the round table . " there will be open-ended negotiations on possible compensation payments at that time , " kinert said . protestant church apologizes the protestant church in germany is the only organization to take responsibility for its past .
hanover 's regional bishop margot kaessmann earlier this month officially apologized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bishop kaessmann has been straightforward in taking responsibility for the church 's past " i can say publicly that i apologize , " kaessmann told german television ndr .
" but i would say even more : i am ashamed that these things occurred in our institutions and that children were truly broken in their wills and their dignity hurt to such an extent . " kaessmann said she welcomed the parliamentary decision to set up a round table .
she said she supported the idea of a compensation fund . " i personally think that we have to talk about compensation for people who were forced to compulsory labor in these institutions without being paid and are in dire situations today , " she said .
she said it was also necessary to discuss therapeutic support to help former state wards process and deal with their pasts . but kaessmann remains alone in her response .
catholic and state organizations , while offering their unconditional help in clarifying the situation , have yet to make formal apologies to the estimated 500,000 to 800,000 adults who spent their childhood and / or adolescence in institutionalized homes between 1945 and 1975 . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the assembly voted 140-48 for the motion to prod the government into trying to negotiate a new lease of life for two of the four decommissioned soviet-era reactors at the kozloduy power plant .
the 2006 closure of two of the 440-megawatt reactors , considered unsafe by the european union , was one of the conditions bulgaria had to meet to join the bloc in 2007 .
the two other soviet-era reactors had already been switched off in 2002 .
kozloduy , bulgaria 's only nuclear plant , continues to operate on two modern , russian-built 1,000-megawatt reactors .
bulgaria has also revived plans to build another nuclear plant at belene , 100 kilometers downstream on the danube .
friday 's parliamentary decision posited that bulgaria should consider bringing the newer generators back online in cooperation with brussels .
bulgarian officials , including president georgi parvanov , argued for the restart of the old kozloduy installations during the recent russia-ukraine gas row , which hit bulgaria hard causing industry loses in excess of 196 million leva -lrb- $ 130 million -rrb- . dpa news agency -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

we expect this to occur with the necessary urgency and thoroughness , " foreign ministry spokesman andreas peschke said . peschke however emphasized that now is not the right time for an international , independent probe of the matter . " in the current situation we should be focused on turning the very fragile peace there into a sustainable ceasefire ... so that it is possible to give concrete help to people , to organize reconstruction and of course to return to a political process , " he told a regular news conference on friday , jan .

according to israeli newspaper haaretz , the country ’ s army has begun an inquiry to determine whether paratroopers used the banned shells close to civilians during the gaza offensive . amesty international has alleged that israel could be guilty of war crimes , saying the use of the shells in civilian areas was " clear and undeniable . " germany ’ s call on israel to conduct the probe comes at a time when european influence over israel is proving itself to be minimal if not obsolete . europe 's dilemma the european union has been frustrated in the past by being forced to stand on the sidelines and watch as building projects they funded in palestine were destroyed by israeli bombs .
the european union has been a major aid partner to palestine , but has very little political influence in the middle east , experts say . but with new us president barack obama signaling that his administration will make the middle east a top foreign policy priority , europe hopes for a greater influence on israel . " the government believes that progress in the middle east is only possible with a strong and sustainable contribution of the united states , " german government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said recently . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw 's daniel scheschkewitz says the two-pronged approach is the only way to get the country on track . afghanistan is teetering on the edge of collapse .
that 's the opinion of all military leaders , reconstruction workers and informed politicians who have visited the country in recent months .
the taliban has regrouped and has extended its influence from the south of afghanistan to the north and west .
troops of the multinational nato-led isaf -lrb- international security and assistance force -rrb- force , including german soldiers , have increasingly come under attacks by insurgent groups .
aid workers have been leaving the region due to the worsening security situation .
at the same time , afghan president hamid karzai has failed to extend his centralized rule to the whole country .
the drug trade continues to flourish , providing a source of finance for the taliban and islamist terrorism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel scheschkewitz nato 's top commander , general john craddock , has for months been urging that the afghanistan force needs to be bolstered by a further 20,000 soldiers .
this week nato sources said the german army plans to send an additional 600 soldiers to afghanistan 's north where german troops are already stationed .
raising the number of troops makes sense provided it 's meant to provide military cover for the civilian reconstruction of the country and not the senseless bombing of alleged taliban targets which usually kills innocent civilians .
human rights groups say over 1,000 civilians were killed last year alone as a result of such attacks by international troops .
a similar number of people were killed in suicide bombings carried out by islamist terrorists .
that leads to an escalating spiral of violence in the region which can only be stopped if significant progress is made in rebuilding afghanistan .
any attempt at reconstruction however remains piecemeal if there is no security , law and order .
efforts to create institutions such as a justice system and a functioning afghan police force , which has been ignored for too long , need to be urgently stepped up .
the military , which is responsible for maintaining order , needs to have an afghan face .
the german army is already making a valuable contribution by training the ana or afghan national army .
but the army still rarely patrols remote parts of the country where former warlords and the taliban seal drug deals and the opium harvest continues unchecked .
the planned deployment of nato reconnaissance planes , in which germany will contribute a third of the needed personnel , could help to tackle the problem .
in the past , the us successfully used such planes to fight drug smuggling in colombia .
the problem is that these aircraft can also be used to coordinate combat operations .
it would be good if a german parliamentary mandate , which is needed for such operations , would be limited to using the reconnaissance jets only for patrolling purposes .
it would thus prevent innocent civilians from being killed during the deployment of the spy planes and german soldiers being involved in their deaths .
as opposed to former us president george w. bush , afghanistan is a priority for new us president barack obama .
that can only be welcomed .
at the same time , the situation would improve if in addition to raising the number of troops , the quality of the civilian-military engagement were improved .
more soldiers alone wo n't be able to secure peace .
but a targeted involvement in reconstructing the country just might achieve that .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 23.01.2009 opinion : afghanistan needs more civilian and military help großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new us president obama is to push international allies to boost their civilian and military engagement in afghanistan .
dw 's daniel scheschkewitz says the two-pronged approach is the only way to get the country on track . afghanistan is teetering on the edge of collapse .
that 's the opinion of all military leaders , reconstruction workers and informed politicians who have visited the country in recent months .
the taliban has regrouped and has extended its influence from the south of afghanistan to the north and west .
troops of the multinational nato-led isaf -lrb- international security and assistance force -rrb- force , including german soldiers , have increasingly come under attacks by insurgent groups .
aid workers have been leaving the region due to the worsening security situation .
at the same time , afghan president hamid karzai has failed to extend his centralized rule to the whole country .
the drug trade continues to flourish , providing a source of finance for the taliban and islamist terrorism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel scheschkewitz nato 's top commander , general john craddock , has for months been urging that the afghanistan force needs to be bolstered by a further 20,000 soldiers .
this week nato sources said the german army plans to send an additional 600 soldiers to afghanistan 's north where german troops are already stationed .
raising the number of troops makes sense provided it 's meant to provide military cover for the civilian reconstruction of the country and not the senseless bombing of alleged taliban targets which usually kills innocent civilians .
human rights groups say over 1,000 civilians were killed last year alone as a result of such attacks by international troops .
a similar number of people were killed in suicide bombings carried out by islamist terrorists .
that leads to an escalating spiral of violence in the region which can only be stopped if significant progress is made in rebuilding afghanistan .
any attempt at reconstruction however remains piecemeal if there is no security , law and order .
efforts to create institutions such as a justice system and a functioning afghan police force , which has been ignored for too long , need to be urgently stepped up .
the military , which is responsible for maintaining order , needs to have an afghan face .
the german army is already making a valuable contribution by training the ana or afghan national army .
but the army still rarely patrols remote parts of the country where former warlords and the taliban seal drug deals and the opium harvest continues unchecked .
the planned deployment of nato reconnaissance planes , in which germany will contribute a third of the needed personnel , could help to tackle the problem .
in the past , the us successfully used such planes to fight drug smuggling in colombia .
the problem is that these aircraft can also be used to coordinate combat operations .
it would be good if a german parliamentary mandate , which is needed for such operations , would be limited to using the reconnaissance jets only for patrolling purposes .
it would thus prevent innocent civilians from being killed during the deployment of the spy planes and german soldiers being involved in their deaths .
as opposed to former us president george w. bush , afghanistan is a priority for new us president barack obama .
that can only be welcomed .
at the same time , the situation would improve if in addition to raising the number of troops , the quality of the civilian-military engagement were improved .
more soldiers alone wo n't be able to secure peace .
but a targeted involvement in reconstructing the country just might achieve that .

dw 's daniel scheschkewitz says the two-pronged approach is the only way to get the country on track . afghanistan is teetering on the edge of collapse .
that 's the opinion of all military leaders , reconstruction workers and informed politicians who have visited the country in recent months .
the taliban has regrouped and has extended its influence from the south of afghanistan to the north and west .
troops of the multinational nato-led isaf -lrb- international security and assistance force -rrb- force , including german soldiers , have increasingly come under attacks by insurgent groups .
aid workers have been leaving the region due to the worsening security situation .
at the same time , afghan president hamid karzai has failed to extend his centralized rule to the whole country .
the drug trade continues to flourish , providing a source of finance for the taliban and islamist terrorism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel scheschkewitz nato 's top commander , general john craddock , has for months been urging that the afghanistan force needs to be bolstered by a further 20,000 soldiers .
this week nato sources said the german army plans to send an additional 600 soldiers to afghanistan 's north where german troops are already stationed .
raising the number of troops makes sense provided it 's meant to provide military cover for the civilian reconstruction of the country and not the senseless bombing of alleged taliban targets which usually kills innocent civilians .
human rights groups say over 1,000 civilians were killed last year alone as a result of such attacks by international troops .
a similar number of people were killed in suicide bombings carried out by islamist terrorists .
that leads to an escalating spiral of violence in the region which can only be stopped if significant progress is made in rebuilding afghanistan .
any attempt at reconstruction however remains piecemeal if there is no security , law and order .
efforts to create institutions such as a justice system and a functioning afghan police force , which has been ignored for too long , need to be urgently stepped up .
the military , which is responsible for maintaining order , needs to have an afghan face .
the german army is already making a valuable contribution by training the ana or afghan national army .
but the army still rarely patrols remote parts of the country where former warlords and the taliban seal drug deals and the opium harvest continues unchecked .
the planned deployment of nato reconnaissance planes , in which germany will contribute a third of the needed personnel , could help to tackle the problem .
in the past , the us successfully used such planes to fight drug smuggling in colombia .
the problem is that these aircraft can also be used to coordinate combat operations .
it would be good if a german parliamentary mandate , which is needed for such operations , would be limited to using the reconnaissance jets only for patrolling purposes .
it would thus prevent innocent civilians from being killed during the deployment of the spy planes and german soldiers being involved in their deaths .
as opposed to former us president george w. bush , afghanistan is a priority for new us president barack obama .
that can only be welcomed .
at the same time , the situation would improve if in addition to raising the number of troops , the quality of the civilian-military engagement were improved .
more soldiers alone wo n't be able to secure peace .
but a targeted involvement in reconstructing the country just might achieve that .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de team charles ashton covering the latest in news and controversy on germany ´ s political stage has always been something charles has enjoyed .
" people and politics " , produced weekly opposite the german parliament , offers just the right stage for probes into german policy-making – be it through in-depth , incisive reporting or interviews . a whole team of dedicated reporters and authors guarantee the show ´ s journalistic consistency , which is just as reliable as the boats ferrying along the spree river in the background !
the production site – set in the heart of berlin ´ s government and parliamentary district – sets the tone of the programme which also seeks to showcase and explain political developments affecting germany and europe . charles and his colleagues are seasoned watchers when it comes to germany ´ s recent political history .
perhaps the most challenging task was covering the collapse of communism in east germany .
charles vividly remembers reporting live for radio from the roof of a transmission truck next to the berlin wall near the brandenburg gate .
when he asked two nonplussed east german border guards when the gate would be opened to the west they mumbled something about losing the key … with the advent of german unity and now the challenges facing the people and the politicians as they grapple with unemployment and the impact of globalisation , reporting from berlin has become even more multifacetted : a development mirrored in the wide range of dw-tv ´ s programming and political coverage as presented in “ people and politics ” .
on a more personal note : charles ashton was born and bred in london , and he tries bravely to mask his london , cockney accent , though he can ´ t help slipping in a certain ironic accent every now and then ! .
he studied political science and german history at the universities of bonn and freiburg .
travelling is one of his favourite hobbies - and trying to understand the mentality of the berliners as they wrestle courageously with berlin 's role as a major european metropolis .

they now want an apology and compensation .
but the government is sending mixed signals . they were beaten , humiliated , sexually abused and forced to do compulsory labor - while wards of the state .
over half a million children brought up in church and state institutions between 1945 and 1975 suffered this fate in what one survivor called " child welfare hellholes . " " i was beaten and kicked into a cripple while in a home , " said dietmar krone .
" i still suffer from this today . " for 30 years , krone kept his experiences to himself - as did most victims of such institutional abuse .
but when other former wards of the state began publicly calling attention to their plight , the 55-year-old joined them .
he wrote a book about his experiences in an institution in suechteln , today a part of viersen near the dutch border . decades after the fact , victims ' groups are finally supposed to sit down in the next weeks with government , state and church representatives for a round table discussion of the situation .
in december , the german parliament bundestag unanimously passed a recommendation to the government to set up such a panel . a petitions committee had previously recommended such action to the bundestag after two years of deliberation . material compensation the round table is intended to serve as a platform for all parties to clarify the background and consequences for victims .
this includes rehabilitation possibilities , psychological support and compensation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : play time , if any , was limited " we 'd like some form of material compensation , " said hans-siegfried wiegand , head of the german association of former institutionalized wards of the state verein ehemaliger heimkinder -lrb- veh -rrb- .
he said many children were forced to compulsory labor during their time in these homes . " we are talking about 10 to 12 hours a day of hard labor for which they received no noticeable , if any , pay , " wiegand said .
" the institutions themselves , as well as companies such as braun and miele , profited from this . " since these adolescents were forced to work , they were refused schooling or vocational training . " the director at my institution told me when i arrived : ' there 's no school instruction here , we just need nimble workers ' , " krone said .
" two hours later , i was sitting at one of the workbenches . "
he received monthly wages of 7.20 deutsche marks -lrb- 3.60 euros , $ 4.75 -rrb- . " and if you made an error , there were deductions - and you were beaten or thrown into a dark cell , " krone said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few children in homes were able to take field trips in addition , the work these adolescents did was not officially recognized and therefore not credited in their pensions . " ironically enough , only voluntary work can be considered for pension benefits - and this was n't voluntary , " wiegand said .
he said many former wards of the state , who are today between 50 and 70 years of age , are financially struggling due to their past . " many are ailing or very ill , either physically or mentally , " wiegand said .
" most are poor as a result of their lives , for example by going into early retirement .
they did n't have the strength anymore to continue working . " mental compensation in addition to financial compensation , wiegand said it would mean a lot to these victims to receive an " explicit recognition " of their suffering .
krone said an official apology would make a difference to him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the catholic church has yet to apologize for its past " it would restore my sense of honor and dignity , " said krone .
but the regional authority responsible for his case has yet to do so , he said . " the word apology does n't cross their lips , " krone said .
" they ca n't apologize ; that would be a confession of their conduct . " round table the petitions committee 's recommendation had recognized " injustice and suffering " and " regretted this deeply . "
yet a dispute has arisen on several points after german family minister ursula von der leyen presented a counter draft of necessary action . " she up front decided to rule out certain aspects , " wiegand said .
this included setting up a contact point for victims and eliminating a compensation fund . " the minister did so without consulting us at all and these decisions are actually the task of the round table , " wiegand said .
" we ca n't put up with this . " but the ministry contradicted these statements .
press officer marc kinert said the ministry had not ruled out anything ahead of time , but rather would leave that up to the discussions at the round table . " there will be open-ended negotiations on possible compensation payments at that time , " kinert said . protestant church apologizes the protestant church in germany is the only organization to take responsibility for its past .
hanover 's regional bishop margot kaessmann earlier this month officially apologized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bishop kaessmann has been straightforward in taking responsibility for the church 's past " i can say publicly that i apologize , " kaessmann told german television ndr .
" but i would say even more : i am ashamed that these things occurred in our institutions and that children were truly broken in their wills and their dignity hurt to such an extent . " kaessmann said she welcomed the parliamentary decision to set up a round table .
she said she supported the idea of a compensation fund . " i personally think that we have to talk about compensation for people who were forced to compulsory labor in these institutions without being paid and are in dire situations today , " she said .
she said it was also necessary to discuss therapeutic support to help former state wards process and deal with their pasts . but kaessmann remains alone in her response .
catholic and state organizations , while offering their unconditional help in clarifying the situation , have yet to make formal apologies to the estimated 500,000 to 800,000 adults who spent their childhood and / or adolescence in institutionalized homes between 1945 and 1975 . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the latest edition has also enraged jewish groups in the country . the project , which focuses on reprinting newspapers from 1933 to 1945 , is meant to educate germans but has instead sparked outrage from jewish groups and authorities worried about the possible offence to holocaust survivors and the potential misuse of the material by neo-nazis . on thursday , the bavarian finance ministry , which says it holds the rights to all publications from the main nazi publishing house , said it would resort to the courts to stop future papers being published .
it added it was pressing charges against the british publisher , peter mcgee , for copyright infringement . the latest edition of the paper , the voelkischer beobachter -lrb- people 's observer -rrb- , greeted germans at newsstands thursday with a headline proclaiming " huge fire in the reichstag " with a photograph of the reichstag parliament building in flames , seen as a pivotal moment in the rise to power of the nazis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler 's propaganda minister joseph goebbels " murder , terror , fire and destruction : these are the terrible things this fanatical party -lrb- the communists -rrb- leaves behind it , " joseph goebbels writes in the commentary on the first page .
" we 've had enough , " says the headline .
" now we 're going to take ruthless and dramatic measures . " jewish group slams " hitler sells " concept the project called " zeitungszeugen , " a word play on the german words for " newspaper " and " witness , " is supported by some german historians who have annotated the articles . but the central council of jews in germany said on thursday it backed bavaria 's decision to ban the newspapers , complaining it was " left to complete chance " whether people also read the historical commentary or just the papers in isolation . " this is not what serious political education looks like , " stephan kramer , the general secretary of the organization said in a statement , adding the project seemed to be irresponsibly driven by the motto " hitler sells . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the row over the nazi papers follows a similar spat last year over the republication of hitler 's " mein kampf " charlotte knobloch , president of the central council for jews in germany said it was vital people read the historians ' comments included in the package with the papers . " as a holocaust survivor , these texts are much more to me than just interesting historical documents .
they are part of a harrowing reality that i can still recall , " she said in a commentary on the publishers ' web site .
if people read only the propaganda , she acknowledged , it could be " disastrous . " creators insist on educational value the makers of the project have however rebuffed the criticism , calling it an attack on press freedom . sandra paweronschitz , chief editor of the series , was quoted by news agency afp as saying the argument that the papers could fuel extremist activity was " as short-sighted as it is wrong . " she pointed out that the series was accompanied by commentary from leading historians putting the papers in their proper historical context . " we will fight this attack on the freedom of the press with all legal means - if necessary not only in civil courts but also before the federal constitutional court , " she said . several german historians have also defended the project . wolfgang benz , a professor at the berlin technical university 's center for research on anti-semitism , told news agency dpa recently that the edited copies were more educational and less harmful than german television history programs about the nazis , which include nazi film footage and images of swastikas . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

rechristened jobcentre plus six years ago , they 've changed a lot - becoming less daunting , more user-friendly places .
but are they any help ?
the selly oak jobcentre plus , near birmingham , is a good example of the new breed - purpose-built in 2007 , it 's open-plan and airy , with brightly-coloured sofas and computer terminals .
an upbeat jean harborne has worked in job centres for 25 years unemployed people coming here are called " customers " .
" i remember years ago there would be a queue of people waiting to see an advisor , " says jean harborne , who has worked at job centres for 25 years and is the senior operations manager in birmingham .
" now they 're greeted at the door by a floor manager and directed to the right type of person .
we have a database of 400,000 vacancies nationwide that you can access at a jobpoint terminal . "
as the downturn bites , jean says more customers are turning up at job centres .
but she insists she can help .
" just here today i noticed that we 've got 25 banking vacancies in the north of the city , we 've got two large hotels opening this spring creating vacancies , just over the road there 's a large retail outlet opening with 60 vacancies .

graham helton of job centre plus explains what can be done to get you back out into the workforce .
" so it 's a very mixed picture .
there are still definitely jobs to have and people are finding work every day . "
that may be , but this week 's figures showing 1.92m people unemployed tell their own story - and vacancies are at their lowest level since records began in 2001 .
long-term unemployment is a particular problem .
leanne jones works at selly oak as a personal advisor for what she calls " harder to help customers " - 18 to 24 year-olds who have been out of work for six months and people aged 25-plus jobless for 18 months or more .
" today i 've had it specialists , construction workers , drivers , loads .
there 's not one particular sort of person at the moment .
some people have got more barriers to getting a job .
" some might live in a hostel , so their rent is high and they need to look at how much they 'll earn before going into employment .
other people have got children and we need to do a better calculation to ensure they 'll be better off working .

it 's just that they do n't have the jobs that i need . "
actually job centre plus only has around a third of all jobs on the market .
but even if unemployed people are looking for jobs elsewhere , they still need to come here to claim benefits and sign on .
one of these is jay acharya , who says he 's now receiving in jobseekers ' allowance every month pretty much the same amount of money he was paid , after tax , on a daily basis as head of training and development for building materials distributor bcg .
jay acharya says job centres are " not much help " for professional people he drives here every fortnight to sign on - and that 's it .
" they 're not much help for what i would call professional people .
a lot of the positions are for administrative jobs , labour-intensive jobs , but there are not many professional ones there - and when i go for less senior positions i 'm told i 'm overqualified . "
jean harborne argues she does have professional positions .
" there were 900 vacancies today in the birmingham and solihull area , and 25 % were executive and professional posts , " she says .
" there may be less than there have been , but there are still vacancies . "
but clearly , the competition for them is increasing all the time .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- the long search for work bbc news / business graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- business contents : your money -pipe- economy companies 06:03 gmt , friday , 23 january 2009 the long search for work by ray furlong bbc news with britain in recession , the jobless total will keep rising and there will be more business for job centres .
rechristened jobcentre plus six years ago , they 've changed a lot - becoming less daunting , more user-friendly places .
but are they any help ?
the selly oak jobcentre plus , near birmingham , is a good example of the new breed - purpose-built in 2007 , it 's open-plan and airy , with brightly-coloured sofas and computer terminals .
unemployed people coming here are called " customers " .
" i remember years ago there would be a queue of people waiting to see an advisor , " says jean harborne , who has worked at job centres for 25 years and is the senior operations manager in birmingham .
" now they 're greeted at the door by a floor manager and directed to the right type of person .
we have a database of 400,000 vacancies nationwide that you can access at a jobpoint terminal . "
as the downturn bites , jean says more customers are turning up at job centres .
but she insists she can help .
" just here today i noticed that we 've got 25 banking vacancies in the north of the city , we 've got two large hotels opening this spring creating vacancies , just over the road there 's a large retail outlet opening with 60 vacancies .
" so it 's a very mixed picture .
there are still definitely jobs to have and people are finding work every day . "
that may be , but this week 's figures showing 1.92m people unemployed tell their own story - and vacancies are at their lowest level since records began in 2001 .
long-term unemployment is a particular problem .
leanne jones works at selly oak as a personal advisor for what she calls " harder to help customers " - 18 to 24 year-olds who have been out of work for six months and people aged 25-plus jobless for 18 months or more .
" today i 've had it specialists , construction workers , drivers , loads .
there 's not one particular sort of person at the moment .
some people have got more barriers to getting a job .
" some might live in a hostel , so their rent is high and they need to look at how much they 'll earn before going into employment .
other people have got children and we need to do a better calculation to ensure they 'll be better off working .
some are harder to help than others . "
so does the personal service and casual decor make a difference ?
garry orstin , a 47-year-old roofer , is unimpressed . "
it 's depressing , very depressing ... just coming here , looking at all these people " garry orstin , a 47-year-old roofer how to cope with unemployment " it 's depressing , very depressing .
i 've worked all my life .
it 's just coming here , looking at all these people .
it 's not a very nice place , " he says .
but another man disagrees : " generally it 's pretty good .
the people in here are ok .
it 's just that they do n't have the jobs that i need . "
actually job centre plus only has around a third of all jobs on the market .
but even if unemployed people are looking for jobs elsewhere , they still need to come here to claim benefits and sign on .
one of these is jay acharya , who says he 's now receiving in jobseekers ' allowance every month pretty much the same amount of money he was paid , after tax , on a daily basis as head of training and development for building materials distributor bcg .
he drives here every fortnight to sign on - and that 's it .
" they 're not much help for what i would call professional people .
a lot of the positions are for administrative jobs , labour-intensive jobs , but there are not many professional ones there - and when i go for less senior positions i 'm told i 'm overqualified . "
jean harborne argues she does have professional positions .
" there were 900 vacancies today in the birmingham and solihull area , and 25 % were executive and professional posts , " she says .
" there may be less than there have been , but there are still vacancies . "
but clearly , the competition for them is increasing all the time .

the burmese rohingya migrants are being detained by the military in southern thailand .
last month around a thousand rohingyas were towed out to sea and set adrift by the thai military , said survivors who reached india and indonesia .
hundreds are missing , feared dead ; thai officials say they are investigating .
after the horrific testimony from rohingya survivors about their treatment at the hands of the thai military last month , the un refugee agency is very concerned for the well-being of a group of 126 more asylum-seekers , who were detained in thailand a week ago .
but there has been no response yet from the thai government to an official request by the un for access to the detainees made three days ago .
' no record ' at one point the foreign ministry said it had lost the letter .
a foreign ministry spokesman told the bbc that the government does not know where the detainees are - there is no police or immigration record of their arrival .
but military sources in the southern province of ranong told us they are indeed being held there by unnamed army or navy units .
it seems that the military is withholding information on the detainees from the government .
it is an embarrassing situation for prime minister abhisit vejjajiva to find himself in so soon after coming to office with a firm promise to improve transparency and accountability .

' no record ' at one point the foreign ministry said it had lost the letter .
a foreign ministry spokesman told the bbc that the government does not know where the detainees are - there is no police or immigration record of their arrival .
but military sources in the southern province of ranong told us they are indeed being held there by unnamed army or navy units .
it seems that the military is withholding information on the detainees from the government .

last month around a thousand rohingyas were towed out to sea and set adrift by the thai military , said survivors who reached india and indonesia .
hundreds are missing , feared dead ; thai officials say they are investigating .
after the horrific testimony from rohingya survivors about their treatment at the hands of the thai military last month , the un refugee agency is very concerned for the well-being of a group of 126 more asylum-seekers , who were detained in thailand a week ago .
but there has been no response yet from the thai government to an official request by the un for access to the detainees made three days ago .
' no record ' at one point the foreign ministry said it had lost the letter .
a foreign ministry spokesman told the bbc that the government does not know where the detainees are - there is no police or immigration record of their arrival .
but military sources in the southern province of ranong told us they are indeed being held there by unnamed army or navy units .
it seems that the military is withholding information on the detainees from the government .
it is an embarrassing situation for prime minister abhisit vejjajiva to find himself in so soon after coming to office with a firm promise to improve transparency and accountability .

they say bbc hoddinott hall , named after the late composer alun hoddinott , is " amazing " and will make a real difference to the orchestra 's sound .
the new venue , at wales millennium centre , opened with a gala concert on thursday , and will stage another on friday .
the orchestra had outgrown its previous base at studio 1 in the bbc studios at llandaff , cardiff .
emilie godden , who plays first violin in the orchestra , said it was " everything we could ask for in a hall " .
" that 's one of the things i noticed from the acoustic test - as soon as we were in here , i could hear myself when i was playing really quietly which in the old studio was n't possible , " she said .
i think it 's going to be really great being able to do concerts in the place where we rehearse all the time debbie harrison " as a result we can try to make the sound we really want to make rather than the sound you just get because of the small space .
" it can only be a great thing for the orchestra sound generally and i 'm really looking forward to seeing what sound we can make . "
debbie harrison , in the second violin section , said the orchestra already felt at home as one of the many arts organisations based at the wales millennium centre .
" i think it 's going to be really great being able to do concerts in the place where we rehearse all the time , " she said .
" it 's a place for the orchestra because we have a role not only with the bbc , but for wales in general .
" it 's going to be really great having us here with the wno -lsb- welsh national opera -rsb- and the dance companies and things as well . "
the orchestra , which tours around the world , will continue to perform major concerts at st david 's hall in cardiff and swansea 's brangwyn hall .
the new venue will be used to rehearse , record and perform more " intimate " concerts , while the grace williams studio at wales millennium centre will provide the base for the orchestra 's community work .
orchestra director david murray said an orchestra taking possession of its own hall was a " unique and very special experience " .
new era " for the last 25 years , the bbc national orchestra and chorus of wales has given concerts at st david 's hall , one of the best concert halls in the uk , and we will continue to do that , " he said .
" but we are also a broadcasting orchestra and we need a studio where we work every day . "
he said bbc hoddinott hall would allow the orchestra to " achieve an almost chamber-like relationship " with its audience .
and for principal conductor thierry fischer , he has already noticed the new home putting a spring into the step of the orchestra .
" it 's transforming the orchestra 's sound , it 's transforming the attitude of the players coming to work - i see big eyes , big smiles , " he said .
" i work on sounds with the orchestra players and you have the feeling they can hear all the groups .
they want to be better and the desire to be better is much stronger in the orchestra . "

" it can only be a great thing for the orchestra sound generally and i 'm really looking forward to seeing what sound we can make . "
debbie harrison , in the second violin section , said the orchestra already felt at home as one of the many arts organisations based at the wales millennium centre .
" i think it 's going to be really great being able to do concerts in the place where we rehearse all the time , " she said .

" it 's going to be really great having us here with the wno -lsb- welsh national opera -rsb- and the dance companies and things as well . "
the orchestra , which tours around the world , will continue to perform major concerts at st david 's hall in cardiff and swansea 's brangwyn hall .
the new venue will be used to rehearse , record and perform more " intimate " concerts , while the grace williams studio at wales millennium centre will provide the base for the orchestra 's community work .
orchestra director david murray said an orchestra taking possession of its own hall was a " unique and very special experience " .
new era " for the last 25 years , the bbc national orchestra and chorus of wales has given concerts at st david 's hall , one of the best concert halls in the uk , and we will continue to do that , " he said .
" but we are also a broadcasting orchestra and we need a studio where we work every day . "
he said bbc hoddinott hall would allow the orchestra to " achieve an almost chamber-like relationship " with its audience .
and for principal conductor thierry fischer , he has already noticed the new home putting a spring into the step of the orchestra .
" it 's transforming the orchestra 's sound , it 's transforming the attitude of the players coming to work - i see big eyes , big smiles , " he said .
" i work on sounds with the orchestra players and you have the feeling they can hear all the groups .
they want to be better and the desire to be better is much stronger in the orchestra . "

unlike tam o 'shanter , scotland 's leaders are neither fou nor unco happy like tam o 'shanter , they 'll claim to be confronting and defeating the witches and warlocks of the economic dance .
they 'll certainly be blaming each other for the whole ghastly show .
and they will be holding up six-point plans for getting home , " where sits a sulky sullen electorate , gathering their brows like gathering storm , nursing their wrath to keep it warm . "
alex salmond tried to hold a candle to the gloom at question time when he announced that the government had just approved one of the world 's largest wave power projects .
forty underwater turbines off the west coast of lewis will create 70 jobs and power 1800 homes .
it 's a sign , " said mr salmond , " that even in these tough economic times there is resilience and strength in the economy . "
renewable energy is , of course , the great green hope of scotland .
and msps have been debating its place in the recovery programme .
the report from the council of economic advisers - debated on thursday - suggested it was one of the " key industries " we ought to be investing in for the future , though the council also seems to have wrung a concession out of the government that there should be a review of its non-nuclear policy .
only the greens and the liberal democrats voted against .
there is rising anger at holyrood that we are in a recession at all .
labour and the liberal democrats want to call the bank executives before an inquisition to explore their role in the banking collapse and how they are able to walk away with huge bonuses .
bankers were blamed in the parliament for the deepening recession " the bankers have made monkeys out of the government , " said the liberal democrat leader tavish scott at question time .
alex salmond said he would be happy to support an inquiry provided it 's not just into the " deplorable " actions of the bankers but also into " the regulators who allowed it to happen and ministers who were in charge of policy over long years . "
the depth of the recession was hinted at in a squall of black figures that came across the holyrood horizon this week .
unemployment in the last quarter went up 13,000 to 138,000 , or 5.2 per cent .
the chambers of commerce and the federation of small businesses told the economy committee that employment , orders and expectations were down and credit was hard to get .
they pleaded with msps to postpone new regulations such as the new licensing laws and waste management rules .
the government this week tried to help families who are falling behind with their mortgage payments .
the number is up from around 200,000 to 500,000 across the uk .
the housing minister stewart maxwell announced a new mortgage- to-shared-equity scheme under which the government would take part-ownership of a house , allowing the family to stay there but make lower mortgage repayments .
next week 's budget might help too .
negotiations are still going on behind the scenes but it looks like the snp are working towards a deal with the conservatives and the greens which will ensure the budget has a majority in the final vote on wednesday .
at question time labour 's iain gray steered clear of the reefs of recession and highlighted the issue of knife crime .
there was a full conference on the subject in the holyrood chamber on friday .
he condemned the two year delay in introducing a licensing system for the sale of knives and said the snp 's policy of ending short jail sentences " will leave around 850 convicted knife criminals every single year on our streets free to carry , free to cut and potentially free to kill . "
the first minister said the best defence against knife crime was an increase in police numbers .
" my message to the victims of crime is that this government has put record numbers of police onto scotland 's streets to make sure our communities are safe . "
mr salmond questioned which of the broons most resembled annabel goldie finally , back to burns .
you may remember last week that alex salmond stood on the battlements of edinburgh castle to help launch the clydesdale bank 's new series of bank notes , on the theme of homecoming and the 250th anniversary of burns ' birth .
well this week , the conservative leader annabel goldie accused mr salmond of wanting to get rid of scottish notes in favour of the euro .
" rather than keep the pound and our scottish bank notes , he 'd settle for some centralised euro note with a bit of regional branding , probably his own face or perhaps a haggis . and some people would n't know the difference . "
ouch , that 's a harsh burns night jest .
but the great chieftain o ' the puddin ' race hit back : " i 'll settle for my cartoon in the broons and i would n't for a second speculate what character annabel goldie might represent ! "

unlike tam o 'shanter , scotland 's leaders are neither fou nor unco happy like tam o 'shanter , they 'll claim to be confronting and defeating the witches and warlocks of the economic dance .
they 'll certainly be blaming each other for the whole ghastly show .
and they will be holding up six-point plans for getting home , " where sits a sulky sullen electorate , gathering their brows like gathering storm , nursing their wrath to keep it warm . "
alex salmond tried to hold a candle to the gloom at question time when he announced that the government had just approved one of the world 's largest wave power projects .
forty underwater turbines off the west coast of lewis will create 70 jobs and power 1800 homes .
it 's a sign , " said mr salmond , " that even in these tough economic times there is resilience and strength in the economy . "
renewable energy is , of course , the great green hope of scotland .
and msps have been debating its place in the recovery programme .
the report from the council of economic advisers - debated on thursday - suggested it was one of the " key industries " we ought to be investing in for the future , though the council also seems to have wrung a concession out of the government that there should be a review of its non-nuclear policy .
only the greens and the liberal democrats voted against .
there is rising anger at holyrood that we are in a recession at all .
labour and the liberal democrats want to call the bank executives before an inquisition to explore their role in the banking collapse and how they are able to walk away with huge bonuses .
bankers were blamed in the parliament for the deepening recession " the bankers have made monkeys out of the government , " said the liberal democrat leader tavish scott at question time .
alex salmond said he would be happy to support an inquiry provided it 's not just into the " deplorable " actions of the bankers but also into " the regulators who allowed it to happen and ministers who were in charge of policy over long years . "
the depth of the recession was hinted at in a squall of black figures that came across the holyrood horizon this week .
unemployment in the last quarter went up 13,000 to 138,000 , or 5.2 per cent .
the chambers of commerce and the federation of small businesses told the economy committee that employment , orders and expectations were down and credit was hard to get .
they pleaded with msps to postpone new regulations such as the new licensing laws and waste management rules .
the government this week tried to help families who are falling behind with their mortgage payments .
the number is up from around 200,000 to 500,000 across the uk .
the housing minister stewart maxwell announced a new mortgage- to-shared-equity scheme under which the government would take part-ownership of a house , allowing the family to stay there but make lower mortgage repayments .
next week 's budget might help too .
negotiations are still going on behind the scenes but it looks like the snp are working towards a deal with the conservatives and the greens which will ensure the budget has a majority in the final vote on wednesday .
at question time labour 's iain gray steered clear of the reefs of recession and highlighted the issue of knife crime .
there was a full conference on the subject in the holyrood chamber on friday .
he condemned the two year delay in introducing a licensing system for the sale of knives and said the snp 's policy of ending short jail sentences " will leave around 850 convicted knife criminals every single year on our streets free to carry , free to cut and potentially free to kill . "
the first minister said the best defence against knife crime was an increase in police numbers .
" my message to the victims of crime is that this government has put record numbers of police onto scotland 's streets to make sure our communities are safe . "
mr salmond questioned which of the broons most resembled annabel goldie finally , back to burns .
you may remember last week that alex salmond stood on the battlements of edinburgh castle to help launch the clydesdale bank 's new series of bank notes , on the theme of homecoming and the 250th anniversary of burns ' birth .
well this week , the conservative leader annabel goldie accused mr salmond of wanting to get rid of scottish notes in favour of the euro .
" rather than keep the pound and our scottish bank notes , he 'd settle for some centralised euro note with a bit of regional branding , probably his own face or perhaps a haggis . and some people would n't know the difference . "
ouch , that 's a harsh burns night jest .

they are seeking people to knit breasts in all shapes , sizes and colours to be used for teaching expectant mothers .
health visitors at present have to demonstrate breastfeeding using balloons or their own elbows , which they say are less than realistic .
their website provides a pattern for crocheting or knitting the breasts , approved by the lactation consultants association of great britain .
sally mills from leeds primary care trust said they would make a contribution to a charity of the knitter 's choice if they received any woollen breasts from the public .
" the only place we could get them from was australia and they were £ 20 each , " she said .
" this way people can enjoy a laugh making them , and help us at the same time . "
the breasts are welcomed in a variety of skin shades .
the website also says : " it is good to have a variety of shapes and sizes , just as women do -lrb- very flat , very small / large , inverted etc -rrb- . "
they are also used by community midwife teams to demonstrate how milk should be expressed , particularly for premature babies being kept in hospital .
a similar appeal in liverpool in 2007 produced offers from all over the world .

police said he was on his way to work at alton police station when the accident happened and officers estimate he was in his car for about two hours before help arrived .
his family said in a statement : " james went to toynbee school in chandlers ford , and throughout his life had been very interested in cars and motorcycles , and also enjoyed football - he was a keen follower of tottenham hotspur football club .

marston 's also said it would not raise the cost of its own beers , which include pedigree , jenning 's and banks .
struggling landlords were also getting financial support including additional discounts and lower rents " where appropriate " , it added .
like-for-like sales fell 6 % in the 15 weeks to 17 january .
the wolverhampton-based company has around 2,250 pubs and bars in england and wales , including 506 managed pubs under the brands tavern table , two for one and pitcher & piano .
it employs about 12,000 people .
' competitive ' marston 's said it had decided to " mitigate the impact of recent substantial price increases from the major lager brewers " .
the move , along with freezing prices on its own beers until at least september , was made to " keep tenants in place and maintain the stability of the estate " , a spokesman said .
the company said the move would protect sales and margins in a " competitive environment " .
marston 's managed pub division reported like-for-like sales - which strip out the effect of new pub openings - down 2.9 % on the same period last year .
it said that trading over christmas and new year had improved slightly but that it had been more subdued since then .

now it is the turn of the british critics to make their minds up about generation kill , a tv mini-series tracing the us invasion of iraq in 2003 .
the show is the latest offering from the wire 's creators david simon and ed burns .
it is based on the work of rolling stone journalist evan wright who was embedded with the marines of the first reconnaissance battalion as they journeyed from kuwait to baghdad .
after the show went out in the us , internet chat rooms were full of praise from members of the military for the programme 's realism , which was exactly what director susanna white was aiming for .
" what we wanted was a very truthful documentary feel to the piece that was n't going to take a political position but told it as it was from the ground , " says white .
generation kill is a far cry from the british director 's last job on the bbc 's adaptation of the dickens 's classic bleak house .
i now know about humvees , cobras and what sequence a humvee travels in - it 's a long way from bleak house .
susanna white , generation kill director " people see it as a huge leap from bleak house to generation kill but they are similar , " says white .
" it 's a huge cast of characters and a story over a lot of episodes .
it requires very vivid and clear storytelling .
so i think i am quite qualified in that sense to direct it . "
it is a sentiment shared by co-producer and writer ed burns : " what bubbles up in warfare is the feminine side in wanting to connect , in wanting to create family .
susanna was very sharp in creating that . "
white agrees that being a female director had its advantages when it came to presiding over a cast of 28 men .
" several of the actors said : ' it 's so good to have a woman because with a man there 's a whole ego , alpha male thing going on , where we are all trying to prove ourselves and with you we can get on and do the job . '
" there was a different dynamic , which was a positive dynamic . "
real marines the series was shot over six months at locations in namibia , mozambique and south africa .
but before that white 's research led her to the us .
" i spent time at camp pendleton and i learnt how to fire the heavy weapons , " she says .
rudy reyes thinks the drama gives a realistic picture of military conflict " i did a lot of military preparations both in terms of looking at war movies and seeing how it all worked .
" i now know about humvees , cobras and what sequence a humvee travels in .
it 's a long way from bleak house . "
the producers also employed some of the marines who were involved in the 2003 attack to act as advisors on the programme .
sergeant rudy reyes ended up playing himself in generation kill and is full of praise for its realism .
" in films everything is fast and explosive , there is resolve .
in real war , real fighting -lrb- and you are talking to a guy who has fought in three of them -rrb- there is no resolve .
" you can go four hours , four days , four weeks without a gunfight and when you are in it , it is so fast and so beautiful it 's intoxicating and it changes your life .
" that is what i think is so important about generation kill - it shows that . "
it is during the spells of no action when the show is probably at its most controversial .
the banter between marines has been accused of being racist , homophobic and misogynistic but white disagrees .
" it is misunderstood because a lot of the humour between marines is teasing about their individuality and actually these guys have incredibly loyal relationships , " she says .
" it is a very black humour which is mistaken for prejudice .
at the end of the day these guys would die for each other . "
gritty drama like the wire before it , generation kill was produced by american channel hbo , the makers of tv hits sex and the city and the sopranos .
" there 's a balance at hbo , " says burns .
the series promises lots of tough action " there are certain shows where you can sit back in the couch and they will wash over you .
" there are other shows you have to lean into and figure out .
we prefer leaning in and hbo gives us the opportunity to lean in . "
before writing for tv , burns spent 20 years working as a detective in baltimore 's police department .
he first teamed up with journalist david simon in 1993 to write the award-winning book the corner .
an emmy award-winning tv series followed and then the wire established the duo as the guys for gritty drama .
but burns says he does not pay much attention to all the critical acclaim : " the bottom line is hbo has already paid us .
" to me it 's : ' is it what we want to say ? ' and the same with david .
then you put it out there and see what happens .
" that 's all you can do as a storyteller . "
generation kill can be seen on the fx channel at 2200 gmt from 25 january .

" several of the actors said : ' it 's so good to have a woman because with a man there 's a whole ego , alpha male thing going on , where we are all trying to prove ourselves and with you we can get on and do the job . '
" there was a different dynamic , which was a positive dynamic . "
real marines the series was shot over six months at locations in namibia , mozambique and south africa .
but before that white 's research led her to the us .
" i spent time at camp pendleton and i learnt how to fire the heavy weapons , " she says .
rudy reyes thinks the drama gives a realistic picture of military conflict " i did a lot of military preparations both in terms of looking at war movies and seeing how it all worked .
" i now know about humvees , cobras and what sequence a humvee travels in .
it 's a long way from bleak house . "
the producers also employed some of the marines who were involved in the 2003 attack to act as advisors on the programme .
sergeant rudy reyes ended up playing himself in generation kill and is full of praise for its realism .
" in films everything is fast and explosive , there is resolve .
in real war , real fighting -lrb- and you are talking to a guy who has fought in three of them -rrb- there is no resolve .
" you can go four hours , four days , four weeks without a gunfight and when you are in it , it is so fast and so beautiful it 's intoxicating and it changes your life .
" that is what i think is so important about generation kill - it shows that . "
it is during the spells of no action when the show is probably at its most controversial .
the banter between marines has been accused of being racist , homophobic and misogynistic but white disagrees .
" it is misunderstood because a lot of the humour between marines is teasing about their individuality and actually these guys have incredibly loyal relationships , " she says .
" it is a very black humour which is mistaken for prejudice .
at the end of the day these guys would die for each other . "
gritty drama like the wire before it , generation kill was produced by american channel hbo , the makers of tv hits sex and the city and the sopranos .
" there 's a balance at hbo , " says burns .
the series promises lots of tough action " there are certain shows where you can sit back in the couch and they will wash over you .
" there are other shows you have to lean into and figure out .
we prefer leaning in and hbo gives us the opportunity to lean in . "
before writing for tv , burns spent 20 years working as a detective in baltimore 's police department .
he first teamed up with journalist david simon in 1993 to write the award-winning book the corner .
an emmy award-winning tv series followed and then the wire established the duo as the guys for gritty drama .
but burns says he does not pay much attention to all the critical acclaim : " the bottom line is hbo has already paid us .
" to me it 's : ' is it what we want to say ? ' and the same with david .
then you put it out there and see what happens .
" that 's all you can do as a storyteller . "
generation kill can be seen on the fx channel at 2200 gmt from 25 january .

now it is the turn of the british critics to make their minds up about generation kill , a tv mini-series tracing the us invasion of iraq in 2003 .
the show is the latest offering from the wire 's creators david simon and ed burns .
it is based on the work of rolling stone journalist evan wright who was embedded with the marines of the first reconnaissance battalion as they journeyed from kuwait to baghdad .
after the show went out in the us , internet chat rooms were full of praise from members of the military for the programme 's realism , which was exactly what director susanna white was aiming for .
" what we wanted was a very truthful documentary feel to the piece that was n't going to take a political position but told it as it was from the ground , " says white .
generation kill is a far cry from the british director 's last job on the bbc 's adaptation of the dickens 's classic bleak house .
i now know about humvees , cobras and what sequence a humvee travels in - it 's a long way from bleak house .
susanna white , generation kill director " people see it as a huge leap from bleak house to generation kill but they are similar , " says white .
" it 's a huge cast of characters and a story over a lot of episodes .
it requires very vivid and clear storytelling .
so i think i am quite qualified in that sense to direct it . "
it is a sentiment shared by co-producer and writer ed burns : " what bubbles up in warfare is the feminine side in wanting to connect , in wanting to create family .
susanna was very sharp in creating that . "
