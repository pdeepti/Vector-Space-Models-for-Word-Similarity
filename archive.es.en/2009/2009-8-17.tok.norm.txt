many eastern europeans came to the small island in the north atlantic to work on construction projects . most of them have left the country since iceland 's economic collapse , and many icelanders have decided to follow them in search for a better future abroad . most of them are eager to avoid pay cuts , tax hikes and the higher unemployment figures expected to hit the country once the summer is over . preferred destination : norway most of the emigrants are heading to norway , where around 1,000 icelanders are expected before this year is over .
for a country with just a little over 300,000 inhabitants , this is not a small number .
craftspeople and technicians have particularly good chances of finding a new job . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : atli and rosa are determined to leave iceland atli steinn gudmundsson , 35 , and his fiancee rosa want to emigrate to norway or holland as soon as the atli completes his ma degree at the university of iceland .
“ half of our friends have already moved to norway , " he says . " and the rest , when you bring up the subject of moving to another country , they never totally reject it . " atli says he refuses to stay in iceland to help pay off the huge international debts with his tax money , arguing that the current difficult situation is not his fault " but that of the bankers and politicians . " is brain drain a serious problem ? following the collapse of iceland ’ s financial system and the dramatic fall of the local currency , the krona , many of the nation 's young professionals are opting to go back to university in england or the us instead of spending the next bleak winter in iceland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iceland 's business minister gylfi magnusson is concerned about emigration for business minister gylfi magnusson these prospects are rather unpleasant : “ it would be pretty devastating if one result of all of this was that iceland ’ s best and brightest would leave or that icelanders that are now studying abroad would not return . ” at the same time , magnusson says he hopes the rate of emigration will slow , stating that the long run prospects for iceland are not that bad : " countries all over the world are also having problems , so it may not be that there are such great opportunities abroad either . " no time to wait for economic upswing compared to last year , the number of household and furniture transports out of iceland is up 20 percent , while a third less is being transported into iceland . many highly qualified employees in iceland have lost their jobs in the past months and they have no time to wait for an economic upswing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the emigration wave means plenty of houses are on the market in iceland jakob lindal , co-owner of an architectural firm on the outskirts of reykjavik , sees this as a huge problem .
he and his business partner had to lay off their staff immediately after the collapse but always intended to bring the team back together as soon as possible .
now , time is running out , says lindal : “ one is on his way to jamaica , one is out farming , helping out a farmer up north and another one is in norway .

but some are finding it difficult to get their economies back on track . analysts say many european countries have begun to slowly pull themselves out of the economic doldrums .
yet for some regions , such as the baltics , recovery will likely be painfully slow .
“ poland and slovakia have fared better than their neighbors in the second quarter this year compared to the first quarter , ” romanian economic analyst aurelian dochia told afp .
“ the baltic countries are facing the worst situation , while romania , bulgaria and hungary are somewhere in-between . ”
notable improvers poland performed relatively well due to its solid economic structure and its large domestic market .
“ this could compensate for the steep fall in exports , ” dochia said .
poland expects gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- growth of 1.0 percent this year .
this would make it an incredible exception in the economic crisis .
the international monetary fund , however , believes poland 's economy will likely shrink by 0.7 percent .
slovakia grew 2.2 percent in the second quarter , largely due to cash rebate programs in its main car export markets .
" it 's good news , ” said juraj valachy , an analyst with tatra bank .
“ the economic results were better than we expected . "
slovakia is managing " to stay competitive " by keeping salaries relatively low as part of its bid to join the euro zone , explained dochia .
the czech republic grew 0.3 percent in the second quarter , announcing it was emerging , like germany and france , from recession .

that 's also an improvement on the first quarter contraction of 4.6 percent .
bucharest , however , is facing huge budgetary constraints and is struggling to pay salaries and pensions .

the government has announced plans to cut public spending by 15 percent and to crack down on customs fraud to raise revenue .

the baltic state 's economy shrank by 12.3 percent in the second quarter , after shrinking 10.2 percent in the first three months prior .
all eyes are now on how the new government plans to rein in public spending .
lithuania has , so far , avoided following latvia and other eastern european economies in seeking a bailout from the international monetary fund and the eu .
vilnius may be forced to seek help if it fails to raise more money from foreign capital markets to prop up the economy .
latvia 's economy also took a sudden about-turn .

the attacks have been blamed on radical militia and raise concerns over their expanding power . with us involvement scaling down and most of the " coalition of the willing " now departed , iraq 's government inches closer each month to full responsibility for the country 's security , judiciary and public services .
but as the western forces , which invaded the country to overthrow saddam hussein and his cronies , prepare to leave iraq to its destiny as a fully sovereign state , there are growing concerns that the country could return to its pre-invasion brutality under a new militant power : the militias .
one of the most disturbing trends which point toward a creeping radicalism and the increased power of iraq 's militias has been highlighted in a new report by human rights watch -lrb- hrw -rrb- , published on monday .
according to the new york-based rights group , iraqi militias are increasingly torturing and executing men suspected of homosexuality but the authorities in baghdad are doing nothing to stop the violence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hrw report details brutal torture of gays in iraq the hrw report states that hundreds of men have been kidnapped , tortured and killed this year in a wave of violence that began in the baghdad sadr city stronghold of shiite cleric moqtada al-sadr 's mahdi army militia .
many bodies have been found with the arabic words for " pervert " and " puppy " - considered derogatory terms for homosexuals in iraq - written on their chests .
the report , released in lebanon and entitled " ' they want us exterminated : murder , torture , sexual orientation and gender in iraq ' , " says it is almost impossible to calculate how many men were killed , but estimates the figure to be in the hundreds .
opportunity knocks for powerful militia " unfortunately it 's not surprising that we 're hearing about these disgusting acts as reported by hrw as well as witnessing the current spate of bombings in iraq , " richard gowan , a middle east policy expert at the european council for foreign relations and author of various papers on iraq 's struggle for democracy , told deutsche welle .
" the country is in danger of becoming ever more fractious as the withdrawal of us forces gets closer . we 've seen this in crisis zones around the world .
when the occupying or peacekeeping forces pull out , there is an escalation of violence within the vacuum . "
" what we are seeing with these killings and bombings is the real power of the militias , " gowan added . " at the height of the insurgency in 2006 , the militias showed that they could give the us forces and the iraqi government a good run for their money .
things have changed and the iraqis are now better-equipped and trained but , as the hrw report shows , the militias can still act with impunity . " fear of feminization threat to iraq 's masculinity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many murders have taken place in al-sadr 's stronghold mahdi army spokesmen have suggested that military action was the remedy for the " feminization " of iraq men , according to the report in which survivors are quoted as saying militiamen invade homes and interrogate victims before killing them in order to identify other potential victims .
hrw said iraqi doctors and morgue employees also have records of grotesque torture marks on the bodies of men , including mutilation and even anuses glued shut .
motives for the murders include " fears that iraqi men 's masculinity is under threat , " hrw reported .
the report said men have fled to neighboring countries , despite consensual homosexual activity being illegal in states in the region such as egypt , jordan and lebanon , even though it is not a criminal offence under iraqi law .
it also said some of the murders were so-called honor killings , carried out by victims ' family members " because ' unmanly ' behavior threatens the reputation of the family or tribe . "
some iraqis interviewed by the rights group charged that , in some cases , members of the security forces had colluded and even joined in the killing .
" at some point during the insurgency , the government came to some agreement for an uneasy peace with the militias where the authorities maintained a certain amount of control and loyalty through bribery and the fact that they would let the militias do what they wanted , " gowan said .
" the hrw report shows that there is a real concern as to what effect this is having on iraqi society , where militias are allowed to brutalize their own communities while the government turns a blind eye . " " what the hrw report reminds us -lrb- of -rrb- is that the us strategy of creating a balancing act between the militias comes with its own set of problems , " he added . " this idea of supporting some militias and not others has been underpinning security policy in iraq for a couple of years now . the primary concern is that , when the americans leave , the balancing act will fail and we 'll see a fragmented iraq and a real threat of civil war . " government accused of turning a blind eye - and worse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the iraqi government somehow involved ?
scott long , director of hrw 's lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender rights program , laid a fair portion of the blame directly at the iraqi government 's feet , accusing it of abandoning the people .
" iraq 's leaders are supposed to defend all iraqis , not abandon them to armed agents of hate , " he said .
" turning a blind eye to torture and murder threatens the rights and life of every iraqi . "
richard gowan believes that iraqis themselves could do much to put pressure on the government to clamp down on the killings and the rise of the militias by pointing out the effects such activities could have on external investment .
" the strong media in iraq and the affluent middle class who want to be secure will put pressure on the government if things get further out of hand , " gowan said . " the many european nations and leaders who have shown an interest in investing in iraq have shown that the country has huge potential and any further scandals and shocks like we 've seen in the hrw report will want to be avoided , " he added . " that said , everyone with an interest in making money from iraq , both internal and external powers , will want to ignore reports like the hrw paper so as to avoid the embarrassing questions about the real state of iraq 's security and the failures of the western powers .

even german tourists have caught lotto fever . the italian superenalotto draw should have taken place on saturday .
but due to a public holiday , it will now take place on monday .
since january , italians have been trying in vain to guess the superenalotto 's winning six-number combination .
draws are held three times a week .
for 83 draws , no one has come up with the winning six numbers .
the chances of guessing the correct combination are an astronomical 623 million to one .
not just locals but also tourists in italy have been playing the superenalotto .
foreigners from neighboring france , austria and slovenia have been driving into italy to snatch up tickets .
in germany , the mass-circulation bild newspaper sponsored a phone-in competition , giving 140 germans a chance to win free flights to italy so they could buy tickets for the last lottery draw .
the winners took a plane from berlin to milan , bought their tickets at a cost of one euro -lrb- us $ 1.74 -rrb- each at an airport cigarette shop - and then flew back home . sc / wl / ap / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the attacks have been blamed on radical militia and raise concerns over their expanding power . with us involvement scaling down and most of the " coalition of the willing " now departed , iraq 's government inches closer each month to full responsibility for the country 's security , judiciary and public services .
but as the western forces , which invaded the country to overthrow saddam hussein and his cronies , prepare to leave iraq to its destiny as a fully sovereign state , there are growing concerns that the country could return to its pre-invasion brutality under a new militant power : the militias .
one of the most disturbing trends which point toward a creeping radicalism and the increased power of iraq 's militias has been highlighted in a new report by human rights watch -lrb- hrw -rrb- , published on monday .
according to the new york-based rights group , iraqi militias are increasingly torturing and executing men suspected of homosexuality but the authorities in baghdad are doing nothing to stop the violence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hrw report details brutal torture of gays in iraq the hrw report states that hundreds of men have been kidnapped , tortured and killed this year in a wave of violence that began in the baghdad sadr city stronghold of shiite cleric moqtada al-sadr 's mahdi army militia .
many bodies have been found with the arabic words for " pervert " and " puppy " - considered derogatory terms for homosexuals in iraq - written on their chests .
the report , released in lebanon and entitled " ' they want us exterminated : murder , torture , sexual orientation and gender in iraq ' , " says it is almost impossible to calculate how many men were killed , but estimates the figure to be in the hundreds .
opportunity knocks for powerful militia " unfortunately it 's not surprising that we 're hearing about these disgusting acts as reported by hrw as well as witnessing the current spate of bombings in iraq , " richard gowan , a middle east policy expert at the european council for foreign relations and author of various papers on iraq 's struggle for democracy , told deutsche welle .
" the country is in danger of becoming ever more fractious as the withdrawal of us forces gets closer . we 've seen this in crisis zones around the world .
when the occupying or peacekeeping forces pull out , there is an escalation of violence within the vacuum . "
" what we are seeing with these killings and bombings is the real power of the militias , " gowan added . " at the height of the insurgency in 2006 , the militias showed that they could give the us forces and the iraqi government a good run for their money .
things have changed and the iraqis are now better-equipped and trained but , as the hrw report shows , the militias can still act with impunity . " fear of feminization threat to iraq 's masculinity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many murders have taken place in al-sadr 's stronghold mahdi army spokesmen have suggested that military action was the remedy for the " feminization " of iraq men , according to the report in which survivors are quoted as saying militiamen invade homes and interrogate victims before killing them in order to identify other potential victims .
hrw said iraqi doctors and morgue employees also have records of grotesque torture marks on the bodies of men , including mutilation and even anuses glued shut .
motives for the murders include " fears that iraqi men 's masculinity is under threat , " hrw reported .
the report said men have fled to neighboring countries , despite consensual homosexual activity being illegal in states in the region such as egypt , jordan and lebanon , even though it is not a criminal offence under iraqi law .
it also said some of the murders were so-called honor killings , carried out by victims ' family members " because ' unmanly ' behavior threatens the reputation of the family or tribe . "
some iraqis interviewed by the rights group charged that , in some cases , members of the security forces had colluded and even joined in the killing .
" at some point during the insurgency , the government came to some agreement for an uneasy peace with the militias where the authorities maintained a certain amount of control and loyalty through bribery and the fact that they would let the militias do what they wanted , " gowan said .
" the hrw report shows that there is a real concern as to what effect this is having on iraqi society , where militias are allowed to brutalize their own communities while the government turns a blind eye . " " what the hrw report reminds us -lrb- of -rrb- is that the us strategy of creating a balancing act between the militias comes with its own set of problems , " he added . " this idea of supporting some militias and not others has been underpinning security policy in iraq for a couple of years now . the primary concern is that , when the americans leave , the balancing act will fail and we 'll see a fragmented iraq and a real threat of civil war . " government accused of turning a blind eye - and worse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the iraqi government somehow involved ?
scott long , director of hrw 's lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender rights program , laid a fair portion of the blame directly at the iraqi government 's feet , accusing it of abandoning the people .
" iraq 's leaders are supposed to defend all iraqis , not abandon them to armed agents of hate , " he said .
" turning a blind eye to torture and murder threatens the rights and life of every iraqi . "
richard gowan believes that iraqis themselves could do much to put pressure on the government to clamp down on the killings and the rise of the militias by pointing out the effects such activities could have on external investment .
" the strong media in iraq and the affluent middle class who want to be secure will put pressure on the government if things get further out of hand , " gowan said . " the many european nations and leaders who have shown an interest in investing in iraq have shown that the country has huge potential and any further scandals and shocks like we 've seen in the hrw report will want to be avoided , " he added . " that said , everyone with an interest in making money from iraq , both internal and external powers , will want to ignore reports like the hrw paper so as to avoid the embarrassing questions about the real state of iraq 's security and the failures of the western powers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : iraq : the rocky road to democracy and stability power struggles at heart of iraq impasse threaten fragile security experts fear integration of former insurgents threatens iraq 's security iraq 's elections will feature less us presence , but more concerns iraq at a crossroads : a return to chaos or are better times ahead ? iraq -pipe- 17.08.2009 increased attacks on iraqi gays raise concerns over militia violence großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the attacks raise fears of the increasing power of militias a human rights watch report published monday shows an increase in attacks on and murders of homosexual men in iraq .
the attacks have been blamed on radical militia and raise concerns over their expanding power . with us involvement scaling down and most of the " coalition of the willing " now departed , iraq 's government inches closer each month to full responsibility for the country 's security , judiciary and public services .
but as the western forces , which invaded the country to overthrow saddam hussein and his cronies , prepare to leave iraq to its destiny as a fully sovereign state , there are growing concerns that the country could return to its pre-invasion brutality under a new militant power : the militias .
one of the most disturbing trends which point toward a creeping radicalism and the increased power of iraq 's militias has been highlighted in a new report by human rights watch -lrb- hrw -rrb- , published on monday .
according to the new york-based rights group , iraqi militias are increasingly torturing and executing men suspected of homosexuality but the authorities in baghdad are doing nothing to stop the violence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hrw report details brutal torture of gays in iraq the hrw report states that hundreds of men have been kidnapped , tortured and killed this year in a wave of violence that began in the baghdad sadr city stronghold of shiite cleric moqtada al-sadr 's mahdi army militia .
many bodies have been found with the arabic words for " pervert " and " puppy " - considered derogatory terms for homosexuals in iraq - written on their chests .
the report , released in lebanon and entitled " ' they want us exterminated : murder , torture , sexual orientation and gender in iraq ' , " says it is almost impossible to calculate how many men were killed , but estimates the figure to be in the hundreds .
opportunity knocks for powerful militia " unfortunately it 's not surprising that we 're hearing about these disgusting acts as reported by hrw as well as witnessing the current spate of bombings in iraq , " richard gowan , a middle east policy expert at the european council for foreign relations and author of various papers on iraq 's struggle for democracy , told deutsche welle .
" the country is in danger of becoming ever more fractious as the withdrawal of us forces gets closer . we 've seen this in crisis zones around the world .
when the occupying or peacekeeping forces pull out , there is an escalation of violence within the vacuum . "
" what we are seeing with these killings and bombings is the real power of the militias , " gowan added . " at the height of the insurgency in 2006 , the militias showed that they could give the us forces and the iraqi government a good run for their money .
things have changed and the iraqis are now better-equipped and trained but , as the hrw report shows , the militias can still act with impunity . " fear of feminization threat to iraq 's masculinity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many murders have taken place in al-sadr 's stronghold mahdi army spokesmen have suggested that military action was the remedy for the " feminization " of iraq men , according to the report in which survivors are quoted as saying militiamen invade homes and interrogate victims before killing them in order to identify other potential victims .
hrw said iraqi doctors and morgue employees also have records of grotesque torture marks on the bodies of men , including mutilation and even anuses glued shut .
motives for the murders include " fears that iraqi men 's masculinity is under threat , " hrw reported .
the report said men have fled to neighboring countries , despite consensual homosexual activity being illegal in states in the region such as egypt , jordan and lebanon , even though it is not a criminal offence under iraqi law .
it also said some of the murders were so-called honor killings , carried out by victims ' family members " because ' unmanly ' behavior threatens the reputation of the family or tribe . "
some iraqis interviewed by the rights group charged that , in some cases , members of the security forces had colluded and even joined in the killing .
" at some point during the insurgency , the government came to some agreement for an uneasy peace with the militias where the authorities maintained a certain amount of control and loyalty through bribery and the fact that they would let the militias do what they wanted , " gowan said .
" the hrw report shows that there is a real concern as to what effect this is having on iraqi society , where militias are allowed to brutalize their own communities while the government turns a blind eye . " " what the hrw report reminds us -lrb- of -rrb- is that the us strategy of creating a balancing act between the militias comes with its own set of problems , " he added . " this idea of supporting some militias and not others has been underpinning security policy in iraq for a couple of years now . the primary concern is that , when the americans leave , the balancing act will fail and we 'll see a fragmented iraq and a real threat of civil war . " government accused of turning a blind eye - and worse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the iraqi government somehow involved ?
scott long , director of hrw 's lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender rights program , laid a fair portion of the blame directly at the iraqi government 's feet , accusing it of abandoning the people .
" iraq 's leaders are supposed to defend all iraqis , not abandon them to armed agents of hate , " he said .
" turning a blind eye to torture and murder threatens the rights and life of every iraqi . "
richard gowan believes that iraqis themselves could do much to put pressure on the government to clamp down on the killings and the rise of the militias by pointing out the effects such activities could have on external investment .
" the strong media in iraq and the affluent middle class who want to be secure will put pressure on the government if things get further out of hand , " gowan said . " the many european nations and leaders who have shown an interest in investing in iraq have shown that the country has huge potential and any further scandals and shocks like we 've seen in the hrw report will want to be avoided , " he added . " that said , everyone with an interest in making money from iraq , both internal and external powers , will want to ignore reports like the hrw paper so as to avoid the embarrassing questions about the real state of iraq 's security and the failures of the western powers .

even german tourists have caught lotto fever . the italian superenalotto draw should have taken place on saturday .

for 83 draws , no one has come up with the winning six numbers .
the chances of guessing the correct combination are an astronomical 623 million to one .
not just locals but also tourists in italy have been playing the superenalotto .
foreigners from neighboring france , austria and slovenia have been driving into italy to snatch up tickets .
in germany , the mass-circulation bild newspaper sponsored a phone-in competition , giving 140 germans a chance to win free flights to italy so they could buy tickets for the last lottery draw .
the winners took a plane from berlin to milan , bought their tickets at a cost of one euro -lrb- us $ 1.74 -rrb- each at an airport cigarette shop - and then flew back home . sc / wl / ap / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the attacks have been blamed on radical militia and raise concerns over their expanding power . with us involvement scaling down and most of the " coalition of the willing " now departed , iraq 's government inches closer each month to full responsibility for the country 's security , judiciary and public services .
but as the western forces , which invaded the country to overthrow saddam hussein and his cronies , prepare to leave iraq to its destiny as a fully sovereign state , there are growing concerns that the country could return to its pre-invasion brutality under a new militant power : the militias .
one of the most disturbing trends which point toward a creeping radicalism and the increased power of iraq 's militias has been highlighted in a new report by human rights watch -lrb- hrw -rrb- , published on monday .
according to the new york-based rights group , iraqi militias are increasingly torturing and executing men suspected of homosexuality but the authorities in baghdad are doing nothing to stop the violence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hrw report details brutal torture of gays in iraq the hrw report states that hundreds of men have been kidnapped , tortured and killed this year in a wave of violence that began in the baghdad sadr city stronghold of shiite cleric moqtada al-sadr 's mahdi army militia .
many bodies have been found with the arabic words for " pervert " and " puppy " - considered derogatory terms for homosexuals in iraq - written on their chests .
the report , released in lebanon and entitled " ' they want us exterminated : murder , torture , sexual orientation and gender in iraq ' , " says it is almost impossible to calculate how many men were killed , but estimates the figure to be in the hundreds .
opportunity knocks for powerful militia " unfortunately it 's not surprising that we 're hearing about these disgusting acts as reported by hrw as well as witnessing the current spate of bombings in iraq , " richard gowan , a middle east policy expert at the european council for foreign relations and author of various papers on iraq 's struggle for democracy , told deutsche welle .
" the country is in danger of becoming ever more fractious as the withdrawal of us forces gets closer . we 've seen this in crisis zones around the world .
when the occupying or peacekeeping forces pull out , there is an escalation of violence within the vacuum . "
" what we are seeing with these killings and bombings is the real power of the militias , " gowan added . " at the height of the insurgency in 2006 , the militias showed that they could give the us forces and the iraqi government a good run for their money .
things have changed and the iraqis are now better-equipped and trained but , as the hrw report shows , the militias can still act with impunity . " fear of feminization threat to iraq 's masculinity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many murders have taken place in al-sadr 's stronghold mahdi army spokesmen have suggested that military action was the remedy for the " feminization " of iraq men , according to the report in which survivors are quoted as saying militiamen invade homes and interrogate victims before killing them in order to identify other potential victims .
hrw said iraqi doctors and morgue employees also have records of grotesque torture marks on the bodies of men , including mutilation and even anuses glued shut .
motives for the murders include " fears that iraqi men 's masculinity is under threat , " hrw reported .
the report said men have fled to neighboring countries , despite consensual homosexual activity being illegal in states in the region such as egypt , jordan and lebanon , even though it is not a criminal offence under iraqi law .
it also said some of the murders were so-called honor killings , carried out by victims ' family members " because ' unmanly ' behavior threatens the reputation of the family or tribe . "
some iraqis interviewed by the rights group charged that , in some cases , members of the security forces had colluded and even joined in the killing .
" at some point during the insurgency , the government came to some agreement for an uneasy peace with the militias where the authorities maintained a certain amount of control and loyalty through bribery and the fact that they would let the militias do what they wanted , " gowan said .
" the hrw report shows that there is a real concern as to what effect this is having on iraqi society , where militias are allowed to brutalize their own communities while the government turns a blind eye . " " what the hrw report reminds us -lrb- of -rrb- is that the us strategy of creating a balancing act between the militias comes with its own set of problems , " he added . " this idea of supporting some militias and not others has been underpinning security policy in iraq for a couple of years now . the primary concern is that , when the americans leave , the balancing act will fail and we 'll see a fragmented iraq and a real threat of civil war . " government accused of turning a blind eye - and worse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the iraqi government somehow involved ?
scott long , director of hrw 's lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender rights program , laid a fair portion of the blame directly at the iraqi government 's feet , accusing it of abandoning the people .
" iraq 's leaders are supposed to defend all iraqis , not abandon them to armed agents of hate , " he said .
" turning a blind eye to torture and murder threatens the rights and life of every iraqi . "
richard gowan believes that iraqis themselves could do much to put pressure on the government to clamp down on the killings and the rise of the militias by pointing out the effects such activities could have on external investment .
" the strong media in iraq and the affluent middle class who want to be secure will put pressure on the government if things get further out of hand , " gowan said . " the many european nations and leaders who have shown an interest in investing in iraq have shown that the country has huge potential and any further scandals and shocks like we 've seen in the hrw report will want to be avoided , " he added . " that said , everyone with an interest in making money from iraq , both internal and external powers , will want to ignore reports like the hrw paper so as to avoid the embarrassing questions about the real state of iraq 's security and the failures of the western powers .

the attacks have been blamed on radical militia and raise concerns over their expanding power . with us involvement scaling down and most of the " coalition of the willing " now departed , iraq 's government inches closer each month to full responsibility for the country 's security , judiciary and public services .
but as the western forces , which invaded the country to overthrow saddam hussein and his cronies , prepare to leave iraq to its destiny as a fully sovereign state , there are growing concerns that the country could return to its pre-invasion brutality under a new militant power : the militias .
one of the most disturbing trends which point toward a creeping radicalism and the increased power of iraq 's militias has been highlighted in a new report by human rights watch -lrb- hrw -rrb- , published on monday .
according to the new york-based rights group , iraqi militias are increasingly torturing and executing men suspected of homosexuality but the authorities in baghdad are doing nothing to stop the violence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hrw report details brutal torture of gays in iraq the hrw report states that hundreds of men have been kidnapped , tortured and killed this year in a wave of violence that began in the baghdad sadr city stronghold of shiite cleric moqtada al-sadr 's mahdi army militia .
many bodies have been found with the arabic words for " pervert " and " puppy " - considered derogatory terms for homosexuals in iraq - written on their chests .
the report , released in lebanon and entitled " ' they want us exterminated : murder , torture , sexual orientation and gender in iraq ' , " says it is almost impossible to calculate how many men were killed , but estimates the figure to be in the hundreds .
opportunity knocks for powerful militia " unfortunately it 's not surprising that we 're hearing about these disgusting acts as reported by hrw as well as witnessing the current spate of bombings in iraq , " richard gowan , a middle east policy expert at the european council for foreign relations and author of various papers on iraq 's struggle for democracy , told deutsche welle .
" the country is in danger of becoming ever more fractious as the withdrawal of us forces gets closer . we 've seen this in crisis zones around the world .
when the occupying or peacekeeping forces pull out , there is an escalation of violence within the vacuum . "
" what we are seeing with these killings and bombings is the real power of the militias , " gowan added . " at the height of the insurgency in 2006 , the militias showed that they could give the us forces and the iraqi government a good run for their money .
things have changed and the iraqis are now better-equipped and trained but , as the hrw report shows , the militias can still act with impunity . " fear of feminization threat to iraq 's masculinity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many murders have taken place in al-sadr 's stronghold mahdi army spokesmen have suggested that military action was the remedy for the " feminization " of iraq men , according to the report in which survivors are quoted as saying militiamen invade homes and interrogate victims before killing them in order to identify other potential victims .
hrw said iraqi doctors and morgue employees also have records of grotesque torture marks on the bodies of men , including mutilation and even anuses glued shut .
motives for the murders include " fears that iraqi men 's masculinity is under threat , " hrw reported .
the report said men have fled to neighboring countries , despite consensual homosexual activity being illegal in states in the region such as egypt , jordan and lebanon , even though it is not a criminal offence under iraqi law .
it also said some of the murders were so-called honor killings , carried out by victims ' family members " because ' unmanly ' behavior threatens the reputation of the family or tribe . "
some iraqis interviewed by the rights group charged that , in some cases , members of the security forces had colluded and even joined in the killing .
" at some point during the insurgency , the government came to some agreement for an uneasy peace with the militias where the authorities maintained a certain amount of control and loyalty through bribery and the fact that they would let the militias do what they wanted , " gowan said .
" the hrw report shows that there is a real concern as to what effect this is having on iraqi society , where militias are allowed to brutalize their own communities while the government turns a blind eye . " " what the hrw report reminds us -lrb- of -rrb- is that the us strategy of creating a balancing act between the militias comes with its own set of problems , " he added . " this idea of supporting some militias and not others has been underpinning security policy in iraq for a couple of years now . the primary concern is that , when the americans leave , the balancing act will fail and we 'll see a fragmented iraq and a real threat of civil war . " government accused of turning a blind eye - and worse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the iraqi government somehow involved ?
scott long , director of hrw 's lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender rights program , laid a fair portion of the blame directly at the iraqi government 's feet , accusing it of abandoning the people .
" iraq 's leaders are supposed to defend all iraqis , not abandon them to armed agents of hate , " he said .
" turning a blind eye to torture and murder threatens the rights and life of every iraqi . "
richard gowan believes that iraqis themselves could do much to put pressure on the government to clamp down on the killings and the rise of the militias by pointing out the effects such activities could have on external investment .
" the strong media in iraq and the affluent middle class who want to be secure will put pressure on the government if things get further out of hand , " gowan said . " the many european nations and leaders who have shown an interest in investing in iraq have shown that the country has huge potential and any further scandals and shocks like we 've seen in the hrw report will want to be avoided , " he added . " that said , everyone with an interest in making money from iraq , both internal and external powers , will want to ignore reports like the hrw paper so as to avoid the embarrassing questions about the real state of iraq 's security and the failures of the western powers .

but some are finding it difficult to get their economies back on track . analysts say many european countries have begun to slowly pull themselves out of the economic doldrums .
yet for some regions , such as the baltics , recovery will likely be painfully slow .
“ poland and slovakia have fared better than their neighbors in the second quarter this year compared to the first quarter , ” romanian economic analyst aurelian dochia told afp .
“ the baltic countries are facing the worst situation , while romania , bulgaria and hungary are somewhere in-between . ”
notable improvers poland performed relatively well due to its solid economic structure and its large domestic market .
“ this could compensate for the steep fall in exports , ” dochia said .
poland expects gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- growth of 1.0 percent this year .
this would make it an incredible exception in the economic crisis .
the international monetary fund , however , believes poland 's economy will likely shrink by 0.7 percent .
slovakia grew 2.2 percent in the second quarter , largely due to cash rebate programs in its main car export markets .
" it 's good news , ” said juraj valachy , an analyst with tatra bank .
“ the economic results were better than we expected . "
slovakia is managing " to stay competitive " by keeping salaries relatively low as part of its bid to join the euro zone , explained dochia .
the czech republic grew 0.3 percent in the second quarter , announcing it was emerging , like germany and france , from recession .
" we already hit the bottom in the first quarter of this year , " said helena horska , a prague-based analyst with austrian lender raiffeisenbank .

that 's a slight improvement over a first quarter contraction of 2.6 percent and could indicate a possible bottoming out .
romania 's economy shrank by 2.1 percent in the second quarter .
that 's also an improvement on the first quarter contraction of 4.6 percent .
bucharest , however , is facing huge budgetary constraints and is struggling to pay salaries and pensions .
the government is forcing state employees to take 10 days of unpaid leave to trim the public deficit .
analysts say while it 's too early to talk about a recovery , they do expect the decline to reverse in the next few months .
bulgaria also has to sharply cut the public deficit .
the government has announced plans to cut public spending by 15 percent and to crack down on customs fraud to raise revenue .
the baltic nations are in deep lithuania , until last year , enjoyed a reputation as a european union " tiger , " but now is deeper into recession than any other eu nation .

the baltic state 's economy shrank by 12.3 percent in the second quarter , after shrinking 10.2 percent in the first three months prior .
all eyes are now on how the new government plans to rein in public spending .
lithuania has , so far , avoided following latvia and other eastern european economies in seeking a bailout from the international monetary fund and the eu .
vilnius may be forced to seek help if it fails to raise more money from foreign capital markets to prop up the economy .
latvia 's economy also took a sudden about-turn .
it grew 10.2 percent in 2007 , but since then it has gone downhill .
output contracted by 4.6 percent in 2008 and is forecast to shrink by18 percent this year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : iraq : the rocky road to democracy and stability power struggles at heart of iraq impasse threaten fragile security experts fear integration of former insurgents threatens iraq 's security iraq 's elections will feature less us presence , but more concerns iraq at a crossroads : a return to chaos or are better times ahead ? iraq -pipe- 17.08.2009 increased attacks on iraqi gays raise concerns over militia violence großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the attacks raise fears of the increasing power of militias a human rights watch report published monday shows an increase in attacks on and murders of homosexual men in iraq .
the attacks have been blamed on radical militia and raise concerns over their expanding power . with us involvement scaling down and most of the " coalition of the willing " now departed , iraq 's government inches closer each month to full responsibility for the country 's security , judiciary and public services .
but as the western forces , which invaded the country to overthrow saddam hussein and his cronies , prepare to leave iraq to its destiny as a fully sovereign state , there are growing concerns that the country could return to its pre-invasion brutality under a new militant power : the militias .
one of the most disturbing trends which point toward a creeping radicalism and the increased power of iraq 's militias has been highlighted in a new report by human rights watch -lrb- hrw -rrb- , published on monday .
according to the new york-based rights group , iraqi militias are increasingly torturing and executing men suspected of homosexuality but the authorities in baghdad are doing nothing to stop the violence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hrw report details brutal torture of gays in iraq the hrw report states that hundreds of men have been kidnapped , tortured and killed this year in a wave of violence that began in the baghdad sadr city stronghold of shiite cleric moqtada al-sadr 's mahdi army militia .
many bodies have been found with the arabic words for " pervert " and " puppy " - considered derogatory terms for homosexuals in iraq - written on their chests .
the report , released in lebanon and entitled " ' they want us exterminated : murder , torture , sexual orientation and gender in iraq ' , " says it is almost impossible to calculate how many men were killed , but estimates the figure to be in the hundreds .
opportunity knocks for powerful militia " unfortunately it 's not surprising that we 're hearing about these disgusting acts as reported by hrw as well as witnessing the current spate of bombings in iraq , " richard gowan , a middle east policy expert at the european council for foreign relations and author of various papers on iraq 's struggle for democracy , told deutsche welle .
" the country is in danger of becoming ever more fractious as the withdrawal of us forces gets closer . we 've seen this in crisis zones around the world .
when the occupying or peacekeeping forces pull out , there is an escalation of violence within the vacuum . "
" what we are seeing with these killings and bombings is the real power of the militias , " gowan added . " at the height of the insurgency in 2006 , the militias showed that they could give the us forces and the iraqi government a good run for their money .
things have changed and the iraqis are now better-equipped and trained but , as the hrw report shows , the militias can still act with impunity . " fear of feminization threat to iraq 's masculinity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many murders have taken place in al-sadr 's stronghold mahdi army spokesmen have suggested that military action was the remedy for the " feminization " of iraq men , according to the report in which survivors are quoted as saying militiamen invade homes and interrogate victims before killing them in order to identify other potential victims .
hrw said iraqi doctors and morgue employees also have records of grotesque torture marks on the bodies of men , including mutilation and even anuses glued shut .
motives for the murders include " fears that iraqi men 's masculinity is under threat , " hrw reported .
the report said men have fled to neighboring countries , despite consensual homosexual activity being illegal in states in the region such as egypt , jordan and lebanon , even though it is not a criminal offence under iraqi law .
it also said some of the murders were so-called honor killings , carried out by victims ' family members " because ' unmanly ' behavior threatens the reputation of the family or tribe . "
some iraqis interviewed by the rights group charged that , in some cases , members of the security forces had colluded and even joined in the killing .
" at some point during the insurgency , the government came to some agreement for an uneasy peace with the militias where the authorities maintained a certain amount of control and loyalty through bribery and the fact that they would let the militias do what they wanted , " gowan said .
" the hrw report shows that there is a real concern as to what effect this is having on iraqi society , where militias are allowed to brutalize their own communities while the government turns a blind eye . " " what the hrw report reminds us -lrb- of -rrb- is that the us strategy of creating a balancing act between the militias comes with its own set of problems , " he added . " this idea of supporting some militias and not others has been underpinning security policy in iraq for a couple of years now . the primary concern is that , when the americans leave , the balancing act will fail and we 'll see a fragmented iraq and a real threat of civil war . " government accused of turning a blind eye - and worse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the iraqi government somehow involved ?
scott long , director of hrw 's lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender rights program , laid a fair portion of the blame directly at the iraqi government 's feet , accusing it of abandoning the people .
" iraq 's leaders are supposed to defend all iraqis , not abandon them to armed agents of hate , " he said .
" turning a blind eye to torture and murder threatens the rights and life of every iraqi . "
richard gowan believes that iraqis themselves could do much to put pressure on the government to clamp down on the killings and the rise of the militias by pointing out the effects such activities could have on external investment .
" the strong media in iraq and the affluent middle class who want to be secure will put pressure on the government if things get further out of hand , " gowan said . " the many european nations and leaders who have shown an interest in investing in iraq have shown that the country has huge potential and any further scandals and shocks like we 've seen in the hrw report will want to be avoided , " he added . " that said , everyone with an interest in making money from iraq , both internal and external powers , will want to ignore reports like the hrw paper so as to avoid the embarrassing questions about the real state of iraq 's security and the failures of the western powers .

the attacks have been blamed on radical militia and raise concerns over their expanding power . with us involvement scaling down and most of the " coalition of the willing " now departed , iraq 's government inches closer each month to full responsibility for the country 's security , judiciary and public services .
but as the western forces , which invaded the country to overthrow saddam hussein and his cronies , prepare to leave iraq to its destiny as a fully sovereign state , there are growing concerns that the country could return to its pre-invasion brutality under a new militant power : the militias .
one of the most disturbing trends which point toward a creeping radicalism and the increased power of iraq 's militias has been highlighted in a new report by human rights watch -lrb- hrw -rrb- , published on monday .
according to the new york-based rights group , iraqi militias are increasingly torturing and executing men suspected of homosexuality but the authorities in baghdad are doing nothing to stop the violence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hrw report details brutal torture of gays in iraq the hrw report states that hundreds of men have been kidnapped , tortured and killed this year in a wave of violence that began in the baghdad sadr city stronghold of shiite cleric moqtada al-sadr 's mahdi army militia .
many bodies have been found with the arabic words for " pervert " and " puppy " - considered derogatory terms for homosexuals in iraq - written on their chests .
the report , released in lebanon and entitled " ' they want us exterminated : murder , torture , sexual orientation and gender in iraq ' , " says it is almost impossible to calculate how many men were killed , but estimates the figure to be in the hundreds .
opportunity knocks for powerful militia " unfortunately it 's not surprising that we 're hearing about these disgusting acts as reported by hrw as well as witnessing the current spate of bombings in iraq , " richard gowan , a middle east policy expert at the european council for foreign relations and author of various papers on iraq 's struggle for democracy , told deutsche welle .
" the country is in danger of becoming ever more fractious as the withdrawal of us forces gets closer . we 've seen this in crisis zones around the world .
when the occupying or peacekeeping forces pull out , there is an escalation of violence within the vacuum . "
" what we are seeing with these killings and bombings is the real power of the militias , " gowan added . " at the height of the insurgency in 2006 , the militias showed that they could give the us forces and the iraqi government a good run for their money .
things have changed and the iraqis are now better-equipped and trained but , as the hrw report shows , the militias can still act with impunity . " fear of feminization threat to iraq 's masculinity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many murders have taken place in al-sadr 's stronghold mahdi army spokesmen have suggested that military action was the remedy for the " feminization " of iraq men , according to the report in which survivors are quoted as saying militiamen invade homes and interrogate victims before killing them in order to identify other potential victims .
hrw said iraqi doctors and morgue employees also have records of grotesque torture marks on the bodies of men , including mutilation and even anuses glued shut .
motives for the murders include " fears that iraqi men 's masculinity is under threat , " hrw reported .
the report said men have fled to neighboring countries , despite consensual homosexual activity being illegal in states in the region such as egypt , jordan and lebanon , even though it is not a criminal offence under iraqi law .
it also said some of the murders were so-called honor killings , carried out by victims ' family members " because ' unmanly ' behavior threatens the reputation of the family or tribe . "

the attacks have been blamed on radical militia and raise concerns over their expanding power . with us involvement scaling down and most of the " coalition of the willing " now departed , iraq 's government inches closer each month to full responsibility for the country 's security , judiciary and public services .
but as the western forces , which invaded the country to overthrow saddam hussein and his cronies , prepare to leave iraq to its destiny as a fully sovereign state , there are growing concerns that the country could return to its pre-invasion brutality under a new militant power : the militias .
one of the most disturbing trends which point toward a creeping radicalism and the increased power of iraq 's militias has been highlighted in a new report by human rights watch -lrb- hrw -rrb- , published on monday .
according to the new york-based rights group , iraqi militias are increasingly torturing and executing men suspected of homosexuality but the authorities in baghdad are doing nothing to stop the violence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hrw report details brutal torture of gays in iraq the hrw report states that hundreds of men have been kidnapped , tortured and killed this year in a wave of violence that began in the baghdad sadr city stronghold of shiite cleric moqtada al-sadr 's mahdi army militia .
many bodies have been found with the arabic words for " pervert " and " puppy " - considered derogatory terms for homosexuals in iraq - written on their chests .
the report , released in lebanon and entitled " ' they want us exterminated : murder , torture , sexual orientation and gender in iraq ' , " says it is almost impossible to calculate how many men were killed , but estimates the figure to be in the hundreds .
opportunity knocks for powerful militia " unfortunately it 's not surprising that we 're hearing about these disgusting acts as reported by hrw as well as witnessing the current spate of bombings in iraq , " richard gowan , a middle east policy expert at the european council for foreign relations and author of various papers on iraq 's struggle for democracy , told deutsche welle .
" the country is in danger of becoming ever more fractious as the withdrawal of us forces gets closer . we 've seen this in crisis zones around the world .
when the occupying or peacekeeping forces pull out , there is an escalation of violence within the vacuum . "
" what we are seeing with these killings and bombings is the real power of the militias , " gowan added . " at the height of the insurgency in 2006 , the militias showed that they could give the us forces and the iraqi government a good run for their money .
things have changed and the iraqis are now better-equipped and trained but , as the hrw report shows , the militias can still act with impunity . " fear of feminization threat to iraq 's masculinity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many murders have taken place in al-sadr 's stronghold mahdi army spokesmen have suggested that military action was the remedy for the " feminization " of iraq men , according to the report in which survivors are quoted as saying militiamen invade homes and interrogate victims before killing them in order to identify other potential victims .
hrw said iraqi doctors and morgue employees also have records of grotesque torture marks on the bodies of men , including mutilation and even anuses glued shut .
motives for the murders include " fears that iraqi men 's masculinity is under threat , " hrw reported .
the report said men have fled to neighboring countries , despite consensual homosexual activity being illegal in states in the region such as egypt , jordan and lebanon , even though it is not a criminal offence under iraqi law .
it also said some of the murders were so-called honor killings , carried out by victims ' family members " because ' unmanly ' behavior threatens the reputation of the family or tribe . "
some iraqis interviewed by the rights group charged that , in some cases , members of the security forces had colluded and even joined in the killing .
" at some point during the insurgency , the government came to some agreement for an uneasy peace with the militias where the authorities maintained a certain amount of control and loyalty through bribery and the fact that they would let the militias do what they wanted , " gowan said .
" the hrw report shows that there is a real concern as to what effect this is having on iraqi society , where militias are allowed to brutalize their own communities while the government turns a blind eye . " " what the hrw report reminds us -lrb- of -rrb- is that the us strategy of creating a balancing act between the militias comes with its own set of problems , " he added . " this idea of supporting some militias and not others has been underpinning security policy in iraq for a couple of years now . the primary concern is that , when the americans leave , the balancing act will fail and we 'll see a fragmented iraq and a real threat of civil war . " government accused of turning a blind eye - and worse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the iraqi government somehow involved ?
scott long , director of hrw 's lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender rights program , laid a fair portion of the blame directly at the iraqi government 's feet , accusing it of abandoning the people .
" iraq 's leaders are supposed to defend all iraqis , not abandon them to armed agents of hate , " he said .
" turning a blind eye to torture and murder threatens the rights and life of every iraqi . "
richard gowan believes that iraqis themselves could do much to put pressure on the government to clamp down on the killings and the rise of the militias by pointing out the effects such activities could have on external investment .
" the strong media in iraq and the affluent middle class who want to be secure will put pressure on the government if things get further out of hand , " gowan said . " the many european nations and leaders who have shown an interest in investing in iraq have shown that the country has huge potential and any further scandals and shocks like we 've seen in the hrw report will want to be avoided , " he added . " that said , everyone with an interest in making money from iraq , both internal and external powers , will want to ignore reports like the hrw paper so as to avoid the embarrassing questions about the real state of iraq 's security and the failures of the western powers .

dozens are missing . the accident in the eastern siberian region of khakassia shut down the sayano-shushenskaya hydroelectric plant on the yenisei river .
casualty figures from russian press sources varied , but the latest showed at least 12 dead , over a dozen injured , and up to 72 missing .
but emergencies ministry spokeswoman irina butenko told reuters : " there is no danger to the population . "
explosion is not ruled out she said authorities were not ruling out the possibility that an explosion caused the accident .
but russian news agencies reported a water surge was the most likely cause .
the sayano-shushenskaya plant provides power to nearby major aluminum smelters operated by rusal , russia 's largest aluminium producer .
production was halted temporarily at some aluminium smelters , but a rusal spokeswoman said all their plants are now being supplied by other electricity producers and are working normally .
water flooded the hall when a wall collapsed , after a sudden change in pressure caused the pipes feeding water to the hydro plant to burst .
no damage to dam local officials have said there is no danger to the dam .
" the body of the dam has not been damaged , " said spokesman dmitry kydryavtsev .
there was some panic among the local population and officials were reportedly trying to calm the situation .

dozens are missing . the accident in the eastern siberian region of khakassia shut down the sayano-shushenskaya hydroelectric plant on the yenisei river .
casualty figures from russian press sources varied , but the latest showed at least 12 dead , over a dozen injured , and up to 72 missing .

explosion is not ruled out she said authorities were not ruling out the possibility that an explosion caused the accident .

many eastern europeans came to the small island in the north atlantic to work on construction projects . most of them have left the country since iceland 's economic collapse , and many icelanders have decided to follow them in search for a better future abroad . most of them are eager to avoid pay cuts , tax hikes and the higher unemployment figures expected to hit the country once the summer is over . preferred destination : norway most of the emigrants are heading to norway , where around 1,000 icelanders are expected before this year is over .

russian defense minister anatoly serdyukov told president dmitry medvedev on monday that the 4,000-ton ship had been found and that the crew were safe after being taken aboard a navy anti-submarine ship .
" today at 1 am moscow time , the ship was found 300 miles off the cape verde islands , " serdyukov told medvedev during a presidential visit to the southern russian city of astrakhan .
however , he gave no details of how the vessel had been found or why it had disappeared in the first place .

they also said crew members had been assaulted , gagged and blindfolded , and some were seriously hurt .
in comments to the media , serdyukov did not say if the crew members had been held against their will .

" this is one of the biggest gene-doping threats that we face at the moment , " diel said .

" this is one of the biggest gene-doping threats that we face at the moment , " diel said .
" athletes who get their hands on these substances at the moment would have an unbelievable advantage .
they would n't have to worry about testing positive . " since the drugs intensify natural production of epo , doping authorities ca n't prove the athlete used performance-enhancing drugs , diel added . dangerous side effects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thicker blood can increase the likelihood of heart attacks and strokes epo-producing treatments were originally intended to help seriously ill patients suffering from anemia to increase the number of red blood cells to transport oxygen .
initial clinical studies were , however , stopped when the drug was found to cause numerous side effects , including thickening patients ' blood , which increases the chances of suffering a heart attack or stroke . but that would n't put off some athletes looking to improve their performance by fractions of inches or seconds , diel said . " gene-doping specialists all say , ' there are too many side effects , i 'd never use that , " ' he added .
" but side effects have never concerned anyone interested in doping . " while diel says he 's confident pharmaceutical companies are n't producing drugs to help athletes dope , individuals are making new medicines available on the black market . " the companies do n't plan to make super drugs available to athletes , but when something is in development , there are people who will take a few pills and sell them for 20,000 or 30,000 euros -lrb- $ 28,100 - $ 42,300 -rrb- , " diel said . untraceable drugs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knocking out myosatin production leads to bigger muscles in mice a type of drug developed for patients suffering from degenerative diseases was designed to turn off the gene that makes the body create myosatin , a protein that inhibits muscle growth , and fend off muscle atrophy .

the attacks have been blamed on radical militia and raise concerns over their expanding power . with us involvement scaling down and most of the " coalition of the willing " now departed , iraq 's government inches closer each month to full responsibility for the country 's security , judiciary and public services .
but as the western forces , which invaded the country to overthrow saddam hussein and his cronies , prepare to leave iraq to its destiny as a fully sovereign state , there are growing concerns that the country could return to its pre-invasion brutality under a new militant power : the militias .
one of the most disturbing trends which point toward a creeping radicalism and the increased power of iraq 's militias has been highlighted in a new report by human rights watch -lrb- hrw -rrb- , published on monday .
according to the new york-based rights group , iraqi militias are increasingly torturing and executing men suspected of homosexuality but the authorities in baghdad are doing nothing to stop the violence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hrw report details brutal torture of gays in iraq the hrw report states that hundreds of men have been kidnapped , tortured and killed this year in a wave of violence that began in the baghdad sadr city stronghold of shiite cleric moqtada al-sadr 's mahdi army militia .
many bodies have been found with the arabic words for " pervert " and " puppy " - considered derogatory terms for homosexuals in iraq - written on their chests .
the report , released in lebanon and entitled " ' they want us exterminated : murder , torture , sexual orientation and gender in iraq ' , " says it is almost impossible to calculate how many men were killed , but estimates the figure to be in the hundreds .
opportunity knocks for powerful militia " unfortunately it 's not surprising that we 're hearing about these disgusting acts as reported by hrw as well as witnessing the current spate of bombings in iraq , " richard gowan , a middle east policy expert at the european council for foreign relations and author of various papers on iraq 's struggle for democracy , told deutsche welle .
" the country is in danger of becoming ever more fractious as the withdrawal of us forces gets closer . we 've seen this in crisis zones around the world .
when the occupying or peacekeeping forces pull out , there is an escalation of violence within the vacuum . "
" what we are seeing with these killings and bombings is the real power of the militias , " gowan added . " at the height of the insurgency in 2006 , the militias showed that they could give the us forces and the iraqi government a good run for their money .
things have changed and the iraqis are now better-equipped and trained but , as the hrw report shows , the militias can still act with impunity . " fear of feminization threat to iraq 's masculinity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many murders have taken place in al-sadr 's stronghold mahdi army spokesmen have suggested that military action was the remedy for the " feminization " of iraq men , according to the report in which survivors are quoted as saying militiamen invade homes and interrogate victims before killing them in order to identify other potential victims .
hrw said iraqi doctors and morgue employees also have records of grotesque torture marks on the bodies of men , including mutilation and even anuses glued shut .
motives for the murders include " fears that iraqi men 's masculinity is under threat , " hrw reported .
the report said men have fled to neighboring countries , despite consensual homosexual activity being illegal in states in the region such as egypt , jordan and lebanon , even though it is not a criminal offence under iraqi law .
it also said some of the murders were so-called honor killings , carried out by victims ' family members " because ' unmanly ' behavior threatens the reputation of the family or tribe . "
some iraqis interviewed by the rights group charged that , in some cases , members of the security forces had colluded and even joined in the killing .
" at some point during the insurgency , the government came to some agreement for an uneasy peace with the militias where the authorities maintained a certain amount of control and loyalty through bribery and the fact that they would let the militias do what they wanted , " gowan said .
" the hrw report shows that there is a real concern as to what effect this is having on iraqi society , where militias are allowed to brutalize their own communities while the government turns a blind eye . " " what the hrw report reminds us -lrb- of -rrb- is that the us strategy of creating a balancing act between the militias comes with its own set of problems , " he added . " this idea of supporting some militias and not others has been underpinning security policy in iraq for a couple of years now . the primary concern is that , when the americans leave , the balancing act will fail and we 'll see a fragmented iraq and a real threat of civil war . " government accused of turning a blind eye - and worse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the iraqi government somehow involved ?
scott long , director of hrw 's lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender rights program , laid a fair portion of the blame directly at the iraqi government 's feet , accusing it of abandoning the people .
" iraq 's leaders are supposed to defend all iraqis , not abandon them to armed agents of hate , " he said .
" turning a blind eye to torture and murder threatens the rights and life of every iraqi . "
richard gowan believes that iraqis themselves could do much to put pressure on the government to clamp down on the killings and the rise of the militias by pointing out the effects such activities could have on external investment .
" the strong media in iraq and the affluent middle class who want to be secure will put pressure on the government if things get further out of hand , " gowan said . " the many european nations and leaders who have shown an interest in investing in iraq have shown that the country has huge potential and any further scandals and shocks like we 've seen in the hrw report will want to be avoided , " he added . " that said , everyone with an interest in making money from iraq , both internal and external powers , will want to ignore reports like the hrw paper so as to avoid the embarrassing questions about the real state of iraq 's security and the failures of the western powers .

scott long , director of hrw 's lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender rights program , laid a fair portion of the blame directly at the iraqi government 's feet , accusing it of abandoning the people .
" iraq 's leaders are supposed to defend all iraqis , not abandon them to armed agents of hate , " he said .

" the strong media in iraq and the affluent middle class who want to be secure will put pressure on the government if things get further out of hand , " gowan said .

the attacks have been blamed on radical militia and raise concerns over their expanding power . with us involvement scaling down and most of the " coalition of the willing " now departed , iraq 's government inches closer each month to full responsibility for the country 's security , judiciary and public services .
but as the western forces , which invaded the country to overthrow saddam hussein and his cronies , prepare to leave iraq to its destiny as a fully sovereign state , there are growing concerns that the country could return to its pre-invasion brutality under a new militant power : the militias .
one of the most disturbing trends which point toward a creeping radicalism and the increased power of iraq 's militias has been highlighted in a new report by human rights watch -lrb- hrw -rrb- , published on monday .
according to the new york-based rights group , iraqi militias are increasingly torturing and executing men suspected of homosexuality but the authorities in baghdad are doing nothing to stop the violence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hrw report details brutal torture of gays in iraq the hrw report states that hundreds of men have been kidnapped , tortured and killed this year in a wave of violence that began in the baghdad sadr city stronghold of shiite cleric moqtada al-sadr 's mahdi army militia .
many bodies have been found with the arabic words for " pervert " and " puppy " - considered derogatory terms for homosexuals in iraq - written on their chests .
the report , released in lebanon and entitled " ' they want us exterminated : murder , torture , sexual orientation and gender in iraq ' , " says it is almost impossible to calculate how many men were killed , but estimates the figure to be in the hundreds .
opportunity knocks for powerful militia " unfortunately it 's not surprising that we 're hearing about these disgusting acts as reported by hrw as well as witnessing the current spate of bombings in iraq , " richard gowan , a middle east policy expert at the european council for foreign relations and author of various papers on iraq 's struggle for democracy , told deutsche welle .
" the country is in danger of becoming ever more fractious as the withdrawal of us forces gets closer . we 've seen this in crisis zones around the world .
when the occupying or peacekeeping forces pull out , there is an escalation of violence within the vacuum . "
" what we are seeing with these killings and bombings is the real power of the militias , " gowan added . " at the height of the insurgency in 2006 , the militias showed that they could give the us forces and the iraqi government a good run for their money .
things have changed and the iraqis are now better-equipped and trained but , as the hrw report shows , the militias can still act with impunity . " fear of feminization threat to iraq 's masculinity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many murders have taken place in al-sadr 's stronghold mahdi army spokesmen have suggested that military action was the remedy for the " feminization " of iraq men , according to the report in which survivors are quoted as saying militiamen invade homes and interrogate victims before killing them in order to identify other potential victims .
hrw said iraqi doctors and morgue employees also have records of grotesque torture marks on the bodies of men , including mutilation and even anuses glued shut .
motives for the murders include " fears that iraqi men 's masculinity is under threat , " hrw reported .
the report said men have fled to neighboring countries , despite consensual homosexual activity being illegal in states in the region such as egypt , jordan and lebanon , even though it is not a criminal offence under iraqi law .
it also said some of the murders were so-called honor killings , carried out by victims ' family members " because ' unmanly ' behavior threatens the reputation of the family or tribe . "
some iraqis interviewed by the rights group charged that , in some cases , members of the security forces had colluded and even joined in the killing .
" at some point during the insurgency , the government came to some agreement for an uneasy peace with the militias where the authorities maintained a certain amount of control and loyalty through bribery and the fact that they would let the militias do what they wanted , " gowan said .
" the hrw report shows that there is a real concern as to what effect this is having on iraqi society , where militias are allowed to brutalize their own communities while the government turns a blind eye . " " what the hrw report reminds us -lrb- of -rrb- is that the us strategy of creating a balancing act between the militias comes with its own set of problems , " he added .

this would make it an incredible exception in the economic crisis .

but has the mystery surrounding the ship 's disappearance been solved ? the fate of the bulk carrier arctic sea and its 15-man russian crew has been cloaked in mystery since the ship went missing in european waters two weeks ago , sparking speculation of foul play or even a secret cargo targeted by pirates or spies .
russian defense minister anatoly serdyukov told president dmitry medvedev on monday that the 4,000-ton ship had been found and that the crew were safe after being taken aboard a navy anti-submarine ship .
" today at 1 am moscow time , the ship was found 300 miles off the cape verde islands , " serdyukov told medvedev during a presidential visit to the southern russian city of astrakhan .
however , he gave no details of how the vessel had been found or why it had disappeared in the first place .
" debriefing is under way to clarify all aspects of the disappearance and loss of signal from this vessel , " serdyukov said .
the russian minister promised to reveal more details later .
navy scoured the atlantic the kremlin had ordered warships and submarines to scour the atlantic for the arctic sea , whose last contact with its finland-based operator was on august 1 off portugal .
the maltese-registered vessel , which was carrying a cargo of timber worth over one million euros -lrb- $ 1.4 million -rrb- , was supposed to have docked on august 4 in the algerian port of bejaia but never arrived .

many eastern europeans came to the small island in the north atlantic to work on construction projects . most of them have left the country since iceland 's economic collapse , and many icelanders have decided to follow them in search for a better future abroad . most of them are eager to avoid pay cuts , tax hikes and the higher unemployment figures expected to hit the country once the summer is over . preferred destination : norway most of the emigrants are heading to norway , where around 1,000 icelanders are expected before this year is over .
for a country with just a little over 300,000 inhabitants , this is not a small number .
craftspeople and technicians have particularly good chances of finding a new job . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : atli and rosa are determined to leave iceland atli steinn gudmundsson , 35 , and his fiancee rosa want to emigrate to norway or holland as soon as the atli completes his ma degree at the university of iceland .
“ half of our friends have already moved to norway , " he says . " and the rest , when you bring up the subject of moving to another country , they never totally reject it . " atli says he refuses to stay in iceland to help pay off the huge international debts with his tax money , arguing that the current difficult situation is not his fault " but that of the bankers and politicians . " is brain drain a serious problem ? following the collapse of iceland ’ s financial system and the dramatic fall of the local currency , the krona , many of the nation 's young professionals are opting to go back to university in england or the us instead of spending the next bleak winter in iceland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iceland 's business minister gylfi magnusson is concerned about emigration for business minister gylfi magnusson these prospects are rather unpleasant : “ it would be pretty devastating if one result of all of this was that iceland ’ s best and brightest would leave or that icelanders that are now studying abroad would not return . ” at the same time , magnusson says he hopes the rate of emigration will slow , stating that the long run prospects for iceland are not that bad : " countries all over the world are also having problems , so it may not be that there are such great opportunities abroad either . " no time to wait for economic upswing compared to last year , the number of household and furniture transports out of iceland is up 20 percent , while a third less is being transported into iceland . many highly qualified employees in iceland have lost their jobs in the past months and they have no time to wait for an economic upswing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the emigration wave means plenty of houses are on the market in iceland jakob lindal , co-owner of an architectural firm on the outskirts of reykjavik , sees this as a huge problem .
he and his business partner had to lay off their staff immediately after the collapse but always intended to bring the team back together as soon as possible .
now , time is running out , says lindal : “ one is on his way to jamaica , one is out farming , helping out a farmer up north and another one is in norway .
if we can ’ t get them back in the next few months , they are gone . ” author : susanne henn editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russian defense minister anatoly serdyukov told president dmitry medvedev on monday that the 4,000-ton ship had been found and that the crew were safe after being taken aboard a navy anti-submarine ship .
" today at 1 am moscow time , the ship was found 300 miles off the cape verde islands , " serdyukov told medvedev during a presidential visit to the southern russian city of astrakhan .
however , he gave no details of how the vessel had been found or why it had disappeared in the first place .

many eastern europeans came to the small island in the north atlantic to work on construction projects . most of them have left the country since iceland 's economic collapse , and many icelanders have decided to follow them in search for a better future abroad . most of them are eager to avoid pay cuts , tax hikes and the higher unemployment figures expected to hit the country once the summer is over . preferred destination : norway most of the emigrants are heading to norway , where around 1,000 icelanders are expected before this year is over .
for a country with just a little over 300,000 inhabitants , this is not a small number .
craftspeople and technicians have particularly good chances of finding a new job . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : atli and rosa are determined to leave iceland atli steinn gudmundsson , 35 , and his fiancee rosa want to emigrate to norway or holland as soon as the atli completes his ma degree at the university of iceland .
“ half of our friends have already moved to norway , " he says . " and the rest , when you bring up the subject of moving to another country , they never totally reject it . " atli says he refuses to stay in iceland to help pay off the huge international debts with his tax money , arguing that the current difficult situation is not his fault " but that of the bankers and politicians . " is brain drain a serious problem ? following the collapse of iceland ’ s financial system and the dramatic fall of the local currency , the krona , many of the nation 's young professionals are opting to go back to university in england or the us instead of spending the next bleak winter in iceland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iceland 's business minister gylfi magnusson is concerned about emigration for business minister gylfi magnusson these prospects are rather unpleasant : “ it would be pretty devastating if one result of all of this was that iceland ’ s best and brightest would leave or that icelanders that are now studying abroad would not return . ” at the same time , magnusson says he hopes the rate of emigration will slow , stating that the long run prospects for iceland are not that bad : " countries all over the world are also having problems , so it may not be that there are such great opportunities abroad either . " no time to wait for economic upswing compared to last year , the number of household and furniture transports out of iceland is up 20 percent , while a third less is being transported into iceland . many highly qualified employees in iceland have lost their jobs in the past months and they have no time to wait for an economic upswing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the emigration wave means plenty of houses are on the market in iceland jakob lindal , co-owner of an architectural firm on the outskirts of reykjavik , sees this as a huge problem .
he and his business partner had to lay off their staff immediately after the collapse but always intended to bring the team back together as soon as possible .
now , time is running out , says lindal : “ one is on his way to jamaica , one is out farming , helping out a farmer up north and another one is in norway .
if we can ’ t get them back in the next few months , they are gone . ” author : susanne henn editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but has the mystery surrounding the ship 's disappearance been solved ? the fate of the bulk carrier arctic sea and its 15-man russian crew has been cloaked in mystery since the ship went missing in european waters two weeks ago , sparking speculation of foul play or even a secret cargo targeted by pirates or spies .
russian defense minister anatoly serdyukov told president dmitry medvedev on monday that the 4,000-ton ship had been found and that the crew were safe after being taken aboard a navy anti-submarine ship .
" today at 1 am moscow time , the ship was found 300 miles off the cape verde islands , " serdyukov told medvedev during a presidential visit to the southern russian city of astrakhan .
however , he gave no details of how the vessel had been found or why it had disappeared in the first place .
" debriefing is under way to clarify all aspects of the disappearance and loss of signal from this vessel , " serdyukov said .
the russian minister promised to reveal more details later .
navy scoured the atlantic the kremlin had ordered warships and submarines to scour the atlantic for the arctic sea , whose last contact with its finland-based operator was on august 1 off portugal .
the maltese-registered vessel , which was carrying a cargo of timber worth over one million euros -lrb- $ 1.4 million -rrb- , was supposed to have docked on august 4 in the algerian port of bejaia but never arrived .
there were concerns for the crew after maltese maritime officials said they had received reports that armed men wearing masks and posing as anti-drugs police had boarded the ship in swedish waters on july 24 .
they also said crew members had been assaulted , gagged and blindfolded , and some were seriously hurt .
in comments to the media , serdyukov did not say if the crew members had been held against their will .
piracy in european waters would be almost unprecedented in modern times , though a wave of hijackings has plagued shipping off somalia. rb / reuters / afp / ap editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but emergencies ministry spokeswoman irina butenko told reuters : " there is no danger to the population . "
explosion is not ruled out she said authorities were not ruling out the possibility that an explosion caused the accident .
but russian news agencies reported a water surge was the most likely cause .
the sayano-shushenskaya plant provides power to nearby major aluminum smelters operated by rusal , russia 's largest aluminium producer .
production was halted temporarily at some aluminium smelters , but a rusal spokeswoman said all their plants are now being supplied by other electricity producers and are working normally .
water flooded the hall when a wall collapsed , after a sudden change in pressure caused the pipes feeding water to the hydro plant to burst .
no damage to dam local officials have said there is no danger to the dam .
" the body of the dam has not been damaged , " said spokesman dmitry kydryavtsev .
there was some panic among the local population and officials were reportedly trying to calm the situation .

the attacks have been blamed on radical militia and raise concerns over their expanding power . with us involvement scaling down and most of the " coalition of the willing " now departed , iraq 's government inches closer each month to full responsibility for the country 's security , judiciary and public services .
but as the western forces , which invaded the country to overthrow saddam hussein and his cronies , prepare to leave iraq to its destiny as a fully sovereign state , there are growing concerns that the country could return to its pre-invasion brutality under a new militant power : the militias .
one of the most disturbing trends which point toward a creeping radicalism and the increased power of iraq 's militias has been highlighted in a new report by human rights watch -lrb- hrw -rrb- , published on monday .
according to the new york-based rights group , iraqi militias are increasingly torturing and executing men suspected of homosexuality but the authorities in baghdad are doing nothing to stop the violence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hrw report details brutal torture of gays in iraq the hrw report states that hundreds of men have been kidnapped , tortured and killed this year in a wave of violence that began in the baghdad sadr city stronghold of shiite cleric moqtada al-sadr 's mahdi army militia .
many bodies have been found with the arabic words for " pervert " and " puppy " - considered derogatory terms for homosexuals in iraq - written on their chests .
the report , released in lebanon and entitled " ' they want us exterminated : murder , torture , sexual orientation and gender in iraq ' , " says it is almost impossible to calculate how many men were killed , but estimates the figure to be in the hundreds .
opportunity knocks for powerful militia " unfortunately it 's not surprising that we 're hearing about these disgusting acts as reported by hrw as well as witnessing the current spate of bombings in iraq , " richard gowan , a middle east policy expert at the european council for foreign relations and author of various papers on iraq 's struggle for democracy , told deutsche welle .
" the country is in danger of becoming ever more fractious as the withdrawal of us forces gets closer . we 've seen this in crisis zones around the world .
when the occupying or peacekeeping forces pull out , there is an escalation of violence within the vacuum . "
" what we are seeing with these killings and bombings is the real power of the militias , " gowan added . " at the height of the insurgency in 2006 , the militias showed that they could give the us forces and the iraqi government a good run for their money .
things have changed and the iraqis are now better-equipped and trained but , as the hrw report shows , the militias can still act with impunity . " fear of feminization threat to iraq 's masculinity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many murders have taken place in al-sadr 's stronghold mahdi army spokesmen have suggested that military action was the remedy for the " feminization " of iraq men , according to the report in which survivors are quoted as saying militiamen invade homes and interrogate victims before killing them in order to identify other potential victims .
hrw said iraqi doctors and morgue employees also have records of grotesque torture marks on the bodies of men , including mutilation and even anuses glued shut .
motives for the murders include " fears that iraqi men 's masculinity is under threat , " hrw reported .
the report said men have fled to neighboring countries , despite consensual homosexual activity being illegal in states in the region such as egypt , jordan and lebanon , even though it is not a criminal offence under iraqi law .
it also said some of the murders were so-called honor killings , carried out by victims ' family members " because ' unmanly ' behavior threatens the reputation of the family or tribe . "
some iraqis interviewed by the rights group charged that , in some cases , members of the security forces had colluded and even joined in the killing .
" at some point during the insurgency , the government came to some agreement for an uneasy peace with the militias where the authorities maintained a certain amount of control and loyalty through bribery and the fact that they would let the militias do what they wanted , " gowan said .
" the hrw report shows that there is a real concern as to what effect this is having on iraqi society , where militias are allowed to brutalize their own communities while the government turns a blind eye . " " what the hrw report reminds us -lrb- of -rrb- is that the us strategy of creating a balancing act between the militias comes with its own set of problems , " he added . " this idea of supporting some militias and not others has been underpinning security policy in iraq for a couple of years now . the primary concern is that , when the americans leave , the balancing act will fail and we 'll see a fragmented iraq and a real threat of civil war . " government accused of turning a blind eye - and worse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the iraqi government somehow involved ?
scott long , director of hrw 's lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender rights program , laid a fair portion of the blame directly at the iraqi government 's feet , accusing it of abandoning the people .
" iraq 's leaders are supposed to defend all iraqis , not abandon them to armed agents of hate , " he said .
" turning a blind eye to torture and murder threatens the rights and life of every iraqi . "
richard gowan believes that iraqis themselves could do much to put pressure on the government to clamp down on the killings and the rise of the militias by pointing out the effects such activities could have on external investment .
" the strong media in iraq and the affluent middle class who want to be secure will put pressure on the government if things get further out of hand , " gowan said . " the many european nations and leaders who have shown an interest in investing in iraq have shown that the country has huge potential and any further scandals and shocks like we 've seen in the hrw report will want to be avoided , " he added . " that said , everyone with an interest in making money from iraq , both internal and external powers , will want to ignore reports like the hrw paper so as to avoid the embarrassing questions about the real state of iraq 's security and the failures of the western powers .

hrw said iraqi doctors and morgue employees also have records of grotesque torture marks on the bodies of men , including mutilation and even anuses glued shut .
motives for the murders include " fears that iraqi men 's masculinity is under threat , " hrw reported .
the report said men have fled to neighboring countries , despite consensual homosexual activity being illegal in states in the region such as egypt , jordan and lebanon , even though it is not a criminal offence under iraqi law .
it also said some of the murders were so-called honor killings , carried out by victims ' family members " because ' unmanly ' behavior threatens the reputation of the family or tribe . "
some iraqis interviewed by the rights group charged that , in some cases , members of the security forces had colluded and even joined in the killing .
" at some point during the insurgency , the government came to some agreement for an uneasy peace with the militias where the authorities maintained a certain amount of control and loyalty through bribery and the fact that they would let the militias do what they wanted , " gowan said .
" the hrw report shows that there is a real concern as to what effect this is having on iraqi society , where militias are allowed to brutalize their own communities while the government turns a blind eye . " " what the hrw report reminds us -lrb- of -rrb- is that the us strategy of creating a balancing act between the militias comes with its own set of problems , " he added . " this idea of supporting some militias and not others has been underpinning security policy in iraq for a couple of years now . the primary concern is that , when the americans leave , the balancing act will fail and we 'll see a fragmented iraq and a real threat of civil war . " government accused of turning a blind eye - and worse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the iraqi government somehow involved ?
scott long , director of hrw 's lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender rights program , laid a fair portion of the blame directly at the iraqi government 's feet , accusing it of abandoning the people .
" iraq 's leaders are supposed to defend all iraqis , not abandon them to armed agents of hate , " he said .
" turning a blind eye to torture and murder threatens the rights and life of every iraqi . "
richard gowan believes that iraqis themselves could do much to put pressure on the government to clamp down on the killings and the rise of the militias by pointing out the effects such activities could have on external investment .
" the strong media in iraq and the affluent middle class who want to be secure will put pressure on the government if things get further out of hand , " gowan said . " the many european nations and leaders who have shown an interest in investing in iraq have shown that the country has huge potential and any further scandals and shocks like we 've seen in the hrw report will want to be avoided , " he added . " that said , everyone with an interest in making money from iraq , both internal and external powers , will want to ignore reports like the hrw paper so as to avoid the embarrassing questions about the real state of iraq 's security and the failures of the western powers .

many eastern europeans came to the small island in the north atlantic to work on construction projects . most of them have left the country since iceland 's economic collapse , and many icelanders have decided to follow them in search for a better future abroad . most of them are eager to avoid pay cuts , tax hikes and the higher unemployment figures expected to hit the country once the summer is over . preferred destination : norway most of the emigrants are heading to norway , where around 1,000 icelanders are expected before this year is over .
for a country with just a little over 300,000 inhabitants , this is not a small number .
craftspeople and technicians have particularly good chances of finding a new job . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : atli and rosa are determined to leave iceland atli steinn gudmundsson , 35 , and his fiancee rosa want to emigrate to norway or holland as soon as the atli completes his ma degree at the university of iceland .
“ half of our friends have already moved to norway , " he says . " and the rest , when you bring up the subject of moving to another country , they never totally reject it . " atli says he refuses to stay in iceland to help pay off the huge international debts with his tax money , arguing that the current difficult situation is not his fault " but that of the bankers and politicians . " is brain drain a serious problem ? following the collapse of iceland ’ s financial system and the dramatic fall of the local currency , the krona , many of the nation 's young professionals are opting to go back to university in england or the us instead of spending the next bleak winter in iceland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iceland 's business minister gylfi magnusson is concerned about emigration for business minister gylfi magnusson these prospects are rather unpleasant : “ it would be pretty devastating if one result of all of this was that iceland ’ s best and brightest would leave or that icelanders that are now studying abroad would not return . ” at the same time , magnusson says he hopes the rate of emigration will slow , stating that the long run prospects for iceland are not that bad : " countries all over the world are also having problems , so it may not be that there are such great opportunities abroad either . " no time to wait for economic upswing compared to last year , the number of household and furniture transports out of iceland is up 20 percent , while a third less is being transported into iceland . many highly qualified employees in iceland have lost their jobs in the past months and they have no time to wait for an economic upswing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the emigration wave means plenty of houses are on the market in iceland jakob lindal , co-owner of an architectural firm on the outskirts of reykjavik , sees this as a huge problem .
he and his business partner had to lay off their staff immediately after the collapse but always intended to bring the team back together as soon as possible .
now , time is running out , says lindal : “ one is on his way to jamaica , one is out farming , helping out a farmer up north and another one is in norway .

the attacks have been blamed on radical militia and raise concerns over their expanding power . with us involvement scaling down and most of the " coalition of the willing " now departed , iraq 's government inches closer each month to full responsibility for the country 's security , judiciary and public services .
but as the western forces , which invaded the country to overthrow saddam hussein and his cronies , prepare to leave iraq to its destiny as a fully sovereign state , there are growing concerns that the country could return to its pre-invasion brutality under a new militant power : the militias .
one of the most disturbing trends which point toward a creeping radicalism and the increased power of iraq 's militias has been highlighted in a new report by human rights watch -lrb- hrw -rrb- , published on monday .
according to the new york-based rights group , iraqi militias are increasingly torturing and executing men suspected of homosexuality but the authorities in baghdad are doing nothing to stop the violence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hrw report details brutal torture of gays in iraq the hrw report states that hundreds of men have been kidnapped , tortured and killed this year in a wave of violence that began in the baghdad sadr city stronghold of shiite cleric moqtada al-sadr 's mahdi army militia .
many bodies have been found with the arabic words for " pervert " and " puppy " - considered derogatory terms for homosexuals in iraq - written on their chests .
the report , released in lebanon and entitled " ' they want us exterminated : murder , torture , sexual orientation and gender in iraq ' , " says it is almost impossible to calculate how many men were killed , but estimates the figure to be in the hundreds .
opportunity knocks for powerful militia " unfortunately it 's not surprising that we 're hearing about these disgusting acts as reported by hrw as well as witnessing the current spate of bombings in iraq , " richard gowan , a middle east policy expert at the european council for foreign relations and author of various papers on iraq 's struggle for democracy , told deutsche welle .
" the country is in danger of becoming ever more fractious as the withdrawal of us forces gets closer . we 've seen this in crisis zones around the world .
when the occupying or peacekeeping forces pull out , there is an escalation of violence within the vacuum . "
" what we are seeing with these killings and bombings is the real power of the militias , " gowan added . " at the height of the insurgency in 2006 , the militias showed that they could give the us forces and the iraqi government a good run for their money .
things have changed and the iraqis are now better-equipped and trained but , as the hrw report shows , the militias can still act with impunity .

" our form today was very good .
i was surprised how clearly we dominated the first 45 minutes , " said magath .
" we did n't expect to win so clearly and without any major problems " .
schalke had the lion 's share of possession and took the lead after 38 minutes with a goal from 19-year-old midfielder christoph moritz , who was making his debut in gelsenkirchen .
just before half-time the royal blues scored their second goal after ivan rakitic set up for german international heiko westermann to give the hosts a 2-nil lead .
in the second half , schalke 's victory was never in jeopardy .
fifteen minutes from the final whistle jeffersson farfan completed the 3-nil scoreline to give schalke their second win of the season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gladbach 's coach michael frontzeck -lrb- r -rrb- talks with karim matmour in the day 's other game , hertha berlin dominated play but found themselves a goal down after 23 minutes when roel brouwers converted gladbach 's first chance of the game , heading in a tobias levels cross .
their second goal came seven minutes after the break through matmour , who calmly slotted home a pinpoint pass from oliver neuville .
hertha immediately pulled one back through gajko kacar , forcing in a raffael corner from four meters out but it was too little , too late .
gladbach , who struggled last season to avoid relegation , move up to fourth on four points , level with hamburg , bayer leverkusen and eintracht frankfurt .
for gladbach 's michael frontzeck it was his first victory since taking over as coach at the start of the season .
saturday 's matches in saturday 's bundesliga action defending champions wolfsburg maintained their perfect start to the bundesliga season with a come-from-behind victory away to cologne .

fabrice ehret gave cologne the lead four minutes into the second interval , but edin dzeko equalized for wolfsburg on 74 minutes .
wolfsburg then grabbed the lead when pierre wome netted in his own goal a minute later .
substitute obafemi martins made it 3-1 with three minutes remaining , all but destroying hopes of a late cologne comeback .
the clash between hamburg and dortmund promised fireworks and after a frantic first 12 minutes the match seemed to be heading in that direction .
hamburg 's guy demel tapped in after just three minutes to put the home side ahead , but dortmund leveled just two minutes later through nelson valdez .
that goal was soon nullified however by quick strikes from new purchase ze roberto and jose paolo guerrero .
substitute marcus berg was on the pitch just three minutes when he scored a fourth goal for hamburg to give bruno labbadia 's men an unassailable three goal buffer .
lanig out vfb stuttgart meanwhile bounced back from a loss to wolfsburg last week with a 4-2 victory over neighbors sc freiburg .
the home side took control after a goalless first half when new russian signing pavel pogrebnyak netted his first goal for stuttgart on the 53 minute mark .
pogrebnyak was also involved in stuttgart 's second on 65 minutes when the striker was judged to have been fouled in the area by freiburg goalkeeper manuel salz .
substitute elson slotted home the resultant spot-kick .
mohamadou idrissou gave freiburg hope with a header but elson responded almost immediately with a superb strike from outside the area 14 minutes from time to make it 3-1 .
there was still time for idrissou to reduce the deficit once again but julian shieber made it 4-2 a minute from time to ensure markus babbel 's side all three points .

however , he gave no details of how the vessel had been found or why it had disappeared in the first place .

even german tourists have caught lotto fever . the italian superenalotto draw should have taken place on saturday .
but due to a public holiday , it will now take place on monday .
since january , italians have been trying in vain to guess the superenalotto 's winning six-number combination .
draws are held three times a week .
for 83 draws , no one has come up with the winning six numbers .
the chances of guessing the correct combination are an astronomical 623 million to one .
not just locals but also tourists in italy have been playing the superenalotto .
foreigners from neighboring france , austria and slovenia have been driving into italy to snatch up tickets .
in germany , the mass-circulation bild newspaper sponsored a phone-in competition , giving 140 germans a chance to win free flights to italy so they could buy tickets for the last lottery draw .
the winners took a plane from berlin to milan , bought their tickets at a cost of one euro -lrb- us $ 1.74 -rrb- each at an airport cigarette shop - and then flew back home . sc / wl / ap / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dozens are missing . the accident in the eastern siberian region of khakassia shut down the sayano-shushenskaya hydroelectric plant on the yenisei river .
casualty figures from russian press sources varied , but the latest showed at least 12 dead , over a dozen injured , and up to 72 missing .

explosion is not ruled out she said authorities were not ruling out the possibility that an explosion caused the accident .
but russian news agencies reported a water surge was the most likely cause .
the sayano-shushenskaya plant provides power to nearby major aluminum smelters operated by rusal , russia 's largest aluminium producer .
production was halted temporarily at some aluminium smelters , but a rusal spokeswoman said all their plants are now being supplied by other electricity producers and are working normally .
water flooded the hall when a wall collapsed , after a sudden change in pressure caused the pipes feeding water to the hydro plant to burst .
no damage to dam local officials have said there is no danger to the dam .
" the body of the dam has not been damaged , " said spokesman dmitry kydryavtsev .
there was some panic among the local population and officials were reportedly trying to calm the situation .

many eastern europeans came to the small island in the north atlantic to work on construction projects . most of them have left the country since iceland 's economic collapse , and many icelanders have decided to follow them in search for a better future abroad . most of them are eager to avoid pay cuts , tax hikes and the higher unemployment figures expected to hit the country once the summer is over . preferred destination : norway most of the emigrants are heading to norway , where around 1,000 icelanders are expected before this year is over .
for a country with just a little over 300,000 inhabitants , this is not a small number .
craftspeople and technicians have particularly good chances of finding a new job . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : atli and rosa are determined to leave iceland atli steinn gudmundsson , 35 , and his fiancee rosa want to emigrate to norway or holland as soon as the atli completes his ma degree at the university of iceland .
“ half of our friends have already moved to norway , " he says . " and the rest , when you bring up the subject of moving to another country , they never totally reject it . " atli says he refuses to stay in iceland to help pay off the huge international debts with his tax money , arguing that the current difficult situation is not his fault " but that of the bankers and politicians . " is brain drain a serious problem ? following the collapse of iceland ’ s financial system and the dramatic fall of the local currency , the krona , many of the nation 's young professionals are opting to go back to university in england or the us instead of spending the next bleak winter in iceland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iceland 's business minister gylfi magnusson is concerned about emigration for business minister gylfi magnusson these prospects are rather unpleasant : “ it would be pretty devastating if one result of all of this was that iceland ’ s best and brightest would leave or that icelanders that are now studying abroad would not return . ” at the same time , magnusson says he hopes the rate of emigration will slow , stating that the long run prospects for iceland are not that bad : " countries all over the world are also having problems , so it may not be that there are such great opportunities abroad either . " no time to wait for economic upswing compared to last year , the number of household and furniture transports out of iceland is up 20 percent , while a third less is being transported into iceland . many highly qualified employees in iceland have lost their jobs in the past months and they have no time to wait for an economic upswing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the emigration wave means plenty of houses are on the market in iceland jakob lindal , co-owner of an architectural firm on the outskirts of reykjavik , sees this as a huge problem .
he and his business partner had to lay off their staff immediately after the collapse but always intended to bring the team back together as soon as possible .
now , time is running out , says lindal : “ one is on his way to jamaica , one is out farming , helping out a farmer up north and another one is in norway .
if we can ’ t get them back in the next few months , they are gone . ” author : susanne henn editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but some are finding it difficult to get their economies back on track . analysts say many european countries have begun to slowly pull themselves out of the economic doldrums .
yet for some regions , such as the baltics , recovery will likely be painfully slow .
“ poland and slovakia have fared better than their neighbors in the second quarter this year compared to the first quarter , ” romanian economic analyst aurelian dochia told afp .
“ the baltic countries are facing the worst situation , while romania , bulgaria and hungary are somewhere in-between . ”
notable improvers poland performed relatively well due to its solid economic structure and its large domestic market .
“ this could compensate for the steep fall in exports , ” dochia said .
poland expects gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- growth of 1.0 percent this year .
this would make it an incredible exception in the economic crisis .
the international monetary fund , however , believes poland 's economy will likely shrink by 0.7 percent .
slovakia grew 2.2 percent in the second quarter , largely due to cash rebate programs in its main car export markets .
" it 's good news , ” said juraj valachy , an analyst with tatra bank .
“ the economic results were better than we expected . "
slovakia is managing " to stay competitive " by keeping salaries relatively low as part of its bid to join the euro zone , explained dochia .
the czech republic grew 0.3 percent in the second quarter , announcing it was emerging , like germany and france , from recession .
" we already hit the bottom in the first quarter of this year , " said helena horska , a prague-based analyst with austrian lender raiffeisenbank .
doing better , but not great bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : budapest is struggling with the financial crisis and soaring unemployment hungary was the first nation in the european union to turn to the imf for help last year and remains in recession with unemployment rising .
according to official data , hungary 's economy contracted 2.1 percent in the second quarter this year .
that 's a slight improvement over a first quarter contraction of 2.6 percent and could indicate a possible bottoming out .
romania 's economy shrank by 2.1 percent in the second quarter .
that 's also an improvement on the first quarter contraction of 4.6 percent .
bucharest , however , is facing huge budgetary constraints and is struggling to pay salaries and pensions .
the government is forcing state employees to take 10 days of unpaid leave to trim the public deficit .
analysts say while it 's too early to talk about a recovery , they do expect the decline to reverse in the next few months .
bulgaria also has to sharply cut the public deficit .
the government has announced plans to cut public spending by 15 percent and to crack down on customs fraud to raise revenue .
the baltic nations are in deep lithuania , until last year , enjoyed a reputation as a european union " tiger , " but now is deeper into recession than any other eu nation .
lithuania 's central bank predicts its economy will contract by 19.3 percent in 2009 compared with 2008 .
the baltic state 's economy shrank by 12.3 percent in the second quarter , after shrinking 10.2 percent in the first three months prior .
all eyes are now on how the new government plans to rein in public spending .
lithuania has , so far , avoided following latvia and other eastern european economies in seeking a bailout from the international monetary fund and the eu .
vilnius may be forced to seek help if it fails to raise more money from foreign capital markets to prop up the economy .

dozens are missing . the accident in the eastern siberian region of khakassia shut down the sayano-shushenskaya hydroelectric plant on the yenisei river .
casualty figures from russian press sources varied , but the latest showed at least 12 dead , over a dozen injured , and up to 72 missing .
but emergencies ministry spokeswoman irina butenko told reuters : " there is no danger to the population . "
explosion is not ruled out she said authorities were not ruling out the possibility that an explosion caused the accident .
but russian news agencies reported a water surge was the most likely cause .
the sayano-shushenskaya plant provides power to nearby major aluminum smelters operated by rusal , russia 's largest aluminium producer .
production was halted temporarily at some aluminium smelters , but a rusal spokeswoman said all their plants are now being supplied by other electricity producers and are working normally .
water flooded the hall when a wall collapsed , after a sudden change in pressure caused the pipes feeding water to the hydro plant to burst .
no damage to dam local officials have said there is no danger to the dam .
" the body of the dam has not been damaged , " said spokesman dmitry kydryavtsev .
there was some panic among the local population and officials were reportedly trying to calm the situation .
the plant , which opened in 1978 , is run by rushydro and a spokesman said that repairs will take several weeks. av / jen / reuters / afp / dpa editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the attacks have been blamed on radical militia and raise concerns over their expanding power . with us involvement scaling down and most of the " coalition of the willing " now departed , iraq 's government inches closer each month to full responsibility for the country 's security , judiciary and public services .
but as the western forces , which invaded the country to overthrow saddam hussein and his cronies , prepare to leave iraq to its destiny as a fully sovereign state , there are growing concerns that the country could return to its pre-invasion brutality under a new militant power : the militias .
one of the most disturbing trends which point toward a creeping radicalism and the increased power of iraq 's militias has been highlighted in a new report by human rights watch -lrb- hrw -rrb- , published on monday .
according to the new york-based rights group , iraqi militias are increasingly torturing and executing men suspected of homosexuality but the authorities in baghdad are doing nothing to stop the violence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hrw report details brutal torture of gays in iraq the hrw report states that hundreds of men have been kidnapped , tortured and killed this year in a wave of violence that began in the baghdad sadr city stronghold of shiite cleric moqtada al-sadr 's mahdi army militia .
many bodies have been found with the arabic words for " pervert " and " puppy " - considered derogatory terms for homosexuals in iraq - written on their chests .
the report , released in lebanon and entitled " ' they want us exterminated : murder , torture , sexual orientation and gender in iraq ' , " says it is almost impossible to calculate how many men were killed , but estimates the figure to be in the hundreds .
opportunity knocks for powerful militia " unfortunately it 's not surprising that we 're hearing about these disgusting acts as reported by hrw as well as witnessing the current spate of bombings in iraq , " richard gowan , a middle east policy expert at the european council for foreign relations and author of various papers on iraq 's struggle for democracy , told deutsche welle .
" the country is in danger of becoming ever more fractious as the withdrawal of us forces gets closer . we 've seen this in crisis zones around the world .
when the occupying or peacekeeping forces pull out , there is an escalation of violence within the vacuum . "
" what we are seeing with these killings and bombings is the real power of the militias , " gowan added . " at the height of the insurgency in 2006 , the militias showed that they could give the us forces and the iraqi government a good run for their money .
things have changed and the iraqis are now better-equipped and trained but , as the hrw report shows , the militias can still act with impunity . " fear of feminization threat to iraq 's masculinity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many murders have taken place in al-sadr 's stronghold mahdi army spokesmen have suggested that military action was the remedy for the " feminization " of iraq men , according to the report in which survivors are quoted as saying militiamen invade homes and interrogate victims before killing them in order to identify other potential victims .
hrw said iraqi doctors and morgue employees also have records of grotesque torture marks on the bodies of men , including mutilation and even anuses glued shut .
motives for the murders include " fears that iraqi men 's masculinity is under threat , " hrw reported .
the report said men have fled to neighboring countries , despite consensual homosexual activity being illegal in states in the region such as egypt , jordan and lebanon , even though it is not a criminal offence under iraqi law .
it also said some of the murders were so-called honor killings , carried out by victims ' family members " because ' unmanly ' behavior threatens the reputation of the family or tribe . "
some iraqis interviewed by the rights group charged that , in some cases , members of the security forces had colluded and even joined in the killing .
" at some point during the insurgency , the government came to some agreement for an uneasy peace with the militias where the authorities maintained a certain amount of control and loyalty through bribery and the fact that they would let the militias do what they wanted , " gowan said .
" the hrw report shows that there is a real concern as to what effect this is having on iraqi society , where militias are allowed to brutalize their own communities while the government turns a blind eye . " " what the hrw report reminds us -lrb- of -rrb- is that the us strategy of creating a balancing act between the militias comes with its own set of problems , " he added . " this idea of supporting some militias and not others has been underpinning security policy in iraq for a couple of years now . the primary concern is that , when the americans leave , the balancing act will fail and we 'll see a fragmented iraq and a real threat of civil war . " government accused of turning a blind eye - and worse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the iraqi government somehow involved ?
scott long , director of hrw 's lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender rights program , laid a fair portion of the blame directly at the iraqi government 's feet , accusing it of abandoning the people .
" iraq 's leaders are supposed to defend all iraqis , not abandon them to armed agents of hate , " he said .
" turning a blind eye to torture and murder threatens the rights and life of every iraqi . "
richard gowan believes that iraqis themselves could do much to put pressure on the government to clamp down on the killings and the rise of the militias by pointing out the effects such activities could have on external investment .
" the strong media in iraq and the affluent middle class who want to be secure will put pressure on the government if things get further out of hand , " gowan said . " the many european nations and leaders who have shown an interest in investing in iraq have shown that the country has huge potential and any further scandals and shocks like we 've seen in the hrw report will want to be avoided , " he added . " that said , everyone with an interest in making money from iraq , both internal and external powers , will want to ignore reports like the hrw paper so as to avoid the embarrassing questions about the real state of iraq 's security and the failures of the western powers .

the attacks have been blamed on radical militia and raise concerns over their expanding power . with us involvement scaling down and most of the " coalition of the willing " now departed , iraq 's government inches closer each month to full responsibility for the country 's security , judiciary and public services .
but as the western forces , which invaded the country to overthrow saddam hussein and his cronies , prepare to leave iraq to its destiny as a fully sovereign state , there are growing concerns that the country could return to its pre-invasion brutality under a new militant power : the militias .
one of the most disturbing trends which point toward a creeping radicalism and the increased power of iraq 's militias has been highlighted in a new report by human rights watch -lrb- hrw -rrb- , published on monday .
according to the new york-based rights group , iraqi militias are increasingly torturing and executing men suspected of homosexuality but the authorities in baghdad are doing nothing to stop the violence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hrw report details brutal torture of gays in iraq the hrw report states that hundreds of men have been kidnapped , tortured and killed this year in a wave of violence that began in the baghdad sadr city stronghold of shiite cleric moqtada al-sadr 's mahdi army militia .
many bodies have been found with the arabic words for " pervert " and " puppy " - considered derogatory terms for homosexuals in iraq - written on their chests .
the report , released in lebanon and entitled " ' they want us exterminated : murder , torture , sexual orientation and gender in iraq ' , " says it is almost impossible to calculate how many men were killed , but estimates the figure to be in the hundreds .
opportunity knocks for powerful militia " unfortunately it 's not surprising that we 're hearing about these disgusting acts as reported by hrw as well as witnessing the current spate of bombings in iraq , " richard gowan , a middle east policy expert at the european council for foreign relations and author of various papers on iraq 's struggle for democracy , told deutsche welle .

dozens are missing . the accident in the eastern siberian region of khakassia shut down the sayano-shushenskaya hydroelectric plant on the yenisei river .
casualty figures from russian press sources varied , but the latest showed at least 12 dead , over a dozen injured , and up to 72 missing .
but emergencies ministry spokeswoman irina butenko told reuters : " there is no danger to the population . "
explosion is not ruled out she said authorities were not ruling out the possibility that an explosion caused the accident .
but russian news agencies reported a water surge was the most likely cause .
the sayano-shushenskaya plant provides power to nearby major aluminum smelters operated by rusal , russia 's largest aluminium producer .
production was halted temporarily at some aluminium smelters , but a rusal spokeswoman said all their plants are now being supplied by other electricity producers and are working normally .
water flooded the hall when a wall collapsed , after a sudden change in pressure caused the pipes feeding water to the hydro plant to burst .
no damage to dam local officials have said there is no danger to the dam .
" the body of the dam has not been damaged , " said spokesman dmitry kydryavtsev .
there was some panic among the local population and officials were reportedly trying to calm the situation .
the plant , which opened in 1978 , is run by rushydro and a spokesman said that repairs will take several weeks. av / jen / reuters / afp / dpa editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russian defense minister anatoly serdyukov told president dmitry medvedev on monday that the 4,000-ton ship had been found and that the crew were safe after being taken aboard a navy anti-submarine ship .
" today at 1 am moscow time , the ship was found 300 miles off the cape verde islands , " serdyukov told medvedev during a presidential visit to the southern russian city of astrakhan .
however , he gave no details of how the vessel had been found or why it had disappeared in the first place .

" this is one of the biggest gene-doping threats that we face at the moment , " diel said .
" athletes who get their hands on these substances at the moment would have an unbelievable advantage .
they would n't have to worry about testing positive . " since the drugs intensify natural production of epo , doping authorities ca n't prove the athlete used performance-enhancing drugs , diel added . dangerous side effects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thicker blood can increase the likelihood of heart attacks and strokes epo-producing treatments were originally intended to help seriously ill patients suffering from anemia to increase the number of red blood cells to transport oxygen .
initial clinical studies were , however , stopped when the drug was found to cause numerous side effects , including thickening patients ' blood , which increases the chances of suffering a heart attack or stroke . but that would n't put off some athletes looking to improve their performance by fractions of inches or seconds , diel said . " gene-doping specialists all say , ' there are too many side effects , i 'd never use that , " ' he added .
" but side effects have never concerned anyone interested in doping . " while diel says he 's confident pharmaceutical companies are n't producing drugs to help athletes dope , individuals are making new medicines available on the black market . " the companies do n't plan to make super drugs available to athletes , but when something is in development , there are people who will take a few pills and sell them for 20,000 or 30,000 euros -lrb- $ 28,100 - $ 42,300 -rrb- , " diel said . untraceable drugs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knocking out myosatin production leads to bigger muscles in mice a type of drug developed for patients suffering from degenerative diseases was designed to turn off the gene that makes the body create myosatin , a protein that inhibits muscle growth , and fend off muscle atrophy .
but myosatin inhibitors give healthy people the ability to grow abnormally large muscles . the effects of limiting myosatin production was first observed in the so-called " mighty mice . "
one study showed muscles increased in strength by up to 27 percent in elderly mice , which normally lose up to a third of their muscle mass and strength as they age . as another drug that promotes the body 's ability to grow naturally , it would also not be detected by modern doping tests , diel said , adding that the drug does not have any known side effects . " that 's a reason why it plays such a big role in doping , " he said .
" there 's an immense interest in it . " interest in performance-enhancing drugs is so great , diel said , that he thinks only a few athletes are n't using them .
he said surveys have shown athletes would be willing to take a drug that would cut 10 years off their lives in order to stand on the podium at the olympic games . doping not out of control bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's good news that more doped athletes are being caught , nada 's mueller says but even as doped athletes continue to make headlines around the world , the problem is not getting out of control , according to rudhard klaus mueller , a board member at germany 's national anti-doping agency nada . " the increased effectiveness and efficiency of the tests shows that the problem is not exploding , " he said . but mueller added that doping tests are n't the only way to detract from the lure of performance-enhancing durgs .

" our form today was very good .
i was surprised how clearly we dominated the first 45 minutes , " said magath .
" we did n't expect to win so clearly and without any major problems " .
schalke had the lion 's share of possession and took the lead after 38 minutes with a goal from 19-year-old midfielder christoph moritz , who was making his debut in gelsenkirchen .
just before half-time the royal blues scored their second goal after ivan rakitic set up for german international heiko westermann to give the hosts a 2-nil lead .

hertha immediately pulled one back through gajko kacar , forcing in a raffael corner from four meters out but it was too little , too late .

substitute elson slotted home the resultant spot-kick .
mohamadou idrissou gave freiburg hope with a header but elson responded almost immediately with a superb strike from outside the area 14 minutes from time to make it 3-1 .
there was still time for idrissou to reduce the deficit once again but julian shieber made it 4-2 a minute from time to ensure markus babbel 's side all three points .

" this is one of the biggest gene-doping threats that we face at the moment , " diel said .
" athletes who get their hands on these substances at the moment would have an unbelievable advantage .
they would n't have to worry about testing positive .

one study showed muscles increased in strength by up to 27 percent in elderly mice , which normally lose up to a third of their muscle mass and strength as they age . as another drug that promotes the body 's ability to grow naturally , it would also not be detected by modern doping tests , diel said , adding that the drug does not have any known side effects . " that 's a reason why it plays such a big role in doping , " he said .
" there 's an immense interest in it . " interest in performance-enhancing drugs is so great , diel said , that he thinks only a few athletes are n't using them .

" this is one of the biggest gene-doping threats that we face at the moment , " diel said .
" athletes who get their hands on these substances at the moment would have an unbelievable advantage .
they would n't have to worry about testing positive . " since the drugs intensify natural production of epo , doping authorities ca n't prove the athlete used performance-enhancing drugs , diel added . dangerous side effects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thicker blood can increase the likelihood of heart attacks and strokes epo-producing treatments were originally intended to help seriously ill patients suffering from anemia to increase the number of red blood cells to transport oxygen .
initial clinical studies were , however , stopped when the drug was found to cause numerous side effects , including thickening patients ' blood , which increases the chances of suffering a heart attack or stroke . but that would n't put off some athletes looking to improve their performance by fractions of inches or seconds , diel said . " gene-doping specialists all say , ' there are too many side effects , i 'd never use that , " ' he added .
" but side effects have never concerned anyone interested in doping . " while diel says he 's confident pharmaceutical companies are n't producing drugs to help athletes dope , individuals are making new medicines available on the black market .

the attacks have been blamed on radical militia and raise concerns over their expanding power . with us involvement scaling down and most of the " coalition of the willing " now departed , iraq 's government inches closer each month to full responsibility for the country 's security , judiciary and public services .
but as the western forces , which invaded the country to overthrow saddam hussein and his cronies , prepare to leave iraq to its destiny as a fully sovereign state , there are growing concerns that the country could return to its pre-invasion brutality under a new militant power : the militias .
one of the most disturbing trends which point toward a creeping radicalism and the increased power of iraq 's militias has been highlighted in a new report by human rights watch -lrb- hrw -rrb- , published on monday .
according to the new york-based rights group , iraqi militias are increasingly torturing and executing men suspected of homosexuality but the authorities in baghdad are doing nothing to stop the violence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hrw report details brutal torture of gays in iraq the hrw report states that hundreds of men have been kidnapped , tortured and killed this year in a wave of violence that began in the baghdad sadr city stronghold of shiite cleric moqtada al-sadr 's mahdi army militia .
many bodies have been found with the arabic words for " pervert " and " puppy " - considered derogatory terms for homosexuals in iraq - written on their chests .
the report , released in lebanon and entitled " ' they want us exterminated : murder , torture , sexual orientation and gender in iraq ' , " says it is almost impossible to calculate how many men were killed , but estimates the figure to be in the hundreds .
opportunity knocks for powerful militia " unfortunately it 's not surprising that we 're hearing about these disgusting acts as reported by hrw as well as witnessing the current spate of bombings in iraq , " richard gowan , a middle east policy expert at the european council for foreign relations and author of various papers on iraq 's struggle for democracy , told deutsche welle .
" the country is in danger of becoming ever more fractious as the withdrawal of us forces gets closer . we 've seen this in crisis zones around the world .
when the occupying or peacekeeping forces pull out , there is an escalation of violence within the vacuum . "
" what we are seeing with these killings and bombings is the real power of the militias , " gowan added . " at the height of the insurgency in 2006 , the militias showed that they could give the us forces and the iraqi government a good run for their money .
things have changed and the iraqis are now better-equipped and trained but , as the hrw report shows , the militias can still act with impunity . " fear of feminization threat to iraq 's masculinity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many murders have taken place in al-sadr 's stronghold mahdi army spokesmen have suggested that military action was the remedy for the " feminization " of iraq men , according to the report in which survivors are quoted as saying militiamen invade homes and interrogate victims before killing them in order to identify other potential victims .
hrw said iraqi doctors and morgue employees also have records of grotesque torture marks on the bodies of men , including mutilation and even anuses glued shut .
motives for the murders include " fears that iraqi men 's masculinity is under threat , " hrw reported .
the report said men have fled to neighboring countries , despite consensual homosexual activity being illegal in states in the region such as egypt , jordan and lebanon , even though it is not a criminal offence under iraqi law .
it also said some of the murders were so-called honor killings , carried out by victims ' family members " because ' unmanly ' behavior threatens the reputation of the family or tribe . "
some iraqis interviewed by the rights group charged that , in some cases , members of the security forces had colluded and even joined in the killing .
" at some point during the insurgency , the government came to some agreement for an uneasy peace with the militias where the authorities maintained a certain amount of control and loyalty through bribery and the fact that they would let the militias do what they wanted , " gowan said .
" the hrw report shows that there is a real concern as to what effect this is having on iraqi society , where militias are allowed to brutalize their own communities while the government turns a blind eye . " " what the hrw report reminds us -lrb- of -rrb- is that the us strategy of creating a balancing act between the militias comes with its own set of problems , " he added . " this idea of supporting some militias and not others has been underpinning security policy in iraq for a couple of years now . the primary concern is that , when the americans leave , the balancing act will fail and we 'll see a fragmented iraq and a real threat of civil war . " government accused of turning a blind eye - and worse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the iraqi government somehow involved ?
scott long , director of hrw 's lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender rights program , laid a fair portion of the blame directly at the iraqi government 's feet , accusing it of abandoning the people .
" iraq 's leaders are supposed to defend all iraqis , not abandon them to armed agents of hate , " he said .
" turning a blind eye to torture and murder threatens the rights and life of every iraqi . "
richard gowan believes that iraqis themselves could do much to put pressure on the government to clamp down on the killings and the rise of the militias by pointing out the effects such activities could have on external investment .
" the strong media in iraq and the affluent middle class who want to be secure will put pressure on the government if things get further out of hand , " gowan said . " the many european nations and leaders who have shown an interest in investing in iraq have shown that the country has huge potential and any further scandals and shocks like we 've seen in the hrw report will want to be avoided , " he added . " that said , everyone with an interest in making money from iraq , both internal and external powers , will want to ignore reports like the hrw paper so as to avoid the embarrassing questions about the real state of iraq 's security and the failures of the western powers .

" this is one of the biggest gene-doping threats that we face at the moment , " diel said .
" athletes who get their hands on these substances at the moment would have an unbelievable advantage .
they would n't have to worry about testing positive . " since the drugs intensify natural production of epo , doping authorities ca n't prove the athlete used performance-enhancing drugs , diel added . dangerous side effects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thicker blood can increase the likelihood of heart attacks and strokes epo-producing treatments were originally intended to help seriously ill patients suffering from anemia to increase the number of red blood cells to transport oxygen .
initial clinical studies were , however , stopped when the drug was found to cause numerous side effects , including thickening patients ' blood , which increases the chances of suffering a heart attack or stroke . but that would n't put off some athletes looking to improve their performance by fractions of inches or seconds , diel said . " gene-doping specialists all say , ' there are too many side effects , i 'd never use that , " ' he added .
" but side effects have never concerned anyone interested in doping . " while diel says he 's confident pharmaceutical companies are n't producing drugs to help athletes dope , individuals are making new medicines available on the black market . " the companies do n't plan to make super drugs available to athletes , but when something is in development , there are people who will take a few pills and sell them for 20,000 or 30,000 euros -lrb- $ 28,100 - $ 42,300 -rrb- , " diel said . untraceable drugs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knocking out myosatin production leads to bigger muscles in mice a type of drug developed for patients suffering from degenerative diseases was designed to turn off the gene that makes the body create myosatin , a protein that inhibits muscle growth , and fend off muscle atrophy .
but myosatin inhibitors give healthy people the ability to grow abnormally large muscles . the effects of limiting myosatin production was first observed in the so-called " mighty mice . "
one study showed muscles increased in strength by up to 27 percent in elderly mice , which normally lose up to a third of their muscle mass and strength as they age . as another drug that promotes the body 's ability to grow naturally , it would also not be detected by modern doping tests , diel said , adding that the drug does not have any known side effects . " that 's a reason why it plays such a big role in doping , " he said .
" there 's an immense interest in it . " interest in performance-enhancing drugs is so great , diel said , that he thinks only a few athletes are n't using them .
he said surveys have shown athletes would be willing to take a drug that would cut 10 years off their lives in order to stand on the podium at the olympic games . doping not out of control bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's good news that more doped athletes are being caught , nada 's mueller says but even as doped athletes continue to make headlines around the world , the problem is not getting out of control , according to rudhard klaus mueller , a board member at germany 's national anti-doping agency nada . " the increased effectiveness and efficiency of the tests shows that the problem is not exploding , " he said . but mueller added that doping tests are n't the only way to detract from the lure of performance-enhancing durgs . " we simply have to reach a point in sports where athletes and nations that do n't put necessary tests in place ahead of major competitions are not taken seriously , " he said . authors : judith hartl , benjamin wuest / sms editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this is one of the biggest gene-doping threats that we face at the moment , " diel said .
" athletes who get their hands on these substances at the moment would have an unbelievable advantage .
they would n't have to worry about testing positive . " since the drugs intensify natural production of epo , doping authorities ca n't prove the athlete used performance-enhancing drugs , diel added . dangerous side effects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thicker blood can increase the likelihood of heart attacks and strokes epo-producing treatments were originally intended to help seriously ill patients suffering from anemia to increase the number of red blood cells to transport oxygen .
initial clinical studies were , however , stopped when the drug was found to cause numerous side effects , including thickening patients ' blood , which increases the chances of suffering a heart attack or stroke . but that would n't put off some athletes looking to improve their performance by fractions of inches or seconds , diel said . " gene-doping specialists all say , ' there are too many side effects , i 'd never use that , " ' he added .
" but side effects have never concerned anyone interested in doping . " while diel says he 's confident pharmaceutical companies are n't producing drugs to help athletes dope , individuals are making new medicines available on the black market . " the companies do n't plan to make super drugs available to athletes , but when something is in development , there are people who will take a few pills and sell them for 20,000 or 30,000 euros -lrb- $ 28,100 - $ 42,300 -rrb- , " diel said . untraceable drugs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knocking out myosatin production leads to bigger muscles in mice a type of drug developed for patients suffering from degenerative diseases was designed to turn off the gene that makes the body create myosatin , a protein that inhibits muscle growth , and fend off muscle atrophy .
but myosatin inhibitors give healthy people the ability to grow abnormally large muscles . the effects of limiting myosatin production was first observed in the so-called " mighty mice . "
one study showed muscles increased in strength by up to 27 percent in elderly mice , which normally lose up to a third of their muscle mass and strength as they age . as another drug that promotes the body 's ability to grow naturally , it would also not be detected by modern doping tests , diel said , adding that the drug does not have any known side effects . " that 's a reason why it plays such a big role in doping , " he said .
" there 's an immense interest in it . " interest in performance-enhancing drugs is so great , diel said , that he thinks only a few athletes are n't using them .

early monday a suicide bomber rammed a truck packed with an estimated 200 kilograms -lrb- 441 pounds -rrb- of explosives through the gate of a nazran police compound , killing at least 20 and injuring dozens .
nazran is the main city in ingushetia , a restive and increasingly violent autonomous republic in southern russia .
russian president dmitry medvedev responded swiftly to what he described as an " act of terror that could have been averted , " and fired ingushetia 's interior minister .
" the police must protect the people and the police must also be able to protect themselves , " he said on state television .
medvedev also called on federal interior minister rashid nurgaliyev to submit proposals to the kremlin " on how to bring about order and strengthen cadres within ingushetia 's interior ministry . "
as the gray smoke settled over the twisted rubble , burned cars and blast crater , the attack stoked fears that ingushetia was replacing chechnya as the next battleground in southern russia .

yevkurov blamed islamic militants for the attack .

but has the mystery surrounding the ship 's disappearance been solved ? the fate of the bulk carrier arctic sea and its 15-man russian crew has been cloaked in mystery since the ship went missing in european waters two weeks ago , sparking speculation of foul play or even a secret cargo targeted by pirates or spies .
russian defense minister anatoly serdyukov told president dmitry medvedev on monday that the 4,000-ton ship had been found and that the crew were safe after being taken aboard a navy anti-submarine ship .
" today at 1 am moscow time , the ship was found 300 miles off the cape verde islands , " serdyukov told medvedev during a presidential visit to the southern russian city of astrakhan .
however , he gave no details of how the vessel had been found or why it had disappeared in the first place .
" debriefing is under way to clarify all aspects of the disappearance and loss of signal from this vessel , " serdyukov said .
the russian minister promised to reveal more details later .
navy scoured the atlantic the kremlin had ordered warships and submarines to scour the atlantic for the arctic sea , whose last contact with its finland-based operator was on august 1 off portugal .
the maltese-registered vessel , which was carrying a cargo of timber worth over one million euros -lrb- $ 1.4 million -rrb- , was supposed to have docked on august 4 in the algerian port of bejaia but never arrived .
there were concerns for the crew after maltese maritime officials said they had received reports that armed men wearing masks and posing as anti-drugs police had boarded the ship in swedish waters on july 24 .
they also said crew members had been assaulted , gagged and blindfolded , and some were seriously hurt .
in comments to the media , serdyukov did not say if the crew members had been held against their will .
piracy in european waters would be almost unprecedented in modern times , though a wave of hijackings has plagued shipping off somalia. rb / reuters / afp / ap editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

nazran is the main city in ingushetia , a restive and increasingly violent autonomous republic in southern russia .

" the police must protect the people and the police must also be able to protect themselves , " he said on state television .
medvedev also called on federal interior minister rashid nurgaliyev to submit proposals to the kremlin " on how to bring about order and strengthen cadres within ingushetia 's interior ministry . "
as the gray smoke settled over the twisted rubble , burned cars and blast crater , the attack stoked fears that ingushetia was replacing chechnya as the next battleground in southern russia .
ingushetia , along with the rest of the caucasus region , has seen a spike in violence in recent months , with islamic separatists launching regular attacks on politicians and police officers .
last wednesday ingushetia 's construction minister was brazenly shot to death in his own office .
and monday 's bombing comes just four days after the kremlin announced that ingushetia 's president yunus-bek yevkurkov would be returning to work while still recovering from injuries sustained in a bomb attack against him in june .
yevkurov blamed islamic militants for the attack .
" the militants have carried out this terrorist attack with the aim of destabilizing the situation in the region , " he said through his spokesman .

but has the mystery surrounding the ship 's disappearance been solved ? the fate of the bulk carrier arctic sea and its 15-man russian crew has been cloaked in mystery since the ship went missing in european waters two weeks ago , sparking speculation of foul play or even a secret cargo targeted by pirates or spies .
russian defense minister anatoly serdyukov told president dmitry medvedev on monday that the 4,000-ton ship had been found and that the crew were safe after being taken aboard a navy anti-submarine ship .
" today at 1 am moscow time , the ship was found 300 miles off the cape verde islands , " serdyukov told medvedev during a presidential visit to the southern russian city of astrakhan .
however , he gave no details of how the vessel had been found or why it had disappeared in the first place .
" debriefing is under way to clarify all aspects of the disappearance and loss of signal from this vessel , " serdyukov said .
the russian minister promised to reveal more details later .

" this is one of the biggest gene-doping threats that we face at the moment , " diel said .
" athletes who get their hands on these substances at the moment would have an unbelievable advantage .
they would n't have to worry about testing positive .

one study showed muscles increased in strength by up to 27 percent in elderly mice , which normally lose up to a third of their muscle mass and strength as they age . as another drug that promotes the body 's ability to grow naturally , it would also not be detected by modern doping tests , diel said , adding that the drug does not have any known side effects .

russian defense minister anatoly serdyukov told president dmitry medvedev on monday that the 4,000-ton ship had been found and that the crew were safe after being taken aboard a navy anti-submarine ship .
" today at 1 am moscow time , the ship was found 300 miles off the cape verde islands , " serdyukov told medvedev during a presidential visit to the southern russian city of astrakhan .
however , he gave no details of how the vessel had been found or why it had disappeared in the first place .

there were concerns for the crew after maltese maritime officials said they had received reports that armed men wearing masks and posing as anti-drugs police had boarded the ship in swedish waters on july 24 .
they also said crew members had been assaulted , gagged and blindfolded , and some were seriously hurt .
in comments to the media , serdyukov did not say if the crew members had been held against their will .

but some are finding it difficult to get their economies back on track . analysts say many european countries have begun to slowly pull themselves out of the economic doldrums .
yet for some regions , such as the baltics , recovery will likely be painfully slow .
“ poland and slovakia have fared better than their neighbors in the second quarter this year compared to the first quarter , ” romanian economic analyst aurelian dochia told afp .
“ the baltic countries are facing the worst situation , while romania , bulgaria and hungary are somewhere in-between . ”
notable improvers poland performed relatively well due to its solid economic structure and its large domestic market .
“ this could compensate for the steep fall in exports , ” dochia said .
poland expects gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- growth of 1.0 percent this year .
this would make it an incredible exception in the economic crisis .
the international monetary fund , however , believes poland 's economy will likely shrink by 0.7 percent .
slovakia grew 2.2 percent in the second quarter , largely due to cash rebate programs in its main car export markets .
" it 's good news , ” said juraj valachy , an analyst with tatra bank .
“ the economic results were better than we expected . "
slovakia is managing " to stay competitive " by keeping salaries relatively low as part of its bid to join the euro zone , explained dochia .

that 's also an improvement on the first quarter contraction of 4.6 percent .
bucharest , however , is facing huge budgetary constraints and is struggling to pay salaries and pensions .

the baltic state 's economy shrank by 12.3 percent in the second quarter , after shrinking 10.2 percent in the first three months prior .
all eyes are now on how the new government plans to rein in public spending .

" this is one of the biggest gene-doping threats that we face at the moment , " diel said .
" athletes who get their hands on these substances at the moment would have an unbelievable advantage .
they would n't have to worry about testing positive .

initial clinical studies were , however , stopped when the drug was found to cause numerous side effects , including thickening patients ' blood , which increases the chances of suffering a heart attack or stroke . but that would n't put off some athletes looking to improve their performance by fractions of inches or seconds , diel said . " gene-doping specialists all say , ' there are too many side effects , i 'd never use that , " ' he added .
" but side effects have never concerned anyone interested in doping . " while diel says he 's confident pharmaceutical companies are n't producing drugs to help athletes dope , individuals are making new medicines available on the black market . " the companies do n't plan to make super drugs available to athletes , but when something is in development , there are people who will take a few pills and sell them for 20,000 or 30,000 euros -lrb- $ 28,100 - $ 42,300 -rrb- , " diel said . untraceable drugs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knocking out myosatin production leads to bigger muscles in mice a type of drug developed for patients suffering from degenerative diseases was designed to turn off the gene that makes the body create myosatin , a protein that inhibits muscle growth , and fend off muscle atrophy .

one study showed muscles increased in strength by up to 27 percent in elderly mice , which normally lose up to a third of their muscle mass and strength as they age . as another drug that promotes the body 's ability to grow naturally , it would also not be detected by modern doping tests , diel said , adding that the drug does not have any known side effects . " that 's a reason why it plays such a big role in doping , " he said .
" there 's an immense interest in it . " interest in performance-enhancing drugs is so great , diel said , that he thinks only a few athletes are n't using them .
he said surveys have shown athletes would be willing to take a drug that would cut 10 years off their lives in order to stand on the podium at the olympic games . doping not out of control bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's good news that more doped athletes are being caught , nada 's mueller says but even as doped athletes continue to make headlines around the world , the problem is not getting out of control , according to rudhard klaus mueller , a board member at germany 's national anti-doping agency nada .

" this is one of the biggest gene-doping threats that we face at the moment , " diel said .
" athletes who get their hands on these substances at the moment would have an unbelievable advantage .
they would n't have to worry about testing positive . " since the drugs intensify natural production of epo , doping authorities ca n't prove the athlete used performance-enhancing drugs , diel added . dangerous side effects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thicker blood can increase the likelihood of heart attacks and strokes epo-producing treatments were originally intended to help seriously ill patients suffering from anemia to increase the number of red blood cells to transport oxygen .
initial clinical studies were , however , stopped when the drug was found to cause numerous side effects , including thickening patients ' blood , which increases the chances of suffering a heart attack or stroke . but that would n't put off some athletes looking to improve their performance by fractions of inches or seconds , diel said . " gene-doping specialists all say , ' there are too many side effects , i 'd never use that , " ' he added .
" but side effects have never concerned anyone interested in doping . " while diel says he 's confident pharmaceutical companies are n't producing drugs to help athletes dope , individuals are making new medicines available on the black market .

the attacks have been blamed on radical militia and raise concerns over their expanding power . with us involvement scaling down and most of the " coalition of the willing " now departed , iraq 's government inches closer each month to full responsibility for the country 's security , judiciary and public services .
but as the western forces , which invaded the country to overthrow saddam hussein and his cronies , prepare to leave iraq to its destiny as a fully sovereign state , there are growing concerns that the country could return to its pre-invasion brutality under a new militant power : the militias .
one of the most disturbing trends which point toward a creeping radicalism and the increased power of iraq 's militias has been highlighted in a new report by human rights watch -lrb- hrw -rrb- , published on monday .
according to the new york-based rights group , iraqi militias are increasingly torturing and executing men suspected of homosexuality but the authorities in baghdad are doing nothing to stop the violence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hrw report details brutal torture of gays in iraq the hrw report states that hundreds of men have been kidnapped , tortured and killed this year in a wave of violence that began in the baghdad sadr city stronghold of shiite cleric moqtada al-sadr 's mahdi army militia .
many bodies have been found with the arabic words for " pervert " and " puppy " - considered derogatory terms for homosexuals in iraq - written on their chests .
the report , released in lebanon and entitled " ' they want us exterminated : murder , torture , sexual orientation and gender in iraq ' , " says it is almost impossible to calculate how many men were killed , but estimates the figure to be in the hundreds .
opportunity knocks for powerful militia " unfortunately it 's not surprising that we 're hearing about these disgusting acts as reported by hrw as well as witnessing the current spate of bombings in iraq , " richard gowan , a middle east policy expert at the european council for foreign relations and author of various papers on iraq 's struggle for democracy , told deutsche welle .
" the country is in danger of becoming ever more fractious as the withdrawal of us forces gets closer . we 've seen this in crisis zones around the world .
when the occupying or peacekeeping forces pull out , there is an escalation of violence within the vacuum . "
" what we are seeing with these killings and bombings is the real power of the militias , " gowan added . " at the height of the insurgency in 2006 , the militias showed that they could give the us forces and the iraqi government a good run for their money .
things have changed and the iraqis are now better-equipped and trained but , as the hrw report shows , the militias can still act with impunity . " fear of feminization threat to iraq 's masculinity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many murders have taken place in al-sadr 's stronghold mahdi army spokesmen have suggested that military action was the remedy for the " feminization " of iraq men , according to the report in which survivors are quoted as saying militiamen invade homes and interrogate victims before killing them in order to identify other potential victims .
hrw said iraqi doctors and morgue employees also have records of grotesque torture marks on the bodies of men , including mutilation and even anuses glued shut .
motives for the murders include " fears that iraqi men 's masculinity is under threat , " hrw reported .
the report said men have fled to neighboring countries , despite consensual homosexual activity being illegal in states in the region such as egypt , jordan and lebanon , even though it is not a criminal offence under iraqi law .
it also said some of the murders were so-called honor killings , carried out by victims ' family members " because ' unmanly ' behavior threatens the reputation of the family or tribe . "
some iraqis interviewed by the rights group charged that , in some cases , members of the security forces had colluded and even joined in the killing .
" at some point during the insurgency , the government came to some agreement for an uneasy peace with the militias where the authorities maintained a certain amount of control and loyalty through bribery and the fact that they would let the militias do what they wanted , " gowan said .
" the hrw report shows that there is a real concern as to what effect this is having on iraqi society , where militias are allowed to brutalize their own communities while the government turns a blind eye . " " what the hrw report reminds us -lrb- of -rrb- is that the us strategy of creating a balancing act between the militias comes with its own set of problems , " he added . " this idea of supporting some militias and not others has been underpinning security policy in iraq for a couple of years now . the primary concern is that , when the americans leave , the balancing act will fail and we 'll see a fragmented iraq and a real threat of civil war . " government accused of turning a blind eye - and worse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the iraqi government somehow involved ?
scott long , director of hrw 's lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender rights program , laid a fair portion of the blame directly at the iraqi government 's feet , accusing it of abandoning the people .
" iraq 's leaders are supposed to defend all iraqis , not abandon them to armed agents of hate , " he said .
" turning a blind eye to torture and murder threatens the rights and life of every iraqi . "
richard gowan believes that iraqis themselves could do much to put pressure on the government to clamp down on the killings and the rise of the militias by pointing out the effects such activities could have on external investment .
" the strong media in iraq and the affluent middle class who want to be secure will put pressure on the government if things get further out of hand , " gowan said . " the many european nations and leaders who have shown an interest in investing in iraq have shown that the country has huge potential and any further scandals and shocks like we 've seen in the hrw report will want to be avoided , " he added . " that said , everyone with an interest in making money from iraq , both internal and external powers , will want to ignore reports like the hrw paper so as to avoid the embarrassing questions about the real state of iraq 's security and the failures of the western powers .

the attacks have been blamed on radical militia and raise concerns over their expanding power . with us involvement scaling down and most of the " coalition of the willing " now departed , iraq 's government inches closer each month to full responsibility for the country 's security , judiciary and public services .
but as the western forces , which invaded the country to overthrow saddam hussein and his cronies , prepare to leave iraq to its destiny as a fully sovereign state , there are growing concerns that the country could return to its pre-invasion brutality under a new militant power : the militias .
one of the most disturbing trends which point toward a creeping radicalism and the increased power of iraq 's militias has been highlighted in a new report by human rights watch -lrb- hrw -rrb- , published on monday .
according to the new york-based rights group , iraqi militias are increasingly torturing and executing men suspected of homosexuality but the authorities in baghdad are doing nothing to stop the violence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hrw report details brutal torture of gays in iraq the hrw report states that hundreds of men have been kidnapped , tortured and killed this year in a wave of violence that began in the baghdad sadr city stronghold of shiite cleric moqtada al-sadr 's mahdi army militia .
many bodies have been found with the arabic words for " pervert " and " puppy " - considered derogatory terms for homosexuals in iraq - written on their chests .
the report , released in lebanon and entitled " ' they want us exterminated : murder , torture , sexual orientation and gender in iraq ' , " says it is almost impossible to calculate how many men were killed , but estimates the figure to be in the hundreds .
opportunity knocks for powerful militia " unfortunately it 's not surprising that we 're hearing about these disgusting acts as reported by hrw as well as witnessing the current spate of bombings in iraq , " richard gowan , a middle east policy expert at the european council for foreign relations and author of various papers on iraq 's struggle for democracy , told deutsche welle .
" the country is in danger of becoming ever more fractious as the withdrawal of us forces gets closer . we 've seen this in crisis zones around the world .
when the occupying or peacekeeping forces pull out , there is an escalation of violence within the vacuum . "
" what we are seeing with these killings and bombings is the real power of the militias , " gowan added . " at the height of the insurgency in 2006 , the militias showed that they could give the us forces and the iraqi government a good run for their money .
things have changed and the iraqis are now better-equipped and trained but , as the hrw report shows , the militias can still act with impunity . " fear of feminization threat to iraq 's masculinity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many murders have taken place in al-sadr 's stronghold mahdi army spokesmen have suggested that military action was the remedy for the " feminization " of iraq men , according to the report in which survivors are quoted as saying militiamen invade homes and interrogate victims before killing them in order to identify other potential victims .
hrw said iraqi doctors and morgue employees also have records of grotesque torture marks on the bodies of men , including mutilation and even anuses glued shut .
motives for the murders include " fears that iraqi men 's masculinity is under threat , " hrw reported .
the report said men have fled to neighboring countries , despite consensual homosexual activity being illegal in states in the region such as egypt , jordan and lebanon , even though it is not a criminal offence under iraqi law .
it also said some of the murders were so-called honor killings , carried out by victims ' family members " because ' unmanly ' behavior threatens the reputation of the family or tribe . "
some iraqis interviewed by the rights group charged that , in some cases , members of the security forces had colluded and even joined in the killing .
" at some point during the insurgency , the government came to some agreement for an uneasy peace with the militias where the authorities maintained a certain amount of control and loyalty through bribery and the fact that they would let the militias do what they wanted , " gowan said .
" the hrw report shows that there is a real concern as to what effect this is having on iraqi society , where militias are allowed to brutalize their own communities while the government turns a blind eye . " " what the hrw report reminds us -lrb- of -rrb- is that the us strategy of creating a balancing act between the militias comes with its own set of problems , " he added . " this idea of supporting some militias and not others has been underpinning security policy in iraq for a couple of years now . the primary concern is that , when the americans leave , the balancing act will fail and we 'll see a fragmented iraq and a real threat of civil war . " government accused of turning a blind eye - and worse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the iraqi government somehow involved ?
scott long , director of hrw 's lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender rights program , laid a fair portion of the blame directly at the iraqi government 's feet , accusing it of abandoning the people .
" iraq 's leaders are supposed to defend all iraqis , not abandon them to armed agents of hate , " he said .
" turning a blind eye to torture and murder threatens the rights and life of every iraqi . "
richard gowan believes that iraqis themselves could do much to put pressure on the government to clamp down on the killings and the rise of the militias by pointing out the effects such activities could have on external investment .
" the strong media in iraq and the affluent middle class who want to be secure will put pressure on the government if things get further out of hand , " gowan said . " the many european nations and leaders who have shown an interest in investing in iraq have shown that the country has huge potential and any further scandals and shocks like we 've seen in the hrw report will want to be avoided , " he added . " that said , everyone with an interest in making money from iraq , both internal and external powers , will want to ignore reports like the hrw paper so as to avoid the embarrassing questions about the real state of iraq 's security and the failures of the western powers .

reiss is one of more than 100 people in a mass trial in iran on charges linked to post-election protests .
she had been held in prison for six weeks after she attended demonstrations following the disputed re-election of president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
she is also charged with espionage for allegedly filing a report to the french embassy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 2008 photo shows reiss as a student in lille , france france paid about $ 300,000 -lrb- 213,000 euros -rrb- for reiss to be released on bail , reuters quoted iranian news sources as saying .
the 24-year-old teacher must stay in the french embassy until a verdict is reached .
earlier , france acknowledged it had paid bail for reiss , but did n't name an amount .
clotilde 's father , remi reiss , told france info radio on monday that he had spoken with his daughter and that she " seems in good shape . " " this is happiness " " this is what happiness is , " he said .
" she will be able to regain her freedom and the everyday life that she has missed for a month-and-a-half . " remi reiss described his daughter 's release on bail as a " first step " and expressed hope that she will return to france in the weeks ahead . on sunday , french president nicolas sarkozy had telephoned with reiss and confirmed that the 24-year-old was in good health .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 17.08.2009 eastern european economies struggle to regain foothold großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland leads economic recovery in central and eastern europe as much of western europe begins to crawl out of recession , central and eastern european nations are slowly following .
but some are finding it difficult to get their economies back on track . analysts say many european countries have begun to slowly pull themselves out of the economic doldrums .
yet for some regions , such as the baltics , recovery will likely be painfully slow .
“ poland and slovakia have fared better than their neighbors in the second quarter this year compared to the first quarter , ” romanian economic analyst aurelian dochia told afp .
“ the baltic countries are facing the worst situation , while romania , bulgaria and hungary are somewhere in-between . ”
notable improvers poland performed relatively well due to its solid economic structure and its large domestic market .
“ this could compensate for the steep fall in exports , ” dochia said .
poland expects gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- growth of 1.0 percent this year .
this would make it an incredible exception in the economic crisis .
the international monetary fund , however , believes poland 's economy will likely shrink by 0.7 percent .
slovakia grew 2.2 percent in the second quarter , largely due to cash rebate programs in its main car export markets .
" it 's good news , ” said juraj valachy , an analyst with tatra bank .
“ the economic results were better than we expected . "
slovakia is managing " to stay competitive " by keeping salaries relatively low as part of its bid to join the euro zone , explained dochia .
the czech republic grew 0.3 percent in the second quarter , announcing it was emerging , like germany and france , from recession .
" we already hit the bottom in the first quarter of this year , " said helena horska , a prague-based analyst with austrian lender raiffeisenbank .
doing better , but not great bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : budapest is struggling with the financial crisis and soaring unemployment hungary was the first nation in the european union to turn to the imf for help last year and remains in recession with unemployment rising .
according to official data , hungary 's economy contracted 2.1 percent in the second quarter this year .
that 's a slight improvement over a first quarter contraction of 2.6 percent and could indicate a possible bottoming out .
romania 's economy shrank by 2.1 percent in the second quarter .
that 's also an improvement on the first quarter contraction of 4.6 percent .
bucharest , however , is facing huge budgetary constraints and is struggling to pay salaries and pensions .
the government is forcing state employees to take 10 days of unpaid leave to trim the public deficit .
analysts say while it 's too early to talk about a recovery , they do expect the decline to reverse in the next few months .
bulgaria also has to sharply cut the public deficit .
the government has announced plans to cut public spending by 15 percent and to crack down on customs fraud to raise revenue .
the baltic nations are in deep lithuania , until last year , enjoyed a reputation as a european union " tiger , " but now is deeper into recession than any other eu nation .
lithuania 's central bank predicts its economy will contract by 19.3 percent in 2009 compared with 2008 .
the baltic state 's economy shrank by 12.3 percent in the second quarter , after shrinking 10.2 percent in the first three months prior .
all eyes are now on how the new government plans to rein in public spending .
lithuania has , so far , avoided following latvia and other eastern european economies in seeking a bailout from the international monetary fund and the eu .
vilnius may be forced to seek help if it fails to raise more money from foreign capital markets to prop up the economy .
latvia 's economy also took a sudden about-turn .
it grew 10.2 percent in 2007 , but since then it has gone downhill .
output contracted by 4.6 percent in 2008 and is forecast to shrink by18 percent this year .
the pattern was similar in estonia .
the economy there grew by 6.3 percent in 2007 , but slid into recession in 2008 .
within 12 months , the economy shrank by 3.6 percent and is forecast to contract by 15.3 percent this year .
