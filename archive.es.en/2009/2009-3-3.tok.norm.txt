they have now passed the buck on to their finance counterparts . the european union is unable to set an exact figure on the aid it is willing to give developing nations in exchange for support of a global climate change pact , said czech environment minister martin bursik . it was " too early " for the 27-nation bloc " to put money on the table , " said bursik , whose country currently holds the eu presidency . " we were not quite able to reach consensus on the financing mechanism , " eu environment commissioner stavros dimas told reporters . the eu environment ministers met in brussels on monday , march 2 , to discuss the bloc 's negotiating position at talks for the un-sponsored climate change talks in copenhagen in december . " it makes no sense to say now how much the eu is willing to transfer , " germany 's environment minister sigmar gabriel said .
" we will negotiate that in copenhagen .
we are creeping towards a number . " usa plays a key role bursik said the eu still wanted to find out the united states ' mid-term targets , how much money the us would spend and whether washington would adopt a cap-and-trade system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time is running out to thwart global warming , experts say he said the eu presidency was confident that us president barack obama " will follow the leadership of the european union " by setting ambitious mid-term goals for cutting greenhouse gases . " we know that the us wants to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent by 2050 , -lrb- but -rrb- we do n't know what their mid-term target is , " bursik said . the eu and the us are considered the major donors that could get lesser developed nations involved in a new global drive to cut carbon dioxide emissions .
the eu has committed to reducing emissions by 30 percent of 1990 levels by 2020 if other developed countries commit to comparable cuts .
it has already put in place the measures to cut its own emissions by 20 percent . european environment ministers said they see obama as a great boost for finding a successor to the kyoto protocol in copenhagen .
his predecessor george w. bush refused to ratify the treaty . bursik and dimas said they would visit washington on march 14-15 to find out more about the intentions of the us administration .
according to bursik climate change would be one of the first things european union leaders discuss with obama when he visits prague for an eu-us summit in early april . passing on the " hot potato " joris den blanken , the eu climate and energy policy director for environmental group greenpeace , criticized that the issue has now been put on the agenda at the eu finance ministers meeting on march 10 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : efficient , clean sources of energy are required around the globe " environment ministers have ducked and passed the climate funding hot potato to finance ministers , " blanken said in a statement .
" while billions of taxpayers ' money is being used to prop up failed banks and carmakers , not one eurocent is being pledged to help the developing world tackle a problem that europeans helped create . " according to greenpeace , eu leaders should support a market-linked scheme where countries are asked to pay for part of their emissions . " the eu must contribute its fair share to poorer countries , " blanken said .
" the clock is ticking , global climate talks in copenhagen are less than 300 days away , and we still have little more than words on the table . " an eu report states that global investment to fight climate change will need to rise to some 175 billion euros -lrb- $ 220 billion -rrb- per year by 2020 .
over 90 billion euros of that sum must be spent in developing countries , the report said . greenpeace and other ngos have said the european union should be contributing around 35 billion euros by 2020 to overall assistance by industrialized countries to help developing nations deal with the effects of climate change . the issue is also on the agenda when the eu 's 27 heads of state and government come together for their next summit on march 19-20 . sac / sms / afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the case , which opens a year and a day after president dimitry medvedev was elected , is being seen by some as a test of his commitment to reform . khodorkovsky faces fresh charges of embezzlement and money laundering that would leave him facing another long jail sentence , if he is found guilty .
" this case of immense importance because of what it will say to all of us about where russia is going , " robert amsterdam , a defence lawyer for khodorkovsky , told reuters news agency before the hearing .
khodorkovsky 's supporters have long alleged that he was arrested at the behest of the then president vladimir putin and his backers .
the oil tycoon had openly funded opposition parties such as the liberal yabloko faction in the run-up to 2003 parliamentary elections to the kremlin 's displeasure . the former yukos boss , who is currently serving an eight-year sentence , has said that corrupt officials also wanted to carve up his business empire , which produced more oil than opec member qatar .
expectations lowered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two heads are better than one ?
medvedev , a former lawyer who was sworn in as president last may , has demanded a clean-up of the russian court system since khodorkovsky 's sentence and criticised high-level corruption .
but there have been few signs of any substantive change .
" the expectations were modest .
it 's not fair to say that he 's disappointed them , but these expectations have become even more modest , " said andrei ryabov from the carnegie centre in moscow .
at an event to mark the first anniversary of his presidential election victory on monday , march 2 , medvedev expressed what seemed to be a commitment to the line of his predecessor , whom he appointed to the post of prime minister shortly after taking power .
on stage with vladimir putin , medvedev shouted " together we can continue the course set by president putin .
together we 'll win .

20 and one month ahead of a group of 20 summit of the world 's leading economies takes place in london . " what we 're talking about today is how , by us taking action , britain and america , we can help other countries join us in making for a more stable and effective financial system , " brown said . the turmoil in the financial markets is viewed as the biggest culprit in the economic downturn that has left both countries mired in a recession . both leaders have endorsed measures that better supervise the finance industry to prevent the high-risk lending that produced record mortgage defaults in the united states and the subsequent credit freeze .
playing on former president franklin delano roosevelt 's economic program during the great depression of the 1930s , brown has advocated a " global new deal . " global new deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a larger meeting of world leaders in april could bring about major changes to the banking system " there is the possibility in the next few months of a global new deal that will involve all the countries of the world in sorting out and cleaning up the banking system , " brown said . obama agreed with brown that more needs to be done to regulate international markets . " we believe in the free market , we believe in a government that is not overbearing and allows entrepreneurs and businesses to thrive , " obama said .
" but we also share a common belief that there have to be sufficient regulatory structures in place so that the market does n't spin out of control . " the talks in washington were being seen as preparation for the london g20 summit on april 2 , when leaders of the world 's major economies and global economic financial institutions will be gathering in the british capital to address the worldwide financial crisis . " now is the time for leaders of every country in the world to work together to agree the action that will see us through the current crisis and ensure we come out stronger , " brown said before meeting obama . more international support in afghanistan the trip to washington followed sunday 's informal eu council in brussels on the economic crisis .
following the meeting , brown said he would take a " clear message " from eu leaders to obama that agreeing a deal on the world economy was " vitally urgent . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama visited us troops in afghanistan during his campaign in addition to the economic crisis , the deteriorating security situation in afghanistan was another central topic to the talks . brown and obama agreed that the war in afghanistan is not winnable as long as taliban militants and al qaeda continue to find refuge in pakistan .
the conflict is at the top of obama 's foreign agenda , and he is expected to ask europe for more help . britain already has more than 8,000 soldiers in afghanistan , and the two leaders have sought greater contributions from other nato partners , an issue that will likely arise at the alliance 's summit next month . " both great britain and the united states share a deep interest in ensuring that neither afghanistan nor pakistan are safe havens for terrorist activity , " obama said , who has pledged to send 17,000 more us soldiers to afghanistan this year to join the 38,000 already there . global warming , iran 's suspect nuclear program and the middle east are also on the agenda in washington during brown 's visit . brown to warn of protectionism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european nations fear they could lose significant business through the " buy american " clause brown , in a speech before the us congress , will also call on countries to avoid trade protectionism , warning us lawmakers that retreating to protectionist economic policies could exacerbate the economic downturn even further . the eu has repeatedly criticized the " buy american " clause in the $ 787 billion us stimulus package , though it has been watered down .
it stipulated that only us iron , steel and manufactured goods could be used in construction work funded by the bill .
but the us administration has said it will respect international trade obligations . could obama 's shine wear off on brown ? analysts have said brown 's speech before congress could play a key role in boosting his popularity , as it would draw attention to his political efforts to demonstrate british leadership at a time of economic uncertainty .
he is only the fifth british prime minister to ever address the us congress . brown , who is suffering from ongoing low popularity at home , is struggling to gain public support for his domestic stimulus package and huge bank bailouts .
his governing labour party is trailing behind the opposition conservatives , with a general election coming up in 2010 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former president bush even invited blair to visit camp david in addition , the visit could help win back labour voters who turned their back on the party under brown 's predecessor tony blair . blair maintained close ties to former us president george w. bush - winning him the nickname " bush 's poodle . "
blair backed bush 's decision to invade iraq in 2003 and sent troops to join us forces in iraq and afghanistan . in an article for the british newspaper the sunday times , brown said there was " no international partnership in recent history that has served the world better than the special relationship between britain and the united states . "
he said he was keen to strengthen it further . us officials said the longtime friendship with britain was as important as ever to washington . sac / sms / nda / afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that was the conclusion after the french and german finance ministers met in paris on tuesday , march 3 . french finance minister christine lagarde and her german counterpart peer steinbrueck said future action must be taken against any financial center that does not cooperate in the fight against tax fraud and money laundering . the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- is to prepare a " black list " of uncooperative countries for the next g20 summit , to be held in london on april 2 . the two finance ministers came together in the french capital to coordinate preparations for that meeting , which will focus the deepening global economic and financial crisis . lagarde demanded that all banks currently active in tax havens be forced to issue annual reports on their activities .

20 and one month ahead of a group of 20 summit of the world 's leading economies takes place in london . " what we 're talking about today is how , by us taking action , britain and america , we can help other countries join us in making for a more stable and effective financial system , " brown said . the turmoil in the financial markets is viewed as the biggest culprit in the economic downturn that has left both countries mired in a recession . both leaders have endorsed measures that better supervise the finance industry to prevent the high-risk lending that produced record mortgage defaults in the united states and the subsequent credit freeze .
playing on former president franklin delano roosevelt 's economic program during the great depression of the 1930s , brown has advocated a " global new deal . " global new deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a larger meeting of world leaders in april could bring about major changes to the banking system " there is the possibility in the next few months of a global new deal that will involve all the countries of the world in sorting out and cleaning up the banking system , " brown said . obama agreed with brown that more needs to be done to regulate international markets . " we believe in the free market , we believe in a government that is not overbearing and allows entrepreneurs and businesses to thrive , " obama said .
" but we also share a common belief that there have to be sufficient regulatory structures in place so that the market does n't spin out of control . " the talks in washington were being seen as preparation for the london g20 summit on april 2 , when leaders of the world 's major economies and global economic financial institutions will be gathering in the british capital to address the worldwide financial crisis . " now is the time for leaders of every country in the world to work together to agree the action that will see us through the current crisis and ensure we come out stronger , " brown said before meeting obama . more international support in afghanistan the trip to washington followed sunday 's informal eu council in brussels on the economic crisis .
following the meeting , brown said he would take a " clear message " from eu leaders to obama that agreeing a deal on the world economy was " vitally urgent . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama visited us troops in afghanistan during his campaign in addition to the economic crisis , the deteriorating security situation in afghanistan was another central topic to the talks . brown and obama agreed that the war in afghanistan is not winnable as long as taliban militants and al qaeda continue to find refuge in pakistan .
the conflict is at the top of obama 's foreign agenda , and he is expected to ask europe for more help . britain already has more than 8,000 soldiers in afghanistan , and the two leaders have sought greater contributions from other nato partners , an issue that will likely arise at the alliance 's summit next month . " both great britain and the united states share a deep interest in ensuring that neither afghanistan nor pakistan are safe havens for terrorist activity , " obama said , who has pledged to send 17,000 more us soldiers to afghanistan this year to join the 38,000 already there . global warming , iran 's suspect nuclear program and the middle east are also on the agenda in washington during brown 's visit . brown to warn of protectionism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european nations fear they could lose significant business through the " buy american " clause brown , in a speech before the us congress , will also call on countries to avoid trade protectionism , warning us lawmakers that retreating to protectionist economic policies could exacerbate the economic downturn even further . the eu has repeatedly criticized the " buy american " clause in the $ 787 billion us stimulus package , though it has been watered down .
it stipulated that only us iron , steel and manufactured goods could be used in construction work funded by the bill .
but the us administration has said it will respect international trade obligations . could obama 's shine wear off on brown ? analysts have said brown 's speech before congress could play a key role in boosting his popularity , as it would draw attention to his political efforts to demonstrate british leadership at a time of economic uncertainty .
he is only the fifth british prime minister to ever address the us congress . brown , who is suffering from ongoing low popularity at home , is struggling to gain public support for his domestic stimulus package and huge bank bailouts .
his governing labour party is trailing behind the opposition conservatives , with a general election coming up in 2010 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former president bush even invited blair to visit camp david in addition , the visit could help win back labour voters who turned their back on the party under brown 's predecessor tony blair . blair maintained close ties to former us president george w. bush - winning him the nickname " bush 's poodle . "
blair backed bush 's decision to invade iraq in 2003 and sent troops to join us forces in iraq and afghanistan . in an article for the british newspaper the sunday times , brown said there was " no international partnership in recent history that has served the world better than the special relationship between britain and the united states . "
he said he was keen to strengthen it further . us officials said the longtime friendship with britain was as important as ever to washington . sac / sms / nda / afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

european parliamentarians have voted to outlaw these goods , with the exception of traditional inuit hunting .
opponents say the ban may break international trade rules . the european parliament 's internal market committee has voted to strictly ban trading throughout the eu in products derived from seals .
a report approved by the committee on tuesday , march 3 , said the ban would cover seal products , as well as meat , oil , blubber , organs and fur skins . the parliament said in a statement that it had reacted to concerns by non-governmental organizations and public opinion in most member states about seal killings . " a clear majority of citizens across the european union are horrified by the cruel clubbing to death of thousands of seals every year , " said arlene mccarthy , the committee 's chair .
" they do not want these products on sale in the eu and today , the internal market committee has backed citizens ' demands for a ban . " inuit hunting only exception the european commission had proposed several exceptions to the ban , for example when the seals are killed " without causing avoidable pain , distress and any other form of suffering . "
but the committee 's meps chose to limit these by a 27-7 vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inuits will be able to continue their traditions in addition , they ignored the view of the committee 's rapporteur diana wallis , who had proposed a labeling system rather than an outright ban .
she said she believed it would be more effective in assuring the customer that animal welfare norms had been obeyed .
wallis said she doubted whether the ban , based on eu internal market rules , would be compatible with international trade rules . but danish mep christel schaldemose said legal opinions were not central in this case . " in this debate we are not dealing with a legal dilemma but a political one , to which parliament must give a political response , " schaldemose said . in practice , seal products such as bags , hats , boots and gloves used by motorcyclists , skiers and boxers would be outlawed , as would parapharmaceutical products sold as omega 3 fatty acid supplements . however , the committee did vote in favor of a proposed exception for inuit and other aboriginal communities living in greenland , canada , russia and the united states .
this would apply to products derived from traditional subsistence hunting that could be traded for cultural , educational , or ceremonial purposes , the committee said . harmonizing trade rules in the eu the new regulation would lay down common corresponding rules that are directly applicable throughout the eu .
at present , national laws vary , with some countries such as belgium and the netherlands having already banned trade in seal products and others expecting to do so . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seals are often shot or clubbed to death yet nordic eu countries such as denmark , sweden and finland have opposed such a ban .
canada and greenland have warned the eu that they could challenge such a ban before the world trade organization . canadian minister of fisheries and oceans gail shea said her government was " disappointed " by the vote , which would severely impact a major canadian export . " canada has made numerous attempts to set the facts straight about the canadian seal hunt and we have provided ample evidence of the humaneness and sustainability of the hunt , " shea said .
" unfortunately , this evidence is not yet understood in europe . " to become law , the ban still needs the approval of the entire eu assembly and eu governments .

the case , which opens a year and a day after president dimitry medvedev was elected , is being seen by some as a test of his commitment to reform . khodorkovsky faces fresh charges of embezzlement and money laundering that would leave him facing another long jail sentence , if he is found guilty .
" this case of immense importance because of what it will say to all of us about where russia is going , " robert amsterdam , a defence lawyer for khodorkovsky , told reuters news agency before the hearing .
khodorkovsky 's supporters have long alleged that he was arrested at the behest of the then president vladimir putin and his backers .
the oil tycoon had openly funded opposition parties such as the liberal yabloko faction in the run-up to 2003 parliamentary elections to the kremlin 's displeasure . the former yukos boss , who is currently serving an eight-year sentence , has said that corrupt officials also wanted to carve up his business empire , which produced more oil than opec member qatar .
expectations lowered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two heads are better than one ?
medvedev , a former lawyer who was sworn in as president last may , has demanded a clean-up of the russian court system since khodorkovsky 's sentence and criticised high-level corruption .
but there have been few signs of any substantive change .
" the expectations were modest .
it 's not fair to say that he 's disappointed them , but these expectations have become even more modest , " said andrei ryabov from the carnegie centre in moscow .
at an event to mark the first anniversary of his presidential election victory on monday , march 2 , medvedev expressed what seemed to be a commitment to the line of his predecessor , whom he appointed to the post of prime minister shortly after taking power .
on stage with vladimir putin , medvedev shouted " together we can continue the course set by president putin .
together we 'll win .

they have now passed the buck on to their finance counterparts . the european union is unable to set an exact figure on the aid it is willing to give developing nations in exchange for support of a global climate change pact , said czech environment minister martin bursik . it was " too early " for the 27-nation bloc " to put money on the table , " said bursik , whose country currently holds the eu presidency . " we were not quite able to reach consensus on the financing mechanism , " eu environment commissioner stavros dimas told reporters . the eu environment ministers met in brussels on monday , march 2 , to discuss the bloc 's negotiating position at talks for the un-sponsored climate change talks in copenhagen in december . " it makes no sense to say now how much the eu is willing to transfer , " germany 's environment minister sigmar gabriel said .
" we will negotiate that in copenhagen .
we are creeping towards a number . " usa plays a key role bursik said the eu still wanted to find out the united states ' mid-term targets , how much money the us would spend and whether washington would adopt a cap-and-trade system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time is running out to thwart global warming , experts say he said the eu presidency was confident that us president barack obama " will follow the leadership of the european union " by setting ambitious mid-term goals for cutting greenhouse gases . " we know that the us wants to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent by 2050 , -lrb- but -rrb- we do n't know what their mid-term target is , " bursik said . the eu and the us are considered the major donors that could get lesser developed nations involved in a new global drive to cut carbon dioxide emissions .
the eu has committed to reducing emissions by 30 percent of 1990 levels by 2020 if other developed countries commit to comparable cuts .
it has already put in place the measures to cut its own emissions by 20 percent . european environment ministers said they see obama as a great boost for finding a successor to the kyoto protocol in copenhagen .
his predecessor george w. bush refused to ratify the treaty . bursik and dimas said they would visit washington on march 14-15 to find out more about the intentions of the us administration .
according to bursik climate change would be one of the first things european union leaders discuss with obama when he visits prague for an eu-us summit in early april . passing on the " hot potato " joris den blanken , the eu climate and energy policy director for environmental group greenpeace , criticized that the issue has now been put on the agenda at the eu finance ministers meeting on march 10 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : efficient , clean sources of energy are required around the globe " environment ministers have ducked and passed the climate funding hot potato to finance ministers , " blanken said in a statement .
" while billions of taxpayers ' money is being used to prop up failed banks and carmakers , not one eurocent is being pledged to help the developing world tackle a problem that europeans helped create . " according to greenpeace , eu leaders should support a market-linked scheme where countries are asked to pay for part of their emissions . " the eu must contribute its fair share to poorer countries , " blanken said .
" the clock is ticking , global climate talks in copenhagen are less than 300 days away , and we still have little more than words on the table . " an eu report states that global investment to fight climate change will need to rise to some 175 billion euros -lrb- $ 220 billion -rrb- per year by 2020 .
over 90 billion euros of that sum must be spent in developing countries , the report said . greenpeace and other ngos have said the european union should be contributing around 35 billion euros by 2020 to overall assistance by industrialized countries to help developing nations deal with the effects of climate change . the issue is also on the agenda when the eu 's 27 heads of state and government come together for their next summit on march 19-20 . sac / sms / afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

wagner , 54 , has repeatedly provoked controversy in recent years .
he described the harry potter novels as " satanism " and implied that natural disasters such as hurricane katrina in 2005 and the 2004 boxing day tsunami in southeast asia were divine punishment for " spiritual pollution . "
following his appointment at the end of january austrian bishops accused the pope of ignoring established procedures for the selection and examination of candidates for preferment .
all but four of 35 deans present at a meeting of the linz diocese , in northern austria , refused to accept the nomination .
wagner eventually announced that he wanted to withdraw because of the " hefty criticism , " a move welcomed by many church leaders .
the storm came as the vatican was already under fire for lifting the excommunication of richard williamson , one of four bishops in a conservative breakaway faction of the catholic church , who denied that six million jews were gassed by the nazis during world war ii . nda / afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , the karlsruhe judges said the 2005 vote was still valid as there was no evidence of errors . september 's upcoming elections looks set to see a return to the more traditional pencil and paper countrywide .
constitutional judge andreas vosskuhle said that the judgment did not rule out digital voting for once and for all , but added that the equipment used four years ago did have shortcomings .

in addition , the two plaintiffs argued that the results were open to manipulation . germany first introduced electronic voting in european elections in 1999 and first used it in parliamentary ballots in 2002 , but 2005 saw the first large-scale deployment of the technology .

the case , which opens a year and a day after president dimitry medvedev was elected , is being seen by some as a test of his commitment to reform . khodorkovsky faces fresh charges of embezzlement and money laundering that would leave him facing another long jail sentence , if he is found guilty .
" this case of immense importance because of what it will say to all of us about where russia is going , " robert amsterdam , a defence lawyer for khodorkovsky , told reuters news agency before the hearing .
khodorkovsky 's supporters have long alleged that he was arrested at the behest of the then president vladimir putin and his backers .
the oil tycoon had openly funded opposition parties such as the liberal yabloko faction in the run-up to 2003 parliamentary elections to the kremlin 's displeasure . the former yukos boss , who is currently serving an eight-year sentence , has said that corrupt officials also wanted to carve up his business empire , which produced more oil than opec member qatar .
expectations lowered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two heads are better than one ?
medvedev , a former lawyer who was sworn in as president last may , has demanded a clean-up of the russian court system since khodorkovsky 's sentence and criticised high-level corruption .
but there have been few signs of any substantive change .
" the expectations were modest .
it 's not fair to say that he 's disappointed them , but these expectations have become even more modest , " said andrei ryabov from the carnegie centre in moscow .
at an event to mark the first anniversary of his presidential election victory on monday , march 2 , medvedev expressed what seemed to be a commitment to the line of his predecessor , whom he appointed to the post of prime minister shortly after taking power .
on stage with vladimir putin , medvedev shouted " together we can continue the course set by president putin .
together we 'll win .

but this bright figure ca n't conceal that the general outlook for the industry is gloomy . the german association of the automotive industry , or vda , announced on tuesday , march 3 , that a total of 277,800 vehicles had been sold in february . " these are the highest february sales for 10 years , " vda president matthias wissmann said at a press conference on the margins of the international motor show in geneva , switzerland . " new car registrations are back in positive territory for the first time in six months , " wissmann added .
" we expect a rise in new car sales compared with last year over the entire first quarter . " the good numbers have come after the german government offered consumers a bonus of 2,500 euros -lrb- $ 3,150 -rrb- to scrap older vehicles and buy new , more energy-efficient ones . figures have been strongest in the compact-car sector , not a traditional strength of german manufacturers , but wissmann said domestic production was also benefitting . " an initial analysis shows that one in two consumers who scrap their old cars chooses a model made by a german company , " wissmann said , adding that the industry was hoping to break the 3 million mark for new car registrations in 2009 . still , overall , german carmakers ' - in particular mercedes and bmw 's - share of their own domestic market declined .
fears abound that true recovery for the industry is still a long way off . sales abroad plummet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more cars at the scrapyards mean - temporarily at least - more new-car buyers as good as the domestic numbers were , figures for german car exports were down dramatically , falling by more than 50 percent in february to just over 200,000 vehicles .
production was also cut back by 47 percent . " despite the positive domestic numbers for february , we 're far from a sustained recovery on the world-wide markets , " wissmann said . in france , new car registrations were down by over 13 percent , despite similar governmental consumer incentives .
drops in spain and japan were 48.8 and 32.4 percent respectively . german carmakers hope their export figures will improve as economic stimulus measures taken by foreign countries begin to kick in .
the industry also pointed out that , while sales abroad are down drastically , german-made cars have made slight gains in market share in countries from china to the united states . " it shows the strength of german brands that they could increase their share of strategically important markets under the most difficult of conditions , " wissmann said . so for german carmakers , the proverbial glass is both half-full and half-empty .
if stimulus packages worldwide begin to work , the german automotive industry could start to rebound as early as the end of 2009 . but if foreign markets stay sluggish , then the premium for scrapping old cars wo n't be bridge between recession and recovers , but rather a one-off boost with few long-term effects . jc / sms / afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the case , which opens a year and a day after president dimitry medvedev was elected , is being seen by some as a test of his commitment to reform . khodorkovsky faces fresh charges of embezzlement and money laundering that would leave him facing another long jail sentence , if he is found guilty .
" this case of immense importance because of what it will say to all of us about where russia is going , " robert amsterdam , a defence lawyer for khodorkovsky , told reuters news agency before the hearing .
khodorkovsky 's supporters have long alleged that he was arrested at the behest of the then president vladimir putin and his backers .
the oil tycoon had openly funded opposition parties such as the liberal yabloko faction in the run-up to 2003 parliamentary elections to the kremlin 's displeasure . the former yukos boss , who is currently serving an eight-year sentence , has said that corrupt officials also wanted to carve up his business empire , which produced more oil than opec member qatar .

they have now passed the buck on to their finance counterparts . the european union is unable to set an exact figure on the aid it is willing to give developing nations in exchange for support of a global climate change pact , said czech environment minister martin bursik . it was " too early " for the 27-nation bloc " to put money on the table , " said bursik , whose country currently holds the eu presidency . " we were not quite able to reach consensus on the financing mechanism , " eu environment commissioner stavros dimas told reporters . the eu environment ministers met in brussels on monday , march 2 , to discuss the bloc 's negotiating position at talks for the un-sponsored climate change talks in copenhagen in december . " it makes no sense to say now how much the eu is willing to transfer , " germany 's environment minister sigmar gabriel said .
" we will negotiate that in copenhagen .
we are creeping towards a number . " usa plays a key role bursik said the eu still wanted to find out the united states ' mid-term targets , how much money the us would spend and whether washington would adopt a cap-and-trade system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time is running out to thwart global warming , experts say he said the eu presidency was confident that us president barack obama " will follow the leadership of the european union " by setting ambitious mid-term goals for cutting greenhouse gases . " we know that the us wants to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent by 2050 , -lrb- but -rrb- we do n't know what their mid-term target is , " bursik said . the eu and the us are considered the major donors that could get lesser developed nations involved in a new global drive to cut carbon dioxide emissions .
the eu has committed to reducing emissions by 30 percent of 1990 levels by 2020 if other developed countries commit to comparable cuts .
it has already put in place the measures to cut its own emissions by 20 percent . european environment ministers said they see obama as a great boost for finding a successor to the kyoto protocol in copenhagen .
his predecessor george w. bush refused to ratify the treaty . bursik and dimas said they would visit washington on march 14-15 to find out more about the intentions of the us administration .
according to bursik climate change would be one of the first things european union leaders discuss with obama when he visits prague for an eu-us summit in early april . passing on the " hot potato " joris den blanken , the eu climate and energy policy director for environmental group greenpeace , criticized that the issue has now been put on the agenda at the eu finance ministers meeting on march 10 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : efficient , clean sources of energy are required around the globe " environment ministers have ducked and passed the climate funding hot potato to finance ministers , " blanken said in a statement .
" while billions of taxpayers ' money is being used to prop up failed banks and carmakers , not one eurocent is being pledged to help the developing world tackle a problem that europeans helped create . " according to greenpeace , eu leaders should support a market-linked scheme where countries are asked to pay for part of their emissions . " the eu must contribute its fair share to poorer countries , " blanken said .
" the clock is ticking , global climate talks in copenhagen are less than 300 days away , and we still have little more than words on the table . " an eu report states that global investment to fight climate change will need to rise to some 175 billion euros -lrb- $ 220 billion -rrb- per year by 2020 .
over 90 billion euros of that sum must be spent in developing countries , the report said . greenpeace and other ngos have said the european union should be contributing around 35 billion euros by 2020 to overall assistance by industrialized countries to help developing nations deal with the effects of climate change . the issue is also on the agenda when the eu 's 27 heads of state and government come together for their next summit on march 19-20 . sac / sms / afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 03.03.2009 russian president wo n't " haggle " over us missile defense plans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us missile shield plans have been vehemently opposed in russia russian president medvedev has said he 's willing to discuss the proposed us missile shield with washington .
but he added that any deal linking those talks with negotiations regarding iran would not be productive . russian president dimitry medvedev 's comments came in response to a new york times report that us president barack obama had written a secret letter to his russian counterpart offering to halt the planned missile shield , which would be located mainly in poland and the czech republic , in return for moscow 's help in stopping iran from developing long-range nuclear weapons . the russian president welcomed the " positive signals " coming from the obama administration with which he said he hoped to reach " agreements . "
" haggling , " however , was " not productive , " added medvedev on tuesday , march 3 . the russian president also said obama 's letter had not presented the issue in such a way . obama on tuesday said the times report did not " accurately characterize the letter " he sent medvedev . " what i said in the letter was that , obviously , to the extent that we are lessening iran 's commitment to nuclear weapons , then that reduces the pressure for - or the need for a missile-defense system , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exact wording of obama 's letter to medvedev is unclear earlier , medvedev 's spokeswoman natalya timakova confirmed the receipt of a letter , but added that " there were no concrete proposals about any mutually binding decisions . " on sunday , the russia president was quoted as saying that moscow was waiting for new us proposals to resolve the missile dispute . the times ' sources said while the letter did not offer a direct quid pro quo deal , it was intended to give moscow an incentive to join the united states in a common front against iran . " it 's almost saying to them , put up or shut up , " an unnamed senior official told the newspaper .
" it 's not that the russians get to say , ' we 'll try and therefore you have to suspend . '
it says the threat has to go away . " too close to home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bush administration said the facilities were intended to stop iranian missiles russia has been bitterly opposed to the deployment of a us missile system in poland and the czech republic ever since it was proposed by the former us president george w. bush 's administration .
moscow believes the interceptor system is aimed at russia .
bush officials have said it was meant to counter missile threats from states such as iran . medvedev had warned last year that moscow would deploy nuclear-capable iskander missiles to kaliningrad , a russian exclave bordered by lithuania and poland , in response to the plans . there are indications that the missile defense shield will be on the agenda between foreign minister sergey lavrov and us secretary of state hillary clinton when they meet on friday . iranian nuclear program continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is in charge of construction at the bushehr site iran has repeatedly rejected calls by the un security council - of which russia and the united states are permanent members - to halt uranium enrichment , despite the imposition of three sets of sanctions .
the united states and its european allies believe that iran is seeking to develop nuclear weapons , a charge that tehran denies , saying that the program is purely civilian . iran recently began testing its bushehr nuclear plant , a construction project run by russia .
last week , tehran said its first nuclear power station could go on line within months . on monday , clinton reiterated washington 's willingness to engage with iran if it " unclenches its fist . "

the case , which opens a year and a day after president dimitry medvedev was elected , is being seen by some as a test of his commitment to reform . khodorkovsky faces fresh charges of embezzlement and money laundering that would leave him facing another long jail sentence , if he is found guilty .
" this case of immense importance because of what it will say to all of us about where russia is going , " robert amsterdam , a defence lawyer for khodorkovsky , told reuters news agency before the hearing .
khodorkovsky 's supporters have long alleged that he was arrested at the behest of the then president vladimir putin and his backers .
the oil tycoon had openly funded opposition parties such as the liberal yabloko faction in the run-up to 2003 parliamentary elections to the kremlin 's displeasure . the former yukos boss , who is currently serving an eight-year sentence , has said that corrupt officials also wanted to carve up his business empire , which produced more oil than opec member qatar .
expectations lowered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two heads are better than one ?
medvedev , a former lawyer who was sworn in as president last may , has demanded a clean-up of the russian court system since khodorkovsky 's sentence and criticised high-level corruption .
but there have been few signs of any substantive change .
" the expectations were modest .
it 's not fair to say that he 's disappointed them , but these expectations have become even more modest , " said andrei ryabov from the carnegie centre in moscow .
at an event to mark the first anniversary of his presidential election victory on monday , march 2 , medvedev expressed what seemed to be a commitment to the line of his predecessor , whom he appointed to the post of prime minister shortly after taking power .
on stage with vladimir putin , medvedev shouted " together we can continue the course set by president putin .
together we 'll win .

wagner , 54 , has repeatedly provoked controversy in recent years .
he described the harry potter novels as " satanism " and implied that natural disasters such as hurricane katrina in 2005 and the 2004 boxing day tsunami in southeast asia were divine punishment for " spiritual pollution . "
following his appointment at the end of january austrian bishops accused the pope of ignoring established procedures for the selection and examination of candidates for preferment .
all but four of 35 deans present at a meeting of the linz diocese , in northern austria , refused to accept the nomination .
wagner eventually announced that he wanted to withdraw because of the " hefty criticism , " a move welcomed by many church leaders .
the storm came as the vatican was already under fire for lifting the excommunication of richard williamson , one of four bishops in a conservative breakaway faction of the catholic church , who denied that six million jews were gassed by the nazis during world war ii . nda / afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but he added that any deal linking those talks with negotiations regarding iran would not be productive . russian president dimitry medvedev 's comments came in response to a new york times report that us president barack obama had written a secret letter to his russian counterpart offering to halt the planned missile shield , which would be located mainly in poland and the czech republic , in return for moscow 's help in stopping iran from developing long-range nuclear weapons . the russian president welcomed the " positive signals " coming from the obama administration with which he said he hoped to reach " agreements . "
" haggling , " however , was " not productive , " added medvedev on tuesday , march 3 . the russian president also said obama 's letter had not presented the issue in such a way . obama on tuesday said the times report did not " accurately characterize the letter " he sent medvedev . " what i said in the letter was that , obviously , to the extent that we are lessening iran 's commitment to nuclear weapons , then that reduces the pressure for - or the need for a missile-defense system , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exact wording of obama 's letter to medvedev is unclear earlier , medvedev 's spokeswoman natalya timakova confirmed the receipt of a letter , but added that " there were no concrete proposals about any mutually binding decisions . " on sunday , the russia president was quoted as saying that moscow was waiting for new us proposals to resolve the missile dispute . the times ' sources said while the letter did not offer a direct quid pro quo deal , it was intended to give moscow an incentive to join the united states in a common front against iran . " it 's almost saying to them , put up or shut up , " an unnamed senior official told the newspaper .

moscow believes the interceptor system is aimed at russia .
bush officials have said it was meant to counter missile threats from states such as iran . medvedev had warned last year that moscow would deploy nuclear-capable iskander missiles to kaliningrad , a russian exclave bordered by lithuania and poland , in response to the plans . there are indications that the missile defense shield will be on the agenda between foreign minister sergey lavrov and us secretary of state hillary clinton when they meet on friday . iranian nuclear program continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is in charge of construction at the bushehr site iran has repeatedly rejected calls by the un security council - of which russia and the united states are permanent members - to halt uranium enrichment , despite the imposition of three sets of sanctions .

last week , tehran said its first nuclear power station could go on line within months . on monday , clinton reiterated washington 's willingness to engage with iran if it " unclenches its fist . "

european parliamentarians have voted to outlaw these goods , with the exception of traditional inuit hunting .
opponents say the ban may break international trade rules . the european parliament 's internal market committee has voted to strictly ban trading throughout the eu in products derived from seals .
a report approved by the committee on tuesday , march 3 , said the ban would cover seal products , as well as meat , oil , blubber , organs and fur skins . the parliament said in a statement that it had reacted to concerns by non-governmental organizations and public opinion in most member states about seal killings . " a clear majority of citizens across the european union are horrified by the cruel clubbing to death of thousands of seals every year , " said arlene mccarthy , the committee 's chair .
" they do not want these products on sale in the eu and today , the internal market committee has backed citizens ' demands for a ban . " inuit hunting only exception the european commission had proposed several exceptions to the ban , for example when the seals are killed " without causing avoidable pain , distress and any other form of suffering . "
but the committee 's meps chose to limit these by a 27-7 vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inuits will be able to continue their traditions in addition , they ignored the view of the committee 's rapporteur diana wallis , who had proposed a labeling system rather than an outright ban .
she said she believed it would be more effective in assuring the customer that animal welfare norms had been obeyed .
wallis said she doubted whether the ban , based on eu internal market rules , would be compatible with international trade rules . but danish mep christel schaldemose said legal opinions were not central in this case . " in this debate we are not dealing with a legal dilemma but a political one , to which parliament must give a political response , " schaldemose said . in practice , seal products such as bags , hats , boots and gloves used by motorcyclists , skiers and boxers would be outlawed , as would parapharmaceutical products sold as omega 3 fatty acid supplements . however , the committee did vote in favor of a proposed exception for inuit and other aboriginal communities living in greenland , canada , russia and the united states .
this would apply to products derived from traditional subsistence hunting that could be traded for cultural , educational , or ceremonial purposes , the committee said . harmonizing trade rules in the eu the new regulation would lay down common corresponding rules that are directly applicable throughout the eu .
at present , national laws vary , with some countries such as belgium and the netherlands having already banned trade in seal products and others expecting to do so . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seals are often shot or clubbed to death yet nordic eu countries such as denmark , sweden and finland have opposed such a ban .
canada and greenland have warned the eu that they could challenge such a ban before the world trade organization . canadian minister of fisheries and oceans gail shea said her government was " disappointed " by the vote , which would severely impact a major canadian export . " canada has made numerous attempts to set the facts straight about the canadian seal hunt and we have provided ample evidence of the humaneness and sustainability of the hunt , " shea said .
" unfortunately , this evidence is not yet understood in europe . " to become law , the ban still needs the approval of the entire eu assembly and eu governments .

european parliamentarians have voted to outlaw these goods , with the exception of traditional inuit hunting .
opponents say the ban may break international trade rules . the european parliament 's internal market committee has voted to strictly ban trading throughout the eu in products derived from seals .
a report approved by the committee on tuesday , march 3 , said the ban would cover seal products , as well as meat , oil , blubber , organs and fur skins . the parliament said in a statement that it had reacted to concerns by non-governmental organizations and public opinion in most member states about seal killings . " a clear majority of citizens across the european union are horrified by the cruel clubbing to death of thousands of seals every year , " said arlene mccarthy , the committee 's chair .
" they do not want these products on sale in the eu and today , the internal market committee has backed citizens ' demands for a ban . " inuit hunting only exception the european commission had proposed several exceptions to the ban , for example when the seals are killed " without causing avoidable pain , distress and any other form of suffering . "
but the committee 's meps chose to limit these by a 27-7 vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inuits will be able to continue their traditions in addition , they ignored the view of the committee 's rapporteur diana wallis , who had proposed a labeling system rather than an outright ban .
she said she believed it would be more effective in assuring the customer that animal welfare norms had been obeyed .
wallis said she doubted whether the ban , based on eu internal market rules , would be compatible with international trade rules . but danish mep christel schaldemose said legal opinions were not central in this case . " in this debate we are not dealing with a legal dilemma but a political one , to which parliament must give a political response , " schaldemose said . in practice , seal products such as bags , hats , boots and gloves used by motorcyclists , skiers and boxers would be outlawed , as would parapharmaceutical products sold as omega 3 fatty acid supplements . however , the committee did vote in favor of a proposed exception for inuit and other aboriginal communities living in greenland , canada , russia and the united states .
this would apply to products derived from traditional subsistence hunting that could be traded for cultural , educational , or ceremonial purposes , the committee said . harmonizing trade rules in the eu the new regulation would lay down common corresponding rules that are directly applicable throughout the eu .
at present , national laws vary , with some countries such as belgium and the netherlands having already banned trade in seal products and others expecting to do so . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seals are often shot or clubbed to death yet nordic eu countries such as denmark , sweden and finland have opposed such a ban .
canada and greenland have warned the eu that they could challenge such a ban before the world trade organization . canadian minister of fisheries and oceans gail shea said her government was " disappointed " by the vote , which would severely impact a major canadian export . " canada has made numerous attempts to set the facts straight about the canadian seal hunt and we have provided ample evidence of the humaneness and sustainability of the hunt , " shea said .
" unfortunately , this evidence is not yet understood in europe . " to become law , the ban still needs the approval of the entire eu assembly and eu governments .

but this bright figure ca n't conceal that the general outlook for the industry is gloomy . the german association of the automotive industry , or vda , announced on tuesday , march 3 , that a total of 277,800 vehicles had been sold in february . " these are the highest february sales for 10 years , " vda president matthias wissmann said at a press conference on the margins of the international motor show in geneva , switzerland . " new car registrations are back in positive territory for the first time in six months , " wissmann added .
" we expect a rise in new car sales compared with last year over the entire first quarter . " the good numbers have come after the german government offered consumers a bonus of 2,500 euros -lrb- $ 3,150 -rrb- to scrap older vehicles and buy new , more energy-efficient ones . figures have been strongest in the compact-car sector , not a traditional strength of german manufacturers , but wissmann said domestic production was also benefitting . " an initial analysis shows that one in two consumers who scrap their old cars chooses a model made by a german company , " wissmann said , adding that the industry was hoping to break the 3 million mark for new car registrations in 2009 . still , overall , german carmakers ' - in particular mercedes and bmw 's - share of their own domestic market declined .
fears abound that true recovery for the industry is still a long way off . sales abroad plummet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more cars at the scrapyards mean - temporarily at least - more new-car buyers as good as the domestic numbers were , figures for german car exports were down dramatically , falling by more than 50 percent in february to just over 200,000 vehicles .
production was also cut back by 47 percent . " despite the positive domestic numbers for february , we 're far from a sustained recovery on the world-wide markets , " wissmann said . in france , new car registrations were down by over 13 percent , despite similar governmental consumer incentives .
drops in spain and japan were 48.8 and 32.4 percent respectively . german carmakers hope their export figures will improve as economic stimulus measures taken by foreign countries begin to kick in .
the industry also pointed out that , while sales abroad are down drastically , german-made cars have made slight gains in market share in countries from china to the united states . " it shows the strength of german brands that they could increase their share of strategically important markets under the most difficult of conditions , " wissmann said . so for german carmakers , the proverbial glass is both half-full and half-empty .
if stimulus packages worldwide begin to work , the german automotive industry could start to rebound as early as the end of 2009 . but if foreign markets stay sluggish , then the premium for scrapping old cars wo n't be bridge between recession and recovers , but rather a one-off boost with few long-term effects . jc / sms / afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

20 and one month ahead of a group of 20 summit of the world 's leading economies takes place in london . " what we 're talking about today is how , by us taking action , britain and america , we can help other countries join us in making for a more stable and effective financial system , " brown said . the turmoil in the financial markets is viewed as the biggest culprit in the economic downturn that has left both countries mired in a recession . both leaders have endorsed measures that better supervise the finance industry to prevent the high-risk lending that produced record mortgage defaults in the united states and the subsequent credit freeze .
playing on former president franklin delano roosevelt 's economic program during the great depression of the 1930s , brown has advocated a " global new deal . " global new deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a larger meeting of world leaders in april could bring about major changes to the banking system " there is the possibility in the next few months of a global new deal that will involve all the countries of the world in sorting out and cleaning up the banking system , " brown said . obama agreed with brown that more needs to be done to regulate international markets . " we believe in the free market , we believe in a government that is not overbearing and allows entrepreneurs and businesses to thrive , " obama said .
" but we also share a common belief that there have to be sufficient regulatory structures in place so that the market does n't spin out of control . " the talks in washington were being seen as preparation for the london g20 summit on april 2 , when leaders of the world 's major economies and global economic financial institutions will be gathering in the british capital to address the worldwide financial crisis . " now is the time for leaders of every country in the world to work together to agree the action that will see us through the current crisis and ensure we come out stronger , " brown said before meeting obama . more international support in afghanistan the trip to washington followed sunday 's informal eu council in brussels on the economic crisis .
following the meeting , brown said he would take a " clear message " from eu leaders to obama that agreeing a deal on the world economy was " vitally urgent . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama visited us troops in afghanistan during his campaign in addition to the economic crisis , the deteriorating security situation in afghanistan was another central topic to the talks . brown and obama agreed that the war in afghanistan is not winnable as long as taliban militants and al qaeda continue to find refuge in pakistan .
the conflict is at the top of obama 's foreign agenda , and he is expected to ask europe for more help . britain already has more than 8,000 soldiers in afghanistan , and the two leaders have sought greater contributions from other nato partners , an issue that will likely arise at the alliance 's summit next month . " both great britain and the united states share a deep interest in ensuring that neither afghanistan nor pakistan are safe havens for terrorist activity , " obama said , who has pledged to send 17,000 more us soldiers to afghanistan this year to join the 38,000 already there . global warming , iran 's suspect nuclear program and the middle east are also on the agenda in washington during brown 's visit . brown to warn of protectionism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european nations fear they could lose significant business through the " buy american " clause brown , in a speech before the us congress , will also call on countries to avoid trade protectionism , warning us lawmakers that retreating to protectionist economic policies could exacerbate the economic downturn even further . the eu has repeatedly criticized the " buy american " clause in the $ 787 billion us stimulus package , though it has been watered down .
it stipulated that only us iron , steel and manufactured goods could be used in construction work funded by the bill .
but the us administration has said it will respect international trade obligations . could obama 's shine wear off on brown ? analysts have said brown 's speech before congress could play a key role in boosting his popularity , as it would draw attention to his political efforts to demonstrate british leadership at a time of economic uncertainty .
he is only the fifth british prime minister to ever address the us congress . brown , who is suffering from ongoing low popularity at home , is struggling to gain public support for his domestic stimulus package and huge bank bailouts .
his governing labour party is trailing behind the opposition conservatives , with a general election coming up in 2010 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former president bush even invited blair to visit camp david in addition , the visit could help win back labour voters who turned their back on the party under brown 's predecessor tony blair . blair maintained close ties to former us president george w. bush - winning him the nickname " bush 's poodle . "
blair backed bush 's decision to invade iraq in 2003 and sent troops to join us forces in iraq and afghanistan . in an article for the british newspaper the sunday times , brown said there was " no international partnership in recent history that has served the world better than the special relationship between britain and the united states . "
he said he was keen to strengthen it further . us officials said the longtime friendship with britain was as important as ever to washington . sac / sms / nda / afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 03.03.2009 obama , brown stress need for global unity in fighting economic crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama and brown both said more needs to be done to regulate financial markets britain 's prime minister gordon brown and us president barack obama on tuesday , march 3 , discussed a " global new deal " to rebuild the world economy and urged nations to cooperate in regulating financial markets . the two leaders met for the first time since obama took office on jan .
20 and one month ahead of a group of 20 summit of the world 's leading economies takes place in london . " what we 're talking about today is how , by us taking action , britain and america , we can help other countries join us in making for a more stable and effective financial system , " brown said . the turmoil in the financial markets is viewed as the biggest culprit in the economic downturn that has left both countries mired in a recession . both leaders have endorsed measures that better supervise the finance industry to prevent the high-risk lending that produced record mortgage defaults in the united states and the subsequent credit freeze .
playing on former president franklin delano roosevelt 's economic program during the great depression of the 1930s , brown has advocated a " global new deal . " global new deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a larger meeting of world leaders in april could bring about major changes to the banking system " there is the possibility in the next few months of a global new deal that will involve all the countries of the world in sorting out and cleaning up the banking system , " brown said . obama agreed with brown that more needs to be done to regulate international markets . " we believe in the free market , we believe in a government that is not overbearing and allows entrepreneurs and businesses to thrive , " obama said .
" but we also share a common belief that there have to be sufficient regulatory structures in place so that the market does n't spin out of control . " the talks in washington were being seen as preparation for the london g20 summit on april 2 , when leaders of the world 's major economies and global economic financial institutions will be gathering in the british capital to address the worldwide financial crisis . " now is the time for leaders of every country in the world to work together to agree the action that will see us through the current crisis and ensure we come out stronger , " brown said before meeting obama . more international support in afghanistan the trip to washington followed sunday 's informal eu council in brussels on the economic crisis .
following the meeting , brown said he would take a " clear message " from eu leaders to obama that agreeing a deal on the world economy was " vitally urgent . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama visited us troops in afghanistan during his campaign in addition to the economic crisis , the deteriorating security situation in afghanistan was another central topic to the talks . brown and obama agreed that the war in afghanistan is not winnable as long as taliban militants and al qaeda continue to find refuge in pakistan .
the conflict is at the top of obama 's foreign agenda , and he is expected to ask europe for more help . britain already has more than 8,000 soldiers in afghanistan , and the two leaders have sought greater contributions from other nato partners , an issue that will likely arise at the alliance 's summit next month . " both great britain and the united states share a deep interest in ensuring that neither afghanistan nor pakistan are safe havens for terrorist activity , " obama said , who has pledged to send 17,000 more us soldiers to afghanistan this year to join the 38,000 already there . global warming , iran 's suspect nuclear program and the middle east are also on the agenda in washington during brown 's visit . brown to warn of protectionism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european nations fear they could lose significant business through the " buy american " clause brown , in a speech before the us congress , will also call on countries to avoid trade protectionism , warning us lawmakers that retreating to protectionist economic policies could exacerbate the economic downturn even further . the eu has repeatedly criticized the " buy american " clause in the $ 787 billion us stimulus package , though it has been watered down .
it stipulated that only us iron , steel and manufactured goods could be used in construction work funded by the bill .
but the us administration has said it will respect international trade obligations . could obama 's shine wear off on brown ? analysts have said brown 's speech before congress could play a key role in boosting his popularity , as it would draw attention to his political efforts to demonstrate british leadership at a time of economic uncertainty .
he is only the fifth british prime minister to ever address the us congress . brown , who is suffering from ongoing low popularity at home , is struggling to gain public support for his domestic stimulus package and huge bank bailouts .
his governing labour party is trailing behind the opposition conservatives , with a general election coming up in 2010 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former president bush even invited blair to visit camp david in addition , the visit could help win back labour voters who turned their back on the party under brown 's predecessor tony blair . blair maintained close ties to former us president george w. bush - winning him the nickname " bush 's poodle . "
blair backed bush 's decision to invade iraq in 2003 and sent troops to join us forces in iraq and afghanistan . in an article for the british newspaper the sunday times , brown said there was " no international partnership in recent history that has served the world better than the special relationship between britain and the united states . "
he said he was keen to strengthen it further . us officials said the longtime friendship with britain was as important as ever to washington . sac / sms / nda / afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

european parliamentarians have voted to outlaw these goods , with the exception of traditional inuit hunting .
opponents say the ban may break international trade rules . the european parliament 's internal market committee has voted to strictly ban trading throughout the eu in products derived from seals .
a report approved by the committee on tuesday , march 3 , said the ban would cover seal products , as well as meat , oil , blubber , organs and fur skins . the parliament said in a statement that it had reacted to concerns by non-governmental organizations and public opinion in most member states about seal killings . " a clear majority of citizens across the european union are horrified by the cruel clubbing to death of thousands of seals every year , " said arlene mccarthy , the committee 's chair .
" they do not want these products on sale in the eu and today , the internal market committee has backed citizens ' demands for a ban . " inuit hunting only exception the european commission had proposed several exceptions to the ban , for example when the seals are killed " without causing avoidable pain , distress and any other form of suffering . "
but the committee 's meps chose to limit these by a 27-7 vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inuits will be able to continue their traditions in addition , they ignored the view of the committee 's rapporteur diana wallis , who had proposed a labeling system rather than an outright ban .
she said she believed it would be more effective in assuring the customer that animal welfare norms had been obeyed .
wallis said she doubted whether the ban , based on eu internal market rules , would be compatible with international trade rules . but danish mep christel schaldemose said legal opinions were not central in this case . " in this debate we are not dealing with a legal dilemma but a political one , to which parliament must give a political response , " schaldemose said . in practice , seal products such as bags , hats , boots and gloves used by motorcyclists , skiers and boxers would be outlawed , as would parapharmaceutical products sold as omega 3 fatty acid supplements . however , the committee did vote in favor of a proposed exception for inuit and other aboriginal communities living in greenland , canada , russia and the united states .
this would apply to products derived from traditional subsistence hunting that could be traded for cultural , educational , or ceremonial purposes , the committee said . harmonizing trade rules in the eu the new regulation would lay down common corresponding rules that are directly applicable throughout the eu .
at present , national laws vary , with some countries such as belgium and the netherlands having already banned trade in seal products and others expecting to do so . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seals are often shot or clubbed to death yet nordic eu countries such as denmark , sweden and finland have opposed such a ban .
canada and greenland have warned the eu that they could challenge such a ban before the world trade organization . canadian minister of fisheries and oceans gail shea said her government was " disappointed " by the vote , which would severely impact a major canadian export . " canada has made numerous attempts to set the facts straight about the canadian seal hunt and we have provided ample evidence of the humaneness and sustainability of the hunt , " shea said .
" unfortunately , this evidence is not yet understood in europe . " to become law , the ban still needs the approval of the entire eu assembly and eu governments .

they have now passed the buck on to their finance counterparts . the european union is unable to set an exact figure on the aid it is willing to give developing nations in exchange for support of a global climate change pact , said czech environment minister martin bursik . it was " too early " for the 27-nation bloc " to put money on the table , " said bursik , whose country currently holds the eu presidency . " we were not quite able to reach consensus on the financing mechanism , " eu environment commissioner stavros dimas told reporters . the eu environment ministers met in brussels on monday , march 2 , to discuss the bloc 's negotiating position at talks for the un-sponsored climate change talks in copenhagen in december . " it makes no sense to say now how much the eu is willing to transfer , " germany 's environment minister sigmar gabriel said .
" we will negotiate that in copenhagen .

" we know that the us wants to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent by 2050 , -lrb- but -rrb- we do n't know what their mid-term target is , " bursik said . the eu and the us are considered the major donors that could get lesser developed nations involved in a new global drive to cut carbon dioxide emissions .
the eu has committed to reducing emissions by 30 percent of 1990 levels by 2020 if other developed countries commit to comparable cuts .
it has already put in place the measures to cut its own emissions by 20 percent . european environment ministers said they see obama as a great boost for finding a successor to the kyoto protocol in copenhagen .
his predecessor george w. bush refused to ratify the treaty . bursik and dimas said they would visit washington on march 14-15 to find out more about the intentions of the us administration .
according to bursik climate change would be one of the first things european union leaders discuss with obama when he visits prague for an eu-us summit in early april . passing on the " hot potato " joris den blanken , the eu climate and energy policy director for environmental group greenpeace , criticized that the issue has now been put on the agenda at the eu finance ministers meeting on march 10 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : efficient , clean sources of energy are required around the globe " environment ministers have ducked and passed the climate funding hot potato to finance ministers , " blanken said in a statement .

they have now passed the buck on to their finance counterparts . the european union is unable to set an exact figure on the aid it is willing to give developing nations in exchange for support of a global climate change pact , said czech environment minister martin bursik . it was " too early " for the 27-nation bloc " to put money on the table , " said bursik , whose country currently holds the eu presidency . " we were not quite able to reach consensus on the financing mechanism , " eu environment commissioner stavros dimas told reporters . the eu environment ministers met in brussels on monday , march 2 , to discuss the bloc 's negotiating position at talks for the un-sponsored climate change talks in copenhagen in december . " it makes no sense to say now how much the eu is willing to transfer , " germany 's environment minister sigmar gabriel said .
" we will negotiate that in copenhagen .
we are creeping towards a number . " usa plays a key role bursik said the eu still wanted to find out the united states ' mid-term targets , how much money the us would spend and whether washington would adopt a cap-and-trade system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time is running out to thwart global warming , experts say he said the eu presidency was confident that us president barack obama " will follow the leadership of the european union " by setting ambitious mid-term goals for cutting greenhouse gases . " we know that the us wants to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent by 2050 , -lrb- but -rrb- we do n't know what their mid-term target is , " bursik said . the eu and the us are considered the major donors that could get lesser developed nations involved in a new global drive to cut carbon dioxide emissions .
the eu has committed to reducing emissions by 30 percent of 1990 levels by 2020 if other developed countries commit to comparable cuts .
it has already put in place the measures to cut its own emissions by 20 percent . european environment ministers said they see obama as a great boost for finding a successor to the kyoto protocol in copenhagen .
his predecessor george w. bush refused to ratify the treaty . bursik and dimas said they would visit washington on march 14-15 to find out more about the intentions of the us administration .
according to bursik climate change would be one of the first things european union leaders discuss with obama when he visits prague for an eu-us summit in early april . passing on the " hot potato " joris den blanken , the eu climate and energy policy director for environmental group greenpeace , criticized that the issue has now been put on the agenda at the eu finance ministers meeting on march 10 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : efficient , clean sources of energy are required around the globe " environment ministers have ducked and passed the climate funding hot potato to finance ministers , " blanken said in a statement .
" while billions of taxpayers ' money is being used to prop up failed banks and carmakers , not one eurocent is being pledged to help the developing world tackle a problem that europeans helped create . " according to greenpeace , eu leaders should support a market-linked scheme where countries are asked to pay for part of their emissions . " the eu must contribute its fair share to poorer countries , " blanken said .
" the clock is ticking , global climate talks in copenhagen are less than 300 days away , and we still have little more than words on the table . " an eu report states that global investment to fight climate change will need to rise to some 175 billion euros -lrb- $ 220 billion -rrb- per year by 2020 .
over 90 billion euros of that sum must be spent in developing countries , the report said . greenpeace and other ngos have said the european union should be contributing around 35 billion euros by 2020 to overall assistance by industrialized countries to help developing nations deal with the effects of climate change . the issue is also on the agenda when the eu 's 27 heads of state and government come together for their next summit on march 19-20 . sac / sms / afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" based on the extremely weak business at the beginning of the year , earnings will not reach the high levels of previous years , " the company added .

the case , which opens a year and a day after president dimitry medvedev was elected , is being seen by some as a test of his commitment to reform . khodorkovsky faces fresh charges of embezzlement and money laundering that would leave him facing another long jail sentence , if he is found guilty .
" this case of immense importance because of what it will say to all of us about where russia is going , " robert amsterdam , a defence lawyer for khodorkovsky , told reuters news agency before the hearing .
khodorkovsky 's supporters have long alleged that he was arrested at the behest of the then president vladimir putin and his backers .
the oil tycoon had openly funded opposition parties such as the liberal yabloko faction in the run-up to 2003 parliamentary elections to the kremlin 's displeasure . the former yukos boss , who is currently serving an eight-year sentence , has said that corrupt officials also wanted to carve up his business empire , which produced more oil than opec member qatar .
expectations lowered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two heads are better than one ?
medvedev , a former lawyer who was sworn in as president last may , has demanded a clean-up of the russian court system since khodorkovsky 's sentence and criticised high-level corruption .
but there have been few signs of any substantive change .
" the expectations were modest .
it 's not fair to say that he 's disappointed them , but these expectations have become even more modest , " said andrei ryabov from the carnegie centre in moscow .
at an event to mark the first anniversary of his presidential election victory on monday , march 2 , medvedev expressed what seemed to be a commitment to the line of his predecessor , whom he appointed to the post of prime minister shortly after taking power .
on stage with vladimir putin , medvedev shouted " together we can continue the course set by president putin .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 03.03.2009 russian president wo n't " haggle " over us missile defense plans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us missile shield plans have been vehemently opposed in russia russian president medvedev has said he 's willing to discuss the proposed us missile shield with washington .
but he added that any deal linking those talks with negotiations regarding iran would not be productive . russian president dimitry medvedev 's comments came in response to a new york times report that us president barack obama had written a secret letter to his russian counterpart offering to halt the planned missile shield , which would be located mainly in poland and the czech republic , in return for moscow 's help in stopping iran from developing long-range nuclear weapons . the russian president welcomed the " positive signals " coming from the obama administration with which he said he hoped to reach " agreements . "
" haggling , " however , was " not productive , " added medvedev on tuesday , march 3 . the russian president also said obama 's letter had not presented the issue in such a way . obama on tuesday said the times report did not " accurately characterize the letter " he sent medvedev . " what i said in the letter was that , obviously , to the extent that we are lessening iran 's commitment to nuclear weapons , then that reduces the pressure for - or the need for a missile-defense system , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exact wording of obama 's letter to medvedev is unclear earlier , medvedev 's spokeswoman natalya timakova confirmed the receipt of a letter , but added that " there were no concrete proposals about any mutually binding decisions . " on sunday , the russia president was quoted as saying that moscow was waiting for new us proposals to resolve the missile dispute . the times ' sources said while the letter did not offer a direct quid pro quo deal , it was intended to give moscow an incentive to join the united states in a common front against iran . " it 's almost saying to them , put up or shut up , " an unnamed senior official told the newspaper .
" it 's not that the russians get to say , ' we 'll try and therefore you have to suspend . '
it says the threat has to go away . " too close to home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bush administration said the facilities were intended to stop iranian missiles russia has been bitterly opposed to the deployment of a us missile system in poland and the czech republic ever since it was proposed by the former us president george w. bush 's administration .
moscow believes the interceptor system is aimed at russia .
bush officials have said it was meant to counter missile threats from states such as iran . medvedev had warned last year that moscow would deploy nuclear-capable iskander missiles to kaliningrad , a russian exclave bordered by lithuania and poland , in response to the plans . there are indications that the missile defense shield will be on the agenda between foreign minister sergey lavrov and us secretary of state hillary clinton when they meet on friday . iranian nuclear program continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is in charge of construction at the bushehr site iran has repeatedly rejected calls by the un security council - of which russia and the united states are permanent members - to halt uranium enrichment , despite the imposition of three sets of sanctions .
the united states and its european allies believe that iran is seeking to develop nuclear weapons , a charge that tehran denies , saying that the program is purely civilian . iran recently began testing its bushehr nuclear plant , a construction project run by russia .
last week , tehran said its first nuclear power station could go on line within months . on monday , clinton reiterated washington 's willingness to engage with iran if it " unclenches its fist . "
this represents a clear switch in policy from the previous us administration , which made talks dependent upon iran halting the enrichment process . russian news agencies cited lavrov as saying that us talks with iran could help to end the international standoff over its nuclear program and boost regional security . jg / sms / nda / afp / dpa / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but he added that any deal linking those talks with negotiations regarding iran would not be productive . russian president dimitry medvedev 's comments came in response to a new york times report that us president barack obama had written a secret letter to his russian counterpart offering to halt the planned missile shield , which would be located mainly in poland and the czech republic , in return for moscow 's help in stopping iran from developing long-range nuclear weapons . the russian president welcomed the " positive signals " coming from the obama administration with which he said he hoped to reach " agreements . "
" haggling , " however , was " not productive , " added medvedev on tuesday , march 3 . the russian president also said obama 's letter had not presented the issue in such a way . obama on tuesday said the times report did not " accurately characterize the letter " he sent medvedev . " what i said in the letter was that , obviously , to the extent that we are lessening iran 's commitment to nuclear weapons , then that reduces the pressure for - or the need for a missile-defense system , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exact wording of obama 's letter to medvedev is unclear earlier , medvedev 's spokeswoman natalya timakova confirmed the receipt of a letter , but added that " there were no concrete proposals about any mutually binding decisions .

bush officials have said it was meant to counter missile threats from states such as iran . medvedev had warned last year that moscow would deploy nuclear-capable iskander missiles to kaliningrad , a russian exclave bordered by lithuania and poland , in response to the plans . there are indications that the missile defense shield will be on the agenda between foreign minister sergey lavrov and us secretary of state hillary clinton when they meet on friday . iranian nuclear program continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is in charge of construction at the bushehr site iran has repeatedly rejected calls by the un security council - of which russia and the united states are permanent members - to halt uranium enrichment , despite the imposition of three sets of sanctions .

however , the karlsruhe judges said the 2005 vote was still valid as there was no evidence of errors . september 's upcoming elections looks set to see a return to the more traditional pencil and paper countrywide .
constitutional judge andreas vosskuhle said that the judgment did not rule out digital voting for once and for all , but added that the equipment used four years ago did have shortcomings .
nevertheless , vosskuhle said there was no indication that there had been any errors .
some two million voters in five different german states submitted their ballots electronically in 2005 .
father and son opposed the technology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes the old solutions are the best the use of electronic voting was challenged by a father-and-son team .
political scientist joachim wiesner and son , physicist ulrich wiesner complained that push button voting was not transparent because the voter could not see what actually happened to his vote inside the computer and was required to place " blind faith " in the technology .
in addition , the two plaintiffs argued that the results were open to manipulation . germany first introduced electronic voting in european elections in 1999 and first used it in parliamentary ballots in 2002 , but 2005 saw the first large-scale deployment of the technology .
german hacker-cum-data-protection group chaos computer club has been spearheading a campaign with the dutch foundation wij vertrouwen stemcomputers niet -lrb- we do n't trust voting computers -rrb- to stop the further spread of electronic voting because of fears about the risk of electronic errors and the potential for abuse .
in 2008 , the dutch government decertified the use of existing paperless systems and rejected a proposal to develop a new generation of voting computers . jg / nda / dpa / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

20 and one month ahead of a group of 20 summit of the world 's leading economies takes place in london . " what we 're talking about today is how , by us taking action , britain and america , we can help other countries join us in making for a more stable and effective financial system , " brown said . the turmoil in the financial markets is viewed as the biggest culprit in the economic downturn that has left both countries mired in a recession . both leaders have endorsed measures that better supervise the finance industry to prevent the high-risk lending that produced record mortgage defaults in the united states and the subsequent credit freeze .
playing on former president franklin delano roosevelt 's economic program during the great depression of the 1930s , brown has advocated a " global new deal . " global new deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a larger meeting of world leaders in april could bring about major changes to the banking system " there is the possibility in the next few months of a global new deal that will involve all the countries of the world in sorting out and cleaning up the banking system , " brown said . obama agreed with brown that more needs to be done to regulate international markets . " we believe in the free market , we believe in a government that is not overbearing and allows entrepreneurs and businesses to thrive , " obama said .
" but we also share a common belief that there have to be sufficient regulatory structures in place so that the market does n't spin out of control . " the talks in washington were being seen as preparation for the london g20 summit on april 2 , when leaders of the world 's major economies and global economic financial institutions will be gathering in the british capital to address the worldwide financial crisis . " now is the time for leaders of every country in the world to work together to agree the action that will see us through the current crisis and ensure we come out stronger , " brown said before meeting obama . more international support in afghanistan the trip to washington followed sunday 's informal eu council in brussels on the economic crisis .
following the meeting , brown said he would take a " clear message " from eu leaders to obama that agreeing a deal on the world economy was " vitally urgent . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama visited us troops in afghanistan during his campaign in addition to the economic crisis , the deteriorating security situation in afghanistan was another central topic to the talks . brown and obama agreed that the war in afghanistan is not winnable as long as taliban militants and al qaeda continue to find refuge in pakistan .
the conflict is at the top of obama 's foreign agenda , and he is expected to ask europe for more help . britain already has more than 8,000 soldiers in afghanistan , and the two leaders have sought greater contributions from other nato partners , an issue that will likely arise at the alliance 's summit next month . " both great britain and the united states share a deep interest in ensuring that neither afghanistan nor pakistan are safe havens for terrorist activity , " obama said , who has pledged to send 17,000 more us soldiers to afghanistan this year to join the 38,000 already there . global warming , iran 's suspect nuclear program and the middle east are also on the agenda in washington during brown 's visit . brown to warn of protectionism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european nations fear they could lose significant business through the " buy american " clause brown , in a speech before the us congress , will also call on countries to avoid trade protectionism , warning us lawmakers that retreating to protectionist economic policies could exacerbate the economic downturn even further . the eu has repeatedly criticized the " buy american " clause in the $ 787 billion us stimulus package , though it has been watered down .
it stipulated that only us iron , steel and manufactured goods could be used in construction work funded by the bill .
but the us administration has said it will respect international trade obligations . could obama 's shine wear off on brown ? analysts have said brown 's speech before congress could play a key role in boosting his popularity , as it would draw attention to his political efforts to demonstrate british leadership at a time of economic uncertainty .
he is only the fifth british prime minister to ever address the us congress . brown , who is suffering from ongoing low popularity at home , is struggling to gain public support for his domestic stimulus package and huge bank bailouts .
his governing labour party is trailing behind the opposition conservatives , with a general election coming up in 2010 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former president bush even invited blair to visit camp david in addition , the visit could help win back labour voters who turned their back on the party under brown 's predecessor tony blair . blair maintained close ties to former us president george w. bush - winning him the nickname " bush 's poodle . "
blair backed bush 's decision to invade iraq in 2003 and sent troops to join us forces in iraq and afghanistan . in an article for the british newspaper the sunday times , brown said there was " no international partnership in recent history that has served the world better than the special relationship between britain and the united states . "
he said he was keen to strengthen it further . us officials said the longtime friendship with britain was as important as ever to washington . sac / sms / nda / afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

20 and one month ahead of a group of 20 summit of the world 's leading economies takes place in london . " what we 're talking about today is how , by us taking action , britain and america , we can help other countries join us in making for a more stable and effective financial system , " brown said . the turmoil in the financial markets is viewed as the biggest culprit in the economic downturn that has left both countries mired in a recession . both leaders have endorsed measures that better supervise the finance industry to prevent the high-risk lending that produced record mortgage defaults in the united states and the subsequent credit freeze .
playing on former president franklin delano roosevelt 's economic program during the great depression of the 1930s , brown has advocated a " global new deal . " global new deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a larger meeting of world leaders in april could bring about major changes to the banking system " there is the possibility in the next few months of a global new deal that will involve all the countries of the world in sorting out and cleaning up the banking system , " brown said . obama agreed with brown that more needs to be done to regulate international markets .

however , the karlsruhe judges said the 2005 vote was still valid as there was no evidence of errors . september 's upcoming elections looks set to see a return to the more traditional pencil and paper countrywide .
constitutional judge andreas vosskuhle said that the judgment did not rule out digital voting for once and for all , but added that the equipment used four years ago did have shortcomings .
nevertheless , vosskuhle said there was no indication that there had been any errors .
some two million voters in five different german states submitted their ballots electronically in 2005 .
father and son opposed the technology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes the old solutions are the best the use of electronic voting was challenged by a father-and-son team .
political scientist joachim wiesner and son , physicist ulrich wiesner complained that push button voting was not transparent because the voter could not see what actually happened to his vote inside the computer and was required to place " blind faith " in the technology .
in addition , the two plaintiffs argued that the results were open to manipulation . germany first introduced electronic voting in european elections in 1999 and first used it in parliamentary ballots in 2002 , but 2005 saw the first large-scale deployment of the technology .
german hacker-cum-data-protection group chaos computer club has been spearheading a campaign with the dutch foundation wij vertrouwen stemcomputers niet -lrb- we do n't trust voting computers -rrb- to stop the further spread of electronic voting because of fears about the risk of electronic errors and the potential for abuse .

however , the karlsruhe judges said the 2005 vote was still valid as there was no evidence of errors . september 's upcoming elections looks set to see a return to the more traditional pencil and paper countrywide .
constitutional judge andreas vosskuhle said that the judgment did not rule out digital voting for once and for all , but added that the equipment used four years ago did have shortcomings .
nevertheless , vosskuhle said there was no indication that there had been any errors .
some two million voters in five different german states submitted their ballots electronically in 2005 .
father and son opposed the technology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes the old solutions are the best the use of electronic voting was challenged by a father-and-son team .
political scientist joachim wiesner and son , physicist ulrich wiesner complained that push button voting was not transparent because the voter could not see what actually happened to his vote inside the computer and was required to place " blind faith " in the technology .
in addition , the two plaintiffs argued that the results were open to manipulation . germany first introduced electronic voting in european elections in 1999 and first used it in parliamentary ballots in 2002 , but 2005 saw the first large-scale deployment of the technology .
german hacker-cum-data-protection group chaos computer club has been spearheading a campaign with the dutch foundation wij vertrouwen stemcomputers niet -lrb- we do n't trust voting computers -rrb- to stop the further spread of electronic voting because of fears about the risk of electronic errors and the potential for abuse .
in 2008 , the dutch government decertified the use of existing paperless systems and rejected a proposal to develop a new generation of voting computers . jg / nda / dpa / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 03.03.2009 obama , brown stress need for global unity in fighting economic crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama and brown both said more needs to be done to regulate financial markets britain 's prime minister gordon brown and us president barack obama on tuesday , march 3 , discussed a " global new deal " to rebuild the world economy and urged nations to cooperate in regulating financial markets . the two leaders met for the first time since obama took office on jan .
20 and one month ahead of a group of 20 summit of the world 's leading economies takes place in london . " what we 're talking about today is how , by us taking action , britain and america , we can help other countries join us in making for a more stable and effective financial system , " brown said . the turmoil in the financial markets is viewed as the biggest culprit in the economic downturn that has left both countries mired in a recession . both leaders have endorsed measures that better supervise the finance industry to prevent the high-risk lending that produced record mortgage defaults in the united states and the subsequent credit freeze .
playing on former president franklin delano roosevelt 's economic program during the great depression of the 1930s , brown has advocated a " global new deal . " global new deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a larger meeting of world leaders in april could bring about major changes to the banking system " there is the possibility in the next few months of a global new deal that will involve all the countries of the world in sorting out and cleaning up the banking system , " brown said . obama agreed with brown that more needs to be done to regulate international markets . " we believe in the free market , we believe in a government that is not overbearing and allows entrepreneurs and businesses to thrive , " obama said .
" but we also share a common belief that there have to be sufficient regulatory structures in place so that the market does n't spin out of control . " the talks in washington were being seen as preparation for the london g20 summit on april 2 , when leaders of the world 's major economies and global economic financial institutions will be gathering in the british capital to address the worldwide financial crisis . " now is the time for leaders of every country in the world to work together to agree the action that will see us through the current crisis and ensure we come out stronger , " brown said before meeting obama . more international support in afghanistan the trip to washington followed sunday 's informal eu council in brussels on the economic crisis .
following the meeting , brown said he would take a " clear message " from eu leaders to obama that agreeing a deal on the world economy was " vitally urgent . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama visited us troops in afghanistan during his campaign in addition to the economic crisis , the deteriorating security situation in afghanistan was another central topic to the talks . brown and obama agreed that the war in afghanistan is not winnable as long as taliban militants and al qaeda continue to find refuge in pakistan .
the conflict is at the top of obama 's foreign agenda , and he is expected to ask europe for more help . britain already has more than 8,000 soldiers in afghanistan , and the two leaders have sought greater contributions from other nato partners , an issue that will likely arise at the alliance 's summit next month . " both great britain and the united states share a deep interest in ensuring that neither afghanistan nor pakistan are safe havens for terrorist activity , " obama said , who has pledged to send 17,000 more us soldiers to afghanistan this year to join the 38,000 already there . global warming , iran 's suspect nuclear program and the middle east are also on the agenda in washington during brown 's visit . brown to warn of protectionism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european nations fear they could lose significant business through the " buy american " clause brown , in a speech before the us congress , will also call on countries to avoid trade protectionism , warning us lawmakers that retreating to protectionist economic policies could exacerbate the economic downturn even further . the eu has repeatedly criticized the " buy american " clause in the $ 787 billion us stimulus package , though it has been watered down .
it stipulated that only us iron , steel and manufactured goods could be used in construction work funded by the bill .
but the us administration has said it will respect international trade obligations . could obama 's shine wear off on brown ? analysts have said brown 's speech before congress could play a key role in boosting his popularity , as it would draw attention to his political efforts to demonstrate british leadership at a time of economic uncertainty .
he is only the fifth british prime minister to ever address the us congress . brown , who is suffering from ongoing low popularity at home , is struggling to gain public support for his domestic stimulus package and huge bank bailouts .
his governing labour party is trailing behind the opposition conservatives , with a general election coming up in 2010 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former president bush even invited blair to visit camp david in addition , the visit could help win back labour voters who turned their back on the party under brown 's predecessor tony blair . blair maintained close ties to former us president george w. bush - winning him the nickname " bush 's poodle . "
blair backed bush 's decision to invade iraq in 2003 and sent troops to join us forces in iraq and afghanistan . in an article for the british newspaper the sunday times , brown said there was " no international partnership in recent history that has served the world better than the special relationship between britain and the united states .

the case , which opens a year and a day after president dimitry medvedev was elected , is being seen by some as a test of his commitment to reform . khodorkovsky faces fresh charges of embezzlement and money laundering that would leave him facing another long jail sentence , if he is found guilty .
" this case of immense importance because of what it will say to all of us about where russia is going , " robert amsterdam , a defence lawyer for khodorkovsky , told reuters news agency before the hearing .
khodorkovsky 's supporters have long alleged that he was arrested at the behest of the then president vladimir putin and his backers .
the oil tycoon had openly funded opposition parties such as the liberal yabloko faction in the run-up to 2003 parliamentary elections to the kremlin 's displeasure . the former yukos boss , who is currently serving an eight-year sentence , has said that corrupt officials also wanted to carve up his business empire , which produced more oil than opec member qatar .
expectations lowered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two heads are better than one ?
medvedev , a former lawyer who was sworn in as president last may , has demanded a clean-up of the russian court system since khodorkovsky 's sentence and criticised high-level corruption .
but there have been few signs of any substantive change .

they have now passed the buck on to their finance counterparts . the european union is unable to set an exact figure on the aid it is willing to give developing nations in exchange for support of a global climate change pact , said czech environment minister martin bursik . it was " too early " for the 27-nation bloc " to put money on the table , " said bursik , whose country currently holds the eu presidency . " we were not quite able to reach consensus on the financing mechanism , " eu environment commissioner stavros dimas told reporters . the eu environment ministers met in brussels on monday , march 2 , to discuss the bloc 's negotiating position at talks for the un-sponsored climate change talks in copenhagen in december . " it makes no sense to say now how much the eu is willing to transfer , " germany 's environment minister sigmar gabriel said .
" we will negotiate that in copenhagen .
we are creeping towards a number . " usa plays a key role bursik said the eu still wanted to find out the united states ' mid-term targets , how much money the us would spend and whether washington would adopt a cap-and-trade system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time is running out to thwart global warming , experts say he said the eu presidency was confident that us president barack obama " will follow the leadership of the european union " by setting ambitious mid-term goals for cutting greenhouse gases . " we know that the us wants to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent by 2050 , -lrb- but -rrb- we do n't know what their mid-term target is , " bursik said . the eu and the us are considered the major donors that could get lesser developed nations involved in a new global drive to cut carbon dioxide emissions .
the eu has committed to reducing emissions by 30 percent of 1990 levels by 2020 if other developed countries commit to comparable cuts .
it has already put in place the measures to cut its own emissions by 20 percent . european environment ministers said they see obama as a great boost for finding a successor to the kyoto protocol in copenhagen .
his predecessor george w. bush refused to ratify the treaty . bursik and dimas said they would visit washington on march 14-15 to find out more about the intentions of the us administration .
according to bursik climate change would be one of the first things european union leaders discuss with obama when he visits prague for an eu-us summit in early april . passing on the " hot potato " joris den blanken , the eu climate and energy policy director for environmental group greenpeace , criticized that the issue has now been put on the agenda at the eu finance ministers meeting on march 10 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : efficient , clean sources of energy are required around the globe " environment ministers have ducked and passed the climate funding hot potato to finance ministers , " blanken said in a statement .
" while billions of taxpayers ' money is being used to prop up failed banks and carmakers , not one eurocent is being pledged to help the developing world tackle a problem that europeans helped create . " according to greenpeace , eu leaders should support a market-linked scheme where countries are asked to pay for part of their emissions . " the eu must contribute its fair share to poorer countries , " blanken said .
" the clock is ticking , global climate talks in copenhagen are less than 300 days away , and we still have little more than words on the table . " an eu report states that global investment to fight climate change will need to rise to some 175 billion euros -lrb- $ 220 billion -rrb- per year by 2020 .
over 90 billion euros of that sum must be spent in developing countries , the report said . greenpeace and other ngos have said the european union should be contributing around 35 billion euros by 2020 to overall assistance by industrialized countries to help developing nations deal with the effects of climate change . the issue is also on the agenda when the eu 's 27 heads of state and government come together for their next summit on march 19-20 . sac / sms / afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they have now passed the buck on to their finance counterparts . the european union is unable to set an exact figure on the aid it is willing to give developing nations in exchange for support of a global climate change pact , said czech environment minister martin bursik . it was " too early " for the 27-nation bloc " to put money on the table , " said bursik , whose country currently holds the eu presidency . " we were not quite able to reach consensus on the financing mechanism , " eu environment commissioner stavros dimas told reporters . the eu environment ministers met in brussels on monday , march 2 , to discuss the bloc 's negotiating position at talks for the un-sponsored climate change talks in copenhagen in december . " it makes no sense to say now how much the eu is willing to transfer , " germany 's environment minister sigmar gabriel said .
" we will negotiate that in copenhagen .

the eu has committed to reducing emissions by 30 percent of 1990 levels by 2020 if other developed countries commit to comparable cuts .
it has already put in place the measures to cut its own emissions by 20 percent . european environment ministers said they see obama as a great boost for finding a successor to the kyoto protocol in copenhagen .
his predecessor george w. bush refused to ratify the treaty . bursik and dimas said they would visit washington on march 14-15 to find out more about the intentions of the us administration .
according to bursik climate change would be one of the first things european union leaders discuss with obama when he visits prague for an eu-us summit in early april . passing on the " hot potato " joris den blanken , the eu climate and energy policy director for environmental group greenpeace , criticized that the issue has now been put on the agenda at the eu finance ministers meeting on march 10 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : efficient , clean sources of energy are required around the globe " environment ministers have ducked and passed the climate funding hot potato to finance ministers , " blanken said in a statement .

" we know that the us wants to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent by 2050 , -lrb- but -rrb- we do n't know what their mid-term target is , " bursik said . the eu and the us are considered the major donors that could get lesser developed nations involved in a new global drive to cut carbon dioxide emissions .
the eu has committed to reducing emissions by 30 percent of 1990 levels by 2020 if other developed countries commit to comparable cuts .
it has already put in place the measures to cut its own emissions by 20 percent . european environment ministers said they see obama as a great boost for finding a successor to the kyoto protocol in copenhagen .
his predecessor george w. bush refused to ratify the treaty . bursik and dimas said they would visit washington on march 14-15 to find out more about the intentions of the us administration .
according to bursik climate change would be one of the first things european union leaders discuss with obama when he visits prague for an eu-us summit in early april . passing on the " hot potato " joris den blanken , the eu climate and energy policy director for environmental group greenpeace , criticized that the issue has now been put on the agenda at the eu finance ministers meeting on march 10 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : efficient , clean sources of energy are required around the globe " environment ministers have ducked and passed the climate funding hot potato to finance ministers , " blanken said in a statement .
" while billions of taxpayers ' money is being used to prop up failed banks and carmakers , not one eurocent is being pledged to help the developing world tackle a problem that europeans helped create . " according to greenpeace , eu leaders should support a market-linked scheme where countries are asked to pay for part of their emissions . " the eu must contribute its fair share to poorer countries , " blanken said .
" the clock is ticking , global climate talks in copenhagen are less than 300 days away , and we still have little more than words on the table . " an eu report states that global investment to fight climate change will need to rise to some 175 billion euros -lrb- $ 220 billion -rrb- per year by 2020 .
over 90 billion euros of that sum must be spent in developing countries , the report said . greenpeace and other ngos have said the european union should be contributing around 35 billion euros by 2020 to overall assistance by industrialized countries to help developing nations deal with the effects of climate change . the issue is also on the agenda when the eu 's 27 heads of state and government come together for their next summit on march 19-20 . sac / sms / afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 03.03.2009 car sales in germany rise in february , but future still cloudy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw is one of the brands that have profitted from consumer incentives government bonuses for people to scrap old cars and buy new ones led to a 21.5 percent boost compared to the previous year .
but this bright figure ca n't conceal that the general outlook for the industry is gloomy . the german association of the automotive industry , or vda , announced on tuesday , march 3 , that a total of 277,800 vehicles had been sold in february . " these are the highest february sales for 10 years , " vda president matthias wissmann said at a press conference on the margins of the international motor show in geneva , switzerland . " new car registrations are back in positive territory for the first time in six months , " wissmann added .
" we expect a rise in new car sales compared with last year over the entire first quarter . " the good numbers have come after the german government offered consumers a bonus of 2,500 euros -lrb- $ 3,150 -rrb- to scrap older vehicles and buy new , more energy-efficient ones . figures have been strongest in the compact-car sector , not a traditional strength of german manufacturers , but wissmann said domestic production was also benefitting . " an initial analysis shows that one in two consumers who scrap their old cars chooses a model made by a german company , " wissmann said , adding that the industry was hoping to break the 3 million mark for new car registrations in 2009 . still , overall , german carmakers ' - in particular mercedes and bmw 's - share of their own domestic market declined .
fears abound that true recovery for the industry is still a long way off . sales abroad plummet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more cars at the scrapyards mean - temporarily at least - more new-car buyers as good as the domestic numbers were , figures for german car exports were down dramatically , falling by more than 50 percent in february to just over 200,000 vehicles .
production was also cut back by 47 percent . " despite the positive domestic numbers for february , we 're far from a sustained recovery on the world-wide markets , " wissmann said . in france , new car registrations were down by over 13 percent , despite similar governmental consumer incentives .
drops in spain and japan were 48.8 and 32.4 percent respectively . german carmakers hope their export figures will improve as economic stimulus measures taken by foreign countries begin to kick in .
the industry also pointed out that , while sales abroad are down drastically , german-made cars have made slight gains in market share in countries from china to the united states . " it shows the strength of german brands that they could increase their share of strategically important markets under the most difficult of conditions , " wissmann said . so for german carmakers , the proverbial glass is both half-full and half-empty .
if stimulus packages worldwide begin to work , the german automotive industry could start to rebound as early as the end of 2009 . but if foreign markets stay sluggish , then the premium for scrapping old cars wo n't be bridge between recession and recovers , but rather a one-off boost with few long-term effects . jc / sms / afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

european parliamentarians have voted to outlaw these goods , with the exception of traditional inuit hunting .
opponents say the ban may break international trade rules . the european parliament 's internal market committee has voted to strictly ban trading throughout the eu in products derived from seals .
a report approved by the committee on tuesday , march 3 , said the ban would cover seal products , as well as meat , oil , blubber , organs and fur skins . the parliament said in a statement that it had reacted to concerns by non-governmental organizations and public opinion in most member states about seal killings . " a clear majority of citizens across the european union are horrified by the cruel clubbing to death of thousands of seals every year , " said arlene mccarthy , the committee 's chair .
" they do not want these products on sale in the eu and today , the internal market committee has backed citizens ' demands for a ban . " inuit hunting only exception the european commission had proposed several exceptions to the ban , for example when the seals are killed " without causing avoidable pain , distress and any other form of suffering . "
but the committee 's meps chose to limit these by a 27-7 vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inuits will be able to continue their traditions in addition , they ignored the view of the committee 's rapporteur diana wallis , who had proposed a labeling system rather than an outright ban .
she said she believed it would be more effective in assuring the customer that animal welfare norms had been obeyed .
wallis said she doubted whether the ban , based on eu internal market rules , would be compatible with international trade rules . but danish mep christel schaldemose said legal opinions were not central in this case . " in this debate we are not dealing with a legal dilemma but a political one , to which parliament must give a political response , " schaldemose said . in practice , seal products such as bags , hats , boots and gloves used by motorcyclists , skiers and boxers would be outlawed , as would parapharmaceutical products sold as omega 3 fatty acid supplements . however , the committee did vote in favor of a proposed exception for inuit and other aboriginal communities living in greenland , canada , russia and the united states .
this would apply to products derived from traditional subsistence hunting that could be traded for cultural , educational , or ceremonial purposes , the committee said . harmonizing trade rules in the eu the new regulation would lay down common corresponding rules that are directly applicable throughout the eu .
at present , national laws vary , with some countries such as belgium and the netherlands having already banned trade in seal products and others expecting to do so . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seals are often shot or clubbed to death yet nordic eu countries such as denmark , sweden and finland have opposed such a ban .
canada and greenland have warned the eu that they could challenge such a ban before the world trade organization . canadian minister of fisheries and oceans gail shea said her government was " disappointed " by the vote , which would severely impact a major canadian export . " canada has made numerous attempts to set the facts straight about the canadian seal hunt and we have provided ample evidence of the humaneness and sustainability of the hunt , " shea said .
" unfortunately , this evidence is not yet understood in europe . " to become law , the ban still needs the approval of the entire eu assembly and eu governments .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de regulation -pipe- 03.03.2009 eu parliamentary committee votes to ban seal products großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seals are mainly hunted for their pelts , but also for meat and fat used in beauty products the eu could soon be off limits for seal products .
european parliamentarians have voted to outlaw these goods , with the exception of traditional inuit hunting .
opponents say the ban may break international trade rules . the european parliament 's internal market committee has voted to strictly ban trading throughout the eu in products derived from seals .
a report approved by the committee on tuesday , march 3 , said the ban would cover seal products , as well as meat , oil , blubber , organs and fur skins . the parliament said in a statement that it had reacted to concerns by non-governmental organizations and public opinion in most member states about seal killings . " a clear majority of citizens across the european union are horrified by the cruel clubbing to death of thousands of seals every year , " said arlene mccarthy , the committee 's chair .
" they do not want these products on sale in the eu and today , the internal market committee has backed citizens ' demands for a ban . " inuit hunting only exception the european commission had proposed several exceptions to the ban , for example when the seals are killed " without causing avoidable pain , distress and any other form of suffering . "
but the committee 's meps chose to limit these by a 27-7 vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inuits will be able to continue their traditions in addition , they ignored the view of the committee 's rapporteur diana wallis , who had proposed a labeling system rather than an outright ban .
she said she believed it would be more effective in assuring the customer that animal welfare norms had been obeyed .
wallis said she doubted whether the ban , based on eu internal market rules , would be compatible with international trade rules . but danish mep christel schaldemose said legal opinions were not central in this case . " in this debate we are not dealing with a legal dilemma but a political one , to which parliament must give a political response , " schaldemose said . in practice , seal products such as bags , hats , boots and gloves used by motorcyclists , skiers and boxers would be outlawed , as would parapharmaceutical products sold as omega 3 fatty acid supplements . however , the committee did vote in favor of a proposed exception for inuit and other aboriginal communities living in greenland , canada , russia and the united states .

wagner , 54 , has repeatedly provoked controversy in recent years .
he described the harry potter novels as " satanism " and implied that natural disasters such as hurricane katrina in 2005 and the 2004 boxing day tsunami in southeast asia were divine punishment for " spiritual pollution . "
following his appointment at the end of january austrian bishops accused the pope of ignoring established procedures for the selection and examination of candidates for preferment .
all but four of 35 deans present at a meeting of the linz diocese , in northern austria , refused to accept the nomination .
wagner eventually announced that he wanted to withdraw because of the " hefty criticism , " a move welcomed by many church leaders .
the storm came as the vatican was already under fire for lifting the excommunication of richard williamson , one of four bishops in a conservative breakaway faction of the catholic church , who denied that six million jews were gassed by the nazis during world war ii . nda / afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they have now passed the buck on to their finance counterparts . the european union is unable to set an exact figure on the aid it is willing to give developing nations in exchange for support of a global climate change pact , said czech environment minister martin bursik . it was " too early " for the 27-nation bloc " to put money on the table , " said bursik , whose country currently holds the eu presidency . " we were not quite able to reach consensus on the financing mechanism , " eu environment commissioner stavros dimas told reporters . the eu environment ministers met in brussels on monday , march 2 , to discuss the bloc 's negotiating position at talks for the un-sponsored climate change talks in copenhagen in december . " it makes no sense to say now how much the eu is willing to transfer , " germany 's environment minister sigmar gabriel said .
" we will negotiate that in copenhagen .
we are creeping towards a number .

" we know that the us wants to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent by 2050 , -lrb- but -rrb- we do n't know what their mid-term target is , " bursik said . the eu and the us are considered the major donors that could get lesser developed nations involved in a new global drive to cut carbon dioxide emissions .
the eu has committed to reducing emissions by 30 percent of 1990 levels by 2020 if other developed countries commit to comparable cuts .
it has already put in place the measures to cut its own emissions by 20 percent . european environment ministers said they see obama as a great boost for finding a successor to the kyoto protocol in copenhagen .
his predecessor george w. bush refused to ratify the treaty . bursik and dimas said they would visit washington on march 14-15 to find out more about the intentions of the us administration .
according to bursik climate change would be one of the first things european union leaders discuss with obama when he visits prague for an eu-us summit in early april . passing on the " hot potato " joris den blanken , the eu climate and energy policy director for environmental group greenpeace , criticized that the issue has now been put on the agenda at the eu finance ministers meeting on march 10 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : efficient , clean sources of energy are required around the globe " environment ministers have ducked and passed the climate funding hot potato to finance ministers , " blanken said in a statement .
" while billions of taxpayers ' money is being used to prop up failed banks and carmakers , not one eurocent is being pledged to help the developing world tackle a problem that europeans helped create . " according to greenpeace , eu leaders should support a market-linked scheme where countries are asked to pay for part of their emissions . " the eu must contribute its fair share to poorer countries , " blanken said .
" the clock is ticking , global climate talks in copenhagen are less than 300 days away , and we still have little more than words on the table . " an eu report states that global investment to fight climate change will need to rise to some 175 billion euros -lrb- $ 220 billion -rrb- per year by 2020 .
over 90 billion euros of that sum must be spent in developing countries , the report said . greenpeace and other ngos have said the european union should be contributing around 35 billion euros by 2020 to overall assistance by industrialized countries to help developing nations deal with the effects of climate change . the issue is also on the agenda when the eu 's 27 heads of state and government come together for their next summit on march 19-20 . sac / sms / afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but he added that any deal linking those talks with negotiations regarding iran would not be productive . russian president dimitry medvedev 's comments came in response to a new york times report that us president barack obama had written a secret letter to his russian counterpart offering to halt the planned missile shield , which would be located mainly in poland and the czech republic , in return for moscow 's help in stopping iran from developing long-range nuclear weapons . the russian president welcomed the " positive signals " coming from the obama administration with which he said he hoped to reach " agreements . "
" haggling , " however , was " not productive , " added medvedev on tuesday , march 3 . the russian president also said obama 's letter had not presented the issue in such a way . obama on tuesday said the times report did not " accurately characterize the letter " he sent medvedev . " what i said in the letter was that , obviously , to the extent that we are lessening iran 's commitment to nuclear weapons , then that reduces the pressure for - or the need for a missile-defense system , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exact wording of obama 's letter to medvedev is unclear earlier , medvedev 's spokeswoman natalya timakova confirmed the receipt of a letter , but added that " there were no concrete proposals about any mutually binding decisions . " on sunday , the russia president was quoted as saying that moscow was waiting for new us proposals to resolve the missile dispute . the times ' sources said while the letter did not offer a direct quid pro quo deal , it was intended to give moscow an incentive to join the united states in a common front against iran . " it 's almost saying to them , put up or shut up , " an unnamed senior official told the newspaper .
" it 's not that the russians get to say , ' we 'll try and therefore you have to suspend . '
it says the threat has to go away . " too close to home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bush administration said the facilities were intended to stop iranian missiles russia has been bitterly opposed to the deployment of a us missile system in poland and the czech republic ever since it was proposed by the former us president george w. bush 's administration .
moscow believes the interceptor system is aimed at russia .
bush officials have said it was meant to counter missile threats from states such as iran . medvedev had warned last year that moscow would deploy nuclear-capable iskander missiles to kaliningrad , a russian exclave bordered by lithuania and poland , in response to the plans . there are indications that the missile defense shield will be on the agenda between foreign minister sergey lavrov and us secretary of state hillary clinton when they meet on friday . iranian nuclear program continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is in charge of construction at the bushehr site iran has repeatedly rejected calls by the un security council - of which russia and the united states are permanent members - to halt uranium enrichment , despite the imposition of three sets of sanctions .
the united states and its european allies believe that iran is seeking to develop nuclear weapons , a charge that tehran denies , saying that the program is purely civilian . iran recently began testing its bushehr nuclear plant , a construction project run by russia .
last week , tehran said its first nuclear power station could go on line within months . on monday , clinton reiterated washington 's willingness to engage with iran if it " unclenches its fist . "
this represents a clear switch in policy from the previous us administration , which made talks dependent upon iran halting the enrichment process . russian news agencies cited lavrov as saying that us talks with iran could help to end the international standoff over its nuclear program and boost regional security . jg / sms / nda / afp / dpa / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , the karlsruhe judges said the 2005 vote was still valid as there was no evidence of errors . september 's upcoming elections looks set to see a return to the more traditional pencil and paper countrywide .
constitutional judge andreas vosskuhle said that the judgment did not rule out digital voting for once and for all , but added that the equipment used four years ago did have shortcomings .
nevertheless , vosskuhle said there was no indication that there had been any errors .
some two million voters in five different german states submitted their ballots electronically in 2005 .
father and son opposed the technology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes the old solutions are the best the use of electronic voting was challenged by a father-and-son team .
political scientist joachim wiesner and son , physicist ulrich wiesner complained that push button voting was not transparent because the voter could not see what actually happened to his vote inside the computer and was required to place " blind faith " in the technology .
in addition , the two plaintiffs argued that the results were open to manipulation . germany first introduced electronic voting in european elections in 1999 and first used it in parliamentary ballots in 2002 , but 2005 saw the first large-scale deployment of the technology .
german hacker-cum-data-protection group chaos computer club has been spearheading a campaign with the dutch foundation wij vertrouwen stemcomputers niet -lrb- we do n't trust voting computers -rrb- to stop the further spread of electronic voting because of fears about the risk of electronic errors and the potential for abuse .

however , the karlsruhe judges said the 2005 vote was still valid as there was no evidence of errors . september 's upcoming elections looks set to see a return to the more traditional pencil and paper countrywide .
constitutional judge andreas vosskuhle said that the judgment did not rule out digital voting for once and for all , but added that the equipment used four years ago did have shortcomings .

political scientist joachim wiesner and son , physicist ulrich wiesner complained that push button voting was not transparent because the voter could not see what actually happened to his vote inside the computer and was required to place " blind faith " in the technology .
in addition , the two plaintiffs argued that the results were open to manipulation . germany first introduced electronic voting in european elections in 1999 and first used it in parliamentary ballots in 2002 , but 2005 saw the first large-scale deployment of the technology .
german hacker-cum-data-protection group chaos computer club has been spearheading a campaign with the dutch foundation wij vertrouwen stemcomputers niet -lrb- we do n't trust voting computers -rrb- to stop the further spread of electronic voting because of fears about the risk of electronic errors and the potential for abuse .

the case , which opens a year and a day after president dimitry medvedev was elected , is being seen by some as a test of his commitment to reform . khodorkovsky faces fresh charges of embezzlement and money laundering that would leave him facing another long jail sentence , if he is found guilty .
" this case of immense importance because of what it will say to all of us about where russia is going , " robert amsterdam , a defence lawyer for khodorkovsky , told reuters news agency before the hearing .
khodorkovsky 's supporters have long alleged that he was arrested at the behest of the then president vladimir putin and his backers .
the oil tycoon had openly funded opposition parties such as the liberal yabloko faction in the run-up to 2003 parliamentary elections to the kremlin 's displeasure . the former yukos boss , who is currently serving an eight-year sentence , has said that corrupt officials also wanted to carve up his business empire , which produced more oil than opec member qatar .
expectations lowered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two heads are better than one ?
medvedev , a former lawyer who was sworn in as president last may , has demanded a clean-up of the russian court system since khodorkovsky 's sentence and criticised high-level corruption .
but there have been few signs of any substantive change .
" the expectations were modest .
it 's not fair to say that he 's disappointed them , but these expectations have become even more modest , " said andrei ryabov from the carnegie centre in moscow .
at an event to mark the first anniversary of his presidential election victory on monday , march 2 , medvedev expressed what seemed to be a commitment to the line of his predecessor , whom he appointed to the post of prime minister shortly after taking power .
on stage with vladimir putin , medvedev shouted " together we can continue the course set by president putin .
together we 'll win .

but this bright figure ca n't conceal that the general outlook for the industry is gloomy . the german association of the automotive industry , or vda , announced on tuesday , march 3 , that a total of 277,800 vehicles had been sold in february . " these are the highest february sales for 10 years , " vda president matthias wissmann said at a press conference on the margins of the international motor show in geneva , switzerland . " new car registrations are back in positive territory for the first time in six months , " wissmann added .
" we expect a rise in new car sales compared with last year over the entire first quarter . " the good numbers have come after the german government offered consumers a bonus of 2,500 euros -lrb- $ 3,150 -rrb- to scrap older vehicles and buy new , more energy-efficient ones . figures have been strongest in the compact-car sector , not a traditional strength of german manufacturers , but wissmann said domestic production was also benefitting .

production was also cut back by 47 percent . " despite the positive domestic numbers for february , we 're far from a sustained recovery on the world-wide markets , " wissmann said . in france , new car registrations were down by over 13 percent , despite similar governmental consumer incentives .
drops in spain and japan were 48.8 and 32.4 percent respectively . german carmakers hope their export figures will improve as economic stimulus measures taken by foreign countries begin to kick in .
the industry also pointed out that , while sales abroad are down drastically , german-made cars have made slight gains in market share in countries from china to the united states . " it shows the strength of german brands that they could increase their share of strategically important markets under the most difficult of conditions , " wissmann said . so for german carmakers , the proverbial glass is both half-full and half-empty .
if stimulus packages worldwide begin to work , the german automotive industry could start to rebound as early as the end of 2009 . but if foreign markets stay sluggish , then the premium for scrapping old cars wo n't be bridge between recession and recovers , but rather a one-off boost with few long-term effects . jc / sms / afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 03.03.2009 car sales in germany rise in february , but future still cloudy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw is one of the brands that have profitted from consumer incentives government bonuses for people to scrap old cars and buy new ones led to a 21.5 percent boost compared to the previous year .
but this bright figure ca n't conceal that the general outlook for the industry is gloomy . the german association of the automotive industry , or vda , announced on tuesday , march 3 , that a total of 277,800 vehicles had been sold in february . " these are the highest february sales for 10 years , " vda president matthias wissmann said at a press conference on the margins of the international motor show in geneva , switzerland . " new car registrations are back in positive territory for the first time in six months , " wissmann added .
" we expect a rise in new car sales compared with last year over the entire first quarter . " the good numbers have come after the german government offered consumers a bonus of 2,500 euros -lrb- $ 3,150 -rrb- to scrap older vehicles and buy new , more energy-efficient ones . figures have been strongest in the compact-car sector , not a traditional strength of german manufacturers , but wissmann said domestic production was also benefitting . " an initial analysis shows that one in two consumers who scrap their old cars chooses a model made by a german company , " wissmann said , adding that the industry was hoping to break the 3 million mark for new car registrations in 2009 . still , overall , german carmakers ' - in particular mercedes and bmw 's - share of their own domestic market declined .
fears abound that true recovery for the industry is still a long way off . sales abroad plummet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more cars at the scrapyards mean - temporarily at least - more new-car buyers as good as the domestic numbers were , figures for german car exports were down dramatically , falling by more than 50 percent in february to just over 200,000 vehicles .
production was also cut back by 47 percent . " despite the positive domestic numbers for february , we 're far from a sustained recovery on the world-wide markets , " wissmann said . in france , new car registrations were down by over 13 percent , despite similar governmental consumer incentives .
drops in spain and japan were 48.8 and 32.4 percent respectively . german carmakers hope their export figures will improve as economic stimulus measures taken by foreign countries begin to kick in .
the industry also pointed out that , while sales abroad are down drastically , german-made cars have made slight gains in market share in countries from china to the united states . " it shows the strength of german brands that they could increase their share of strategically important markets under the most difficult of conditions , " wissmann said . so for german carmakers , the proverbial glass is both half-full and half-empty .
if stimulus packages worldwide begin to work , the german automotive industry could start to rebound as early as the end of 2009 . but if foreign markets stay sluggish , then the premium for scrapping old cars wo n't be bridge between recession and recovers , but rather a one-off boost with few long-term effects . jc / sms / afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

european parliamentarians have voted to outlaw these goods , with the exception of traditional inuit hunting .
opponents say the ban may break international trade rules . the european parliament 's internal market committee has voted to strictly ban trading throughout the eu in products derived from seals .
a report approved by the committee on tuesday , march 3 , said the ban would cover seal products , as well as meat , oil , blubber , organs and fur skins . the parliament said in a statement that it had reacted to concerns by non-governmental organizations and public opinion in most member states about seal killings . " a clear majority of citizens across the european union are horrified by the cruel clubbing to death of thousands of seals every year , " said arlene mccarthy , the committee 's chair .
" they do not want these products on sale in the eu and today , the internal market committee has backed citizens ' demands for a ban . " inuit hunting only exception the european commission had proposed several exceptions to the ban , for example when the seals are killed " without causing avoidable pain , distress and any other form of suffering . "
but the committee 's meps chose to limit these by a 27-7 vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inuits will be able to continue their traditions in addition , they ignored the view of the committee 's rapporteur diana wallis , who had proposed a labeling system rather than an outright ban .
she said she believed it would be more effective in assuring the customer that animal welfare norms had been obeyed .
wallis said she doubted whether the ban , based on eu internal market rules , would be compatible with international trade rules . but danish mep christel schaldemose said legal opinions were not central in this case . " in this debate we are not dealing with a legal dilemma but a political one , to which parliament must give a political response , " schaldemose said . in practice , seal products such as bags , hats , boots and gloves used by motorcyclists , skiers and boxers would be outlawed , as would parapharmaceutical products sold as omega 3 fatty acid supplements . however , the committee did vote in favor of a proposed exception for inuit and other aboriginal communities living in greenland , canada , russia and the united states .
this would apply to products derived from traditional subsistence hunting that could be traded for cultural , educational , or ceremonial purposes , the committee said . harmonizing trade rules in the eu the new regulation would lay down common corresponding rules that are directly applicable throughout the eu .
at present , national laws vary , with some countries such as belgium and the netherlands having already banned trade in seal products and others expecting to do so . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seals are often shot or clubbed to death yet nordic eu countries such as denmark , sweden and finland have opposed such a ban .
canada and greenland have warned the eu that they could challenge such a ban before the world trade organization . canadian minister of fisheries and oceans gail shea said her government was " disappointed " by the vote , which would severely impact a major canadian export . " canada has made numerous attempts to set the facts straight about the canadian seal hunt and we have provided ample evidence of the humaneness and sustainability of the hunt , " shea said .
" unfortunately , this evidence is not yet understood in europe . " to become law , the ban still needs the approval of the entire eu assembly and eu governments .

european parliamentarians have voted to outlaw these goods , with the exception of traditional inuit hunting .
opponents say the ban may break international trade rules . the european parliament 's internal market committee has voted to strictly ban trading throughout the eu in products derived from seals .
a report approved by the committee on tuesday , march 3 , said the ban would cover seal products , as well as meat , oil , blubber , organs and fur skins . the parliament said in a statement that it had reacted to concerns by non-governmental organizations and public opinion in most member states about seal killings . " a clear majority of citizens across the european union are horrified by the cruel clubbing to death of thousands of seals every year , " said arlene mccarthy , the committee 's chair .
" they do not want these products on sale in the eu and today , the internal market committee has backed citizens ' demands for a ban . " inuit hunting only exception the european commission had proposed several exceptions to the ban , for example when the seals are killed " without causing avoidable pain , distress and any other form of suffering . "
but the committee 's meps chose to limit these by a 27-7 vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inuits will be able to continue their traditions in addition , they ignored the view of the committee 's rapporteur diana wallis , who had proposed a labeling system rather than an outright ban .
she said she believed it would be more effective in assuring the customer that animal welfare norms had been obeyed .
wallis said she doubted whether the ban , based on eu internal market rules , would be compatible with international trade rules . but danish mep christel schaldemose said legal opinions were not central in this case . " in this debate we are not dealing with a legal dilemma but a political one , to which parliament must give a political response , " schaldemose said . in practice , seal products such as bags , hats , boots and gloves used by motorcyclists , skiers and boxers would be outlawed , as would parapharmaceutical products sold as omega 3 fatty acid supplements . however , the committee did vote in favor of a proposed exception for inuit and other aboriginal communities living in greenland , canada , russia and the united states .
this would apply to products derived from traditional subsistence hunting that could be traded for cultural , educational , or ceremonial purposes , the committee said . harmonizing trade rules in the eu the new regulation would lay down common corresponding rules that are directly applicable throughout the eu .
at present , national laws vary , with some countries such as belgium and the netherlands having already banned trade in seal products and others expecting to do so . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seals are often shot or clubbed to death yet nordic eu countries such as denmark , sweden and finland have opposed such a ban .
canada and greenland have warned the eu that they could challenge such a ban before the world trade organization . canadian minister of fisheries and oceans gail shea said her government was " disappointed " by the vote , which would severely impact a major canadian export . " canada has made numerous attempts to set the facts straight about the canadian seal hunt and we have provided ample evidence of the humaneness and sustainability of the hunt , " shea said .
" unfortunately , this evidence is not yet understood in europe . " to become law , the ban still needs the approval of the entire eu assembly and eu governments .

the case , which opens a year and a day after president dimitry medvedev was elected , is being seen by some as a test of his commitment to reform . khodorkovsky faces fresh charges of embezzlement and money laundering that would leave him facing another long jail sentence , if he is found guilty .
" this case of immense importance because of what it will say to all of us about where russia is going , " robert amsterdam , a defence lawyer for khodorkovsky , told reuters news agency before the hearing .
khodorkovsky 's supporters have long alleged that he was arrested at the behest of the then president vladimir putin and his backers .
the oil tycoon had openly funded opposition parties such as the liberal yabloko faction in the run-up to 2003 parliamentary elections to the kremlin 's displeasure . the former yukos boss , who is currently serving an eight-year sentence , has said that corrupt officials also wanted to carve up his business empire , which produced more oil than opec member qatar .
expectations lowered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two heads are better than one ?
medvedev , a former lawyer who was sworn in as president last may , has demanded a clean-up of the russian court system since khodorkovsky 's sentence and criticised high-level corruption .
but there have been few signs of any substantive change .
" the expectations were modest .
it 's not fair to say that he 's disappointed them , but these expectations have become even more modest , " said andrei ryabov from the carnegie centre in moscow .
at an event to mark the first anniversary of his presidential election victory on monday , march 2 , medvedev expressed what seemed to be a commitment to the line of his predecessor , whom he appointed to the post of prime minister shortly after taking power .
on stage with vladimir putin , medvedev shouted " together we can continue the course set by president putin .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 03.03.2009 obama , brown stress need for global unity in fighting economic crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama and brown both said more needs to be done to regulate financial markets britain 's prime minister gordon brown and us president barack obama on tuesday , march 3 , discussed a " global new deal " to rebuild the world economy and urged nations to cooperate in regulating financial markets . the two leaders met for the first time since obama took office on jan .
20 and one month ahead of a group of 20 summit of the world 's leading economies takes place in london . " what we 're talking about today is how , by us taking action , britain and america , we can help other countries join us in making for a more stable and effective financial system , " brown said . the turmoil in the financial markets is viewed as the biggest culprit in the economic downturn that has left both countries mired in a recession . both leaders have endorsed measures that better supervise the finance industry to prevent the high-risk lending that produced record mortgage defaults in the united states and the subsequent credit freeze .
playing on former president franklin delano roosevelt 's economic program during the great depression of the 1930s , brown has advocated a " global new deal . " global new deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a larger meeting of world leaders in april could bring about major changes to the banking system " there is the possibility in the next few months of a global new deal that will involve all the countries of the world in sorting out and cleaning up the banking system , " brown said . obama agreed with brown that more needs to be done to regulate international markets . " we believe in the free market , we believe in a government that is not overbearing and allows entrepreneurs and businesses to thrive , " obama said .
" but we also share a common belief that there have to be sufficient regulatory structures in place so that the market does n't spin out of control . " the talks in washington were being seen as preparation for the london g20 summit on april 2 , when leaders of the world 's major economies and global economic financial institutions will be gathering in the british capital to address the worldwide financial crisis . " now is the time for leaders of every country in the world to work together to agree the action that will see us through the current crisis and ensure we come out stronger , " brown said before meeting obama . more international support in afghanistan the trip to washington followed sunday 's informal eu council in brussels on the economic crisis .
following the meeting , brown said he would take a " clear message " from eu leaders to obama that agreeing a deal on the world economy was " vitally urgent . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama visited us troops in afghanistan during his campaign in addition to the economic crisis , the deteriorating security situation in afghanistan was another central topic to the talks . brown and obama agreed that the war in afghanistan is not winnable as long as taliban militants and al qaeda continue to find refuge in pakistan .
the conflict is at the top of obama 's foreign agenda , and he is expected to ask europe for more help . britain already has more than 8,000 soldiers in afghanistan , and the two leaders have sought greater contributions from other nato partners , an issue that will likely arise at the alliance 's summit next month . " both great britain and the united states share a deep interest in ensuring that neither afghanistan nor pakistan are safe havens for terrorist activity , " obama said , who has pledged to send 17,000 more us soldiers to afghanistan this year to join the 38,000 already there . global warming , iran 's suspect nuclear program and the middle east are also on the agenda in washington during brown 's visit . brown to warn of protectionism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european nations fear they could lose significant business through the " buy american " clause brown , in a speech before the us congress , will also call on countries to avoid trade protectionism , warning us lawmakers that retreating to protectionist economic policies could exacerbate the economic downturn even further . the eu has repeatedly criticized the " buy american " clause in the $ 787 billion us stimulus package , though it has been watered down .
it stipulated that only us iron , steel and manufactured goods could be used in construction work funded by the bill .
but the us administration has said it will respect international trade obligations . could obama 's shine wear off on brown ? analysts have said brown 's speech before congress could play a key role in boosting his popularity , as it would draw attention to his political efforts to demonstrate british leadership at a time of economic uncertainty .
he is only the fifth british prime minister to ever address the us congress . brown , who is suffering from ongoing low popularity at home , is struggling to gain public support for his domestic stimulus package and huge bank bailouts .

20 and one month ahead of a group of 20 summit of the world 's leading economies takes place in london . " what we 're talking about today is how , by us taking action , britain and america , we can help other countries join us in making for a more stable and effective financial system , " brown said . the turmoil in the financial markets is viewed as the biggest culprit in the economic downturn that has left both countries mired in a recession . both leaders have endorsed measures that better supervise the finance industry to prevent the high-risk lending that produced record mortgage defaults in the united states and the subsequent credit freeze .
playing on former president franklin delano roosevelt 's economic program during the great depression of the 1930s , brown has advocated a " global new deal . " global new deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a larger meeting of world leaders in april could bring about major changes to the banking system " there is the possibility in the next few months of a global new deal that will involve all the countries of the world in sorting out and cleaning up the banking system , " brown said . obama agreed with brown that more needs to be done to regulate international markets . " we believe in the free market , we believe in a government that is not overbearing and allows entrepreneurs and businesses to thrive , " obama said .
" but we also share a common belief that there have to be sufficient regulatory structures in place so that the market does n't spin out of control . " the talks in washington were being seen as preparation for the london g20 summit on april 2 , when leaders of the world 's major economies and global economic financial institutions will be gathering in the british capital to address the worldwide financial crisis . " now is the time for leaders of every country in the world to work together to agree the action that will see us through the current crisis and ensure we come out stronger , " brown said before meeting obama . more international support in afghanistan the trip to washington followed sunday 's informal eu council in brussels on the economic crisis .
following the meeting , brown said he would take a " clear message " from eu leaders to obama that agreeing a deal on the world economy was " vitally urgent . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama visited us troops in afghanistan during his campaign in addition to the economic crisis , the deteriorating security situation in afghanistan was another central topic to the talks . brown and obama agreed that the war in afghanistan is not winnable as long as taliban militants and al qaeda continue to find refuge in pakistan .
the conflict is at the top of obama 's foreign agenda , and he is expected to ask europe for more help . britain already has more than 8,000 soldiers in afghanistan , and the two leaders have sought greater contributions from other nato partners , an issue that will likely arise at the alliance 's summit next month . " both great britain and the united states share a deep interest in ensuring that neither afghanistan nor pakistan are safe havens for terrorist activity , " obama said , who has pledged to send 17,000 more us soldiers to afghanistan this year to join the 38,000 already there . global warming , iran 's suspect nuclear program and the middle east are also on the agenda in washington during brown 's visit . brown to warn of protectionism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european nations fear they could lose significant business through the " buy american " clause brown , in a speech before the us congress , will also call on countries to avoid trade protectionism , warning us lawmakers that retreating to protectionist economic policies could exacerbate the economic downturn even further . the eu has repeatedly criticized the " buy american " clause in the $ 787 billion us stimulus package , though it has been watered down .
it stipulated that only us iron , steel and manufactured goods could be used in construction work funded by the bill .
but the us administration has said it will respect international trade obligations . could obama 's shine wear off on brown ? analysts have said brown 's speech before congress could play a key role in boosting his popularity , as it would draw attention to his political efforts to demonstrate british leadership at a time of economic uncertainty .
he is only the fifth british prime minister to ever address the us congress . brown , who is suffering from ongoing low popularity at home , is struggling to gain public support for his domestic stimulus package and huge bank bailouts .

however , the karlsruhe judges said the 2005 vote was still valid as there was no evidence of errors . september 's upcoming elections looks set to see a return to the more traditional pencil and paper countrywide .
constitutional judge andreas vosskuhle said that the judgment did not rule out digital voting for once and for all , but added that the equipment used four years ago did have shortcomings .
nevertheless , vosskuhle said there was no indication that there had been any errors .

political scientist joachim wiesner and son , physicist ulrich wiesner complained that push button voting was not transparent because the voter could not see what actually happened to his vote inside the computer and was required to place " blind faith " in the technology .
in addition , the two plaintiffs argued that the results were open to manipulation . germany first introduced electronic voting in european elections in 1999 and first used it in parliamentary ballots in 2002 , but 2005 saw the first large-scale deployment of the technology .
german hacker-cum-data-protection group chaos computer club has been spearheading a campaign with the dutch foundation wij vertrouwen stemcomputers niet -lrb- we do n't trust voting computers -rrb- to stop the further spread of electronic voting because of fears about the risk of electronic errors and the potential for abuse .

20 and one month ahead of a group of 20 summit of the world 's leading economies takes place in london . " what we 're talking about today is how , by us taking action , britain and america , we can help other countries join us in making for a more stable and effective financial system , " brown said . the turmoil in the financial markets is viewed as the biggest culprit in the economic downturn that has left both countries mired in a recession . both leaders have endorsed measures that better supervise the finance industry to prevent the high-risk lending that produced record mortgage defaults in the united states and the subsequent credit freeze .
playing on former president franklin delano roosevelt 's economic program during the great depression of the 1930s , brown has advocated a " global new deal . " global new deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a larger meeting of world leaders in april could bring about major changes to the banking system " there is the possibility in the next few months of a global new deal that will involve all the countries of the world in sorting out and cleaning up the banking system , " brown said . obama agreed with brown that more needs to be done to regulate international markets . " we believe in the free market , we believe in a government that is not overbearing and allows entrepreneurs and businesses to thrive , " obama said .
" but we also share a common belief that there have to be sufficient regulatory structures in place so that the market does n't spin out of control . " the talks in washington were being seen as preparation for the london g20 summit on april 2 , when leaders of the world 's major economies and global economic financial institutions will be gathering in the british capital to address the worldwide financial crisis . " now is the time for leaders of every country in the world to work together to agree the action that will see us through the current crisis and ensure we come out stronger , " brown said before meeting obama . more international support in afghanistan the trip to washington followed sunday 's informal eu council in brussels on the economic crisis .
following the meeting , brown said he would take a " clear message " from eu leaders to obama that agreeing a deal on the world economy was " vitally urgent . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama visited us troops in afghanistan during his campaign in addition to the economic crisis , the deteriorating security situation in afghanistan was another central topic to the talks . brown and obama agreed that the war in afghanistan is not winnable as long as taliban militants and al qaeda continue to find refuge in pakistan .
the conflict is at the top of obama 's foreign agenda , and he is expected to ask europe for more help . britain already has more than 8,000 soldiers in afghanistan , and the two leaders have sought greater contributions from other nato partners , an issue that will likely arise at the alliance 's summit next month . " both great britain and the united states share a deep interest in ensuring that neither afghanistan nor pakistan are safe havens for terrorist activity , " obama said , who has pledged to send 17,000 more us soldiers to afghanistan this year to join the 38,000 already there . global warming , iran 's suspect nuclear program and the middle east are also on the agenda in washington during brown 's visit . brown to warn of protectionism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european nations fear they could lose significant business through the " buy american " clause brown , in a speech before the us congress , will also call on countries to avoid trade protectionism , warning us lawmakers that retreating to protectionist economic policies could exacerbate the economic downturn even further . the eu has repeatedly criticized the " buy american " clause in the $ 787 billion us stimulus package , though it has been watered down .
it stipulated that only us iron , steel and manufactured goods could be used in construction work funded by the bill .
but the us administration has said it will respect international trade obligations . could obama 's shine wear off on brown ? analysts have said brown 's speech before congress could play a key role in boosting his popularity , as it would draw attention to his political efforts to demonstrate british leadership at a time of economic uncertainty .
he is only the fifth british prime minister to ever address the us congress . brown , who is suffering from ongoing low popularity at home , is struggling to gain public support for his domestic stimulus package and huge bank bailouts .
his governing labour party is trailing behind the opposition conservatives , with a general election coming up in 2010 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former president bush even invited blair to visit camp david in addition , the visit could help win back labour voters who turned their back on the party under brown 's predecessor tony blair . blair maintained close ties to former us president george w. bush - winning him the nickname " bush 's poodle . "
blair backed bush 's decision to invade iraq in 2003 and sent troops to join us forces in iraq and afghanistan . in an article for the british newspaper the sunday times , brown said there was " no international partnership in recent history that has served the world better than the special relationship between britain and the united states . "
he said he was keen to strengthen it further . us officials said the longtime friendship with britain was as important as ever to washington . sac / sms / nda / afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but he added that any deal linking those talks with negotiations regarding iran would not be productive . russian president dimitry medvedev 's comments came in response to a new york times report that us president barack obama had written a secret letter to his russian counterpart offering to halt the planned missile shield , which would be located mainly in poland and the czech republic , in return for moscow 's help in stopping iran from developing long-range nuclear weapons . the russian president welcomed the " positive signals " coming from the obama administration with which he said he hoped to reach " agreements . "
" haggling , " however , was " not productive , " added medvedev on tuesday , march 3 . the russian president also said obama 's letter had not presented the issue in such a way . obama on tuesday said the times report did not " accurately characterize the letter " he sent medvedev .

moscow believes the interceptor system is aimed at russia .
bush officials have said it was meant to counter missile threats from states such as iran . medvedev had warned last year that moscow would deploy nuclear-capable iskander missiles to kaliningrad , a russian exclave bordered by lithuania and poland , in response to the plans . there are indications that the missile defense shield will be on the agenda between foreign minister sergey lavrov and us secretary of state hillary clinton when they meet on friday . iranian nuclear program continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is in charge of construction at the bushehr site iran has repeatedly rejected calls by the un security council - of which russia and the united states are permanent members - to halt uranium enrichment , despite the imposition of three sets of sanctions .
the united states and its european allies believe that iran is seeking to develop nuclear weapons , a charge that tehran denies , saying that the program is purely civilian . iran recently began testing its bushehr nuclear plant , a construction project run by russia .
last week , tehran said its first nuclear power station could go on line within months . on monday , clinton reiterated washington 's willingness to engage with iran if it " unclenches its fist . "
this represents a clear switch in policy from the previous us administration , which made talks dependent upon iran halting the enrichment process . russian news agencies cited lavrov as saying that us talks with iran could help to end the international standoff over its nuclear program and boost regional security . jg / sms / nda / afp / dpa / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the case , which opens a year and a day after president dimitry medvedev was elected , is being seen by some as a test of his commitment to reform . khodorkovsky faces fresh charges of embezzlement and money laundering that would leave him facing another long jail sentence , if he is found guilty .

khodorkovsky 's supporters have long alleged that he was arrested at the behest of the then president vladimir putin and his backers .
the oil tycoon had openly funded opposition parties such as the liberal yabloko faction in the run-up to 2003 parliamentary elections to the kremlin 's displeasure . the former yukos boss , who is currently serving an eight-year sentence , has said that corrupt officials also wanted to carve up his business empire , which produced more oil than opec member qatar .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 03.03.2009 obama , brown stress need for global unity in fighting economic crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama and brown both said more needs to be done to regulate financial markets britain 's prime minister gordon brown and us president barack obama on tuesday , march 3 , discussed a " global new deal " to rebuild the world economy and urged nations to cooperate in regulating financial markets . the two leaders met for the first time since obama took office on jan .
20 and one month ahead of a group of 20 summit of the world 's leading economies takes place in london . " what we 're talking about today is how , by us taking action , britain and america , we can help other countries join us in making for a more stable and effective financial system , " brown said . the turmoil in the financial markets is viewed as the biggest culprit in the economic downturn that has left both countries mired in a recession . both leaders have endorsed measures that better supervise the finance industry to prevent the high-risk lending that produced record mortgage defaults in the united states and the subsequent credit freeze .
playing on former president franklin delano roosevelt 's economic program during the great depression of the 1930s , brown has advocated a " global new deal . " global new deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a larger meeting of world leaders in april could bring about major changes to the banking system " there is the possibility in the next few months of a global new deal that will involve all the countries of the world in sorting out and cleaning up the banking system , " brown said . obama agreed with brown that more needs to be done to regulate international markets . " we believe in the free market , we believe in a government that is not overbearing and allows entrepreneurs and businesses to thrive , " obama said .
" but we also share a common belief that there have to be sufficient regulatory structures in place so that the market does n't spin out of control . " the talks in washington were being seen as preparation for the london g20 summit on april 2 , when leaders of the world 's major economies and global economic financial institutions will be gathering in the british capital to address the worldwide financial crisis . " now is the time for leaders of every country in the world to work together to agree the action that will see us through the current crisis and ensure we come out stronger , " brown said before meeting obama . more international support in afghanistan the trip to washington followed sunday 's informal eu council in brussels on the economic crisis .
following the meeting , brown said he would take a " clear message " from eu leaders to obama that agreeing a deal on the world economy was " vitally urgent . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama visited us troops in afghanistan during his campaign in addition to the economic crisis , the deteriorating security situation in afghanistan was another central topic to the talks . brown and obama agreed that the war in afghanistan is not winnable as long as taliban militants and al qaeda continue to find refuge in pakistan .
the conflict is at the top of obama 's foreign agenda , and he is expected to ask europe for more help . britain already has more than 8,000 soldiers in afghanistan , and the two leaders have sought greater contributions from other nato partners , an issue that will likely arise at the alliance 's summit next month . " both great britain and the united states share a deep interest in ensuring that neither afghanistan nor pakistan are safe havens for terrorist activity , " obama said , who has pledged to send 17,000 more us soldiers to afghanistan this year to join the 38,000 already there . global warming , iran 's suspect nuclear program and the middle east are also on the agenda in washington during brown 's visit . brown to warn of protectionism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european nations fear they could lose significant business through the " buy american " clause brown , in a speech before the us congress , will also call on countries to avoid trade protectionism , warning us lawmakers that retreating to protectionist economic policies could exacerbate the economic downturn even further . the eu has repeatedly criticized the " buy american " clause in the $ 787 billion us stimulus package , though it has been watered down .
it stipulated that only us iron , steel and manufactured goods could be used in construction work funded by the bill .
but the us administration has said it will respect international trade obligations . could obama 's shine wear off on brown ? analysts have said brown 's speech before congress could play a key role in boosting his popularity , as it would draw attention to his political efforts to demonstrate british leadership at a time of economic uncertainty .
he is only the fifth british prime minister to ever address the us congress . brown , who is suffering from ongoing low popularity at home , is struggling to gain public support for his domestic stimulus package and huge bank bailouts .
his governing labour party is trailing behind the opposition conservatives , with a general election coming up in 2010 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former president bush even invited blair to visit camp david in addition , the visit could help win back labour voters who turned their back on the party under brown 's predecessor tony blair . blair maintained close ties to former us president george w. bush - winning him the nickname " bush 's poodle . "
blair backed bush 's decision to invade iraq in 2003 and sent troops to join us forces in iraq and afghanistan . in an article for the british newspaper the sunday times , brown said there was " no international partnership in recent history that has served the world better than the special relationship between britain and the united states . "
he said he was keen to strengthen it further . us officials said the longtime friendship with britain was as important as ever to washington . sac / sms / nda / afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but he added that any deal linking those talks with negotiations regarding iran would not be productive . russian president dimitry medvedev 's comments came in response to a new york times report that us president barack obama had written a secret letter to his russian counterpart offering to halt the planned missile shield , which would be located mainly in poland and the czech republic , in return for moscow 's help in stopping iran from developing long-range nuclear weapons . the russian president welcomed the " positive signals " coming from the obama administration with which he said he hoped to reach " agreements . "
" haggling , " however , was " not productive , " added medvedev on tuesday , march 3 . the russian president also said obama 's letter had not presented the issue in such a way . obama on tuesday said the times report did not " accurately characterize the letter " he sent medvedev . " what i said in the letter was that , obviously , to the extent that we are lessening iran 's commitment to nuclear weapons , then that reduces the pressure for - or the need for a missile-defense system , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exact wording of obama 's letter to medvedev is unclear earlier , medvedev 's spokeswoman natalya timakova confirmed the receipt of a letter , but added that " there were no concrete proposals about any mutually binding decisions . " on sunday , the russia president was quoted as saying that moscow was waiting for new us proposals to resolve the missile dispute . the times ' sources said while the letter did not offer a direct quid pro quo deal , it was intended to give moscow an incentive to join the united states in a common front against iran . " it 's almost saying to them , put up or shut up , " an unnamed senior official told the newspaper .
" it 's not that the russians get to say , ' we 'll try and therefore you have to suspend . '
it says the threat has to go away . " too close to home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bush administration said the facilities were intended to stop iranian missiles russia has been bitterly opposed to the deployment of a us missile system in poland and the czech republic ever since it was proposed by the former us president george w. bush 's administration .
moscow believes the interceptor system is aimed at russia .
bush officials have said it was meant to counter missile threats from states such as iran . medvedev had warned last year that moscow would deploy nuclear-capable iskander missiles to kaliningrad , a russian exclave bordered by lithuania and poland , in response to the plans . there are indications that the missile defense shield will be on the agenda between foreign minister sergey lavrov and us secretary of state hillary clinton when they meet on friday . iranian nuclear program continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is in charge of construction at the bushehr site iran has repeatedly rejected calls by the un security council - of which russia and the united states are permanent members - to halt uranium enrichment , despite the imposition of three sets of sanctions .
the united states and its european allies believe that iran is seeking to develop nuclear weapons , a charge that tehran denies , saying that the program is purely civilian . iran recently began testing its bushehr nuclear plant , a construction project run by russia .
last week , tehran said its first nuclear power station could go on line within months . on monday , clinton reiterated washington 's willingness to engage with iran if it " unclenches its fist . "
this represents a clear switch in policy from the previous us administration , which made talks dependent upon iran halting the enrichment process . russian news agencies cited lavrov as saying that us talks with iran could help to end the international standoff over its nuclear program and boost regional security . jg / sms / nda / afp / dpa / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the case , which opens a year and a day after president dimitry medvedev was elected , is being seen by some as a test of his commitment to reform . khodorkovsky faces fresh charges of embezzlement and money laundering that would leave him facing another long jail sentence , if he is found guilty .
" this case of immense importance because of what it will say to all of us about where russia is going , " robert amsterdam , a defence lawyer for khodorkovsky , told reuters news agency before the hearing .
khodorkovsky 's supporters have long alleged that he was arrested at the behest of the then president vladimir putin and his backers .
the oil tycoon had openly funded opposition parties such as the liberal yabloko faction in the run-up to 2003 parliamentary elections to the kremlin 's displeasure . the former yukos boss , who is currently serving an eight-year sentence , has said that corrupt officials also wanted to carve up his business empire , which produced more oil than opec member qatar .
expectations lowered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two heads are better than one ?
medvedev , a former lawyer who was sworn in as president last may , has demanded a clean-up of the russian court system since khodorkovsky 's sentence and criticised high-level corruption .
but there have been few signs of any substantive change .
" the expectations were modest .
it 's not fair to say that he 's disappointed them , but these expectations have become even more modest , " said andrei ryabov from the carnegie centre in moscow .
at an event to mark the first anniversary of his presidential election victory on monday , march 2 , medvedev expressed what seemed to be a commitment to the line of his predecessor , whom he appointed to the post of prime minister shortly after taking power .
on stage with vladimir putin , medvedev shouted " together we can continue the course set by president putin .
together we 'll win .

20 and one month ahead of a group of 20 summit of the world 's leading economies takes place in london . " what we 're talking about today is how , by us taking action , britain and america , we can help other countries join us in making for a more stable and effective financial system , " brown said . the turmoil in the financial markets is viewed as the biggest culprit in the economic downturn that has left both countries mired in a recession . both leaders have endorsed measures that better supervise the finance industry to prevent the high-risk lending that produced record mortgage defaults in the united states and the subsequent credit freeze .
playing on former president franklin delano roosevelt 's economic program during the great depression of the 1930s , brown has advocated a " global new deal . " global new deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a larger meeting of world leaders in april could bring about major changes to the banking system " there is the possibility in the next few months of a global new deal that will involve all the countries of the world in sorting out and cleaning up the banking system , " brown said . obama agreed with brown that more needs to be done to regulate international markets . " we believe in the free market , we believe in a government that is not overbearing and allows entrepreneurs and businesses to thrive , " obama said .
" but we also share a common belief that there have to be sufficient regulatory structures in place so that the market does n't spin out of control . " the talks in washington were being seen as preparation for the london g20 summit on april 2 , when leaders of the world 's major economies and global economic financial institutions will be gathering in the british capital to address the worldwide financial crisis . " now is the time for leaders of every country in the world to work together to agree the action that will see us through the current crisis and ensure we come out stronger , " brown said before meeting obama . more international support in afghanistan the trip to washington followed sunday 's informal eu council in brussels on the economic crisis .
following the meeting , brown said he would take a " clear message " from eu leaders to obama that agreeing a deal on the world economy was " vitally urgent . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama visited us troops in afghanistan during his campaign in addition to the economic crisis , the deteriorating security situation in afghanistan was another central topic to the talks . brown and obama agreed that the war in afghanistan is not winnable as long as taliban militants and al qaeda continue to find refuge in pakistan .
the conflict is at the top of obama 's foreign agenda , and he is expected to ask europe for more help . britain already has more than 8,000 soldiers in afghanistan , and the two leaders have sought greater contributions from other nato partners , an issue that will likely arise at the alliance 's summit next month . " both great britain and the united states share a deep interest in ensuring that neither afghanistan nor pakistan are safe havens for terrorist activity , " obama said , who has pledged to send 17,000 more us soldiers to afghanistan this year to join the 38,000 already there . global warming , iran 's suspect nuclear program and the middle east are also on the agenda in washington during brown 's visit . brown to warn of protectionism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european nations fear they could lose significant business through the " buy american " clause brown , in a speech before the us congress , will also call on countries to avoid trade protectionism , warning us lawmakers that retreating to protectionist economic policies could exacerbate the economic downturn even further . the eu has repeatedly criticized the " buy american " clause in the $ 787 billion us stimulus package , though it has been watered down .
it stipulated that only us iron , steel and manufactured goods could be used in construction work funded by the bill .
but the us administration has said it will respect international trade obligations . could obama 's shine wear off on brown ? analysts have said brown 's speech before congress could play a key role in boosting his popularity , as it would draw attention to his political efforts to demonstrate british leadership at a time of economic uncertainty .
he is only the fifth british prime minister to ever address the us congress . brown , who is suffering from ongoing low popularity at home , is struggling to gain public support for his domestic stimulus package and huge bank bailouts .

wagner , 54 , has repeatedly provoked controversy in recent years .
he described the harry potter novels as " satanism " and implied that natural disasters such as hurricane katrina in 2005 and the 2004 boxing day tsunami in southeast asia were divine punishment for " spiritual pollution . "
following his appointment at the end of january austrian bishops accused the pope of ignoring established procedures for the selection and examination of candidates for preferment .
all but four of 35 deans present at a meeting of the linz diocese , in northern austria , refused to accept the nomination .
wagner eventually announced that he wanted to withdraw because of the " hefty criticism , " a move welcomed by many church leaders .
the storm came as the vatican was already under fire for lifting the excommunication of richard williamson , one of four bishops in a conservative breakaway faction of the catholic church , who denied that six million jews were gassed by the nazis during world war ii . nda / afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

wagner , 54 , has repeatedly provoked controversy in recent years .
he described the harry potter novels as " satanism " and implied that natural disasters such as hurricane katrina in 2005 and the 2004 boxing day tsunami in southeast asia were divine punishment for " spiritual pollution . "
following his appointment at the end of january austrian bishops accused the pope of ignoring established procedures for the selection and examination of candidates for preferment .
all but four of 35 deans present at a meeting of the linz diocese , in northern austria , refused to accept the nomination .
wagner eventually announced that he wanted to withdraw because of the " hefty criticism , " a move welcomed by many church leaders .
the storm came as the vatican was already under fire for lifting the excommunication of richard williamson , one of four bishops in a conservative breakaway faction of the catholic church , who denied that six million jews were gassed by the nazis during world war ii . nda / afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but he added that any deal linking those talks with negotiations regarding iran would not be productive . russian president dimitry medvedev 's comments came in response to a new york times report that us president barack obama had written a secret letter to his russian counterpart offering to halt the planned missile shield , which would be located mainly in poland and the czech republic , in return for moscow 's help in stopping iran from developing long-range nuclear weapons . the russian president welcomed the " positive signals " coming from the obama administration with which he said he hoped to reach " agreements . "
" haggling , " however , was " not productive , " added medvedev on tuesday , march 3 . the russian president also said obama 's letter had not presented the issue in such a way . obama on tuesday said the times report did not " accurately characterize the letter " he sent medvedev .

moscow believes the interceptor system is aimed at russia .
bush officials have said it was meant to counter missile threats from states such as iran . medvedev had warned last year that moscow would deploy nuclear-capable iskander missiles to kaliningrad , a russian exclave bordered by lithuania and poland , in response to the plans . there are indications that the missile defense shield will be on the agenda between foreign minister sergey lavrov and us secretary of state hillary clinton when they meet on friday . iranian nuclear program continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is in charge of construction at the bushehr site iran has repeatedly rejected calls by the un security council - of which russia and the united states are permanent members - to halt uranium enrichment , despite the imposition of three sets of sanctions .

european parliamentarians have voted to outlaw these goods , with the exception of traditional inuit hunting .
opponents say the ban may break international trade rules . the european parliament 's internal market committee has voted to strictly ban trading throughout the eu in products derived from seals .
a report approved by the committee on tuesday , march 3 , said the ban would cover seal products , as well as meat , oil , blubber , organs and fur skins . the parliament said in a statement that it had reacted to concerns by non-governmental organizations and public opinion in most member states about seal killings . " a clear majority of citizens across the european union are horrified by the cruel clubbing to death of thousands of seals every year , " said arlene mccarthy , the committee 's chair .
" they do not want these products on sale in the eu and today , the internal market committee has backed citizens ' demands for a ban . " inuit hunting only exception the european commission had proposed several exceptions to the ban , for example when the seals are killed " without causing avoidable pain , distress and any other form of suffering . "
but the committee 's meps chose to limit these by a 27-7 vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inuits will be able to continue their traditions in addition , they ignored the view of the committee 's rapporteur diana wallis , who had proposed a labeling system rather than an outright ban .
she said she believed it would be more effective in assuring the customer that animal welfare norms had been obeyed .
wallis said she doubted whether the ban , based on eu internal market rules , would be compatible with international trade rules . but danish mep christel schaldemose said legal opinions were not central in this case . " in this debate we are not dealing with a legal dilemma but a political one , to which parliament must give a political response , " schaldemose said . in practice , seal products such as bags , hats , boots and gloves used by motorcyclists , skiers and boxers would be outlawed , as would parapharmaceutical products sold as omega 3 fatty acid supplements . however , the committee did vote in favor of a proposed exception for inuit and other aboriginal communities living in greenland , canada , russia and the united states .
this would apply to products derived from traditional subsistence hunting that could be traded for cultural , educational , or ceremonial purposes , the committee said . harmonizing trade rules in the eu the new regulation would lay down common corresponding rules that are directly applicable throughout the eu .
at present , national laws vary , with some countries such as belgium and the netherlands having already banned trade in seal products and others expecting to do so . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seals are often shot or clubbed to death yet nordic eu countries such as denmark , sweden and finland have opposed such a ban .
canada and greenland have warned the eu that they could challenge such a ban before the world trade organization . canadian minister of fisheries and oceans gail shea said her government was " disappointed " by the vote , which would severely impact a major canadian export . " canada has made numerous attempts to set the facts straight about the canadian seal hunt and we have provided ample evidence of the humaneness and sustainability of the hunt , " shea said .
" unfortunately , this evidence is not yet understood in europe . " to become law , the ban still needs the approval of the entire eu assembly and eu governments .

european parliamentarians have voted to outlaw these goods , with the exception of traditional inuit hunting .
opponents say the ban may break international trade rules . the european parliament 's internal market committee has voted to strictly ban trading throughout the eu in products derived from seals .
a report approved by the committee on tuesday , march 3 , said the ban would cover seal products , as well as meat , oil , blubber , organs and fur skins . the parliament said in a statement that it had reacted to concerns by non-governmental organizations and public opinion in most member states about seal killings . " a clear majority of citizens across the european union are horrified by the cruel clubbing to death of thousands of seals every year , " said arlene mccarthy , the committee 's chair .
" they do not want these products on sale in the eu and today , the internal market committee has backed citizens ' demands for a ban . " inuit hunting only exception the european commission had proposed several exceptions to the ban , for example when the seals are killed " without causing avoidable pain , distress and any other form of suffering . "
but the committee 's meps chose to limit these by a 27-7 vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inuits will be able to continue their traditions in addition , they ignored the view of the committee 's rapporteur diana wallis , who had proposed a labeling system rather than an outright ban .
she said she believed it would be more effective in assuring the customer that animal welfare norms had been obeyed .
wallis said she doubted whether the ban , based on eu internal market rules , would be compatible with international trade rules . but danish mep christel schaldemose said legal opinions were not central in this case . " in this debate we are not dealing with a legal dilemma but a political one , to which parliament must give a political response , " schaldemose said . in practice , seal products such as bags , hats , boots and gloves used by motorcyclists , skiers and boxers would be outlawed , as would parapharmaceutical products sold as omega 3 fatty acid supplements . however , the committee did vote in favor of a proposed exception for inuit and other aboriginal communities living in greenland , canada , russia and the united states .
this would apply to products derived from traditional subsistence hunting that could be traded for cultural , educational , or ceremonial purposes , the committee said . harmonizing trade rules in the eu the new regulation would lay down common corresponding rules that are directly applicable throughout the eu .
at present , national laws vary , with some countries such as belgium and the netherlands having already banned trade in seal products and others expecting to do so . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seals are often shot or clubbed to death yet nordic eu countries such as denmark , sweden and finland have opposed such a ban .
canada and greenland have warned the eu that they could challenge such a ban before the world trade organization . canadian minister of fisheries and oceans gail shea said her government was " disappointed " by the vote , which would severely impact a major canadian export . " canada has made numerous attempts to set the facts straight about the canadian seal hunt and we have provided ample evidence of the humaneness and sustainability of the hunt , " shea said .
" unfortunately , this evidence is not yet understood in europe . " to become law , the ban still needs the approval of the entire eu assembly and eu governments .

the case , which opens a year and a day after president dimitry medvedev was elected , is being seen by some as a test of his commitment to reform . khodorkovsky faces fresh charges of embezzlement and money laundering that would leave him facing another long jail sentence , if he is found guilty .
" this case of immense importance because of what it will say to all of us about where russia is going , " robert amsterdam , a defence lawyer for khodorkovsky , told reuters news agency before the hearing .
khodorkovsky 's supporters have long alleged that he was arrested at the behest of the then president vladimir putin and his backers .
the oil tycoon had openly funded opposition parties such as the liberal yabloko faction in the run-up to 2003 parliamentary elections to the kremlin 's displeasure . the former yukos boss , who is currently serving an eight-year sentence , has said that corrupt officials also wanted to carve up his business empire , which produced more oil than opec member qatar .
expectations lowered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two heads are better than one ?
medvedev , a former lawyer who was sworn in as president last may , has demanded a clean-up of the russian court system since khodorkovsky 's sentence and criticised high-level corruption .
but there have been few signs of any substantive change .
" the expectations were modest .
it 's not fair to say that he 's disappointed them , but these expectations have become even more modest , " said andrei ryabov from the carnegie centre in moscow .
at an event to mark the first anniversary of his presidential election victory on monday , march 2 , medvedev expressed what seemed to be a commitment to the line of his predecessor , whom he appointed to the post of prime minister shortly after taking power .
on stage with vladimir putin , medvedev shouted " together we can continue the course set by president putin .

however , the karlsruhe judges said the 2005 vote was still valid as there was no evidence of errors . september 's upcoming elections looks set to see a return to the more traditional pencil and paper countrywide .
constitutional judge andreas vosskuhle said that the judgment did not rule out digital voting for once and for all , but added that the equipment used four years ago did have shortcomings .
nevertheless , vosskuhle said there was no indication that there had been any errors .
some two million voters in five different german states submitted their ballots electronically in 2005 .
father and son opposed the technology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes the old solutions are the best the use of electronic voting was challenged by a father-and-son team .
political scientist joachim wiesner and son , physicist ulrich wiesner complained that push button voting was not transparent because the voter could not see what actually happened to his vote inside the computer and was required to place " blind faith " in the technology .
in addition , the two plaintiffs argued that the results were open to manipulation . germany first introduced electronic voting in european elections in 1999 and first used it in parliamentary ballots in 2002 , but 2005 saw the first large-scale deployment of the technology .
german hacker-cum-data-protection group chaos computer club has been spearheading a campaign with the dutch foundation wij vertrouwen stemcomputers niet -lrb- we do n't trust voting computers -rrb- to stop the further spread of electronic voting because of fears about the risk of electronic errors and the potential for abuse .

20 and one month ahead of a group of 20 summit of the world 's leading economies takes place in london . " what we 're talking about today is how , by us taking action , britain and america , we can help other countries join us in making for a more stable and effective financial system , " brown said . the turmoil in the financial markets is viewed as the biggest culprit in the economic downturn that has left both countries mired in a recession . both leaders have endorsed measures that better supervise the finance industry to prevent the high-risk lending that produced record mortgage defaults in the united states and the subsequent credit freeze .
playing on former president franklin delano roosevelt 's economic program during the great depression of the 1930s , brown has advocated a " global new deal . " global new deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a larger meeting of world leaders in april could bring about major changes to the banking system " there is the possibility in the next few months of a global new deal that will involve all the countries of the world in sorting out and cleaning up the banking system , " brown said . obama agreed with brown that more needs to be done to regulate international markets . " we believe in the free market , we believe in a government that is not overbearing and allows entrepreneurs and businesses to thrive , " obama said .
" but we also share a common belief that there have to be sufficient regulatory structures in place so that the market does n't spin out of control . " the talks in washington were being seen as preparation for the london g20 summit on april 2 , when leaders of the world 's major economies and global economic financial institutions will be gathering in the british capital to address the worldwide financial crisis . " now is the time for leaders of every country in the world to work together to agree the action that will see us through the current crisis and ensure we come out stronger , " brown said before meeting obama . more international support in afghanistan the trip to washington followed sunday 's informal eu council in brussels on the economic crisis .
following the meeting , brown said he would take a " clear message " from eu leaders to obama that agreeing a deal on the world economy was " vitally urgent . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama visited us troops in afghanistan during his campaign in addition to the economic crisis , the deteriorating security situation in afghanistan was another central topic to the talks . brown and obama agreed that the war in afghanistan is not winnable as long as taliban militants and al qaeda continue to find refuge in pakistan .
the conflict is at the top of obama 's foreign agenda , and he is expected to ask europe for more help . britain already has more than 8,000 soldiers in afghanistan , and the two leaders have sought greater contributions from other nato partners , an issue that will likely arise at the alliance 's summit next month . " both great britain and the united states share a deep interest in ensuring that neither afghanistan nor pakistan are safe havens for terrorist activity , " obama said , who has pledged to send 17,000 more us soldiers to afghanistan this year to join the 38,000 already there . global warming , iran 's suspect nuclear program and the middle east are also on the agenda in washington during brown 's visit . brown to warn of protectionism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european nations fear they could lose significant business through the " buy american " clause brown , in a speech before the us congress , will also call on countries to avoid trade protectionism , warning us lawmakers that retreating to protectionist economic policies could exacerbate the economic downturn even further . the eu has repeatedly criticized the " buy american " clause in the $ 787 billion us stimulus package , though it has been watered down .
it stipulated that only us iron , steel and manufactured goods could be used in construction work funded by the bill .
but the us administration has said it will respect international trade obligations . could obama 's shine wear off on brown ? analysts have said brown 's speech before congress could play a key role in boosting his popularity , as it would draw attention to his political efforts to demonstrate british leadership at a time of economic uncertainty .
he is only the fifth british prime minister to ever address the us congress . brown , who is suffering from ongoing low popularity at home , is struggling to gain public support for his domestic stimulus package and huge bank bailouts .
his governing labour party is trailing behind the opposition conservatives , with a general election coming up in 2010 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former president bush even invited blair to visit camp david in addition , the visit could help win back labour voters who turned their back on the party under brown 's predecessor tony blair . blair maintained close ties to former us president george w. bush - winning him the nickname " bush 's poodle . "
blair backed bush 's decision to invade iraq in 2003 and sent troops to join us forces in iraq and afghanistan . in an article for the british newspaper the sunday times , brown said there was " no international partnership in recent history that has served the world better than the special relationship between britain and the united states . "
he said he was keen to strengthen it further . us officials said the longtime friendship with britain was as important as ever to washington . sac / sms / nda / afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but he added that any deal linking those talks with negotiations regarding iran would not be productive . russian president dimitry medvedev 's comments came in response to a new york times report that us president barack obama had written a secret letter to his russian counterpart offering to halt the planned missile shield , which would be located mainly in poland and the czech republic , in return for moscow 's help in stopping iran from developing long-range nuclear weapons . the russian president welcomed the " positive signals " coming from the obama administration with which he said he hoped to reach " agreements . "
" haggling , " however , was " not productive , " added medvedev on tuesday , march 3 . the russian president also said obama 's letter had not presented the issue in such a way . obama on tuesday said the times report did not " accurately characterize the letter " he sent medvedev . " what i said in the letter was that , obviously , to the extent that we are lessening iran 's commitment to nuclear weapons , then that reduces the pressure for - or the need for a missile-defense system , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exact wording of obama 's letter to medvedev is unclear earlier , medvedev 's spokeswoman natalya timakova confirmed the receipt of a letter , but added that " there were no concrete proposals about any mutually binding decisions . " on sunday , the russia president was quoted as saying that moscow was waiting for new us proposals to resolve the missile dispute . the times ' sources said while the letter did not offer a direct quid pro quo deal , it was intended to give moscow an incentive to join the united states in a common front against iran . " it 's almost saying to them , put up or shut up , " an unnamed senior official told the newspaper .
" it 's not that the russians get to say , ' we 'll try and therefore you have to suspend . '
it says the threat has to go away .

moscow believes the interceptor system is aimed at russia .
bush officials have said it was meant to counter missile threats from states such as iran . medvedev had warned last year that moscow would deploy nuclear-capable iskander missiles to kaliningrad , a russian exclave bordered by lithuania and poland , in response to the plans . there are indications that the missile defense shield will be on the agenda between foreign minister sergey lavrov and us secretary of state hillary clinton when they meet on friday . iranian nuclear program continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is in charge of construction at the bushehr site iran has repeatedly rejected calls by the un security council - of which russia and the united states are permanent members - to halt uranium enrichment , despite the imposition of three sets of sanctions .
the united states and its european allies believe that iran is seeking to develop nuclear weapons , a charge that tehran denies , saying that the program is purely civilian . iran recently began testing its bushehr nuclear plant , a construction project run by russia .
last week , tehran said its first nuclear power station could go on line within months . on monday , clinton reiterated washington 's willingness to engage with iran if it " unclenches its fist . "
this represents a clear switch in policy from the previous us administration , which made talks dependent upon iran halting the enrichment process . russian news agencies cited lavrov as saying that us talks with iran could help to end the international standoff over its nuclear program and boost regional security . jg / sms / nda / afp / dpa / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they have now passed the buck on to their finance counterparts . the european union is unable to set an exact figure on the aid it is willing to give developing nations in exchange for support of a global climate change pact , said czech environment minister martin bursik . it was " too early " for the 27-nation bloc " to put money on the table , " said bursik , whose country currently holds the eu presidency . " we were not quite able to reach consensus on the financing mechanism , " eu environment commissioner stavros dimas told reporters . the eu environment ministers met in brussels on monday , march 2 , to discuss the bloc 's negotiating position at talks for the un-sponsored climate change talks in copenhagen in december . " it makes no sense to say now how much the eu is willing to transfer , " germany 's environment minister sigmar gabriel said .
" we will negotiate that in copenhagen .
we are creeping towards a number . " usa plays a key role bursik said the eu still wanted to find out the united states ' mid-term targets , how much money the us would spend and whether washington would adopt a cap-and-trade system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time is running out to thwart global warming , experts say he said the eu presidency was confident that us president barack obama " will follow the leadership of the european union " by setting ambitious mid-term goals for cutting greenhouse gases . " we know that the us wants to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent by 2050 , -lrb- but -rrb- we do n't know what their mid-term target is , " bursik said . the eu and the us are considered the major donors that could get lesser developed nations involved in a new global drive to cut carbon dioxide emissions .
the eu has committed to reducing emissions by 30 percent of 1990 levels by 2020 if other developed countries commit to comparable cuts .
it has already put in place the measures to cut its own emissions by 20 percent . european environment ministers said they see obama as a great boost for finding a successor to the kyoto protocol in copenhagen .
his predecessor george w. bush refused to ratify the treaty . bursik and dimas said they would visit washington on march 14-15 to find out more about the intentions of the us administration .
according to bursik climate change would be one of the first things european union leaders discuss with obama when he visits prague for an eu-us summit in early april . passing on the " hot potato " joris den blanken , the eu climate and energy policy director for environmental group greenpeace , criticized that the issue has now been put on the agenda at the eu finance ministers meeting on march 10 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : efficient , clean sources of energy are required around the globe " environment ministers have ducked and passed the climate funding hot potato to finance ministers , " blanken said in a statement .
" while billions of taxpayers ' money is being used to prop up failed banks and carmakers , not one eurocent is being pledged to help the developing world tackle a problem that europeans helped create . " according to greenpeace , eu leaders should support a market-linked scheme where countries are asked to pay for part of their emissions . " the eu must contribute its fair share to poorer countries , " blanken said .
" the clock is ticking , global climate talks in copenhagen are less than 300 days away , and we still have little more than words on the table . " an eu report states that global investment to fight climate change will need to rise to some 175 billion euros -lrb- $ 220 billion -rrb- per year by 2020 .
over 90 billion euros of that sum must be spent in developing countries , the report said . greenpeace and other ngos have said the european union should be contributing around 35 billion euros by 2020 to overall assistance by industrialized countries to help developing nations deal with the effects of climate change . the issue is also on the agenda when the eu 's 27 heads of state and government come together for their next summit on march 19-20 . sac / sms / afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

european parliamentarians have voted to outlaw these goods , with the exception of traditional inuit hunting .
opponents say the ban may break international trade rules . the european parliament 's internal market committee has voted to strictly ban trading throughout the eu in products derived from seals .
a report approved by the committee on tuesday , march 3 , said the ban would cover seal products , as well as meat , oil , blubber , organs and fur skins . the parliament said in a statement that it had reacted to concerns by non-governmental organizations and public opinion in most member states about seal killings . " a clear majority of citizens across the european union are horrified by the cruel clubbing to death of thousands of seals every year , " said arlene mccarthy , the committee 's chair .
" they do not want these products on sale in the eu and today , the internal market committee has backed citizens ' demands for a ban . " inuit hunting only exception the european commission had proposed several exceptions to the ban , for example when the seals are killed " without causing avoidable pain , distress and any other form of suffering . "
but the committee 's meps chose to limit these by a 27-7 vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inuits will be able to continue their traditions in addition , they ignored the view of the committee 's rapporteur diana wallis , who had proposed a labeling system rather than an outright ban .
she said she believed it would be more effective in assuring the customer that animal welfare norms had been obeyed .
wallis said she doubted whether the ban , based on eu internal market rules , would be compatible with international trade rules . but danish mep christel schaldemose said legal opinions were not central in this case . " in this debate we are not dealing with a legal dilemma but a political one , to which parliament must give a political response , " schaldemose said . in practice , seal products such as bags , hats , boots and gloves used by motorcyclists , skiers and boxers would be outlawed , as would parapharmaceutical products sold as omega 3 fatty acid supplements . however , the committee did vote in favor of a proposed exception for inuit and other aboriginal communities living in greenland , canada , russia and the united states .
this would apply to products derived from traditional subsistence hunting that could be traded for cultural , educational , or ceremonial purposes , the committee said . harmonizing trade rules in the eu the new regulation would lay down common corresponding rules that are directly applicable throughout the eu .
at present , national laws vary , with some countries such as belgium and the netherlands having already banned trade in seal products and others expecting to do so . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seals are often shot or clubbed to death yet nordic eu countries such as denmark , sweden and finland have opposed such a ban .
canada and greenland have warned the eu that they could challenge such a ban before the world trade organization . canadian minister of fisheries and oceans gail shea said her government was " disappointed " by the vote , which would severely impact a major canadian export . " canada has made numerous attempts to set the facts straight about the canadian seal hunt and we have provided ample evidence of the humaneness and sustainability of the hunt , " shea said .
" unfortunately , this evidence is not yet understood in europe . " to become law , the ban still needs the approval of the entire eu assembly and eu governments .

but this bright figure ca n't conceal that the general outlook for the industry is gloomy . the german association of the automotive industry , or vda , announced on tuesday , march 3 , that a total of 277,800 vehicles had been sold in february . " these are the highest february sales for 10 years , " vda president matthias wissmann said at a press conference on the margins of the international motor show in geneva , switzerland . " new car registrations are back in positive territory for the first time in six months , " wissmann added .
" we expect a rise in new car sales compared with last year over the entire first quarter . " the good numbers have come after the german government offered consumers a bonus of 2,500 euros -lrb- $ 3,150 -rrb- to scrap older vehicles and buy new , more energy-efficient ones . figures have been strongest in the compact-car sector , not a traditional strength of german manufacturers , but wissmann said domestic production was also benefitting .

production was also cut back by 47 percent . " despite the positive domestic numbers for february , we 're far from a sustained recovery on the world-wide markets , " wissmann said . in france , new car registrations were down by over 13 percent , despite similar governmental consumer incentives .
drops in spain and japan were 48.8 and 32.4 percent respectively . german carmakers hope their export figures will improve as economic stimulus measures taken by foreign countries begin to kick in .

" it shows the strength of german brands that they could increase their share of strategically important markets under the most difficult of conditions , " wissmann said . so for german carmakers , the proverbial glass is both half-full and half-empty .
if stimulus packages worldwide begin to work , the german automotive industry could start to rebound as early as the end of 2009 . but if foreign markets stay sluggish , then the premium for scrapping old cars wo n't be bridge between recession and recovers , but rather a one-off boost with few long-term effects . jc / sms / afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , the karlsruhe judges said the 2005 vote was still valid as there was no evidence of errors . september 's upcoming elections looks set to see a return to the more traditional pencil and paper countrywide .
constitutional judge andreas vosskuhle said that the judgment did not rule out digital voting for once and for all , but added that the equipment used four years ago did have shortcomings .
nevertheless , vosskuhle said there was no indication that there had been any errors .
some two million voters in five different german states submitted their ballots electronically in 2005 .
father and son opposed the technology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes the old solutions are the best the use of electronic voting was challenged by a father-and-son team .
political scientist joachim wiesner and son , physicist ulrich wiesner complained that push button voting was not transparent because the voter could not see what actually happened to his vote inside the computer and was required to place " blind faith " in the technology .
in addition , the two plaintiffs argued that the results were open to manipulation . germany first introduced electronic voting in european elections in 1999 and first used it in parliamentary ballots in 2002 , but 2005 saw the first large-scale deployment of the technology .
german hacker-cum-data-protection group chaos computer club has been spearheading a campaign with the dutch foundation wij vertrouwen stemcomputers niet -lrb- we do n't trust voting computers -rrb- to stop the further spread of electronic voting because of fears about the risk of electronic errors and the potential for abuse .

they have now passed the buck on to their finance counterparts . the european union is unable to set an exact figure on the aid it is willing to give developing nations in exchange for support of a global climate change pact , said czech environment minister martin bursik . it was " too early " for the 27-nation bloc " to put money on the table , " said bursik , whose country currently holds the eu presidency . " we were not quite able to reach consensus on the financing mechanism , " eu environment commissioner stavros dimas told reporters . the eu environment ministers met in brussels on monday , march 2 , to discuss the bloc 's negotiating position at talks for the un-sponsored climate change talks in copenhagen in december . " it makes no sense to say now how much the eu is willing to transfer , " germany 's environment minister sigmar gabriel said .
" we will negotiate that in copenhagen .
we are creeping towards a number . " usa plays a key role bursik said the eu still wanted to find out the united states ' mid-term targets , how much money the us would spend and whether washington would adopt a cap-and-trade system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time is running out to thwart global warming , experts say he said the eu presidency was confident that us president barack obama " will follow the leadership of the european union " by setting ambitious mid-term goals for cutting greenhouse gases . " we know that the us wants to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent by 2050 , -lrb- but -rrb- we do n't know what their mid-term target is , " bursik said . the eu and the us are considered the major donors that could get lesser developed nations involved in a new global drive to cut carbon dioxide emissions .
the eu has committed to reducing emissions by 30 percent of 1990 levels by 2020 if other developed countries commit to comparable cuts .
it has already put in place the measures to cut its own emissions by 20 percent . european environment ministers said they see obama as a great boost for finding a successor to the kyoto protocol in copenhagen .
his predecessor george w. bush refused to ratify the treaty . bursik and dimas said they would visit washington on march 14-15 to find out more about the intentions of the us administration .
according to bursik climate change would be one of the first things european union leaders discuss with obama when he visits prague for an eu-us summit in early april . passing on the " hot potato " joris den blanken , the eu climate and energy policy director for environmental group greenpeace , criticized that the issue has now been put on the agenda at the eu finance ministers meeting on march 10 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : efficient , clean sources of energy are required around the globe " environment ministers have ducked and passed the climate funding hot potato to finance ministers , " blanken said in a statement .
" while billions of taxpayers ' money is being used to prop up failed banks and carmakers , not one eurocent is being pledged to help the developing world tackle a problem that europeans helped create . " according to greenpeace , eu leaders should support a market-linked scheme where countries are asked to pay for part of their emissions . " the eu must contribute its fair share to poorer countries , " blanken said .
" the clock is ticking , global climate talks in copenhagen are less than 300 days away , and we still have little more than words on the table . " an eu report states that global investment to fight climate change will need to rise to some 175 billion euros -lrb- $ 220 billion -rrb- per year by 2020 .
over 90 billion euros of that sum must be spent in developing countries , the report said . greenpeace and other ngos have said the european union should be contributing around 35 billion euros by 2020 to overall assistance by industrialized countries to help developing nations deal with the effects of climate change . the issue is also on the agenda when the eu 's 27 heads of state and government come together for their next summit on march 19-20 . sac / sms / afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , the karlsruhe judges said the 2005 vote was still valid as there was no evidence of errors . september 's upcoming elections looks set to see a return to the more traditional pencil and paper countrywide .
constitutional judge andreas vosskuhle said that the judgment did not rule out digital voting for once and for all , but added that the equipment used four years ago did have shortcomings .
nevertheless , vosskuhle said there was no indication that there had been any errors .
some two million voters in five different german states submitted their ballots electronically in 2005 .
father and son opposed the technology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes the old solutions are the best the use of electronic voting was challenged by a father-and-son team .
political scientist joachim wiesner and son , physicist ulrich wiesner complained that push button voting was not transparent because the voter could not see what actually happened to his vote inside the computer and was required to place " blind faith " in the technology .
in addition , the two plaintiffs argued that the results were open to manipulation . germany first introduced electronic voting in european elections in 1999 and first used it in parliamentary ballots in 2002 , but 2005 saw the first large-scale deployment of the technology .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 03.03.2009 obama , brown stress need for global unity in fighting economic crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama and brown both said more needs to be done to regulate financial markets britain 's prime minister gordon brown and us president barack obama on tuesday , march 3 , discussed a " global new deal " to rebuild the world economy and urged nations to cooperate in regulating financial markets . the two leaders met for the first time since obama took office on jan .
20 and one month ahead of a group of 20 summit of the world 's leading economies takes place in london . " what we 're talking about today is how , by us taking action , britain and america , we can help other countries join us in making for a more stable and effective financial system , " brown said . the turmoil in the financial markets is viewed as the biggest culprit in the economic downturn that has left both countries mired in a recession . both leaders have endorsed measures that better supervise the finance industry to prevent the high-risk lending that produced record mortgage defaults in the united states and the subsequent credit freeze .
playing on former president franklin delano roosevelt 's economic program during the great depression of the 1930s , brown has advocated a " global new deal . " global new deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a larger meeting of world leaders in april could bring about major changes to the banking system " there is the possibility in the next few months of a global new deal that will involve all the countries of the world in sorting out and cleaning up the banking system , " brown said . obama agreed with brown that more needs to be done to regulate international markets . " we believe in the free market , we believe in a government that is not overbearing and allows entrepreneurs and businesses to thrive , " obama said .
" but we also share a common belief that there have to be sufficient regulatory structures in place so that the market does n't spin out of control . " the talks in washington were being seen as preparation for the london g20 summit on april 2 , when leaders of the world 's major economies and global economic financial institutions will be gathering in the british capital to address the worldwide financial crisis . " now is the time for leaders of every country in the world to work together to agree the action that will see us through the current crisis and ensure we come out stronger , " brown said before meeting obama . more international support in afghanistan the trip to washington followed sunday 's informal eu council in brussels on the economic crisis .
following the meeting , brown said he would take a " clear message " from eu leaders to obama that agreeing a deal on the world economy was " vitally urgent .

20 and one month ahead of a group of 20 summit of the world 's leading economies takes place in london . " what we 're talking about today is how , by us taking action , britain and america , we can help other countries join us in making for a more stable and effective financial system , " brown said . the turmoil in the financial markets is viewed as the biggest culprit in the economic downturn that has left both countries mired in a recession . both leaders have endorsed measures that better supervise the finance industry to prevent the high-risk lending that produced record mortgage defaults in the united states and the subsequent credit freeze .
playing on former president franklin delano roosevelt 's economic program during the great depression of the 1930s , brown has advocated a " global new deal .

" we believe in the free market , we believe in a government that is not overbearing and allows entrepreneurs and businesses to thrive , " obama said .
" but we also share a common belief that there have to be sufficient regulatory structures in place so that the market does n't spin out of control . " the talks in washington were being seen as preparation for the london g20 summit on april 2 , when leaders of the world 's major economies and global economic financial institutions will be gathering in the british capital to address the worldwide financial crisis . " now is the time for leaders of every country in the world to work together to agree the action that will see us through the current crisis and ensure we come out stronger , " brown said before meeting obama . more international support in afghanistan the trip to washington followed sunday 's informal eu council in brussels on the economic crisis .
following the meeting , brown said he would take a " clear message " from eu leaders to obama that agreeing a deal on the world economy was " vitally urgent .

" new car registrations are back in positive territory for the first time in six months , " wissmann added .

the case , which opens a year and a day after president dimitry medvedev was elected , is being seen by some as a test of his commitment to reform . khodorkovsky faces fresh charges of embezzlement and money laundering that would leave him facing another long jail sentence , if he is found guilty .
" this case of immense importance because of what it will say to all of us about where russia is going , " robert amsterdam , a defence lawyer for khodorkovsky , told reuters news agency before the hearing .
khodorkovsky 's supporters have long alleged that he was arrested at the behest of the then president vladimir putin and his backers .
the oil tycoon had openly funded opposition parties such as the liberal yabloko faction in the run-up to 2003 parliamentary elections to the kremlin 's displeasure . the former yukos boss , who is currently serving an eight-year sentence , has said that corrupt officials also wanted to carve up his business empire , which produced more oil than opec member qatar .

medvedev , a former lawyer who was sworn in as president last may , has demanded a clean-up of the russian court system since khodorkovsky 's sentence and criticised high-level corruption .
but there have been few signs of any substantive change .
" the expectations were modest .
it 's not fair to say that he 's disappointed them , but these expectations have become even more modest , " said andrei ryabov from the carnegie centre in moscow .
at an event to mark the first anniversary of his presidential election victory on monday , march 2 , medvedev expressed what seemed to be a commitment to the line of his predecessor , whom he appointed to the post of prime minister shortly after taking power .
on stage with vladimir putin , medvedev shouted " together we can continue the course set by president putin .

the case , which opens a year and a day after president dimitry medvedev was elected , is being seen by some as a test of his commitment to reform . khodorkovsky faces fresh charges of embezzlement and money laundering that would leave him facing another long jail sentence , if he is found guilty .
" this case of immense importance because of what it will say to all of us about where russia is going , " robert amsterdam , a defence lawyer for khodorkovsky , told reuters news agency before the hearing .
khodorkovsky 's supporters have long alleged that he was arrested at the behest of the then president vladimir putin and his backers .
the oil tycoon had openly funded opposition parties such as the liberal yabloko faction in the run-up to 2003 parliamentary elections to the kremlin 's displeasure . the former yukos boss , who is currently serving an eight-year sentence , has said that corrupt officials also wanted to carve up his business empire , which produced more oil than opec member qatar .

the oil tycoon had openly funded opposition parties such as the liberal yabloko faction in the run-up to 2003 parliamentary elections to the kremlin 's displeasure . the former yukos boss , who is currently serving an eight-year sentence , has said that corrupt officials also wanted to carve up his business empire , which produced more oil than opec member qatar .
expectations lowered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two heads are better than one ?
medvedev , a former lawyer who was sworn in as president last may , has demanded a clean-up of the russian court system since khodorkovsky 's sentence and criticised high-level corruption .
but there have been few signs of any substantive change .
" the expectations were modest .
it 's not fair to say that he 's disappointed them , but these expectations have become even more modest , " said andrei ryabov from the carnegie centre in moscow .
at an event to mark the first anniversary of his presidential election victory on monday , march 2 , medvedev expressed what seemed to be a commitment to the line of his predecessor , whom he appointed to the post of prime minister shortly after taking power .
on stage with vladimir putin , medvedev shouted " together we can continue the course set by president putin .
together we 'll win .

they have now passed the buck on to their finance counterparts . the european union is unable to set an exact figure on the aid it is willing to give developing nations in exchange for support of a global climate change pact , said czech environment minister martin bursik . it was " too early " for the 27-nation bloc " to put money on the table , " said bursik , whose country currently holds the eu presidency . " we were not quite able to reach consensus on the financing mechanism , " eu environment commissioner stavros dimas told reporters . the eu environment ministers met in brussels on monday , march 2 , to discuss the bloc 's negotiating position at talks for the un-sponsored climate change talks in copenhagen in december . " it makes no sense to say now how much the eu is willing to transfer , " germany 's environment minister sigmar gabriel said .
" we will negotiate that in copenhagen .
we are creeping towards a number . " usa plays a key role bursik said the eu still wanted to find out the united states ' mid-term targets , how much money the us would spend and whether washington would adopt a cap-and-trade system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time is running out to thwart global warming , experts say he said the eu presidency was confident that us president barack obama " will follow the leadership of the european union " by setting ambitious mid-term goals for cutting greenhouse gases . " we know that the us wants to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent by 2050 , -lrb- but -rrb- we do n't know what their mid-term target is , " bursik said . the eu and the us are considered the major donors that could get lesser developed nations involved in a new global drive to cut carbon dioxide emissions .
the eu has committed to reducing emissions by 30 percent of 1990 levels by 2020 if other developed countries commit to comparable cuts .
it has already put in place the measures to cut its own emissions by 20 percent . european environment ministers said they see obama as a great boost for finding a successor to the kyoto protocol in copenhagen .
his predecessor george w. bush refused to ratify the treaty . bursik and dimas said they would visit washington on march 14-15 to find out more about the intentions of the us administration .
according to bursik climate change would be one of the first things european union leaders discuss with obama when he visits prague for an eu-us summit in early april . passing on the " hot potato " joris den blanken , the eu climate and energy policy director for environmental group greenpeace , criticized that the issue has now been put on the agenda at the eu finance ministers meeting on march 10 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : efficient , clean sources of energy are required around the globe " environment ministers have ducked and passed the climate funding hot potato to finance ministers , " blanken said in a statement .
" while billions of taxpayers ' money is being used to prop up failed banks and carmakers , not one eurocent is being pledged to help the developing world tackle a problem that europeans helped create . " according to greenpeace , eu leaders should support a market-linked scheme where countries are asked to pay for part of their emissions . " the eu must contribute its fair share to poorer countries , " blanken said .
" the clock is ticking , global climate talks in copenhagen are less than 300 days away , and we still have little more than words on the table . " an eu report states that global investment to fight climate change will need to rise to some 175 billion euros -lrb- $ 220 billion -rrb- per year by 2020 .
over 90 billion euros of that sum must be spent in developing countries , the report said . greenpeace and other ngos have said the european union should be contributing around 35 billion euros by 2020 to overall assistance by industrialized countries to help developing nations deal with the effects of climate change . the issue is also on the agenda when the eu 's 27 heads of state and government come together for their next summit on march 19-20 . sac / sms / afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

20 and one month ahead of a group of 20 summit of the world 's leading economies takes place in london . " what we 're talking about today is how , by us taking action , britain and america , we can help other countries join us in making for a more stable and effective financial system , " brown said . the turmoil in the financial markets is viewed as the biggest culprit in the economic downturn that has left both countries mired in a recession . both leaders have endorsed measures that better supervise the finance industry to prevent the high-risk lending that produced record mortgage defaults in the united states and the subsequent credit freeze .
playing on former president franklin delano roosevelt 's economic program during the great depression of the 1930s , brown has advocated a " global new deal . " global new deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a larger meeting of world leaders in april could bring about major changes to the banking system " there is the possibility in the next few months of a global new deal that will involve all the countries of the world in sorting out and cleaning up the banking system , " brown said . obama agreed with brown that more needs to be done to regulate international markets . " we believe in the free market , we believe in a government that is not overbearing and allows entrepreneurs and businesses to thrive , " obama said .
" but we also share a common belief that there have to be sufficient regulatory structures in place so that the market does n't spin out of control . " the talks in washington were being seen as preparation for the london g20 summit on april 2 , when leaders of the world 's major economies and global economic financial institutions will be gathering in the british capital to address the worldwide financial crisis . " now is the time for leaders of every country in the world to work together to agree the action that will see us through the current crisis and ensure we come out stronger , " brown said before meeting obama . more international support in afghanistan the trip to washington followed sunday 's informal eu council in brussels on the economic crisis .
following the meeting , brown said he would take a " clear message " from eu leaders to obama that agreeing a deal on the world economy was " vitally urgent . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama visited us troops in afghanistan during his campaign in addition to the economic crisis , the deteriorating security situation in afghanistan was another central topic to the talks . brown and obama agreed that the war in afghanistan is not winnable as long as taliban militants and al qaeda continue to find refuge in pakistan .
the conflict is at the top of obama 's foreign agenda , and he is expected to ask europe for more help . britain already has more than 8,000 soldiers in afghanistan , and the two leaders have sought greater contributions from other nato partners , an issue that will likely arise at the alliance 's summit next month . " both great britain and the united states share a deep interest in ensuring that neither afghanistan nor pakistan are safe havens for terrorist activity , " obama said , who has pledged to send 17,000 more us soldiers to afghanistan this year to join the 38,000 already there . global warming , iran 's suspect nuclear program and the middle east are also on the agenda in washington during brown 's visit . brown to warn of protectionism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european nations fear they could lose significant business through the " buy american " clause brown , in a speech before the us congress , will also call on countries to avoid trade protectionism , warning us lawmakers that retreating to protectionist economic policies could exacerbate the economic downturn even further . the eu has repeatedly criticized the " buy american " clause in the $ 787 billion us stimulus package , though it has been watered down .
it stipulated that only us iron , steel and manufactured goods could be used in construction work funded by the bill .
but the us administration has said it will respect international trade obligations . could obama 's shine wear off on brown ? analysts have said brown 's speech before congress could play a key role in boosting his popularity , as it would draw attention to his political efforts to demonstrate british leadership at a time of economic uncertainty .
he is only the fifth british prime minister to ever address the us congress . brown , who is suffering from ongoing low popularity at home , is struggling to gain public support for his domestic stimulus package and huge bank bailouts .

"
blair backed bush 's decision to invade iraq in 2003 and sent troops to join us forces in iraq and afghanistan . in an article for the british newspaper the sunday times , brown said there was " no international partnership in recent history that has served the world better than the special relationship between britain and the united states .

20 and one month ahead of a group of 20 summit of the world 's leading economies takes place in london . " what we 're talking about today is how , by us taking action , britain and america , we can help other countries join us in making for a more stable and effective financial system , " brown said . the turmoil in the financial markets is viewed as the biggest culprit in the economic downturn that has left both countries mired in a recession . both leaders have endorsed measures that better supervise the finance industry to prevent the high-risk lending that produced record mortgage defaults in the united states and the subsequent credit freeze .
playing on former president franklin delano roosevelt 's economic program during the great depression of the 1930s , brown has advocated a " global new deal . " global new deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a larger meeting of world leaders in april could bring about major changes to the banking system " there is the possibility in the next few months of a global new deal that will involve all the countries of the world in sorting out and cleaning up the banking system , " brown said . obama agreed with brown that more needs to be done to regulate international markets . " we believe in the free market , we believe in a government that is not overbearing and allows entrepreneurs and businesses to thrive , " obama said .
" but we also share a common belief that there have to be sufficient regulatory structures in place so that the market does n't spin out of control . " the talks in washington were being seen as preparation for the london g20 summit on april 2 , when leaders of the world 's major economies and global economic financial institutions will be gathering in the british capital to address the worldwide financial crisis . " now is the time for leaders of every country in the world to work together to agree the action that will see us through the current crisis and ensure we come out stronger , " brown said before meeting obama . more international support in afghanistan the trip to washington followed sunday 's informal eu council in brussels on the economic crisis .
following the meeting , brown said he would take a " clear message " from eu leaders to obama that agreeing a deal on the world economy was " vitally urgent .

the conflict is at the top of obama 's foreign agenda , and he is expected to ask europe for more help . britain already has more than 8,000 soldiers in afghanistan , and the two leaders have sought greater contributions from other nato partners , an issue that will likely arise at the alliance 's summit next month . " both great britain and the united states share a deep interest in ensuring that neither afghanistan nor pakistan are safe havens for terrorist activity , " obama said , who has pledged to send 17,000 more us soldiers to afghanistan this year to join the 38,000 already there . global warming , iran 's suspect nuclear program and the middle east are also on the agenda in washington during brown 's visit . brown to warn of protectionism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european nations fear they could lose significant business through the " buy american " clause brown , in a speech before the us congress , will also call on countries to avoid trade protectionism , warning us lawmakers that retreating to protectionist economic policies could exacerbate the economic downturn even further . the eu has repeatedly criticized the " buy american " clause in the $ 787 billion us stimulus package , though it has been watered down .
it stipulated that only us iron , steel and manufactured goods could be used in construction work funded by the bill .
but the us administration has said it will respect international trade obligations . could obama 's shine wear off on brown ? analysts have said brown 's speech before congress could play a key role in boosting his popularity , as it would draw attention to his political efforts to demonstrate british leadership at a time of economic uncertainty .
he is only the fifth british prime minister to ever address the us congress . brown , who is suffering from ongoing low popularity at home , is struggling to gain public support for his domestic stimulus package and huge bank bailouts .

20 and one month ahead of a group of 20 summit of the world 's leading economies takes place in london . " what we 're talking about today is how , by us taking action , britain and america , we can help other countries join us in making for a more stable and effective financial system , " brown said . the turmoil in the financial markets is viewed as the biggest culprit in the economic downturn that has left both countries mired in a recession . both leaders have endorsed measures that better supervise the finance industry to prevent the high-risk lending that produced record mortgage defaults in the united states and the subsequent credit freeze .
playing on former president franklin delano roosevelt 's economic program during the great depression of the 1930s , brown has advocated a " global new deal . " global new deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a larger meeting of world leaders in april could bring about major changes to the banking system " there is the possibility in the next few months of a global new deal that will involve all the countries of the world in sorting out and cleaning up the banking system , " brown said . obama agreed with brown that more needs to be done to regulate international markets . " we believe in the free market , we believe in a government that is not overbearing and allows entrepreneurs and businesses to thrive , " obama said .
" but we also share a common belief that there have to be sufficient regulatory structures in place so that the market does n't spin out of control . " the talks in washington were being seen as preparation for the london g20 summit on april 2 , when leaders of the world 's major economies and global economic financial institutions will be gathering in the british capital to address the worldwide financial crisis . " now is the time for leaders of every country in the world to work together to agree the action that will see us through the current crisis and ensure we come out stronger , " brown said before meeting obama . more international support in afghanistan the trip to washington followed sunday 's informal eu council in brussels on the economic crisis .
following the meeting , brown said he would take a " clear message " from eu leaders to obama that agreeing a deal on the world economy was " vitally urgent .

authorities are also investigating the possible causes . eyewitnesses interviewed by the local koelner stadt-anzeiger newspaper drew comparisons with an earthquake and the 9/11 terrorist attacks after the archive building suddenly fell apart on tuesday , march 3 .
two neighboring multi-story apartment houses were also reported to have been destroyed in the incident . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rescue personnel rushed to the scene to search for survivors initial reports said that some 30 people had been trapped in the rubble , but miraculously most of the people inside the buildings seemed to have escaped unharmed .

european parliamentarians have voted to outlaw these goods , with the exception of traditional inuit hunting .
opponents say the ban may break international trade rules . the european parliament 's internal market committee has voted to strictly ban trading throughout the eu in products derived from seals .
a report approved by the committee on tuesday , march 3 , said the ban would cover seal products , as well as meat , oil , blubber , organs and fur skins . the parliament said in a statement that it had reacted to concerns by non-governmental organizations and public opinion in most member states about seal killings . " a clear majority of citizens across the european union are horrified by the cruel clubbing to death of thousands of seals every year , " said arlene mccarthy , the committee 's chair .
" they do not want these products on sale in the eu and today , the internal market committee has backed citizens ' demands for a ban . " inuit hunting only exception the european commission had proposed several exceptions to the ban , for example when the seals are killed " without causing avoidable pain , distress and any other form of suffering . "
but the committee 's meps chose to limit these by a 27-7 vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inuits will be able to continue their traditions in addition , they ignored the view of the committee 's rapporteur diana wallis , who had proposed a labeling system rather than an outright ban .
she said she believed it would be more effective in assuring the customer that animal welfare norms had been obeyed .
wallis said she doubted whether the ban , based on eu internal market rules , would be compatible with international trade rules . but danish mep christel schaldemose said legal opinions were not central in this case . " in this debate we are not dealing with a legal dilemma but a political one , to which parliament must give a political response , " schaldemose said . in practice , seal products such as bags , hats , boots and gloves used by motorcyclists , skiers and boxers would be outlawed , as would parapharmaceutical products sold as omega 3 fatty acid supplements . however , the committee did vote in favor of a proposed exception for inuit and other aboriginal communities living in greenland , canada , russia and the united states .
this would apply to products derived from traditional subsistence hunting that could be traded for cultural , educational , or ceremonial purposes , the committee said . harmonizing trade rules in the eu the new regulation would lay down common corresponding rules that are directly applicable throughout the eu .
at present , national laws vary , with some countries such as belgium and the netherlands having already banned trade in seal products and others expecting to do so . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seals are often shot or clubbed to death yet nordic eu countries such as denmark , sweden and finland have opposed such a ban .
canada and greenland have warned the eu that they could challenge such a ban before the world trade organization . canadian minister of fisheries and oceans gail shea said her government was " disappointed " by the vote , which would severely impact a major canadian export . " canada has made numerous attempts to set the facts straight about the canadian seal hunt and we have provided ample evidence of the humaneness and sustainability of the hunt , " shea said .
" unfortunately , this evidence is not yet understood in europe . " to become law , the ban still needs the approval of the entire eu assembly and eu governments .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 03.03.2009 car sales in germany rise in february , but future still cloudy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw is one of the brands that have profitted from consumer incentives government bonuses for people to scrap old cars and buy new ones led to a 21.5 percent boost compared to the previous year .
but this bright figure ca n't conceal that the general outlook for the industry is gloomy . the german association of the automotive industry , or vda , announced on tuesday , march 3 , that a total of 277,800 vehicles had been sold in february . " these are the highest february sales for 10 years , " vda president matthias wissmann said at a press conference on the margins of the international motor show in geneva , switzerland . " new car registrations are back in positive territory for the first time in six months , " wissmann added .
" we expect a rise in new car sales compared with last year over the entire first quarter . " the good numbers have come after the german government offered consumers a bonus of 2,500 euros -lrb- $ 3,150 -rrb- to scrap older vehicles and buy new , more energy-efficient ones . figures have been strongest in the compact-car sector , not a traditional strength of german manufacturers , but wissmann said domestic production was also benefitting . " an initial analysis shows that one in two consumers who scrap their old cars chooses a model made by a german company , " wissmann said , adding that the industry was hoping to break the 3 million mark for new car registrations in 2009 . still , overall , german carmakers ' - in particular mercedes and bmw 's - share of their own domestic market declined .
fears abound that true recovery for the industry is still a long way off . sales abroad plummet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more cars at the scrapyards mean - temporarily at least - more new-car buyers as good as the domestic numbers were , figures for german car exports were down dramatically , falling by more than 50 percent in february to just over 200,000 vehicles .
production was also cut back by 47 percent . " despite the positive domestic numbers for february , we 're far from a sustained recovery on the world-wide markets , " wissmann said . in france , new car registrations were down by over 13 percent , despite similar governmental consumer incentives .
drops in spain and japan were 48.8 and 32.4 percent respectively . german carmakers hope their export figures will improve as economic stimulus measures taken by foreign countries begin to kick in .
the industry also pointed out that , while sales abroad are down drastically , german-made cars have made slight gains in market share in countries from china to the united states . " it shows the strength of german brands that they could increase their share of strategically important markets under the most difficult of conditions , " wissmann said . so for german carmakers , the proverbial glass is both half-full and half-empty .
if stimulus packages worldwide begin to work , the german automotive industry could start to rebound as early as the end of 2009 . but if foreign markets stay sluggish , then the premium for scrapping old cars wo n't be bridge between recession and recovers , but rather a one-off boost with few long-term effects . jc / sms / afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 03.03.2009 car sales in germany rise in february , but future still cloudy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw is one of the brands that have profitted from consumer incentives government bonuses for people to scrap old cars and buy new ones led to a 21.5 percent boost compared to the previous year .
but this bright figure ca n't conceal that the general outlook for the industry is gloomy . the german association of the automotive industry , or vda , announced on tuesday , march 3 , that a total of 277,800 vehicles had been sold in february . " these are the highest february sales for 10 years , " vda president matthias wissmann said at a press conference on the margins of the international motor show in geneva , switzerland . " new car registrations are back in positive territory for the first time in six months , " wissmann added .
" we expect a rise in new car sales compared with last year over the entire first quarter . " the good numbers have come after the german government offered consumers a bonus of 2,500 euros -lrb- $ 3,150 -rrb- to scrap older vehicles and buy new , more energy-efficient ones . figures have been strongest in the compact-car sector , not a traditional strength of german manufacturers , but wissmann said domestic production was also benefitting . " an initial analysis shows that one in two consumers who scrap their old cars chooses a model made by a german company , " wissmann said , adding that the industry was hoping to break the 3 million mark for new car registrations in 2009 . still , overall , german carmakers ' - in particular mercedes and bmw 's - share of their own domestic market declined .
fears abound that true recovery for the industry is still a long way off . sales abroad plummet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more cars at the scrapyards mean - temporarily at least - more new-car buyers as good as the domestic numbers were , figures for german car exports were down dramatically , falling by more than 50 percent in february to just over 200,000 vehicles .
production was also cut back by 47 percent . " despite the positive domestic numbers for february , we 're far from a sustained recovery on the world-wide markets , " wissmann said . in france , new car registrations were down by over 13 percent , despite similar governmental consumer incentives .
drops in spain and japan were 48.8 and 32.4 percent respectively . german carmakers hope their export figures will improve as economic stimulus measures taken by foreign countries begin to kick in .
the industry also pointed out that , while sales abroad are down drastically , german-made cars have made slight gains in market share in countries from china to the united states . " it shows the strength of german brands that they could increase their share of strategically important markets under the most difficult of conditions , " wissmann said . so for german carmakers , the proverbial glass is both half-full and half-empty .
if stimulus packages worldwide begin to work , the german automotive industry could start to rebound as early as the end of 2009 . but if foreign markets stay sluggish , then the premium for scrapping old cars wo n't be bridge between recession and recovers , but rather a one-off boost with few long-term effects . jc / sms / afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de regulation -pipe- 03.03.2009 eu parliamentary committee votes to ban seal products großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seals are mainly hunted for their pelts , but also for meat and fat used in beauty products the eu could soon be off limits for seal products .
european parliamentarians have voted to outlaw these goods , with the exception of traditional inuit hunting .
opponents say the ban may break international trade rules . the european parliament 's internal market committee has voted to strictly ban trading throughout the eu in products derived from seals .
a report approved by the committee on tuesday , march 3 , said the ban would cover seal products , as well as meat , oil , blubber , organs and fur skins . the parliament said in a statement that it had reacted to concerns by non-governmental organizations and public opinion in most member states about seal killings . " a clear majority of citizens across the european union are horrified by the cruel clubbing to death of thousands of seals every year , " said arlene mccarthy , the committee 's chair .
" they do not want these products on sale in the eu and today , the internal market committee has backed citizens ' demands for a ban . " inuit hunting only exception the european commission had proposed several exceptions to the ban , for example when the seals are killed " without causing avoidable pain , distress and any other form of suffering . "
but the committee 's meps chose to limit these by a 27-7 vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inuits will be able to continue their traditions in addition , they ignored the view of the committee 's rapporteur diana wallis , who had proposed a labeling system rather than an outright ban .
she said she believed it would be more effective in assuring the customer that animal welfare norms had been obeyed .
wallis said she doubted whether the ban , based on eu internal market rules , would be compatible with international trade rules . but danish mep christel schaldemose said legal opinions were not central in this case . " in this debate we are not dealing with a legal dilemma but a political one , to which parliament must give a political response , " schaldemose said . in practice , seal products such as bags , hats , boots and gloves used by motorcyclists , skiers and boxers would be outlawed , as would parapharmaceutical products sold as omega 3 fatty acid supplements . however , the committee did vote in favor of a proposed exception for inuit and other aboriginal communities living in greenland , canada , russia and the united states .
this would apply to products derived from traditional subsistence hunting that could be traded for cultural , educational , or ceremonial purposes , the committee said . harmonizing trade rules in the eu the new regulation would lay down common corresponding rules that are directly applicable throughout the eu .
at present , national laws vary , with some countries such as belgium and the netherlands having already banned trade in seal products and others expecting to do so . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seals are often shot or clubbed to death yet nordic eu countries such as denmark , sweden and finland have opposed such a ban .
canada and greenland have warned the eu that they could challenge such a ban before the world trade organization . canadian minister of fisheries and oceans gail shea said her government was " disappointed " by the vote , which would severely impact a major canadian export . " canada has made numerous attempts to set the facts straight about the canadian seal hunt and we have provided ample evidence of the humaneness and sustainability of the hunt , " shea said .
" unfortunately , this evidence is not yet understood in europe . " to become law , the ban still needs the approval of the entire eu assembly and eu governments .

but he added that any deal linking those talks with negotiations regarding iran would not be productive . russian president dimitry medvedev 's comments came in response to a new york times report that us president barack obama had written a secret letter to his russian counterpart offering to halt the planned missile shield , which would be located mainly in poland and the czech republic , in return for moscow 's help in stopping iran from developing long-range nuclear weapons . the russian president welcomed the " positive signals " coming from the obama administration with which he said he hoped to reach " agreements . "
" haggling , " however , was " not productive , " added medvedev on tuesday , march 3 . the russian president also said obama 's letter had not presented the issue in such a way . obama on tuesday said the times report did not " accurately characterize the letter " he sent medvedev . " what i said in the letter was that , obviously , to the extent that we are lessening iran 's commitment to nuclear weapons , then that reduces the pressure for - or the need for a missile-defense system , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exact wording of obama 's letter to medvedev is unclear earlier , medvedev 's spokeswoman natalya timakova confirmed the receipt of a letter , but added that " there were no concrete proposals about any mutually binding decisions . " on sunday , the russia president was quoted as saying that moscow was waiting for new us proposals to resolve the missile dispute . the times ' sources said while the letter did not offer a direct quid pro quo deal , it was intended to give moscow an incentive to join the united states in a common front against iran . " it 's almost saying to them , put up or shut up , " an unnamed senior official told the newspaper .
" it 's not that the russians get to say , ' we 'll try and therefore you have to suspend . '
it says the threat has to go away . " too close to home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bush administration said the facilities were intended to stop iranian missiles russia has been bitterly opposed to the deployment of a us missile system in poland and the czech republic ever since it was proposed by the former us president george w. bush 's administration .
moscow believes the interceptor system is aimed at russia .
bush officials have said it was meant to counter missile threats from states such as iran . medvedev had warned last year that moscow would deploy nuclear-capable iskander missiles to kaliningrad , a russian exclave bordered by lithuania and poland , in response to the plans . there are indications that the missile defense shield will be on the agenda between foreign minister sergey lavrov and us secretary of state hillary clinton when they meet on friday . iranian nuclear program continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is in charge of construction at the bushehr site iran has repeatedly rejected calls by the un security council - of which russia and the united states are permanent members - to halt uranium enrichment , despite the imposition of three sets of sanctions .
the united states and its european allies believe that iran is seeking to develop nuclear weapons , a charge that tehran denies , saying that the program is purely civilian . iran recently began testing its bushehr nuclear plant , a construction project run by russia .
last week , tehran said its first nuclear power station could go on line within months . on monday , clinton reiterated washington 's willingness to engage with iran if it " unclenches its fist . "
this represents a clear switch in policy from the previous us administration , which made talks dependent upon iran halting the enrichment process . russian news agencies cited lavrov as saying that us talks with iran could help to end the international standoff over its nuclear program and boost regional security . jg / sms / nda / afp / dpa / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but he added that any deal linking those talks with negotiations regarding iran would not be productive . russian president dimitry medvedev 's comments came in response to a new york times report that us president barack obama had written a secret letter to his russian counterpart offering to halt the planned missile shield , which would be located mainly in poland and the czech republic , in return for moscow 's help in stopping iran from developing long-range nuclear weapons . the russian president welcomed the " positive signals " coming from the obama administration with which he said he hoped to reach " agreements . "
" haggling , " however , was " not productive , " added medvedev on tuesday , march 3 . the russian president also said obama 's letter had not presented the issue in such a way . obama on tuesday said the times report did not " accurately characterize the letter " he sent medvedev . " what i said in the letter was that , obviously , to the extent that we are lessening iran 's commitment to nuclear weapons , then that reduces the pressure for - or the need for a missile-defense system , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exact wording of obama 's letter to medvedev is unclear earlier , medvedev 's spokeswoman natalya timakova confirmed the receipt of a letter , but added that " there were no concrete proposals about any mutually binding decisions . " on sunday , the russia president was quoted as saying that moscow was waiting for new us proposals to resolve the missile dispute . the times ' sources said while the letter did not offer a direct quid pro quo deal , it was intended to give moscow an incentive to join the united states in a common front against iran . " it 's almost saying to them , put up or shut up , " an unnamed senior official told the newspaper .
" it 's not that the russians get to say , ' we 'll try and therefore you have to suspend . '
it says the threat has to go away . " too close to home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bush administration said the facilities were intended to stop iranian missiles russia has been bitterly opposed to the deployment of a us missile system in poland and the czech republic ever since it was proposed by the former us president george w. bush 's administration .
moscow believes the interceptor system is aimed at russia .
bush officials have said it was meant to counter missile threats from states such as iran . medvedev had warned last year that moscow would deploy nuclear-capable iskander missiles to kaliningrad , a russian exclave bordered by lithuania and poland , in response to the plans . there are indications that the missile defense shield will be on the agenda between foreign minister sergey lavrov and us secretary of state hillary clinton when they meet on friday . iranian nuclear program continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is in charge of construction at the bushehr site iran has repeatedly rejected calls by the un security council - of which russia and the united states are permanent members - to halt uranium enrichment , despite the imposition of three sets of sanctions .
the united states and its european allies believe that iran is seeking to develop nuclear weapons , a charge that tehran denies , saying that the program is purely civilian . iran recently began testing its bushehr nuclear plant , a construction project run by russia .
last week , tehran said its first nuclear power station could go on line within months . on monday , clinton reiterated washington 's willingness to engage with iran if it " unclenches its fist . "
this represents a clear switch in policy from the previous us administration , which made talks dependent upon iran halting the enrichment process . russian news agencies cited lavrov as saying that us talks with iran could help to end the international standoff over its nuclear program and boost regional security . jg / sms / nda / afp / dpa / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

wagner , 54 , has repeatedly provoked controversy in recent years .
he described the harry potter novels as " satanism " and implied that natural disasters such as hurricane katrina in 2005 and the 2004 boxing day tsunami in southeast asia were divine punishment for " spiritual pollution . "

all but four of 35 deans present at a meeting of the linz diocese , in northern austria , refused to accept the nomination .
wagner eventually announced that he wanted to withdraw because of the " hefty criticism , " a move welcomed by many church leaders .

wagner , 54 , has repeatedly provoked controversy in recent years .
he described the harry potter novels as " satanism " and implied that natural disasters such as hurricane katrina in 2005 and the 2004 boxing day tsunami in southeast asia were divine punishment for " spiritual pollution . "

all but four of 35 deans present at a meeting of the linz diocese , in northern austria , refused to accept the nomination .
wagner eventually announced that he wanted to withdraw because of the " hefty criticism , " a move welcomed by many church leaders .

european parliamentarians have voted to outlaw these goods , with the exception of traditional inuit hunting .
opponents say the ban may break international trade rules . the european parliament 's internal market committee has voted to strictly ban trading throughout the eu in products derived from seals .
a report approved by the committee on tuesday , march 3 , said the ban would cover seal products , as well as meat , oil , blubber , organs and fur skins . the parliament said in a statement that it had reacted to concerns by non-governmental organizations and public opinion in most member states about seal killings . " a clear majority of citizens across the european union are horrified by the cruel clubbing to death of thousands of seals every year , " said arlene mccarthy , the committee 's chair .
" they do not want these products on sale in the eu and today , the internal market committee has backed citizens ' demands for a ban . " inuit hunting only exception the european commission had proposed several exceptions to the ban , for example when the seals are killed " without causing avoidable pain , distress and any other form of suffering . "
but the committee 's meps chose to limit these by a 27-7 vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inuits will be able to continue their traditions in addition , they ignored the view of the committee 's rapporteur diana wallis , who had proposed a labeling system rather than an outright ban .
she said she believed it would be more effective in assuring the customer that animal welfare norms had been obeyed .
wallis said she doubted whether the ban , based on eu internal market rules , would be compatible with international trade rules . but danish mep christel schaldemose said legal opinions were not central in this case . " in this debate we are not dealing with a legal dilemma but a political one , to which parliament must give a political response , " schaldemose said . in practice , seal products such as bags , hats , boots and gloves used by motorcyclists , skiers and boxers would be outlawed , as would parapharmaceutical products sold as omega 3 fatty acid supplements . however , the committee did vote in favor of a proposed exception for inuit and other aboriginal communities living in greenland , canada , russia and the united states .
this would apply to products derived from traditional subsistence hunting that could be traded for cultural , educational , or ceremonial purposes , the committee said . harmonizing trade rules in the eu the new regulation would lay down common corresponding rules that are directly applicable throughout the eu .
at present , national laws vary , with some countries such as belgium and the netherlands having already banned trade in seal products and others expecting to do so . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seals are often shot or clubbed to death yet nordic eu countries such as denmark , sweden and finland have opposed such a ban .
canada and greenland have warned the eu that they could challenge such a ban before the world trade organization . canadian minister of fisheries and oceans gail shea said her government was " disappointed " by the vote , which would severely impact a major canadian export . " canada has made numerous attempts to set the facts straight about the canadian seal hunt and we have provided ample evidence of the humaneness and sustainability of the hunt , " shea said .
" unfortunately , this evidence is not yet understood in europe . " to become law , the ban still needs the approval of the entire eu assembly and eu governments .

european parliamentarians have voted to outlaw these goods , with the exception of traditional inuit hunting .
opponents say the ban may break international trade rules . the european parliament 's internal market committee has voted to strictly ban trading throughout the eu in products derived from seals .
a report approved by the committee on tuesday , march 3 , said the ban would cover seal products , as well as meat , oil , blubber , organs and fur skins . the parliament said in a statement that it had reacted to concerns by non-governmental organizations and public opinion in most member states about seal killings . " a clear majority of citizens across the european union are horrified by the cruel clubbing to death of thousands of seals every year , " said arlene mccarthy , the committee 's chair .
" they do not want these products on sale in the eu and today , the internal market committee has backed citizens ' demands for a ban . " inuit hunting only exception the european commission had proposed several exceptions to the ban , for example when the seals are killed " without causing avoidable pain , distress and any other form of suffering . "
but the committee 's meps chose to limit these by a 27-7 vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inuits will be able to continue their traditions in addition , they ignored the view of the committee 's rapporteur diana wallis , who had proposed a labeling system rather than an outright ban .
she said she believed it would be more effective in assuring the customer that animal welfare norms had been obeyed .
wallis said she doubted whether the ban , based on eu internal market rules , would be compatible with international trade rules . but danish mep christel schaldemose said legal opinions were not central in this case . " in this debate we are not dealing with a legal dilemma but a political one , to which parliament must give a political response , " schaldemose said . in practice , seal products such as bags , hats , boots and gloves used by motorcyclists , skiers and boxers would be outlawed , as would parapharmaceutical products sold as omega 3 fatty acid supplements . however , the committee did vote in favor of a proposed exception for inuit and other aboriginal communities living in greenland , canada , russia and the united states .
this would apply to products derived from traditional subsistence hunting that could be traded for cultural , educational , or ceremonial purposes , the committee said . harmonizing trade rules in the eu the new regulation would lay down common corresponding rules that are directly applicable throughout the eu .
at present , national laws vary , with some countries such as belgium and the netherlands having already banned trade in seal products and others expecting to do so . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seals are often shot or clubbed to death yet nordic eu countries such as denmark , sweden and finland have opposed such a ban .
canada and greenland have warned the eu that they could challenge such a ban before the world trade organization . canadian minister of fisheries and oceans gail shea said her government was " disappointed " by the vote , which would severely impact a major canadian export . " canada has made numerous attempts to set the facts straight about the canadian seal hunt and we have provided ample evidence of the humaneness and sustainability of the hunt , " shea said .
" unfortunately , this evidence is not yet understood in europe . " to become law , the ban still needs the approval of the entire eu assembly and eu governments .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de regulation -pipe- 03.03.2009 eu parliamentary committee votes to ban seal products großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seals are mainly hunted for their pelts , but also for meat and fat used in beauty products the eu could soon be off limits for seal products .
european parliamentarians have voted to outlaw these goods , with the exception of traditional inuit hunting .
opponents say the ban may break international trade rules . the european parliament 's internal market committee has voted to strictly ban trading throughout the eu in products derived from seals .
a report approved by the committee on tuesday , march 3 , said the ban would cover seal products , as well as meat , oil , blubber , organs and fur skins . the parliament said in a statement that it had reacted to concerns by non-governmental organizations and public opinion in most member states about seal killings . " a clear majority of citizens across the european union are horrified by the cruel clubbing to death of thousands of seals every year , " said arlene mccarthy , the committee 's chair .
" they do not want these products on sale in the eu and today , the internal market committee has backed citizens ' demands for a ban . " inuit hunting only exception the european commission had proposed several exceptions to the ban , for example when the seals are killed " without causing avoidable pain , distress and any other form of suffering . "
but the committee 's meps chose to limit these by a 27-7 vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inuits will be able to continue their traditions in addition , they ignored the view of the committee 's rapporteur diana wallis , who had proposed a labeling system rather than an outright ban .
she said she believed it would be more effective in assuring the customer that animal welfare norms had been obeyed .
wallis said she doubted whether the ban , based on eu internal market rules , would be compatible with international trade rules . but danish mep christel schaldemose said legal opinions were not central in this case . " in this debate we are not dealing with a legal dilemma but a political one , to which parliament must give a political response , " schaldemose said . in practice , seal products such as bags , hats , boots and gloves used by motorcyclists , skiers and boxers would be outlawed , as would parapharmaceutical products sold as omega 3 fatty acid supplements . however , the committee did vote in favor of a proposed exception for inuit and other aboriginal communities living in greenland , canada , russia and the united states .
this would apply to products derived from traditional subsistence hunting that could be traded for cultural , educational , or ceremonial purposes , the committee said . harmonizing trade rules in the eu the new regulation would lay down common corresponding rules that are directly applicable throughout the eu .
at present , national laws vary , with some countries such as belgium and the netherlands having already banned trade in seal products and others expecting to do so . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seals are often shot or clubbed to death yet nordic eu countries such as denmark , sweden and finland have opposed such a ban .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de regulation -pipe- 03.03.2009 eu parliamentary committee votes to ban seal products großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seals are mainly hunted for their pelts , but also for meat and fat used in beauty products the eu could soon be off limits for seal products .
european parliamentarians have voted to outlaw these goods , with the exception of traditional inuit hunting .
opponents say the ban may break international trade rules . the european parliament 's internal market committee has voted to strictly ban trading throughout the eu in products derived from seals .
a report approved by the committee on tuesday , march 3 , said the ban would cover seal products , as well as meat , oil , blubber , organs and fur skins . the parliament said in a statement that it had reacted to concerns by non-governmental organizations and public opinion in most member states about seal killings . " a clear majority of citizens across the european union are horrified by the cruel clubbing to death of thousands of seals every year , " said arlene mccarthy , the committee 's chair .
" they do not want these products on sale in the eu and today , the internal market committee has backed citizens ' demands for a ban . " inuit hunting only exception the european commission had proposed several exceptions to the ban , for example when the seals are killed " without causing avoidable pain , distress and any other form of suffering . "
but the committee 's meps chose to limit these by a 27-7 vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inuits will be able to continue their traditions in addition , they ignored the view of the committee 's rapporteur diana wallis , who had proposed a labeling system rather than an outright ban .
she said she believed it would be more effective in assuring the customer that animal welfare norms had been obeyed .
wallis said she doubted whether the ban , based on eu internal market rules , would be compatible with international trade rules . but danish mep christel schaldemose said legal opinions were not central in this case . " in this debate we are not dealing with a legal dilemma but a political one , to which parliament must give a political response , " schaldemose said . in practice , seal products such as bags , hats , boots and gloves used by motorcyclists , skiers and boxers would be outlawed , as would parapharmaceutical products sold as omega 3 fatty acid supplements . however , the committee did vote in favor of a proposed exception for inuit and other aboriginal communities living in greenland , canada , russia and the united states .
this would apply to products derived from traditional subsistence hunting that could be traded for cultural , educational , or ceremonial purposes , the committee said . harmonizing trade rules in the eu the new regulation would lay down common corresponding rules that are directly applicable throughout the eu .
at present , national laws vary , with some countries such as belgium and the netherlands having already banned trade in seal products and others expecting to do so . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seals are often shot or clubbed to death yet nordic eu countries such as denmark , sweden and finland have opposed such a ban .
canada and greenland have warned the eu that they could challenge such a ban before the world trade organization . canadian minister of fisheries and oceans gail shea said her government was " disappointed " by the vote , which would severely impact a major canadian export . " canada has made numerous attempts to set the facts straight about the canadian seal hunt and we have provided ample evidence of the humaneness and sustainability of the hunt , " shea said .
" unfortunately , this evidence is not yet understood in europe . " to become law , the ban still needs the approval of the entire eu assembly and eu governments .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 03.03.2009 car sales in germany rise in february , but future still cloudy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw is one of the brands that have profitted from consumer incentives government bonuses for people to scrap old cars and buy new ones led to a 21.5 percent boost compared to the previous year .
but this bright figure ca n't conceal that the general outlook for the industry is gloomy . the german association of the automotive industry , or vda , announced on tuesday , march 3 , that a total of 277,800 vehicles had been sold in february . " these are the highest february sales for 10 years , " vda president matthias wissmann said at a press conference on the margins of the international motor show in geneva , switzerland . " new car registrations are back in positive territory for the first time in six months , " wissmann added .
" we expect a rise in new car sales compared with last year over the entire first quarter . " the good numbers have come after the german government offered consumers a bonus of 2,500 euros -lrb- $ 3,150 -rrb- to scrap older vehicles and buy new , more energy-efficient ones . figures have been strongest in the compact-car sector , not a traditional strength of german manufacturers , but wissmann said domestic production was also benefitting . " an initial analysis shows that one in two consumers who scrap their old cars chooses a model made by a german company , " wissmann said , adding that the industry was hoping to break the 3 million mark for new car registrations in 2009 . still , overall , german carmakers ' - in particular mercedes and bmw 's - share of their own domestic market declined .
fears abound that true recovery for the industry is still a long way off . sales abroad plummet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more cars at the scrapyards mean - temporarily at least - more new-car buyers as good as the domestic numbers were , figures for german car exports were down dramatically , falling by more than 50 percent in february to just over 200,000 vehicles .
production was also cut back by 47 percent . " despite the positive domestic numbers for february , we 're far from a sustained recovery on the world-wide markets , " wissmann said . in france , new car registrations were down by over 13 percent , despite similar governmental consumer incentives .
drops in spain and japan were 48.8 and 32.4 percent respectively . german carmakers hope their export figures will improve as economic stimulus measures taken by foreign countries begin to kick in .
the industry also pointed out that , while sales abroad are down drastically , german-made cars have made slight gains in market share in countries from china to the united states . " it shows the strength of german brands that they could increase their share of strategically important markets under the most difficult of conditions , " wissmann said . so for german carmakers , the proverbial glass is both half-full and half-empty .
if stimulus packages worldwide begin to work , the german automotive industry could start to rebound as early as the end of 2009 . but if foreign markets stay sluggish , then the premium for scrapping old cars wo n't be bridge between recession and recovers , but rather a one-off boost with few long-term effects . jc / sms / afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yet europe 's largest automaker warned it will not sell as many cars in 2009 as it did last year . germany 's vw announced that it is well-positioned to weather the current crisis in the auto sector , although the car company said it expects a slowdown in 2009 .
volkswagen has not given up on its aim to overtake japanese rival toyota by 2018 to become the world 's leading auto manufacturer .
audi , vw 's high-end line , said monday that it has its sights set on overtaking domestic rivals bmw and mercedes in europe during the next year despite the market slump .

the carmaker has 24 models which emit less that 120 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer , which meets a strict european union target planned for 2012 .
vw also recently announced it plans to become the first manufacturer of an affordable , mass-produced electric car .
vw will develop electric drive units together with japanese electronics group toshiba .
besides green technology , vw also hopes that strong sales in china will keep up profits .

they have now passed the buck on to their finance counterparts . the european union is unable to set an exact figure on the aid it is willing to give developing nations in exchange for support of a global climate change pact , said czech environment minister martin bursik . it was " too early " for the 27-nation bloc " to put money on the table , " said bursik , whose country currently holds the eu presidency . " we were not quite able to reach consensus on the financing mechanism , " eu environment commissioner stavros dimas told reporters . the eu environment ministers met in brussels on monday , march 2 , to discuss the bloc 's negotiating position at talks for the un-sponsored climate change talks in copenhagen in december . " it makes no sense to say now how much the eu is willing to transfer , " germany 's environment minister sigmar gabriel said .
" we will negotiate that in copenhagen .
we are creeping towards a number . " usa plays a key role bursik said the eu still wanted to find out the united states ' mid-term targets , how much money the us would spend and whether washington would adopt a cap-and-trade system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time is running out to thwart global warming , experts say he said the eu presidency was confident that us president barack obama " will follow the leadership of the european union " by setting ambitious mid-term goals for cutting greenhouse gases . " we know that the us wants to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent by 2050 , -lrb- but -rrb- we do n't know what their mid-term target is , " bursik said . the eu and the us are considered the major donors that could get lesser developed nations involved in a new global drive to cut carbon dioxide emissions .
the eu has committed to reducing emissions by 30 percent of 1990 levels by 2020 if other developed countries commit to comparable cuts .
it has already put in place the measures to cut its own emissions by 20 percent . european environment ministers said they see obama as a great boost for finding a successor to the kyoto protocol in copenhagen .
his predecessor george w. bush refused to ratify the treaty . bursik and dimas said they would visit washington on march 14-15 to find out more about the intentions of the us administration .
according to bursik climate change would be one of the first things european union leaders discuss with obama when he visits prague for an eu-us summit in early april . passing on the " hot potato " joris den blanken , the eu climate and energy policy director for environmental group greenpeace , criticized that the issue has now been put on the agenda at the eu finance ministers meeting on march 10 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : efficient , clean sources of energy are required around the globe " environment ministers have ducked and passed the climate funding hot potato to finance ministers , " blanken said in a statement .
" while billions of taxpayers ' money is being used to prop up failed banks and carmakers , not one eurocent is being pledged to help the developing world tackle a problem that europeans helped create . " according to greenpeace , eu leaders should support a market-linked scheme where countries are asked to pay for part of their emissions . " the eu must contribute its fair share to poorer countries , " blanken said .
" the clock is ticking , global climate talks in copenhagen are less than 300 days away , and we still have little more than words on the table . " an eu report states that global investment to fight climate change will need to rise to some 175 billion euros -lrb- $ 220 billion -rrb- per year by 2020 .
over 90 billion euros of that sum must be spent in developing countries , the report said . greenpeace and other ngos have said the european union should be contributing around 35 billion euros by 2020 to overall assistance by industrialized countries to help developing nations deal with the effects of climate change . the issue is also on the agenda when the eu 's 27 heads of state and government come together for their next summit on march 19-20 . sac / sms / afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

wagner , 54 , has repeatedly provoked controversy in recent years .
he described the harry potter novels as " satanism " and implied that natural disasters such as hurricane katrina in 2005 and the 2004 boxing day tsunami in southeast asia were divine punishment for " spiritual pollution . "
following his appointment at the end of january austrian bishops accused the pope of ignoring established procedures for the selection and examination of candidates for preferment .
all but four of 35 deans present at a meeting of the linz diocese , in northern austria , refused to accept the nomination .
wagner eventually announced that he wanted to withdraw because of the " hefty criticism , " a move welcomed by many church leaders .
the storm came as the vatican was already under fire for lifting the excommunication of richard williamson , one of four bishops in a conservative breakaway faction of the catholic church , who denied that six million jews were gassed by the nazis during world war ii . nda / afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but swimming welshman david davies has been busy since then writing a very short autobiography about his life so far .
he is now back in the pool , amassing up to 80,000 metres a week in training for rome 's world championships and , of course , london 2012 .
davies , who will still be only 28 , then intends to bow out of competitive swimming .
he says he ca n't imagine " topping " competing in his home olympics .
at beijing davies picked up the silver medal in the 10km open water swim , coming home just 1.5 seconds behind dutchman maarten van der weijden , at the end of a gruelling swim of more than 1 hour 50 minutes .
he had already won an olympic bronze at athens four years before so the dream of picking up the gold at the uk games " would be the ultimate , " said davies .
so he is now back in the pool at loughborough where he is based pounding the lengths for up to 30 hours a week and swimming between 75,000 and 80,000m .
it is a demanding regime and not for the faint-hearted , but olympian davies has his sights set firmly on trying to win that elusive gold for his medals cabinet .
he said he may swim both 1500m and the 10km at london in front of the home crowds .
" but if it makes sense to drop one to make the other better , then i will because i wo n't have any more opportunities , " he said .
either way , he insists that he will bow out of swimming in 2012 , because " it wo n't get any better than that at home " .
davies is from barry in the vale of glamorgan and a very keen supporter of everything welsh .
so he was very keen to get involved with writing in at the deep end from barry to beijing when he was asked .
the biography charts his early years up to the open top post olympic victory parades in london and cardiff bay .
it is part of a joint venture project between basic skills cymru and the welsh books council to promote adult literacy , something which davies said he was keen to endorse .
davies said : " i had a nice long break after beijing and was able to spend some time doing the writing before i got back into the pool in october .
" if i can inspire any one to the kind of success i 've had , that 's a great thing .
" i would definitely like to do more -lrb- writing -rrb- if there 's enough interesting stuff about me to write . "
and when his career in the pool is over , davies has not decided what he will do .
he is looking at all the options .
" i will have to get a career , maybe joining the police , maybe helping with things like this -lrb- ie book writing -rrb- , " said the swimmer .
he is as he said " keeping his options open " but whatever he will be doing , the ardent cardiff city and wales fan is sure he will be based in his homeland which he comes back to now most weekends .
who knows , he may even end up appearing in gavin and stacey .
the swimmer has , as he says , " got the accent for it " and famously did a radio audition with nessa -lrb- ruth jones -rrb- during last year 's olympics for a part in the next series of the bbc comedy set in his home town .
but he said : " i 'm still waiting for that call " .

but swimming welshman david davies has been busy since then writing a very short autobiography about his life so far .
he is now back in the pool , amassing up to 80,000 metres a week in training for rome 's world championships and , of course , london 2012 .
davies , who will still be only 28 , then intends to bow out of competitive swimming .
he says he ca n't imagine " topping " competing in his home olympics .
at beijing davies picked up the silver medal in the 10km open water swim , coming home just 1.5 seconds behind dutchman maarten van der weijden , at the end of a gruelling swim of more than 1 hour 50 minutes .
he had already won an olympic bronze at athens four years before so the dream of picking up the gold at the uk games " would be the ultimate , " said davies .
so he is now back in the pool at loughborough where he is based pounding the lengths for up to 30 hours a week and swimming between 75,000 and 80,000m .
davies took 1500m freestyle bronze at the athens olympics it is a demanding regime and not for the faint-hearted , but olympian davies has his sights set firmly on trying to win that elusive gold for his medals cabinet .
he said he may swim both 1500m and the 10km at london in front of the home crowds .
" but if it makes sense to drop one to make the other better , then i will because i wo n't have any more opportunities , " he said .
either way , he insists that he will bow out of swimming in 2012 , because " it wo n't get any better than that at home " .
davies is from barry in the vale of glamorgan and a very keen supporter of everything welsh .
so he was very keen to get involved with writing in at the deep end from barry to beijing when he was asked .
the biography charts his early years up to the open top post olympic victory parades in london and cardiff bay .
the book is one in a series encouraging adult literacy it is part of a joint venture project between basic skills cymru and the welsh books council to promote adult literacy , something which davies said he was keen to endorse .
davies said : " i had a nice long break after beijing and was able to spend some time doing the writing before i got back into the pool in october .
" if i can inspire any one to the kind of success i 've had , that 's a great thing .
" i would definitely like to do more -lrb- writing -rrb- if there 's enough interesting stuff about me to write . "
and when his career in the pool is over , davies has not decided what he will do .
he is looking at all the options .
" i will have to get a career , maybe joining the police , maybe helping with things like this -lrb- ie book writing -rrb- , " said the swimmer .
he is as he said " keeping his options open " but whatever he will be doing , the ardent cardiff city and wales fan is sure he will be based in his homeland which he comes back to now most weekends .
who knows , he may even end up appearing in gavin and stacey .
the swimmer has , as he says , " got the accent for it " and famously did a radio audition with nessa -lrb- ruth jones -rrb- during last year 's olympics for a part in the next series of the bbc comedy set in his home town .
but he said : " i 'm still waiting for that call " .

it also punishes what it calls " preparatory acts " of these crimes , and the theft of state secrets .
rights watchdogs have criticised the ambiguous , catch-all language of the law .
democrat legislators have said the law in macau is intended by china to set an example for less pliant hong kong .
the chinese government says the law is to fulfil article 23 of the basic law governing the return of the former portuguese colony of macau and former british colony of hong kong to chinese sovereignty .
it provides for sentences of up to 30 years for political crimes .
the state security law will never be a good law because it can be used to repress political enemies macau legislator antonio ng kuok-cheong its passage in macau met with broad public acceptance in the territory , a special administrative region -lrb- sar -rrb- of china .
in neighbouring hong kong , earlier chinese government efforts to pass the law prompted huge protests in 2003 .
democratic legislators in macau and hong kong agree the significance of the law 's easy passage in macau lies in the example it sets for hong kong .
grey areas when the bill was passed last week macau 's secretary for administration and justice , florinda da rosa silva chan , said the authorities would work to strike a balance between protecting national security and safeguarding residents ' rights .
but critics are not convinced .
" the state security law will never be a good law because it can be used to repress political enemies , " said macau legislator antonio ng kuok-cheong , one of two members of macau 's 29-member legislative assembly to vote against the bill last week .
" there are some grey areas where the police could abuse their authority , " he told the bbc , as the law came into effect .
small protests marked preparations for macau 's new security law mr ng said there was no code to define what are " preparatory acts " of treason , secession or subversion , and while such cases might not result in prosecutions , the loose wording could be used to detain and harass political opponents .
he said macau 's local government already had more than enough means at its disposal to control society .
" so why do we need this law in macau ?
the intention of china is to make macau an example to hong kong , " he said .
hong kong fears " i agree the law in macau is to set an example for hong kong - but it 's not a good example , " said law yuk-kai , director of the hong kong human rights monitor .
he pinpointed the low threshold for political activity , freedom of speech and assembly in the security law .
" lots of activities could be caught up in that , from demonstrations to simply making any political demand , " he noted , adding the law offered ambiguous wording and few safeguards .
civic party lawmaker margaret ng ngoi-yee said it was a sad day for hong kong .
" inevitably , there will be greater pressure to revive article 23 in hong kong , " she said .
macau 's immigration authorities have recently outraged hong kong sensibilities by refusing entry to a photographer from a local newspaper , as well as to several pro-democracy politicians .

it also punishes what it calls " preparatory acts " of these crimes , and the theft of state secrets .
rights watchdogs have criticised the ambiguous , catch-all language of the law .
democrat legislators have said the law in macau is intended by china to set an example for less pliant hong kong .
the chinese government says the law is to fulfil article 23 of the basic law governing the return of the former portuguese colony of macau and former british colony of hong kong to chinese sovereignty .
it provides for sentences of up to 30 years for political crimes .
the state security law will never be a good law because it can be used to repress political enemies macau legislator antonio ng kuok-cheong its passage in macau met with broad public acceptance in the territory , a special administrative region -lrb- sar -rrb- of china .
in neighbouring hong kong , earlier chinese government efforts to pass the law prompted huge protests in 2003 .
democratic legislators in macau and hong kong agree the significance of the law 's easy passage in macau lies in the example it sets for hong kong .
grey areas when the bill was passed last week macau 's secretary for administration and justice , florinda da rosa silva chan , said the authorities would work to strike a balance between protecting national security and safeguarding residents ' rights .
but critics are not convinced .
" the state security law will never be a good law because it can be used to repress political enemies , " said macau legislator antonio ng kuok-cheong , one of two members of macau 's 29-member legislative assembly to vote against the bill last week .
" there are some grey areas where the police could abuse their authority , " he told the bbc , as the law came into effect .
small protests marked preparations for macau 's new security law mr ng said there was no code to define what are " preparatory acts " of treason , secession or subversion , and while such cases might not result in prosecutions , the loose wording could be used to detain and harass political opponents .
he said macau 's local government already had more than enough means at its disposal to control society .
" so why do we need this law in macau ?
the intention of china is to make macau an example to hong kong , " he said .
hong kong fears " i agree the law in macau is to set an example for hong kong - but it 's not a good example , " said law yuk-kai , director of the hong kong human rights monitor .
he pinpointed the low threshold for political activity , freedom of speech and assembly in the security law .
" lots of activities could be caught up in that , from demonstrations to simply making any political demand , " he noted , adding the law offered ambiguous wording and few safeguards .
civic party lawmaker margaret ng ngoi-yee said it was a sad day for hong kong .
" inevitably , there will be greater pressure to revive article 23 in hong kong , " she said .
macau 's immigration authorities have recently outraged hong kong sensibilities by refusing entry to a photographer from a local newspaper , as well as to several pro-democracy politicians .
