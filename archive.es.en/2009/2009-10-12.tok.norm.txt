but how does the team measure up to the world 's top national teams ?
deutsche welle 's jefferson chase takes a closer look . the one moment that best symbolizes the 1-0 win over moscow that qualified germany for the 2010 world cup in south africa was directly after the lone goal was scored .
striker miroslav klose celebrated with one of his trademark forward flips - and only narrowly avoided landing on his backside .
match reports in german newspapers , perhaps understandably , were full of superlatives about germany 's gutsy away win .
but that 1-0 victory was of the knife-edge variety , unlike germany 's 1-0 loss to spain in the 2008 european championships , the last time coach joachim loew had a chance to win a title .
so have germany improved enough to draw level with the spaniards or brazil ?
or are they more on a par with other large european nations like england , the netherlands and italy .
here 's a back-to-front run-through of the strengths and weaknesses of the german squad .
defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adler could become the next in a long line of stellar german national keepers the one position about which loew has absolutely no worries is goal .
24-year-old rene adler was the key to germany 's victory , making a number of world-class saves , and seems to have sealed his position as germany 's number one .
the young keeper 's most brilliant moment in moscow came in the 73rd minute , when russian midfielder igor semshov was clear on the right side and slotted a crisp pass in the direction of two teammates waiting in front of goal .
adler not only got a hand to the ball but cleverly deflected it over the end line .
and should adler get hurt , loew can call on robert enke , manuel neuer or even tim wiese who 've all proved their worth at the international level .
left back philipp lahm is arguably the best in the world at his position so his selection is a no-brainer .
interior defenders per mertesacker and heiko westermann provide a solid anchor in the back four .
youngster serdar tasci could also play a role .
the big question is right back .
jerome boateng , who made his national-team debut in russia , showed he was capable of provided some welcome offensive pressure .
but the 21-year-old also got himself sent off with a red card .
loew 's task will be to get the youngster enough experience in friendlies between now and next june that he no longer poses a risk .
otherwise , he 'll be forced to fall back on arne friedrich , who 's been mediocre at best when wearing the german kit .
defensive midfield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack is a force in midfield but germany could use a threat like russia 's andrei arshavin though not the force he once was german captain michael ballack is the lynchpin of the german squad .
the 33-year-old not only wins lots of challenges but is responsible for the opening passes for germany 's offense .
to cover ballack 's back when he presses forward , simon rolfes is a good choice .
and thomas hitzlsperger is also a more offensive option because of his ability to blast in shots from long-range .
if ballack were to go down to injury , though , germany would be in trouble .
ballack is to germany what gennaro gattuso has been to italy , and loew needs to plan , as best he can , for the eventuality that his captain is unavailable .
the problem is that no one currently on the squad or on the radar screen has the ability to fill the stopper-meets-playmaker role ballack occupies .
offensive midfield and wingers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is counting on youngsters like jerome boateng , marko marin and mesut oezil the emergence of mesut oezil represents the biggest improvement of germany 's likely 2010 squad over the 2008 edition .
the 20-year-old displayed both his pace and his eye for his teammates in setting up the lone goal in moscow that punched germany 's world cup ticket .
but after that , the quality tails off .
bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski are active but relatively inefficient players who 've never lived up their potential .
it will be interesting to see whether youngster marko marin , oezil 's equally fleet-footed teammate at werder bremen , can break into the germany 's starting eleven .
but even if he does , a comparison with the world 's top teams suggests that germany 's offensive midfield is a relative weakness .
spain are spoiled for choice with xabi alonso , xavi , fabregas , iniesta and senna .
brazil , too , can chose from nearly a dozen top-quality midfielders , including kaka , whose skills and creativity are far superior to any member of the german squad .
thus , as the squad stands , germany may find it difficult to come back if they go behind early in matches - something that most teams need to do if they want to take a major international title .
bildunterschrift : klose showed his age in executing his celebratory front flip - he landed on his backside , not his feet the center forward this position is one of the biggest question marks in the team .
if the russia match is anything to go by , loew could likely rely on a 4-3-3 formation for much of the tournament in south africa .
that essentially means the battle to fill the lone central forward slot is between miroslav klose and mario gomez , the same pair of players contesting the same position at their mutual club bayern munich .
for now klose , who will be 32 years old next summer , gets the nod because he , in contrast to gomez , has been effective for the national squad in the past .
but he 's clearly lost a bit of athleticism , so in his heart of hearts , loew might well prefer the 24-year-old gomez .
loew choice will probably be influenced by how much playing time the two strikers get at bayern munich .
however that situation turns out , though , what loew does n't have is a center forward who can create goal opportunities for himself a la wayne rooney for england or thierry henry for france .
that means that germany could have trouble against other defensively oriented teams like italy .
as one of the best teams at the back in the world , germany could certainly fly high in south africa , and no nation will relish facing them .
but their creative deficiencies at the front also mean that loew 's men , if they face tough opponents early on , could end up smack on their backsides .

can it escape the oil curse and become an example to other developing states ? in many ways ghana serves as a model among african countries .
compared to many other west african nations it has been very stable in recent years .
ghana 's peaceful election last year and the successful transition of government from one party to another this year were considered the pinnacle of the country 's progress , which was highlighted by us president barack obama 's visit to accra this summer .
but after the recent announcement by oil giant exxonmobil that it was buying a four billion-dollar stake in ghana 's jubilee oil field , the country is now facing a task that may be even more challenging than the democratic reform process it has undergone : to prove that it can not only successfully deal with a powerful multinational , but also that the windfall that is generated by what is considered to be one of africa 's biggest oil fields does n't end up in the pockets of a few insiders , but improves the wealth and well-being of ghana 's society .
" the stakes are very high , " writes ian gary , an expert in extractive industries , in a report about ghana 's oil find and its consequences for society for the international aid agency oxfam .
" while many ghanaian government officials are confident they can meet the challenge , oil 's threat to democratic development should not be underestimated . "
high stakes , big profits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exxonmobil 's bid beat out other oil giants while the stakes are high , so is the profit .
according to an estimate by the international monetary fund which is cited by gary , ghana 's government can expect revenues from oil and gas up to 20 billion dollars during the production period between 2012 and 2030 for the jubilee field alone .
so what are ghana 's chances to avoid the spell of the so-called oil curse ? " i think that ghana could really be one country which could be a positive example to the world and it could also be profitable and beneficial for the country , " claudia kemfert , an energy specialist at berlin 's economic research institute diw , tells deutsche welle .
" ghana could really profit from this deal and also from the oil market . "
what 's required , adds kemfert , is that ghana 's government puts in place a good political strategy on how it wants to use the oil revenues .
talking to deutsche welle , ulrike bickel , an energy expert with germany 's catholic relief agency misereor , is more skeptical : " we obviously see the danger that ghana could also become a victim of the oil curse , that its oil wealth wo n't benefit the people and that oil revenues just like in neighboring countries , vanish instead of being spent on health , education or sustainable social development . " while bickel points out that ghana , a country without previous experience in the oil sector , has taken positive steps such as signing on to the so-called extractive industries transparency initiative , which mandates its members to openly document the flow of revenues , she adds that it is still far too early to tell whether it will be implemented .
bildunterschrift : president obama 's visit , with ghana president john atta mills highlighted the country 's progress negative example an example that positive declarations and good intentions do n't necessarily translate into enforceable action is chad .
" before the world bank agreed to a large loan for the chad-cameroon pipeline there was an agreement that a fund for future generations would be created and that up to 70 percent of the oil revenues would be used for priority social sector developments , " says bickel .
" but as soon as the oil revenue started to flow , chad 's government , which was fighting a civil war , dissolved the fund for future generations and extended the priority sector developments to include national security .
that means the oil revenue is used to buy large quantities of weapons . " that does n't mean that agreements and declarations are n't useful .
they definitely are .
but reality eventually is the ultimate test whether those agreements are fulfilled .
ghana , say the analysts , among developing african nations , is perhaps best prepared to manage its oil wealth carefully . as oxfam expert gary wrote in his report on ghana : " oil wealth tends to erode democratic accountability .
ghana 's challenge will be to ensure that the right institutions and transparent policies are in place before oil production starts . "
currently oil production at the jubilee field is scheduled for 2010 . author : michael knigge editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the new power-sharing government of northern ireland , a landmark accord between the protestant conservative , pro-british dup and catholic socialist republicans sinn fein , agreed in principle on the transfer of responsibility from the united kingdom to northern ireland , however , differences over the details of the devolution process led to discord between the parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in march 2009 , two british soldiers died in an attack on military barracks near antrim sinn fein and the dup have been in conflict over when powers for policing should be devolved from london , the former insisting it should have happened already and the latter choosing caution and saying it will only assent to devolution with an adequate financial package in place and broad community confidence . inla lays down arms for peace the peace process , started in 1998 by the good friday agreement , ended three decades of conflict in northern ireland , in which roughly 3,500 people were killed .
its full implementation , rather than squabbling over its fine points , is vital to peaceful governance in northern ireland as stressed by clinton .
clinton 's visit comes as the irish national liberation army -lrb- inla -rrb- , a republican paramilitary group infamous for its violent crimes during northern ireland 's troubles , has signaled it 's prepared to lay down arms .
it has renounced its armed struggle , releasing a statement saying , " following a process of serious debate ... it has concluded that the armed struggle is over .

leonid ivlev , a member of the central elections commission , told reporters that the ruling party had garnered almost 80 percent of seats up for grabs in the 75 regional and local elections held up and down the country on sunday .
ivlev said putin 's party picked up 107 of the 135 regional seats and 189 of the 235 seats available in municipal legislatures .
they also emerged victorious in the eagerly-watched race for moscow 's city legislature .
with 99 percent of votes in , the ria-novosti news agency reported a 66 percent win for united russia .

yabloko , which failed to reach the 7 percent hurdle in moscow 's local election , has condemned the 17-year-reign of mayor yury luzhkov , accusing him of carrying out " one of the all-time election frauds in russia 's recent history . "
on sunday , while the ballot boxes were still open , yabloko said it had received a " storm of calls " from the moscow electorate , complaining that they were unable to cast their vote because someone else had already done so using their name .
" united russia used so-called carousel voting , " said yabloko spokesman sergey mitrohin .
" this time , it was busloads of soldiers and police that they took from one polling station to another and had them cast their votes for united russia over and over .
we also have serious reason to believe that the ballot boxes were stuffed with additional ballots . "

leonid ivlev , a member of the central elections commission , told reporters that the ruling party had garnered almost 80 percent of seats up for grabs in the 75 regional and local elections held up and down the country on sunday .
ivlev said putin 's party picked up 107 of the 135 regional seats and 189 of the 235 seats available in municipal legislatures .
they also emerged victorious in the eagerly-watched race for moscow 's city legislature .
with 99 percent of votes in , the ria-novosti news agency reported a 66 percent win for united russia .
praise from the president the opposition communists were the only rivals to score any seats in the high-profile ballot , which only managed to attract a 35 percent voter turnout .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president dmitry medvedev praised the results in comments on the united russia party website , president dmitry medvedev told his country , which has been particularly hard hit by the economic downturn , that they had voted for the right party .
" only together can we surmount the hardships of the financial crisis , " he wrote , " and the vote obtained by united russia demonstrates that we are together and this is most important . "
he went on to say that the 30 million-strong electorate clearly knew what it wanted .
" taking account that elections in the capital are practically federal ones , we can state that in the crisis situation voters have demonstrated they stay together with the ruling party . "
claims of fraud but the liberal yabloko party , which came away from the vote completely empty-handed , has made claims of systematic vote rigging .
yabloko , which failed to reach the 7 percent hurdle in moscow 's local election , has condemned the 17-year-reign of mayor yury luzhkov , accusing him of carrying out " one of the all-time election frauds in russia 's recent history . "
on sunday , while the ballot boxes were still open , yabloko said it had received a " storm of calls " from the moscow electorate , complaining that they were unable to cast their vote because someone else had already done so using their name .
" united russia used so-called carousel voting , " said yabloko spokesman sergey mitrohin .
" this time , it was busloads of soldiers and police that they took from one polling station to another and had them cast their votes for united russia over and over .
we also have serious reason to believe that the ballot boxes were stuffed with additional ballots . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition parties say they will contest moscow 's municipal ballot yabloko and communist party representatives have already said they will contest the results of the municipal poll in court .
" we can not recognize these elections or consider them normal , " communist party deputy chairman vladimir kashin told ria-novosti .
the independent election watchdog golog has come out behind the opposition parties , and has said it will provide proof of fraud . earlier , head of the watchdog , liliya shibanova , lamented the lack of political competition in russia .

can it escape the oil curse and become an example to other developing states ? in many ways ghana serves as a model among african countries .
compared to many other west african nations it has been very stable in recent years .
ghana 's peaceful election last year and the successful transition of government from one party to another this year were considered the pinnacle of the country 's progress , which was highlighted by us president barack obama 's visit to accra this summer .
but after the recent announcement by oil giant exxonmobil that it was buying a four billion-dollar stake in ghana 's jubilee oil field , the country is now facing a task that may be even more challenging than the democratic reform process it has undergone : to prove that it can not only successfully deal with a powerful multinational , but also that the windfall that is generated by what is considered to be one of africa 's biggest oil fields does n't end up in the pockets of a few insiders , but improves the wealth and well-being of ghana 's society .
" the stakes are very high , " writes ian gary , an expert in extractive industries , in a report about ghana 's oil find and its consequences for society for the international aid agency oxfam .
" while many ghanaian government officials are confident they can meet the challenge , oil 's threat to democratic development should not be underestimated . "
high stakes , big profits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exxonmobil 's bid beat out other oil giants while the stakes are high , so is the profit .
according to an estimate by the international monetary fund which is cited by gary , ghana 's government can expect revenues from oil and gas up to 20 billion dollars during the production period between 2012 and 2030 for the jubilee field alone .
so what are ghana 's chances to avoid the spell of the so-called oil curse ? " i think that ghana could really be one country which could be a positive example to the world and it could also be profitable and beneficial for the country , " claudia kemfert , an energy specialist at berlin 's economic research institute diw , tells deutsche welle .
" ghana could really profit from this deal and also from the oil market . "
what 's required , adds kemfert , is that ghana 's government puts in place a good political strategy on how it wants to use the oil revenues .
talking to deutsche welle , ulrike bickel , an energy expert with germany 's catholic relief agency misereor , is more skeptical : " we obviously see the danger that ghana could also become a victim of the oil curse , that its oil wealth wo n't benefit the people and that oil revenues just like in neighboring countries , vanish instead of being spent on health , education or sustainable social development . " while bickel points out that ghana , a country without previous experience in the oil sector , has taken positive steps such as signing on to the so-called extractive industries transparency initiative , which mandates its members to openly document the flow of revenues , she adds that it is still far too early to tell whether it will be implemented .
bildunterschrift : president obama 's visit , with ghana president john atta mills highlighted the country 's progress negative example an example that positive declarations and good intentions do n't necessarily translate into enforceable action is chad .
" before the world bank agreed to a large loan for the chad-cameroon pipeline there was an agreement that a fund for future generations would be created and that up to 70 percent of the oil revenues would be used for priority social sector developments , " says bickel .
" but as soon as the oil revenue started to flow , chad 's government , which was fighting a civil war , dissolved the fund for future generations and extended the priority sector developments to include national security .
that means the oil revenue is used to buy large quantities of weapons . " that does n't mean that agreements and declarations are n't useful .
they definitely are .
but reality eventually is the ultimate test whether those agreements are fulfilled .
ghana , say the analysts , among developing african nations , is perhaps best prepared to manage its oil wealth carefully . as oxfam expert gary wrote in his report on ghana : " oil wealth tends to erode democratic accountability .
ghana 's challenge will be to ensure that the right institutions and transparent policies are in place before oil production starts . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 12.10.2009 germans criticize czech demand for lisbon treaty opt-out großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vaclav klaus wants a guarantee that czech property remains such with poland 's signature on the lisbon treaty in the bag , there is just one left to collect .
but that is easier said than done , as the president of the czech republic appears at pains to demonstrate . euroskeptic czech president vaclav klaus chose his moment well .
just hours before poland became a signatory to the much-talked about european treaty , he managed to keep the union 's eyes on him by saying he would not add his name to the pact until he was satisfied it will not destabilize national property rights .
klaus is concerned that the european charter of fundamental rights , part of the lisbon treaty , could allow the three million germans expelled from czechoslovakia at the end of the second world war to reclaim property confiscated from them at the time .
the issue came up after the fall of communism , but the czech courts have thrown out claims brought forth by expellees , and klaus is clearly prepared to go to great lengths to prevent an upsetting of that particular apple cart .
but in so doing , he is attracting much negative attention , and winning no eu popularity contests .
although relations between germany and the czech republic - which border one another - are essentially quite good , klaus 's latest demands have met with criticism in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech president vaclav klaus says he wo n't take no for an answer christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- member and parliamentary secretary for defense , christian schmidt , told the dpa news agency that it was unnecessary to play the german expellees card and that there is already a european convention of human rights .
" everything that concerns the lisbon treaty has been negotiated , " schmidt said .
" to come now , shortly before the end game with new demands , leads to the impression that he only wants to delay . "

but that is easier said than done , as the president of the czech republic appears at pains to demonstrate . euroskeptic czech president vaclav klaus chose his moment well .
just hours before poland became a signatory to the much-talked about european treaty , he managed to keep the union 's eyes on him by saying he would not add his name to the pact until he was satisfied it will not destabilize national property rights .
klaus is concerned that the european charter of fundamental rights , part of the lisbon treaty , could allow the three million germans expelled from czechoslovakia at the end of the second world war to reclaim property confiscated from them at the time .
the issue came up after the fall of communism , but the czech courts have thrown out claims brought forth by expellees , and klaus is clearly prepared to go to great lengths to prevent an upsetting of that particular apple cart .
but in so doing , he is attracting much negative attention , and winning no eu popularity contests .
although relations between germany and the czech republic - which border one another - are essentially quite good , klaus 's latest demands have met with criticism in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech president vaclav klaus says he wo n't take no for an answer christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- member and parliamentary secretary for defense , christian schmidt , told the dpa news agency that it was unnecessary to play the german expellees card and that there is already a european convention of human rights .
" everything that concerns the lisbon treaty has been negotiated , " schmidt said .
" to come now , shortly before the end game with new demands , leads to the impression that he only wants to delay . "

the weapons were sent in 2006 and were intended for local police and army personnel . arms dealers in the region told german public radio that hundreds of german weapons were for sale carrying a price tag of over 680 euros a piece -lrb- $ 1,000 -rrb- .
in 2006 , the german defense ministry shipped 10,000 old walther-p1 pistols to the afghan interior ministry to equip afghan police and army .
however , both the german government and the responsible us-led security team in afghanistan reportedly failed to properly monitor the guns ' whereabouts .
the us unit said that it only had detailed records of 4,563 pistols out of a total 10,000 . current and former afghan soldiers and police officers are said to be among those illegally selling and trafficking the pistols , some of which have ended up in pakistan 's north-west border provinces and neighboring tribal areas .

can it escape the oil curse and become an example to other developing states ? in many ways ghana serves as a model among african countries .
compared to many other west african nations it has been very stable in recent years .
ghana 's peaceful election last year and the successful transition of government from one party to another this year were considered the pinnacle of the country 's progress , which was highlighted by us president barack obama 's visit to accra this summer .
but after the recent announcement by oil giant exxonmobil that it was buying a four billion-dollar stake in ghana 's jubilee oil field , the country is now facing a task that may be even more challenging than the democratic reform process it has undergone : to prove that it can not only successfully deal with a powerful multinational , but also that the windfall that is generated by what is considered to be one of africa 's biggest oil fields does n't end up in the pockets of a few insiders , but improves the wealth and well-being of ghana 's society .
" the stakes are very high , " writes ian gary , an expert in extractive industries , in a report about ghana 's oil find and its consequences for society for the international aid agency oxfam .
" while many ghanaian government officials are confident they can meet the challenge , oil 's threat to democratic development should not be underestimated . "
high stakes , big profits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exxonmobil 's bid beat out other oil giants while the stakes are high , so is the profit .
according to an estimate by the international monetary fund which is cited by gary , ghana 's government can expect revenues from oil and gas up to 20 billion dollars during the production period between 2012 and 2030 for the jubilee field alone .
so what are ghana 's chances to avoid the spell of the so-called oil curse ? " i think that ghana could really be one country which could be a positive example to the world and it could also be profitable and beneficial for the country , " claudia kemfert , an energy specialist at berlin 's economic research institute diw , tells deutsche welle .
" ghana could really profit from this deal and also from the oil market . "
what 's required , adds kemfert , is that ghana 's government puts in place a good political strategy on how it wants to use the oil revenues .
talking to deutsche welle , ulrike bickel , an energy expert with germany 's catholic relief agency misereor , is more skeptical : " we obviously see the danger that ghana could also become a victim of the oil curse , that its oil wealth wo n't benefit the people and that oil revenues just like in neighboring countries , vanish instead of being spent on health , education or sustainable social development . " while bickel points out that ghana , a country without previous experience in the oil sector , has taken positive steps such as signing on to the so-called extractive industries transparency initiative , which mandates its members to openly document the flow of revenues , she adds that it is still far too early to tell whether it will be implemented .
bildunterschrift : president obama 's visit , with ghana president john atta mills highlighted the country 's progress negative example an example that positive declarations and good intentions do n't necessarily translate into enforceable action is chad .
" before the world bank agreed to a large loan for the chad-cameroon pipeline there was an agreement that a fund for future generations would be created and that up to 70 percent of the oil revenues would be used for priority social sector developments , " says bickel .
" but as soon as the oil revenue started to flow , chad 's government , which was fighting a civil war , dissolved the fund for future generations and extended the priority sector developments to include national security .
that means the oil revenue is used to buy large quantities of weapons . " that does n't mean that agreements and declarations are n't useful .
they definitely are .
but reality eventually is the ultimate test whether those agreements are fulfilled .
ghana , say the analysts , among developing african nations , is perhaps best prepared to manage its oil wealth carefully . as oxfam expert gary wrote in his report on ghana : " oil wealth tends to erode democratic accountability .
ghana 's challenge will be to ensure that the right institutions and transparent policies are in place before oil production starts . "
currently oil production at the jubilee field is scheduled for 2010 . author : michael knigge editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

larsson , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , said that although the pandemic has n't hurt the european population as much as feared , it still makes sense to be vaccinated .
" experts have told us that the pandemic will continue for some years , " larsson said .
" if you protect yourself , that will be protection not just for the current situation and the nearest months , but the nearest years . "
the emergence of swine flu in april led to widespread public fears , but since then , two new vaccines have been developed and concerns have abated .
but the eu wants to play it safe , and that means seeing to it that as many people as possible are vaccinated , thereby diminishing the likelihood that the disease will ever get a real grip on the population .
help further afield in that vein , larsson said she and her fellow health ministers would also debate whether it made sense to share their vaccine supplies with developing nations outside the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : handkerchiefs are not the kind of protection the eu is talking about also on monday , the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- announced that some 100 developing countries were in line to receive international donations of swine flu vaccines .
marie-paule kieny , who runs the who 's vaccine research unit , said the director general would approve a list of countries later in the day and hoped to start getting supplies to their recipients very soon .
" we are trying to have the first deliveries in november , " she said , adding that the vaccines will largely go to low income countries and will target some two percent of their population over the next four to five months. tkw / ap / afp / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 12.10.2009 german military guns reportedly sold illegally on afghan , pakistan black market großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guns sent to afghanistan for police and army have ended up on the black market german military pistols are being sold on the black market in afghanistan and pakistan .
the weapons were sent in 2006 and were intended for local police and army personnel . arms dealers in the region told german public radio that hundreds of german weapons were for sale carrying a price tag of over 680 euros a piece -lrb- $ 1,000 -rrb- .
in 2006 , the german defense ministry shipped 10,000 old walther-p1 pistols to the afghan interior ministry to equip afghan police and army .
however , both the german government and the responsible us-led security team in afghanistan reportedly failed to properly monitor the guns ' whereabouts .
the us unit said that it only had detailed records of 4,563 pistols out of a total 10,000 . current and former afghan soldiers and police officers are said to be among those illegally selling and trafficking the pistols , some of which have ended up in pakistan 's north-west border provinces and neighboring tribal areas .
the german guns were also being traded in northern afghanistan where german soldiers are stationed .
the team of ndr radio reporters who discovered the black market guns said it 's not clear exactly how they ended up there .
" apparently , most of these pistols have n't been stolen , but were simply taken home and sold by former police officers and soldiers after they 'd left the service , " said christoph heinzle , who headed the ndr team .
" but corruption and theft can not be ruled out because neither the afghan authorities nor the us and german armed forces carry out effective controls to prevent -lsb- theft -rsb- . "
greens , police union call for investigation the 2006 delivery was carried out despite a german government principle that german weapons could not be supplied to non-nato countries .
germany 's then coalition government of social democrats and greens made an exception , but the decision reportedly only reached parliament after the weapons had already arrived in afghanistan .
the fresh allegations have prompted calls for an investigation by germany 's green party and the police trade union .
green party spokesman winfried nachtwei accused the grand coalition government , which was in power when the guns were shipped , of a " grossly negligent course of action , " and called for the matter to be investigated in the interest of german security forces and civilian experts sent to afghanistan .
" it would be truly absurd if soldiers were threatened by weapons irresponsibly delivered by germany , " nachtwei said .
joerg radek of the police union said the danger was that " such weapons could fall into the wrong hands .
it is a risk for the germans deployed there , a risk to security in the country . "
defense ministry spokesman thomas raabe told reporters in berlin on monday that officials in kabul had guaranteed the weapons would only be distributed among security forces .
he said the ministry would be investigating any unlawful sales of the guns .

the weapons were sent in 2006 and were intended for local police and army personnel . arms dealers in the region told german public radio that hundreds of german weapons were for sale carrying a price tag of over 680 euros a piece -lrb- $ 1,000 -rrb- .
in 2006 , the german defense ministry shipped 10,000 old walther-p1 pistols to the afghan interior ministry to equip afghan police and army .
however , both the german government and the responsible us-led security team in afghanistan reportedly failed to properly monitor the guns ' whereabouts .
the us unit said that it only had detailed records of 4,563 pistols out of a total 10,000 . current and former afghan soldiers and police officers are said to be among those illegally selling and trafficking the pistols , some of which have ended up in pakistan 's north-west border provinces and neighboring tribal areas .
the german guns were also being traded in northern afghanistan where german soldiers are stationed .
the team of ndr radio reporters who discovered the black market guns said it 's not clear exactly how they ended up there .
" apparently , most of these pistols have n't been stolen , but were simply taken home and sold by former police officers and soldiers after they 'd left the service , " said christoph heinzle , who headed the ndr team .
" but corruption and theft can not be ruled out because neither the afghan authorities nor the us and german armed forces carry out effective controls to prevent -lsb- theft -rsb- . "
greens , police union call for investigation the 2006 delivery was carried out despite a german government principle that german weapons could not be supplied to non-nato countries .
germany 's then coalition government of social democrats and greens made an exception , but the decision reportedly only reached parliament after the weapons had already arrived in afghanistan .
the fresh allegations have prompted calls for an investigation by germany 's green party and the police trade union .

the deal also received heavy criticism from azerbaijan over unsolved armenian-azeri territorial disputes . even though the ink has dried on the protocols signed by the foreign ministers of turkey and armenia , there is no guarantee that the parties will or can make the agreements a reality .
indeed , turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan was first out of the gate with a cautionary note .
" we want all the borders to be opened at the same time ... , but as long as armenia has not withdrawn from azerbaijani territory that it is occupying , turkey can not have a positive attitude on this subject , " said erdogan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nagorno-karabakh dispute puts the deal at risk in the late 1980 's , as the soviet union was dissolving , violence broke out in the ethnic armenian enclave of nagorno-karabakh within azerbaijan 's internationally recognized borders .
in 1993 a war broke out when armenia sent in troops to support the ethnic armenians and they drove azeri troops from seven districts next to nagorno-karabakh .
they have remained there ever since .
azerbaijan condemns accord in support of the turkic speaking azeris , turkey closed its border with armenia when armenia went into azerbaijan .
hence ankara 's insistence that armenia pull out of azerbaijan before the protocols can be ratified in the turkish parliament .
in azerbaijan , the foreign ministry issued a statement saying that the accords should not have been signed while nagorno-karabakh is still occupied .
" the normalization of relations between turkey and armenia before the withdrawal of armenian troops from occupied azeri territory is in direct contradiction to the national interests of azerbaijan , " said the statement .
by all accounts , the signing was an historic event .
nearly a year in the making , discretely abetted by the swiss .
however , the signing ceremony for the protocols that pledge to establish diplomatic relations , open borders and to set up an historic commission to investigate armenian deaths in world war i , almost fell through when the parties disagreed over some of the wording in the statements to be delivered at the end of the signing ceremony .
protests around the world the agreement between the two countries has sparked widespread controversy .
some 10,000 people marched in the armenian capital yerevan to protest the agreement .

larsson , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , said that although the pandemic has n't hurt the european population as much as feared , it still makes sense to be vaccinated .

but a group of german and scottish poets who have translated it found out just how similar europeans are . from landlocked farms in the franconia region of bavaria to fishing villages on the coast of scotland or the shetland islands , regional dialects throughout consolidated and globalized europe are something of an endangered cultural resource . the task of preserving them goes in part to dialect poets , including two germans and two scots who have been involved in a project to translate regional verse . last year they held a workshop in fife , scotland , where they communicated through oral translators and were provided with literal " gloss " translations in both languages of each other 's poems .
today , they say the experience has had a lasting effect on how they view their poetry . ties to the land the sentiments of dialect poems are often expressed through rustic and geographically-bound language .
while franconian poets often work with imagery and idiomatic expressions based on a life of farming , the scots poets do so with a life of fishing in mind .
in some instances , this makes literal translation impossible and forces the poets to search for comparable literary devices . isabel cole organized the workshop and edits a berlin-based journal of german literature in english translation called " no man 's land . "
she said dialect is less accepted in germany as a form of literary expression than it is in scotland . " i think if people are open-minded about literature , dialects or non-standard literature , it is a real enrichment , " said cole .
" that 's something i actually miss in standard german literature .
one thing i like about germany is how many dialects there are , and how people cultivate their dialects .
they have really different ways of expressing themselves . " bildunterschrift : fishing is an integral part of local scottish culture the personal element fitzgerald kusz , a franconian poet from nuremberg , said that in translating scots poems he was surprised to discover traces of that dialect 's germanic roots .
kusz has spoken franconian since childhood and regards his dialect as an intimate and comfortable form of communication . " on one hand , globalization continues strengthen its hold , " he said , " high german , the unified language , can be heard on television in every village .
but there is , in fact , a movement among the people to keep their languages alive . " and that is one primary goal of dialect literature , he added . one of kusz ' scots counterparts , alexander hutchison , said " a shift into the dialect makes things much more personal … for me it 's just a different instrument . " although hutchison , who lives in glasgow , is not optimistic about current attempts to cultivate dialect in scotland 's schools , he said that in poetry the scots dialect is every bit as viable a form of self-expression as standard english . " if people do n't understand the dialect , they ca n't connect , " he said .
" but if they do understand it , then there 's an immediacy - a personal element - that you can not get in the parent language .
there 's just as much possibility of a lack in the parent language as there is in the dialect .
they operate in different dimensions to me . " the flip-side of globalization franconian poet helmut haberkamm , who grew up in a farming village not far from erlangen , told deutsche welle in an email interview that franconian is " deeply and unmistakably connected to my childhood and the early emotions and experiences which formed me , predetermined parts of my life , and arranged my existence . " franconian is inextricably dissolved in my person .
it is my language of emotion and intimacy , " he added . haberkamm has translated the works of shetlandic poet robert alan jamieson .
although the environments of sheltand and franconia vary greatly , haberkamm said he found striking similarities in the way nature is woven into the lives and languages of both regions . in translating jamieson 's poems , he said he wanted " to bring out the simple , gripping way these people express themselves . " haberkamm described regionalism as the " necessary flip-side of globalization , " adding that " people without an understanding of their roots and concrete values are easily manipulated . " endangered by mobility although hutchison expressed similar sentiments while speaking about his desire to preserve scots and see it flourish , he compared the dialect to a " threatened habitat , " endangered by time and changing patterns of human behavior .
having lived for years in north america , hutchison said he understands the pressures modern existence exerts on local cultures . " people move around , people move off , people do n't stay in one place long enough to develop it , " he said .

" logicomix : an epic search for truth " follows british philosopher , logician and pacifist bertrand russell -lrb- 1872-1970 -rrb- in his tortuous quest for the foundations of mathematics , and his search for logic as a shield from the insanity that consumed other members of his family . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " logicomix " tracks the foundation of mathematics the story uses his relationships with the great thinkers and mathematicians of the era , two of his four marriages and historical events in europe such as the rise of nazism as a backdrop for the novel 's more abstract and philosophical subject matter . unexpected success originally published in greek in the fall of 2008 , " logicomix " was a hit at home .
but its authors were unprepared for the reception in the united states and britain , where it sold out on the first day of its release in september . the novel received positive reviews from such publications as the guardian and the new york times , which described the story as presented " with real graphic verve " and " delightful simplicity . " it sped up bestseller lists to occupy top 10 spots in comics , fiction and general book rankings on both amazon.com and amazon.co.uk.
it also recently hit no. 1 on the new york times paperback graphic book list . " i think the publishers -lrb- bloomsbury -rrb- were shocked , " apostolos doxiadis , who co-authored the story with computer science professor christos papadimitriou at the university of california , berkeley , told afp news agency .
" i was shocked too . " bertrand " not a mega-nerd " in searching for a narrator who would fit the novel 's context , doxiadis said bertrand russell was " ideal . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russell was n't a mega-nerd , said doxiadis born into a liberal aristocratic english family and the grandson of a former british prime minister , russell is considered one of the 20th century 's most important philosophers . he was an early advocate of sexual freedom , he was jailed for pacifism during world war i and later campaigned against nuclear proliferation and the vietnam war . " he was a political activist , a womanizer , traveler , adventurer , great talker , a wit and a dandy , " doxiadis told afp .
" he was the only one of these characters who was not a mega-nerd . " the long journey to print from initial discussions between the creators to scripting , drawing , inking and coloring , the novel 's completion took seven years - which the author called " a super-marathon . " like many other cartoon books , the album was pieced together like a movie with wall-to-wall story boards and doxiadis , who has a film-making background , acted out the characters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doxiadis was n't deterred by the unusual theme the aim of " logicomix " is " to tell a fascinating story about the history of ideas , " said doxiadis , who published a novel in 2001 entitled " uncle petros and goldbach 's conjecture " about a boy 's quest for knowledge about his reclusive mathematician uncle . " the fact that this idea looked like , to put it mildly , not a very likely idea for a comic book , never deterred me , " he said .
" in ' logicomix , ' the story i think is in some ways emblematic of much of what happened in the 20th century , with its search for certainty , for knowledge , and what often went with it , for power over life .

but a group of german and scottish poets who have translated it found out just how similar europeans are . from landlocked farms in the franconia region of bavaria to fishing villages on the coast of scotland or the shetland islands , regional dialects throughout consolidated and globalized europe are something of an endangered cultural resource . the task of preserving them goes in part to dialect poets , including two germans and two scots who have been involved in a project to translate regional verse . last year they held a workshop in fife , scotland , where they communicated through oral translators and were provided with literal " gloss " translations in both languages of each other 's poems .
today , they say the experience has had a lasting effect on how they view their poetry . ties to the land the sentiments of dialect poems are often expressed through rustic and geographically-bound language .
while franconian poets often work with imagery and idiomatic expressions based on a life of farming , the scots poets do so with a life of fishing in mind .
in some instances , this makes literal translation impossible and forces the poets to search for comparable literary devices . isabel cole organized the workshop and edits a berlin-based journal of german literature in english translation called " no man 's land . "
she said dialect is less accepted in germany as a form of literary expression than it is in scotland . " i think if people are open-minded about literature , dialects or non-standard literature , it is a real enrichment , " said cole .
" that 's something i actually miss in standard german literature .
one thing i like about germany is how many dialects there are , and how people cultivate their dialects .

kusz has spoken franconian since childhood and regards his dialect as an intimate and comfortable form of communication . " on one hand , globalization continues strengthen its hold , " he said , " high german , the unified language , can be heard on television in every village .
but there is , in fact , a movement among the people to keep their languages alive . " and that is one primary goal of dialect literature , he added . one of kusz ' scots counterparts , alexander hutchison , said " a shift into the dialect makes things much more personal … for me it 's just a different instrument . " although hutchison , who lives in glasgow , is not optimistic about current attempts to cultivate dialect in scotland 's schools , he said that in poetry the scots dialect is every bit as viable a form of self-expression as standard english . " if people do n't understand the dialect , they ca n't connect , " he said .
" but if they do understand it , then there 's an immediacy - a personal element - that you can not get in the parent language .
there 's just as much possibility of a lack in the parent language as there is in the dialect .
they operate in different dimensions to me . " the flip-side of globalization franconian poet helmut haberkamm , who grew up in a farming village not far from erlangen , told deutsche welle in an email interview that franconian is " deeply and unmistakably connected to my childhood and the early emotions and experiences which formed me , predetermined parts of my life , and arranged my existence . " franconian is inextricably dissolved in my person .
it is my language of emotion and intimacy , " he added . haberkamm has translated the works of shetlandic poet robert alan jamieson .
although the environments of sheltand and franconia vary greatly , haberkamm said he found striking similarities in the way nature is woven into the lives and languages of both regions . in translating jamieson 's poems , he said he wanted " to bring out the simple , gripping way these people express themselves .

but a group of german and scottish poets who have translated it found out just how similar europeans are . from landlocked farms in the franconia region of bavaria to fishing villages on the coast of scotland or the shetland islands , regional dialects throughout consolidated and globalized europe are something of an endangered cultural resource . the task of preserving them goes in part to dialect poets , including two germans and two scots who have been involved in a project to translate regional verse . last year they held a workshop in fife , scotland , where they communicated through oral translators and were provided with literal " gloss " translations in both languages of each other 's poems .
today , they say the experience has had a lasting effect on how they view their poetry . ties to the land the sentiments of dialect poems are often expressed through rustic and geographically-bound language .
while franconian poets often work with imagery and idiomatic expressions based on a life of farming , the scots poets do so with a life of fishing in mind .
in some instances , this makes literal translation impossible and forces the poets to search for comparable literary devices . isabel cole organized the workshop and edits a berlin-based journal of german literature in english translation called " no man 's land . "
she said dialect is less accepted in germany as a form of literary expression than it is in scotland . " i think if people are open-minded about literature , dialects or non-standard literature , it is a real enrichment , " said cole .
" that 's something i actually miss in standard german literature .
one thing i like about germany is how many dialects there are , and how people cultivate their dialects .
they have really different ways of expressing themselves . " bildunterschrift : fishing is an integral part of local scottish culture the personal element fitzgerald kusz , a franconian poet from nuremberg , said that in translating scots poems he was surprised to discover traces of that dialect 's germanic roots .
kusz has spoken franconian since childhood and regards his dialect as an intimate and comfortable form of communication . " on one hand , globalization continues strengthen its hold , " he said , " high german , the unified language , can be heard on television in every village .
but there is , in fact , a movement among the people to keep their languages alive . " and that is one primary goal of dialect literature , he added . one of kusz ' scots counterparts , alexander hutchison , said " a shift into the dialect makes things much more personal … for me it 's just a different instrument . " although hutchison , who lives in glasgow , is not optimistic about current attempts to cultivate dialect in scotland 's schools , he said that in poetry the scots dialect is every bit as viable a form of self-expression as standard english . " if people do n't understand the dialect , they ca n't connect , " he said .
" but if they do understand it , then there 's an immediacy - a personal element - that you can not get in the parent language .
there 's just as much possibility of a lack in the parent language as there is in the dialect .
they operate in different dimensions to me . " the flip-side of globalization franconian poet helmut haberkamm , who grew up in a farming village not far from erlangen , told deutsche welle in an email interview that franconian is " deeply and unmistakably connected to my childhood and the early emotions and experiences which formed me , predetermined parts of my life , and arranged my existence . " franconian is inextricably dissolved in my person .
it is my language of emotion and intimacy , " he added . haberkamm has translated the works of shetlandic poet robert alan jamieson .
although the environments of sheltand and franconia vary greatly , haberkamm said he found striking similarities in the way nature is woven into the lives and languages of both regions . in translating jamieson 's poems , he said he wanted " to bring out the simple , gripping way these people express themselves . " haberkamm described regionalism as the " necessary flip-side of globalization , " adding that " people without an understanding of their roots and concrete values are easily manipulated . " endangered by mobility although hutchison expressed similar sentiments while speaking about his desire to preserve scots and see it flourish , he compared the dialect to a " threatened habitat , " endangered by time and changing patterns of human behavior .
having lived for years in north america , hutchison said he understands the pressures modern existence exerts on local cultures . " people move around , people move off , people do n't stay in one place long enough to develop it , " he said .
" there are new dialects springing up all the time .
if there 's enough settled community , they 'll find a language . " i 'm always wary of standardization , of people trying to impose things .

can it escape the oil curse and become an example to other developing states ? in many ways ghana serves as a model among african countries .
compared to many other west african nations it has been very stable in recent years .
ghana 's peaceful election last year and the successful transition of government from one party to another this year were considered the pinnacle of the country 's progress , which was highlighted by us president barack obama 's visit to accra this summer .
but after the recent announcement by oil giant exxonmobil that it was buying a four billion-dollar stake in ghana 's jubilee oil field , the country is now facing a task that may be even more challenging than the democratic reform process it has undergone : to prove that it can not only successfully deal with a powerful multinational , but also that the windfall that is generated by what is considered to be one of africa 's biggest oil fields does n't end up in the pockets of a few insiders , but improves the wealth and well-being of ghana 's society .
" the stakes are very high , " writes ian gary , an expert in extractive industries , in a report about ghana 's oil find and its consequences for society for the international aid agency oxfam .
" while many ghanaian government officials are confident they can meet the challenge , oil 's threat to democratic development should not be underestimated . "
high stakes , big profits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exxonmobil 's bid beat out other oil giants while the stakes are high , so is the profit .
according to an estimate by the international monetary fund which is cited by gary , ghana 's government can expect revenues from oil and gas up to 20 billion dollars during the production period between 2012 and 2030 for the jubilee field alone .
so what are ghana 's chances to avoid the spell of the so-called oil curse ? " i think that ghana could really be one country which could be a positive example to the world and it could also be profitable and beneficial for the country , " claudia kemfert , an energy specialist at berlin 's economic research institute diw , tells deutsche welle .
" ghana could really profit from this deal and also from the oil market . "
what 's required , adds kemfert , is that ghana 's government puts in place a good political strategy on how it wants to use the oil revenues .
talking to deutsche welle , ulrike bickel , an energy expert with germany 's catholic relief agency misereor , is more skeptical : " we obviously see the danger that ghana could also become a victim of the oil curse , that its oil wealth wo n't benefit the people and that oil revenues just like in neighboring countries , vanish instead of being spent on health , education or sustainable social development . " while bickel points out that ghana , a country without previous experience in the oil sector , has taken positive steps such as signing on to the so-called extractive industries transparency initiative , which mandates its members to openly document the flow of revenues , she adds that it is still far too early to tell whether it will be implemented .
bildunterschrift : president obama 's visit , with ghana president john atta mills highlighted the country 's progress negative example an example that positive declarations and good intentions do n't necessarily translate into enforceable action is chad .
" before the world bank agreed to a large loan for the chad-cameroon pipeline there was an agreement that a fund for future generations would be created and that up to 70 percent of the oil revenues would be used for priority social sector developments , " says bickel .
" but as soon as the oil revenue started to flow , chad 's government , which was fighting a civil war , dissolved the fund for future generations and extended the priority sector developments to include national security .
that means the oil revenue is used to buy large quantities of weapons . " that does n't mean that agreements and declarations are n't useful .
they definitely are .
but reality eventually is the ultimate test whether those agreements are fulfilled .
ghana , say the analysts , among developing african nations , is perhaps best prepared to manage its oil wealth carefully . as oxfam expert gary wrote in his report on ghana : " oil wealth tends to erode democratic accountability .
ghana 's challenge will be to ensure that the right institutions and transparent policies are in place before oil production starts . "
currently oil production at the jubilee field is scheduled for 2010 . author : michael knigge editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

larsson , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , said that although the pandemic has n't hurt the european population as much as feared , it still makes sense to be vaccinated .
" experts have told us that the pandemic will continue for some years , " larsson said .
" if you protect yourself , that will be protection not just for the current situation and the nearest months , but the nearest years . "
the emergence of swine flu in april led to widespread public fears , but since then , two new vaccines have been developed and concerns have abated .
but the eu wants to play it safe , and that means seeing to it that as many people as possible are vaccinated , thereby diminishing the likelihood that the disease will ever get a real grip on the population .
help further afield in that vein , larsson said she and her fellow health ministers would also debate whether it made sense to share their vaccine supplies with developing nations outside the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : handkerchiefs are not the kind of protection the eu is talking about also on monday , the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- announced that some 100 developing countries were in line to receive international donations of swine flu vaccines .
marie-paule kieny , who runs the who 's vaccine research unit , said the director general would approve a list of countries later in the day and hoped to start getting supplies to their recipients very soon .
" we are trying to have the first deliveries in november , " she said , adding that the vaccines will largely go to low income countries and will target some two percent of their population over the next four to five months. tkw / ap / afp / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

talking to deutsche welle , ulrike bickel , an energy expert with germany 's catholic relief agency misereor , is more skeptical : " we obviously see the danger that ghana could also become a victim of the oil curse , that its oil wealth wo n't benefit the people and that oil revenues just like in neighboring countries , vanish instead of being spent on health , education or sustainable social development . " while bickel points out that ghana , a country without previous experience in the oil sector , has taken positive steps such as signing on to the so-called extractive industries transparency initiative , which mandates its members to openly document the flow of revenues , she adds that it is still far too early to tell whether it will be implemented .
bildunterschrift : president obama 's visit , with ghana president john atta mills highlighted the country 's progress negative example an example that positive declarations and good intentions do n't necessarily translate into enforceable action is chad .
" before the world bank agreed to a large loan for the chad-cameroon pipeline there was an agreement that a fund for future generations would be created and that up to 70 percent of the oil revenues would be used for priority social sector developments , " says bickel .
" but as soon as the oil revenue started to flow , chad 's government , which was fighting a civil war , dissolved the fund for future generations and extended the priority sector developments to include national security .
that means the oil revenue is used to buy large quantities of weapons . " that does n't mean that agreements and declarations are n't useful .
they definitely are .
but reality eventually is the ultimate test whether those agreements are fulfilled .
ghana , say the analysts , among developing african nations , is perhaps best prepared to manage its oil wealth carefully . as oxfam expert gary wrote in his report on ghana : " oil wealth tends to erode democratic accountability .
ghana 's challenge will be to ensure that the right institutions and transparent policies are in place before oil production starts . "
currently oil production at the jubilee field is scheduled for 2010 . author : michael knigge editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 12.10.2009 germany needs to improve to become a world cup favorite großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany got the result they needed when it counted germany got the job done in a relative easy group and qualified for the world cup .
but how does the team measure up to the world 's top national teams ?
deutsche welle 's jefferson chase takes a closer look . the one moment that best symbolizes the 1-0 win over moscow that qualified germany for the 2010 world cup in south africa was directly after the lone goal was scored .
striker miroslav klose celebrated with one of his trademark forward flips - and only narrowly avoided landing on his backside .
match reports in german newspapers , perhaps understandably , were full of superlatives about germany 's gutsy away win .
but that 1-0 victory was of the knife-edge variety , unlike germany 's 1-0 loss to spain in the 2008 european championships , the last time coach joachim loew had a chance to win a title .
so have germany improved enough to draw level with the spaniards or brazil ?
or are they more on a par with other large european nations like england , the netherlands and italy .
here 's a back-to-front run-through of the strengths and weaknesses of the german squad .
defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adler could become the next in a long line of stellar german national keepers the one position about which loew has absolutely no worries is goal .
24-year-old rene adler was the key to germany 's victory , making a number of world-class saves , and seems to have sealed his position as germany 's number one .
the young keeper 's most brilliant moment in moscow came in the 73rd minute , when russian midfielder igor semshov was clear on the right side and slotted a crisp pass in the direction of two teammates waiting in front of goal .
adler not only got a hand to the ball but cleverly deflected it over the end line .
and should adler get hurt , loew can call on robert enke , manuel neuer or even tim wiese who 've all proved their worth at the international level .
left back philipp lahm is arguably the best in the world at his position so his selection is a no-brainer .
interior defenders per mertesacker and heiko westermann provide a solid anchor in the back four .
youngster serdar tasci could also play a role .
the big question is right back .
jerome boateng , who made his national-team debut in russia , showed he was capable of provided some welcome offensive pressure .
but the 21-year-old also got himself sent off with a red card .
loew 's task will be to get the youngster enough experience in friendlies between now and next june that he no longer poses a risk .
otherwise , he 'll be forced to fall back on arne friedrich , who 's been mediocre at best when wearing the german kit .
defensive midfield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack is a force in midfield but germany could use a threat like russia 's andrei arshavin though not the force he once was german captain michael ballack is the lynchpin of the german squad .
the 33-year-old not only wins lots of challenges but is responsible for the opening passes for germany 's offense .
to cover ballack 's back when he presses forward , simon rolfes is a good choice .
and thomas hitzlsperger is also a more offensive option because of his ability to blast in shots from long-range .
if ballack were to go down to injury , though , germany would be in trouble .
ballack is to germany what gennaro gattuso has been to italy , and loew needs to plan , as best he can , for the eventuality that his captain is unavailable .
the problem is that no one currently on the squad or on the radar screen has the ability to fill the stopper-meets-playmaker role ballack occupies .
offensive midfield and wingers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is counting on youngsters like jerome boateng , marko marin and mesut oezil the emergence of mesut oezil represents the biggest improvement of germany 's likely 2010 squad over the 2008 edition .
the 20-year-old displayed both his pace and his eye for his teammates in setting up the lone goal in moscow that punched germany 's world cup ticket .
but after that , the quality tails off .
bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski are active but relatively inefficient players who 've never lived up their potential .
it will be interesting to see whether youngster marko marin , oezil 's equally fleet-footed teammate at werder bremen , can break into the germany 's starting eleven .
but even if he does , a comparison with the world 's top teams suggests that germany 's offensive midfield is a relative weakness .
spain are spoiled for choice with xabi alonso , xavi , fabregas , iniesta and senna .
brazil , too , can chose from nearly a dozen top-quality midfielders , including kaka , whose skills and creativity are far superior to any member of the german squad .
thus , as the squad stands , germany may find it difficult to come back if they go behind early in matches - something that most teams need to do if they want to take a major international title .
bildunterschrift : klose showed his age in executing his celebratory front flip - he landed on his backside , not his feet the center forward this position is one of the biggest question marks in the team .
if the russia match is anything to go by , loew could likely rely on a 4-3-3 formation for much of the tournament in south africa .
that essentially means the battle to fill the lone central forward slot is between miroslav klose and mario gomez , the same pair of players contesting the same position at their mutual club bayern munich .
for now klose , who will be 32 years old next summer , gets the nod because he , in contrast to gomez , has been effective for the national squad in the past .
but he 's clearly lost a bit of athleticism , so in his heart of hearts , loew might well prefer the 24-year-old gomez .
loew choice will probably be influenced by how much playing time the two strikers get at bayern munich .
however that situation turns out , though , what loew does n't have is a center forward who can create goal opportunities for himself a la wayne rooney for england or thierry henry for france .
that means that germany could have trouble against other defensively oriented teams like italy .
as one of the best teams at the back in the world , germany could certainly fly high in south africa , and no nation will relish facing them .
but their creative deficiencies at the front also mean that loew 's men , if they face tough opponents early on , could end up smack on their backsides .

but how does the team measure up to the world 's top national teams ?
deutsche welle 's jefferson chase takes a closer look . the one moment that best symbolizes the 1-0 win over moscow that qualified germany for the 2010 world cup in south africa was directly after the lone goal was scored .
striker miroslav klose celebrated with one of his trademark forward flips - and only narrowly avoided landing on his backside .
match reports in german newspapers , perhaps understandably , were full of superlatives about germany 's gutsy away win .
but that 1-0 victory was of the knife-edge variety , unlike germany 's 1-0 loss to spain in the 2008 european championships , the last time coach joachim loew had a chance to win a title .
so have germany improved enough to draw level with the spaniards or brazil ?
or are they more on a par with other large european nations like england , the netherlands and italy .
here 's a back-to-front run-through of the strengths and weaknesses of the german squad .
defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adler could become the next in a long line of stellar german national keepers the one position about which loew has absolutely no worries is goal .
24-year-old rene adler was the key to germany 's victory , making a number of world-class saves , and seems to have sealed his position as germany 's number one .
the young keeper 's most brilliant moment in moscow came in the 73rd minute , when russian midfielder igor semshov was clear on the right side and slotted a crisp pass in the direction of two teammates waiting in front of goal .
adler not only got a hand to the ball but cleverly deflected it over the end line .
and should adler get hurt , loew can call on robert enke , manuel neuer or even tim wiese who 've all proved their worth at the international level .
left back philipp lahm is arguably the best in the world at his position so his selection is a no-brainer .
interior defenders per mertesacker and heiko westermann provide a solid anchor in the back four .
youngster serdar tasci could also play a role .
the big question is right back .
jerome boateng , who made his national-team debut in russia , showed he was capable of provided some welcome offensive pressure .
but the 21-year-old also got himself sent off with a red card .
loew 's task will be to get the youngster enough experience in friendlies between now and next june that he no longer poses a risk .
otherwise , he 'll be forced to fall back on arne friedrich , who 's been mediocre at best when wearing the german kit .
defensive midfield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack is a force in midfield but germany could use a threat like russia 's andrei arshavin though not the force he once was german captain michael ballack is the lynchpin of the german squad .
the 33-year-old not only wins lots of challenges but is responsible for the opening passes for germany 's offense .
to cover ballack 's back when he presses forward , simon rolfes is a good choice .
and thomas hitzlsperger is also a more offensive option because of his ability to blast in shots from long-range .
if ballack were to go down to injury , though , germany would be in trouble .
ballack is to germany what gennaro gattuso has been to italy , and loew needs to plan , as best he can , for the eventuality that his captain is unavailable .
the problem is that no one currently on the squad or on the radar screen has the ability to fill the stopper-meets-playmaker role ballack occupies .
offensive midfield and wingers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is counting on youngsters like jerome boateng , marko marin and mesut oezil the emergence of mesut oezil represents the biggest improvement of germany 's likely 2010 squad over the 2008 edition .
the 20-year-old displayed both his pace and his eye for his teammates in setting up the lone goal in moscow that punched germany 's world cup ticket .
but after that , the quality tails off .
bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski are active but relatively inefficient players who 've never lived up their potential .
it will be interesting to see whether youngster marko marin , oezil 's equally fleet-footed teammate at werder bremen , can break into the germany 's starting eleven .
but even if he does , a comparison with the world 's top teams suggests that germany 's offensive midfield is a relative weakness .
spain are spoiled for choice with xabi alonso , xavi , fabregas , iniesta and senna .
brazil , too , can chose from nearly a dozen top-quality midfielders , including kaka , whose skills and creativity are far superior to any member of the german squad .
thus , as the squad stands , germany may find it difficult to come back if they go behind early in matches - something that most teams need to do if they want to take a major international title .
bildunterschrift : klose showed his age in executing his celebratory front flip - he landed on his backside , not his feet the center forward this position is one of the biggest question marks in the team .
if the russia match is anything to go by , loew could likely rely on a 4-3-3 formation for much of the tournament in south africa .
that essentially means the battle to fill the lone central forward slot is between miroslav klose and mario gomez , the same pair of players contesting the same position at their mutual club bayern munich .
for now klose , who will be 32 years old next summer , gets the nod because he , in contrast to gomez , has been effective for the national squad in the past .
but he 's clearly lost a bit of athleticism , so in his heart of hearts , loew might well prefer the 24-year-old gomez .
loew choice will probably be influenced by how much playing time the two strikers get at bayern munich .
however that situation turns out , though , what loew does n't have is a center forward who can create goal opportunities for himself a la wayne rooney for england or thierry henry for france .
that means that germany could have trouble against other defensively oriented teams like italy .
as one of the best teams at the back in the world , germany could certainly fly high in south africa , and no nation will relish facing them .
but their creative deficiencies at the front also mean that loew 's men , if they face tough opponents early on , could end up smack on their backsides .

and should adler get hurt , loew can call on robert enke , manuel neuer or even tim wiese who 've all proved their worth at the international level .
left back philipp lahm is arguably the best in the world at his position so his selection is a no-brainer .
interior defenders per mertesacker and heiko westermann provide a solid anchor in the back four .
youngster serdar tasci could also play a role .
the big question is right back .
jerome boateng , who made his national-team debut in russia , showed he was capable of provided some welcome offensive pressure .
but the 21-year-old also got himself sent off with a red card .
loew 's task will be to get the youngster enough experience in friendlies between now and next june that he no longer poses a risk .
otherwise , he 'll be forced to fall back on arne friedrich , who 's been mediocre at best when wearing the german kit .
defensive midfield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack is a force in midfield but germany could use a threat like russia 's andrei arshavin though not the force he once was german captain michael ballack is the lynchpin of the german squad .
the 33-year-old not only wins lots of challenges but is responsible for the opening passes for germany 's offense .
to cover ballack 's back when he presses forward , simon rolfes is a good choice .
and thomas hitzlsperger is also a more offensive option because of his ability to blast in shots from long-range .
if ballack were to go down to injury , though , germany would be in trouble .
ballack is to germany what gennaro gattuso has been to italy , and loew needs to plan , as best he can , for the eventuality that his captain is unavailable .
the problem is that no one currently on the squad or on the radar screen has the ability to fill the stopper-meets-playmaker role ballack occupies .
offensive midfield and wingers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is counting on youngsters like jerome boateng , marko marin and mesut oezil the emergence of mesut oezil represents the biggest improvement of germany 's likely 2010 squad over the 2008 edition .
the 20-year-old displayed both his pace and his eye for his teammates in setting up the lone goal in moscow that punched germany 's world cup ticket .
but after that , the quality tails off .
bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski are active but relatively inefficient players who 've never lived up their potential .
it will be interesting to see whether youngster marko marin , oezil 's equally fleet-footed teammate at werder bremen , can break into the germany 's starting eleven .
but even if he does , a comparison with the world 's top teams suggests that germany 's offensive midfield is a relative weakness .
spain are spoiled for choice with xabi alonso , xavi , fabregas , iniesta and senna .
brazil , too , can chose from nearly a dozen top-quality midfielders , including kaka , whose skills and creativity are far superior to any member of the german squad .
thus , as the squad stands , germany may find it difficult to come back if they go behind early in matches - something that most teams need to do if they want to take a major international title .
bildunterschrift : klose showed his age in executing his celebratory front flip - he landed on his backside , not his feet the center forward this position is one of the biggest question marks in the team .
if the russia match is anything to go by , loew could likely rely on a 4-3-3 formation for much of the tournament in south africa .
that essentially means the battle to fill the lone central forward slot is between miroslav klose and mario gomez , the same pair of players contesting the same position at their mutual club bayern munich .
for now klose , who will be 32 years old next summer , gets the nod because he , in contrast to gomez , has been effective for the national squad in the past .
but he 's clearly lost a bit of athleticism , so in his heart of hearts , loew might well prefer the 24-year-old gomez .
loew choice will probably be influenced by how much playing time the two strikers get at bayern munich .
however that situation turns out , though , what loew does n't have is a center forward who can create goal opportunities for himself a la wayne rooney for england or thierry henry for france .
that means that germany could have trouble against other defensively oriented teams like italy .
as one of the best teams at the back in the world , germany could certainly fly high in south africa , and no nation will relish facing them .
but their creative deficiencies at the front also mean that loew 's men , if they face tough opponents early on , could end up smack on their backsides .

but how does the team measure up to the world 's top national teams ?
deutsche welle 's jefferson chase takes a closer look . the one moment that best symbolizes the 1-0 win over moscow that qualified germany for the 2010 world cup in south africa was directly after the lone goal was scored .
striker miroslav klose celebrated with one of his trademark forward flips - and only narrowly avoided landing on his backside .
match reports in german newspapers , perhaps understandably , were full of superlatives about germany 's gutsy away win .
but that 1-0 victory was of the knife-edge variety , unlike germany 's 1-0 loss to spain in the 2008 european championships , the last time coach joachim loew had a chance to win a title .
so have germany improved enough to draw level with the spaniards or brazil ?
or are they more on a par with other large european nations like england , the netherlands and italy .
here 's a back-to-front run-through of the strengths and weaknesses of the german squad .
defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adler could become the next in a long line of stellar german national keepers the one position about which loew has absolutely no worries is goal .
24-year-old rene adler was the key to germany 's victory , making a number of world-class saves , and seems to have sealed his position as germany 's number one .
the young keeper 's most brilliant moment in moscow came in the 73rd minute , when russian midfielder igor semshov was clear on the right side and slotted a crisp pass in the direction of two teammates waiting in front of goal .
adler not only got a hand to the ball but cleverly deflected it over the end line .

but a group of german and scottish poets who have translated it found out just how similar europeans are . from landlocked farms in the franconia region of bavaria to fishing villages on the coast of scotland or the shetland islands , regional dialects throughout consolidated and globalized europe are something of an endangered cultural resource . the task of preserving them goes in part to dialect poets , including two germans and two scots who have been involved in a project to translate regional verse . last year they held a workshop in fife , scotland , where they communicated through oral translators and were provided with literal " gloss " translations in both languages of each other 's poems .
today , they say the experience has had a lasting effect on how they view their poetry . ties to the land the sentiments of dialect poems are often expressed through rustic and geographically-bound language .
while franconian poets often work with imagery and idiomatic expressions based on a life of farming , the scots poets do so with a life of fishing in mind .
in some instances , this makes literal translation impossible and forces the poets to search for comparable literary devices . isabel cole organized the workshop and edits a berlin-based journal of german literature in english translation called " no man 's land . "
she said dialect is less accepted in germany as a form of literary expression than it is in scotland . " i think if people are open-minded about literature , dialects or non-standard literature , it is a real enrichment , " said cole .
" that 's something i actually miss in standard german literature .
one thing i like about germany is how many dialects there are , and how people cultivate their dialects .
they have really different ways of expressing themselves . " bildunterschrift : fishing is an integral part of local scottish culture the personal element fitzgerald kusz , a franconian poet from nuremberg , said that in translating scots poems he was surprised to discover traces of that dialect 's germanic roots .
kusz has spoken franconian since childhood and regards his dialect as an intimate and comfortable form of communication . " on one hand , globalization continues strengthen its hold , " he said , " high german , the unified language , can be heard on television in every village .
but there is , in fact , a movement among the people to keep their languages alive . " and that is one primary goal of dialect literature , he added . one of kusz ' scots counterparts , alexander hutchison , said " a shift into the dialect makes things much more personal … for me it 's just a different instrument . " although hutchison , who lives in glasgow , is not optimistic about current attempts to cultivate dialect in scotland 's schools , he said that in poetry the scots dialect is every bit as viable a form of self-expression as standard english . " if people do n't understand the dialect , they ca n't connect , " he said .
" but if they do understand it , then there 's an immediacy - a personal element - that you can not get in the parent language .
there 's just as much possibility of a lack in the parent language as there is in the dialect .
they operate in different dimensions to me . " the flip-side of globalization franconian poet helmut haberkamm , who grew up in a farming village not far from erlangen , told deutsche welle in an email interview that franconian is " deeply and unmistakably connected to my childhood and the early emotions and experiences which formed me , predetermined parts of my life , and arranged my existence . " franconian is inextricably dissolved in my person .
it is my language of emotion and intimacy , " he added . haberkamm has translated the works of shetlandic poet robert alan jamieson .
although the environments of sheltand and franconia vary greatly , haberkamm said he found striking similarities in the way nature is woven into the lives and languages of both regions . in translating jamieson 's poems , he said he wanted " to bring out the simple , gripping way these people express themselves .

but a group of german and scottish poets who have translated it found out just how similar europeans are . from landlocked farms in the franconia region of bavaria to fishing villages on the coast of scotland or the shetland islands , regional dialects throughout consolidated and globalized europe are something of an endangered cultural resource . the task of preserving them goes in part to dialect poets , including two germans and two scots who have been involved in a project to translate regional verse . last year they held a workshop in fife , scotland , where they communicated through oral translators and were provided with literal " gloss " translations in both languages of each other 's poems .
today , they say the experience has had a lasting effect on how they view their poetry . ties to the land the sentiments of dialect poems are often expressed through rustic and geographically-bound language .
while franconian poets often work with imagery and idiomatic expressions based on a life of farming , the scots poets do so with a life of fishing in mind .
in some instances , this makes literal translation impossible and forces the poets to search for comparable literary devices . isabel cole organized the workshop and edits a berlin-based journal of german literature in english translation called " no man 's land . "
she said dialect is less accepted in germany as a form of literary expression than it is in scotland . " i think if people are open-minded about literature , dialects or non-standard literature , it is a real enrichment , " said cole .
" that 's something i actually miss in standard german literature .
one thing i like about germany is how many dialects there are , and how people cultivate their dialects .
they have really different ways of expressing themselves . " bildunterschrift : fishing is an integral part of local scottish culture the personal element fitzgerald kusz , a franconian poet from nuremberg , said that in translating scots poems he was surprised to discover traces of that dialect 's germanic roots .
kusz has spoken franconian since childhood and regards his dialect as an intimate and comfortable form of communication . " on one hand , globalization continues strengthen its hold , " he said , " high german , the unified language , can be heard on television in every village .
but there is , in fact , a movement among the people to keep their languages alive . " and that is one primary goal of dialect literature , he added . one of kusz ' scots counterparts , alexander hutchison , said " a shift into the dialect makes things much more personal … for me it 's just a different instrument . " although hutchison , who lives in glasgow , is not optimistic about current attempts to cultivate dialect in scotland 's schools , he said that in poetry the scots dialect is every bit as viable a form of self-expression as standard english . " if people do n't understand the dialect , they ca n't connect , " he said .
" but if they do understand it , then there 's an immediacy - a personal element - that you can not get in the parent language .
there 's just as much possibility of a lack in the parent language as there is in the dialect .
they operate in different dimensions to me . " the flip-side of globalization franconian poet helmut haberkamm , who grew up in a farming village not far from erlangen , told deutsche welle in an email interview that franconian is " deeply and unmistakably connected to my childhood and the early emotions and experiences which formed me , predetermined parts of my life , and arranged my existence . " franconian is inextricably dissolved in my person .
it is my language of emotion and intimacy , " he added . haberkamm has translated the works of shetlandic poet robert alan jamieson .
although the environments of sheltand and franconia vary greatly , haberkamm said he found striking similarities in the way nature is woven into the lives and languages of both regions . in translating jamieson 's poems , he said he wanted " to bring out the simple , gripping way these people express themselves . " haberkamm described regionalism as the " necessary flip-side of globalization , " adding that " people without an understanding of their roots and concrete values are easily manipulated . " endangered by mobility although hutchison expressed similar sentiments while speaking about his desire to preserve scots and see it flourish , he compared the dialect to a " threatened habitat , " endangered by time and changing patterns of human behavior .
having lived for years in north america , hutchison said he understands the pressures modern existence exerts on local cultures . " people move around , people move off , people do n't stay in one place long enough to develop it , " he said .
" there are new dialects springing up all the time .
if there 's enough settled community , they 'll find a language . " i 'm always wary of standardization , of people trying to impose things .
as a poet , i never want to make rules for other poets . " author : gerhard schneibel editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but that is easier said than done , as the president of the czech republic appears at pains to demonstrate . euroskeptic czech president vaclav klaus chose his moment well .

klaus is concerned that the european charter of fundamental rights , part of the lisbon treaty , could allow the three million germans expelled from czechoslovakia at the end of the second world war to reclaim property confiscated from them at the time .
the issue came up after the fall of communism , but the czech courts have thrown out claims brought forth by expellees , and klaus is clearly prepared to go to great lengths to prevent an upsetting of that particular apple cart .
but in so doing , he is attracting much negative attention , and winning no eu popularity contests .
although relations between germany and the czech republic - which border one another - are essentially quite good , klaus 's latest demands have met with criticism in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech president vaclav klaus says he wo n't take no for an answer christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- member and parliamentary secretary for defense , christian schmidt , told the dpa news agency that it was unnecessary to play the german expellees card and that there is already a european convention of human rights .
" everything that concerns the lisbon treaty has been negotiated , " schmidt said .
" to come now , shortly before the end game with new demands , leads to the impression that he only wants to delay . "
if they can , so can we but klaus insists it is his right to demand a binding guarantee that prevents expellees from using eu laws to circumnavigate the czech judicial system .
he cited britain and poland , both of which negotiated an opt-out before the pact was signed at the end of 2007 - britain over fears that collective bargaining rights could lead to increased strike action , and poland in order to protect the values of a deeply catholic society - saying he wanted something similar for his country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president lech kaczynski signed the treaty at the weekend " i am convinced that the czech republic must at least post facto negotiate a similar exemption , " klaus told reporters , adding that he thought a " non-standard " procedure could get the job done quickly .
in order to try and convince the rest of the eu to accommodate his wishes , the czech president would first have to submit a proposal .
the alternative procedure the easier way forward could be to have eu leaders approve a declaration which is not intrinsically a part of the treaty , such as they did when ireland asked for a guarantee that the lisbon treaty would not interfere with laws on taxes and abortion .
but ladislav jakl , an aide to klaus , poured water on that idea on czech television on sunday .
he said the president would " not be satisfied by any declaration but only guarantees for every citizen , " adding that the condition was " fundamental , necessary , unbreachable . "
it is certainly problematic for the eu that klaus has waited until this late stage in the ratification process to ask to see it tweaked in his favor .
what happens next will depend to some degree on the czech parliament which is scheduled to meet on monday to discuss the latest spanner the president has thrown into the ratification process works. tkw / afp / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

can it escape the oil curse and become an example to other developing states ? in many ways ghana serves as a model among african countries .
compared to many other west african nations it has been very stable in recent years .
ghana 's peaceful election last year and the successful transition of government from one party to another this year were considered the pinnacle of the country 's progress , which was highlighted by us president barack obama 's visit to accra this summer .
but after the recent announcement by oil giant exxonmobil that it was buying a four billion-dollar stake in ghana 's jubilee oil field , the country is now facing a task that may be even more challenging than the democratic reform process it has undergone : to prove that it can not only successfully deal with a powerful multinational , but also that the windfall that is generated by what is considered to be one of africa 's biggest oil fields does n't end up in the pockets of a few insiders , but improves the wealth and well-being of ghana 's society .
" the stakes are very high , " writes ian gary , an expert in extractive industries , in a report about ghana 's oil find and its consequences for society for the international aid agency oxfam .
" while many ghanaian government officials are confident they can meet the challenge , oil 's threat to democratic development should not be underestimated . "
high stakes , big profits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exxonmobil 's bid beat out other oil giants while the stakes are high , so is the profit .
according to an estimate by the international monetary fund which is cited by gary , ghana 's government can expect revenues from oil and gas up to 20 billion dollars during the production period between 2012 and 2030 for the jubilee field alone .
so what are ghana 's chances to avoid the spell of the so-called oil curse ? " i think that ghana could really be one country which could be a positive example to the world and it could also be profitable and beneficial for the country , " claudia kemfert , an energy specialist at berlin 's economic research institute diw , tells deutsche welle .
" ghana could really profit from this deal and also from the oil market . "
what 's required , adds kemfert , is that ghana 's government puts in place a good political strategy on how it wants to use the oil revenues .
talking to deutsche welle , ulrike bickel , an energy expert with germany 's catholic relief agency misereor , is more skeptical : " we obviously see the danger that ghana could also become a victim of the oil curse , that its oil wealth wo n't benefit the people and that oil revenues just like in neighboring countries , vanish instead of being spent on health , education or sustainable social development . " while bickel points out that ghana , a country without previous experience in the oil sector , has taken positive steps such as signing on to the so-called extractive industries transparency initiative , which mandates its members to openly document the flow of revenues , she adds that it is still far too early to tell whether it will be implemented .
bildunterschrift : president obama 's visit , with ghana president john atta mills highlighted the country 's progress negative example an example that positive declarations and good intentions do n't necessarily translate into enforceable action is chad .
" before the world bank agreed to a large loan for the chad-cameroon pipeline there was an agreement that a fund for future generations would be created and that up to 70 percent of the oil revenues would be used for priority social sector developments , " says bickel .
" but as soon as the oil revenue started to flow , chad 's government , which was fighting a civil war , dissolved the fund for future generations and extended the priority sector developments to include national security .
that means the oil revenue is used to buy large quantities of weapons . " that does n't mean that agreements and declarations are n't useful .
they definitely are .
but reality eventually is the ultimate test whether those agreements are fulfilled .
ghana , say the analysts , among developing african nations , is perhaps best prepared to manage its oil wealth carefully . as oxfam expert gary wrote in his report on ghana : " oil wealth tends to erode democratic accountability .
ghana 's challenge will be to ensure that the right institutions and transparent policies are in place before oil production starts . "

can it escape the oil curse and become an example to other developing states ? in many ways ghana serves as a model among african countries .
compared to many other west african nations it has been very stable in recent years .
ghana 's peaceful election last year and the successful transition of government from one party to another this year were considered the pinnacle of the country 's progress , which was highlighted by us president barack obama 's visit to accra this summer .
but after the recent announcement by oil giant exxonmobil that it was buying a four billion-dollar stake in ghana 's jubilee oil field , the country is now facing a task that may be even more challenging than the democratic reform process it has undergone : to prove that it can not only successfully deal with a powerful multinational , but also that the windfall that is generated by what is considered to be one of africa 's biggest oil fields does n't end up in the pockets of a few insiders , but improves the wealth and well-being of ghana 's society .
" the stakes are very high , " writes ian gary , an expert in extractive industries , in a report about ghana 's oil find and its consequences for society for the international aid agency oxfam .
" while many ghanaian government officials are confident they can meet the challenge , oil 's threat to democratic development should not be underestimated . "
high stakes , big profits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exxonmobil 's bid beat out other oil giants while the stakes are high , so is the profit .
according to an estimate by the international monetary fund which is cited by gary , ghana 's government can expect revenues from oil and gas up to 20 billion dollars during the production period between 2012 and 2030 for the jubilee field alone .
so what are ghana 's chances to avoid the spell of the so-called oil curse ? " i think that ghana could really be one country which could be a positive example to the world and it could also be profitable and beneficial for the country , " claudia kemfert , an energy specialist at berlin 's economic research institute diw , tells deutsche welle .
" ghana could really profit from this deal and also from the oil market . "
what 's required , adds kemfert , is that ghana 's government puts in place a good political strategy on how it wants to use the oil revenues .
talking to deutsche welle , ulrike bickel , an energy expert with germany 's catholic relief agency misereor , is more skeptical : " we obviously see the danger that ghana could also become a victim of the oil curse , that its oil wealth wo n't benefit the people and that oil revenues just like in neighboring countries , vanish instead of being spent on health , education or sustainable social development . " while bickel points out that ghana , a country without previous experience in the oil sector , has taken positive steps such as signing on to the so-called extractive industries transparency initiative , which mandates its members to openly document the flow of revenues , she adds that it is still far too early to tell whether it will be implemented .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 12.10.2009 german military guns reportedly sold illegally on afghan , pakistan black market großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guns sent to afghanistan for police and army have ended up on the black market german military pistols are being sold on the black market in afghanistan and pakistan .
the weapons were sent in 2006 and were intended for local police and army personnel . arms dealers in the region told german public radio that hundreds of german weapons were for sale carrying a price tag of over 680 euros a piece -lrb- $ 1,000 -rrb- .
in 2006 , the german defense ministry shipped 10,000 old walther-p1 pistols to the afghan interior ministry to equip afghan police and army .
however , both the german government and the responsible us-led security team in afghanistan reportedly failed to properly monitor the guns ' whereabouts .
the us unit said that it only had detailed records of 4,563 pistols out of a total 10,000 . current and former afghan soldiers and police officers are said to be among those illegally selling and trafficking the pistols , some of which have ended up in pakistan 's north-west border provinces and neighboring tribal areas .
the german guns were also being traded in northern afghanistan where german soldiers are stationed .
the team of ndr radio reporters who discovered the black market guns said it 's not clear exactly how they ended up there .
" apparently , most of these pistols have n't been stolen , but were simply taken home and sold by former police officers and soldiers after they 'd left the service , " said christoph heinzle , who headed the ndr team .
" but corruption and theft can not be ruled out because neither the afghan authorities nor the us and german armed forces carry out effective controls to prevent -lsb- theft -rsb- . "
greens , police union call for investigation the 2006 delivery was carried out despite a german government principle that german weapons could not be supplied to non-nato countries .
germany 's then coalition government of social democrats and greens made an exception , but the decision reportedly only reached parliament after the weapons had already arrived in afghanistan .
the fresh allegations have prompted calls for an investigation by germany 's green party and the police trade union .
green party spokesman winfried nachtwei accused the grand coalition government , which was in power when the guns were shipped , of a " grossly negligent course of action , " and called for the matter to be investigated in the interest of german security forces and civilian experts sent to afghanistan .
" it would be truly absurd if soldiers were threatened by weapons irresponsibly delivered by germany , " nachtwei said .
joerg radek of the police union said the danger was that " such weapons could fall into the wrong hands .
it is a risk for the germans deployed there , a risk to security in the country . "
defense ministry spokesman thomas raabe told reporters in berlin on monday that officials in kabul had guaranteed the weapons would only be distributed among security forces .
he said the ministry would be investigating any unlawful sales of the guns .
" of course we 'll be looking for evidence of any wrongdoing , but i want to underscore that the afghan government is independent in its decision-making and that we 'll continue to support its efforts to build up effective security forces .

the deal also received heavy criticism from azerbaijan over unsolved armenian-azeri territorial disputes . even though the ink has dried on the protocols signed by the foreign ministers of turkey and armenia , there is no guarantee that the parties will or can make the agreements a reality .
indeed , turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan was first out of the gate with a cautionary note .
" we want all the borders to be opened at the same time ... , but as long as armenia has not withdrawn from azerbaijani territory that it is occupying , turkey can not have a positive attitude on this subject , " said erdogan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nagorno-karabakh dispute puts the deal at risk in the late 1980 's , as the soviet union was dissolving , violence broke out in the ethnic armenian enclave of nagorno-karabakh within azerbaijan 's internationally recognized borders .
in 1993 a war broke out when armenia sent in troops to support the ethnic armenians and they drove azeri troops from seven districts next to nagorno-karabakh .
they have remained there ever since .
azerbaijan condemns accord in support of the turkic speaking azeris , turkey closed its border with armenia when armenia went into azerbaijan .
hence ankara 's insistence that armenia pull out of azerbaijan before the protocols can be ratified in the turkish parliament .
in azerbaijan , the foreign ministry issued a statement saying that the accords should not have been signed while nagorno-karabakh is still occupied .
" the normalization of relations between turkey and armenia before the withdrawal of armenian troops from occupied azeri territory is in direct contradiction to the national interests of azerbaijan , " said the statement .
by all accounts , the signing was an historic event .
nearly a year in the making , discretely abetted by the swiss .
however , the signing ceremony for the protocols that pledge to establish diplomatic relations , open borders and to set up an historic commission to investigate armenian deaths in world war i , almost fell through when the parties disagreed over some of the wording in the statements to be delivered at the end of the signing ceremony .
protests around the world the agreement between the two countries has sparked widespread controversy .
some 10,000 people marched in the armenian capital yerevan to protest the agreement .
they are part of a global protest movement that fears the signing of the protocols will lessen the emphasis on the mass killings of armenians during world war i. bildunterschrift : the deal between turkey and armenia include a provision to set up a historical commission to investigate the events of world war i. yerevan claims that during the war , the ottoman turks committed genocide by killing more than a million armenians and wants ankara to acknowledge it .
turkey admits that there were deaths , but vehemently deny that the number of dead approach the threshold of the definition for genocide .

" lagerfeld also said that the current backlash against skinny models was being fuelled by overweight women who resent being reminded of their weight issues .
" these are fat moms sitting with their bags of chips in front of the tv and saying that thin models are ugly , " lagerfeld said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl lagerfeld the head designer for chanel made the comments in monday 's edition of german news magazine focus .
he was responding to a decision announced last week by top-selling german women 's magazine brigitte to forgo thin professional models .
instead , brigitte 's editors plan to feature real women they say represent more relatable ideals of beauty .
lagerfeld slammed the idea as " absurd , " arguing that the world of fashion is supposed to be about " dreams and illusions . "
from 2001 to 2002 , lagerfeld displayed an iron will as he whittled some 40 kilos -lrb- 90 pounds -rrb- off his frame in just 13 months .
since then , he has been outspoken when it comes to the correlation between fashion and size .
in 2004 , for example , he announced his irritation over a decision by swedish retailer h & m to make his designs for a one-off collection available in larger sizes .
" what i created was fashion for slim , slender people , " he said then , vowing never to work with the company again .
debate has become hysterical , designer says fellow german designer john ribbe was also quoted in focus , saying the current debate about too-skinny models had become hysterical .
" that 's another one of those cliches , like saying that all models take drugs and get drunk at sex orgies , " ribbe said .
" ninety percent are totally normal , well-proportioned girls with less fat and more muscle , but who also eat pizza and burgers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : starting in january , brigitte will feature " real women " instead of models according to brigitte editor andreas lebert , the average catwalk model today weighs some 23 percent less than the average woman on the street .
a few designers , however , are realizing that not all professional models have to be a size zero .
a case in point is us model crystal renn , who recently released a book entitled " hungry , " in which she details her struggle to meet the demands of agents who told her to lose weight if she wanted to work .
renn became anorexic in her pursuit to fit into the typical fashion mould before deciding that her health was more important .
now a voluptuous us size 12 , her modelling career is taking off .
she has been featured in fashion bible vogue magazine six times and walked the runway for designers such as jeanpaul gaultier .
renn is using her newfound stardom to plead for the world of fashion to recognize a multitude of beauty ideals - including women who are naturally a size two .
" all women bring something different to the table and we have to appreciate them all , " she said. dc / ap / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

instead , brigitte 's editors plan to feature real women they say represent more relatable ideals of beauty .
lagerfeld slammed the idea as " absurd , " arguing that the world of fashion is supposed to be about " dreams and illusions . "
from 2001 to 2002 , lagerfeld displayed an iron will as he whittled some 40 kilos -lrb- 90 pounds -rrb- off his frame in just 13 months .
since then , he has been outspoken when it comes to the correlation between fashion and size .
in 2004 , for example , he announced his irritation over a decision by swedish retailer h & m to make his designs for a one-off collection available in larger sizes .
" what i created was fashion for slim , slender people , " he said then , vowing never to work with the company again .
debate has become hysterical , designer says fellow german designer john ribbe was also quoted in focus , saying the current debate about too-skinny models had become hysterical .
" that 's another one of those cliches , like saying that all models take drugs and get drunk at sex orgies , " ribbe said .
" ninety percent are totally normal , well-proportioned girls with less fat and more muscle , but who also eat pizza and burgers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : starting in january , brigitte will feature " real women " instead of models according to brigitte editor andreas lebert , the average catwalk model today weighs some 23 percent less than the average woman on the street .
a few designers , however , are realizing that not all professional models have to be a size zero .
a case in point is us model crystal renn , who recently released a book entitled " hungry , " in which she details her struggle to meet the demands of agents who told her to lose weight if she wanted to work .
renn became anorexic in her pursuit to fit into the typical fashion mould before deciding that her health was more important .
now a voluptuous us size 12 , her modelling career is taking off .
she has been featured in fashion bible vogue magazine six times and walked the runway for designers such as jeanpaul gaultier .
renn is using her newfound stardom to plead for the world of fashion to recognize a multitude of beauty ideals - including women who are naturally a size two .

but a group of german and scottish poets who have translated it found out just how similar europeans are . from landlocked farms in the franconia region of bavaria to fishing villages on the coast of scotland or the shetland islands , regional dialects throughout consolidated and globalized europe are something of an endangered cultural resource . the task of preserving them goes in part to dialect poets , including two germans and two scots who have been involved in a project to translate regional verse . last year they held a workshop in fife , scotland , where they communicated through oral translators and were provided with literal " gloss " translations in both languages of each other 's poems .
today , they say the experience has had a lasting effect on how they view their poetry . ties to the land the sentiments of dialect poems are often expressed through rustic and geographically-bound language .
while franconian poets often work with imagery and idiomatic expressions based on a life of farming , the scots poets do so with a life of fishing in mind .
in some instances , this makes literal translation impossible and forces the poets to search for comparable literary devices . isabel cole organized the workshop and edits a berlin-based journal of german literature in english translation called " no man 's land . "
she said dialect is less accepted in germany as a form of literary expression than it is in scotland . " i think if people are open-minded about literature , dialects or non-standard literature , it is a real enrichment , " said cole .
" that 's something i actually miss in standard german literature .
one thing i like about germany is how many dialects there are , and how people cultivate their dialects .
they have really different ways of expressing themselves . " bildunterschrift : fishing is an integral part of local scottish culture the personal element fitzgerald kusz , a franconian poet from nuremberg , said that in translating scots poems he was surprised to discover traces of that dialect 's germanic roots .
kusz has spoken franconian since childhood and regards his dialect as an intimate and comfortable form of communication . " on one hand , globalization continues strengthen its hold , " he said , " high german , the unified language , can be heard on television in every village .
but there is , in fact , a movement among the people to keep their languages alive . " and that is one primary goal of dialect literature , he added . one of kusz ' scots counterparts , alexander hutchison , said " a shift into the dialect makes things much more personal … for me it 's just a different instrument . " although hutchison , who lives in glasgow , is not optimistic about current attempts to cultivate dialect in scotland 's schools , he said that in poetry the scots dialect is every bit as viable a form of self-expression as standard english . " if people do n't understand the dialect , they ca n't connect , " he said .
" but if they do understand it , then there 's an immediacy - a personal element - that you can not get in the parent language .
there 's just as much possibility of a lack in the parent language as there is in the dialect .
they operate in different dimensions to me . " the flip-side of globalization franconian poet helmut haberkamm , who grew up in a farming village not far from erlangen , told deutsche welle in an email interview that franconian is " deeply and unmistakably connected to my childhood and the early emotions and experiences which formed me , predetermined parts of my life , and arranged my existence . " franconian is inextricably dissolved in my person .
it is my language of emotion and intimacy , " he added . haberkamm has translated the works of shetlandic poet robert alan jamieson .
although the environments of sheltand and franconia vary greatly , haberkamm said he found striking similarities in the way nature is woven into the lives and languages of both regions . in translating jamieson 's poems , he said he wanted " to bring out the simple , gripping way these people express themselves . " haberkamm described regionalism as the " necessary flip-side of globalization , " adding that " people without an understanding of their roots and concrete values are easily manipulated . " endangered by mobility although hutchison expressed similar sentiments while speaking about his desire to preserve scots and see it flourish , he compared the dialect to a " threatened habitat , " endangered by time and changing patterns of human behavior .
having lived for years in north america , hutchison said he understands the pressures modern existence exerts on local cultures . " people move around , people move off , people do n't stay in one place long enough to develop it , " he said .
" there are new dialects springing up all the time .
if there 's enough settled community , they 'll find a language . " i 'm always wary of standardization , of people trying to impose things .
as a poet , i never want to make rules for other poets . " author : gerhard schneibel editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

leonid ivlev , a member of the central elections commission , told reporters that the ruling party had garnered almost 80 percent of seats up for grabs in the 75 regional and local elections held up and down the country on sunday .
ivlev said putin 's party picked up 107 of the 135 regional seats and 189 of the 235 seats available in municipal legislatures .
they also emerged victorious in the eagerly-watched race for moscow 's city legislature .
with 99 percent of votes in , the ria-novosti news agency reported a 66 percent win for united russia .
praise from the president the opposition communists were the only rivals to score any seats in the high-profile ballot , which only managed to attract a 35 percent voter turnout .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president dmitry medvedev praised the results in comments on the united russia party website , president dmitry medvedev told his country , which has been particularly hard hit by the economic downturn , that they had voted for the right party .
" only together can we surmount the hardships of the financial crisis , " he wrote , " and the vote obtained by united russia demonstrates that we are together and this is most important . "
he went on to say that the 30 million-strong electorate clearly knew what it wanted .
" taking account that elections in the capital are practically federal ones , we can state that in the crisis situation voters have demonstrated they stay together with the ruling party . "
claims of fraud but the liberal yabloko party , which came away from the vote completely empty-handed , has made claims of systematic vote rigging .
yabloko , which failed to reach the 7 percent hurdle in moscow 's local election , has condemned the 17-year-reign of mayor yury luzhkov , accusing him of carrying out " one of the all-time election frauds in russia 's recent history . "
on sunday , while the ballot boxes were still open , yabloko said it had received a " storm of calls " from the moscow electorate , complaining that they were unable to cast their vote because someone else had already done so using their name .
" united russia used so-called carousel voting , " said yabloko spokesman sergey mitrohin .
" this time , it was busloads of soldiers and police that they took from one polling station to another and had them cast their votes for united russia over and over .
we also have serious reason to believe that the ballot boxes were stuffed with additional ballots . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition parties say they will contest moscow 's municipal ballot yabloko and communist party representatives have already said they will contest the results of the municipal poll in court .
" we can not recognize these elections or consider them normal , " communist party deputy chairman vladimir kashin told ria-novosti .
the independent election watchdog golog has come out behind the opposition parties , and has said it will provide proof of fraud . earlier , head of the watchdog , liliya shibanova , lamented the lack of political competition in russia .
" medvedev says we need competition , we need a multi-party system , but election results show the exact opposite , " she said. tkw / dc / afp / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

leonid ivlev , a member of the central elections commission , told reporters that the ruling party had garnered almost 80 percent of seats up for grabs in the 75 regional and local elections held up and down the country on sunday .
ivlev said putin 's party picked up 107 of the 135 regional seats and 189 of the 235 seats available in municipal legislatures .
they also emerged victorious in the eagerly-watched race for moscow 's city legislature .
with 99 percent of votes in , the ria-novosti news agency reported a 66 percent win for united russia .

yabloko , which failed to reach the 7 percent hurdle in moscow 's local election , has condemned the 17-year-reign of mayor yury luzhkov , accusing him of carrying out " one of the all-time election frauds in russia 's recent history . "
on sunday , while the ballot boxes were still open , yabloko said it had received a " storm of calls " from the moscow electorate , complaining that they were unable to cast their vote because someone else had already done so using their name .
" united russia used so-called carousel voting , " said yabloko spokesman sergey mitrohin .
" this time , it was busloads of soldiers and police that they took from one polling station to another and had them cast their votes for united russia over and over .
we also have serious reason to believe that the ballot boxes were stuffed with additional ballots . "

larsson , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , said that although the pandemic has n't hurt the european population as much as feared , it still makes sense to be vaccinated .
" experts have told us that the pandemic will continue for some years , " larsson said .
" if you protect yourself , that will be protection not just for the current situation and the nearest months , but the nearest years . "
the emergence of swine flu in april led to widespread public fears , but since then , two new vaccines have been developed and concerns have abated .
but the eu wants to play it safe , and that means seeing to it that as many people as possible are vaccinated , thereby diminishing the likelihood that the disease will ever get a real grip on the population .
help further afield in that vein , larsson said she and her fellow health ministers would also debate whether it made sense to share their vaccine supplies with developing nations outside the eu .

leonid ivlev , a member of the central elections commission , told reporters that the ruling party had garnered almost 80 percent of seats up for grabs in the 75 regional and local elections held up and down the country on sunday .
ivlev said putin 's party picked up 107 of the 135 regional seats and 189 of the 235 seats available in municipal legislatures .
they also emerged victorious in the eagerly-watched race for moscow 's city legislature .
with 99 percent of votes in , the ria-novosti news agency reported a 66 percent win for united russia .
praise from the president the opposition communists were the only rivals to score any seats in the high-profile ballot , which only managed to attract a 35 percent voter turnout .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president dmitry medvedev praised the results in comments on the united russia party website , president dmitry medvedev told his country , which has been particularly hard hit by the economic downturn , that they had voted for the right party .
" only together can we surmount the hardships of the financial crisis , " he wrote , " and the vote obtained by united russia demonstrates that we are together and this is most important . "
he went on to say that the 30 million-strong electorate clearly knew what it wanted .
" taking account that elections in the capital are practically federal ones , we can state that in the crisis situation voters have demonstrated they stay together with the ruling party . "
claims of fraud but the liberal yabloko party , which came away from the vote completely empty-handed , has made claims of systematic vote rigging .
yabloko , which failed to reach the 7 percent hurdle in moscow 's local election , has condemned the 17-year-reign of mayor yury luzhkov , accusing him of carrying out " one of the all-time election frauds in russia 's recent history . "
on sunday , while the ballot boxes were still open , yabloko said it had received a " storm of calls " from the moscow electorate , complaining that they were unable to cast their vote because someone else had already done so using their name .
" united russia used so-called carousel voting , " said yabloko spokesman sergey mitrohin .
" this time , it was busloads of soldiers and police that they took from one polling station to another and had them cast their votes for united russia over and over .
we also have serious reason to believe that the ballot boxes were stuffed with additional ballots . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition parties say they will contest moscow 's municipal ballot yabloko and communist party representatives have already said they will contest the results of the municipal poll in court .
" we can not recognize these elections or consider them normal , " communist party deputy chairman vladimir kashin told ria-novosti .
the independent election watchdog golog has come out behind the opposition parties , and has said it will provide proof of fraud . earlier , head of the watchdog , liliya shibanova , lamented the lack of political competition in russia .
" medvedev says we need competition , we need a multi-party system , but election results show the exact opposite , " she said. tkw / dc / afp / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a new trend aims to keep classical recordings from becoming a taxidermist ’ s project . methods of recording , distribution , and promotion are changing in the classical music industry , and the companies that once dominated the market have either adapted or faltered .
as estimable names in the industry fall by the wayside , new models arise . one of the most successful projects has been the establishment of classical labels by orchestras , with a focus on live recordings . while exclusive contracts with the big-name labels - emi , deutsche grammophon / decca , sony / rca , telarc / warner - became scarce , and their recording projects fewer and fewer , orchestras are inevitably searching for new ways to reach new audiences with new recordings . recording technology has advanced significantly in the last 20 years so that recording concerts live is no longer an inherently hampered way to preserve an otherwise un-replicable musical event . " recording technology is so mobile that there are no qualitative differences between studio and live recordings , " said chaz jenkins , head of the london symphony orchestra 's own label , lso live . the live experience jenkins is one of the pioneers of the orchestra-record-label industry .
he has been with lso live , the first label of an orchestra to enter the market this way , since it was founded in 2000 .
the concept of the label has been replicated by many other orchestras -lrb- often with the help of lso live -rrb- , which the london orchestra 's efforts paved the way for . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sir colin davis specializes in berlioz the goal of lso live was not to replicate what labels have done in the past , but to do something different , and , in particular , to retain the orchestra 's work in the concert hall .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 12.10.2009 germany needs to improve to become a world cup favorite großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany got the result they needed when it counted germany got the job done in a relative easy group and qualified for the world cup .
but how does the team measure up to the world 's top national teams ?
deutsche welle 's jefferson chase takes a closer look . the one moment that best symbolizes the 1-0 win over moscow that qualified germany for the 2010 world cup in south africa was directly after the lone goal was scored .
striker miroslav klose celebrated with one of his trademark forward flips - and only narrowly avoided landing on his backside .
match reports in german newspapers , perhaps understandably , were full of superlatives about germany 's gutsy away win .
but that 1-0 victory was of the knife-edge variety , unlike germany 's 1-0 loss to spain in the 2008 european championships , the last time coach joachim loew had a chance to win a title .
so have germany improved enough to draw level with the spaniards or brazil ?
or are they more on a par with other large european nations like england , the netherlands and italy .
here 's a back-to-front run-through of the strengths and weaknesses of the german squad .
defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adler could become the next in a long line of stellar german national keepers the one position about which loew has absolutely no worries is goal .
24-year-old rene adler was the key to germany 's victory , making a number of world-class saves , and seems to have sealed his position as germany 's number one .
the young keeper 's most brilliant moment in moscow came in the 73rd minute , when russian midfielder igor semshov was clear on the right side and slotted a crisp pass in the direction of two teammates waiting in front of goal .
adler not only got a hand to the ball but cleverly deflected it over the end line .
and should adler get hurt , loew can call on robert enke , manuel neuer or even tim wiese who 've all proved their worth at the international level .
left back philipp lahm is arguably the best in the world at his position so his selection is a no-brainer .
interior defenders per mertesacker and heiko westermann provide a solid anchor in the back four .
youngster serdar tasci could also play a role .
the big question is right back .
jerome boateng , who made his national-team debut in russia , showed he was capable of provided some welcome offensive pressure .
but the 21-year-old also got himself sent off with a red card .
loew 's task will be to get the youngster enough experience in friendlies between now and next june that he no longer poses a risk .
otherwise , he 'll be forced to fall back on arne friedrich , who 's been mediocre at best when wearing the german kit .
defensive midfield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack is a force in midfield but germany could use a threat like russia 's andrei arshavin though not the force he once was german captain michael ballack is the lynchpin of the german squad .
the 33-year-old not only wins lots of challenges but is responsible for the opening passes for germany 's offense .
to cover ballack 's back when he presses forward , simon rolfes is a good choice .
and thomas hitzlsperger is also a more offensive option because of his ability to blast in shots from long-range .
if ballack were to go down to injury , though , germany would be in trouble .
ballack is to germany what gennaro gattuso has been to italy , and loew needs to plan , as best he can , for the eventuality that his captain is unavailable .
the problem is that no one currently on the squad or on the radar screen has the ability to fill the stopper-meets-playmaker role ballack occupies .
offensive midfield and wingers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is counting on youngsters like jerome boateng , marko marin and mesut oezil the emergence of mesut oezil represents the biggest improvement of germany 's likely 2010 squad over the 2008 edition .
the 20-year-old displayed both his pace and his eye for his teammates in setting up the lone goal in moscow that punched germany 's world cup ticket .
but after that , the quality tails off .
bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski are active but relatively inefficient players who 've never lived up their potential .
it will be interesting to see whether youngster marko marin , oezil 's equally fleet-footed teammate at werder bremen , can break into the germany 's starting eleven .
but even if he does , a comparison with the world 's top teams suggests that germany 's offensive midfield is a relative weakness .
spain are spoiled for choice with xabi alonso , xavi , fabregas , iniesta and senna .
brazil , too , can chose from nearly a dozen top-quality midfielders , including kaka , whose skills and creativity are far superior to any member of the german squad .
thus , as the squad stands , germany may find it difficult to come back if they go behind early in matches - something that most teams need to do if they want to take a major international title .
bildunterschrift : klose showed his age in executing his celebratory front flip - he landed on his backside , not his feet the center forward this position is one of the biggest question marks in the team .
if the russia match is anything to go by , loew could likely rely on a 4-3-3 formation for much of the tournament in south africa .
that essentially means the battle to fill the lone central forward slot is between miroslav klose and mario gomez , the same pair of players contesting the same position at their mutual club bayern munich .
for now klose , who will be 32 years old next summer , gets the nod because he , in contrast to gomez , has been effective for the national squad in the past .
but he 's clearly lost a bit of athleticism , so in his heart of hearts , loew might well prefer the 24-year-old gomez .
loew choice will probably be influenced by how much playing time the two strikers get at bayern munich .
however that situation turns out , though , what loew does n't have is a center forward who can create goal opportunities for himself a la wayne rooney for england or thierry henry for france .
that means that germany could have trouble against other defensively oriented teams like italy .
as one of the best teams at the back in the world , germany could certainly fly high in south africa , and no nation will relish facing them .
but their creative deficiencies at the front also mean that loew 's men , if they face tough opponents early on , could end up smack on their backsides .

but how does the team measure up to the world 's top national teams ?
deutsche welle 's jefferson chase takes a closer look . the one moment that best symbolizes the 1-0 win over moscow that qualified germany for the 2010 world cup in south africa was directly after the lone goal was scored .
striker miroslav klose celebrated with one of his trademark forward flips - and only narrowly avoided landing on his backside .
match reports in german newspapers , perhaps understandably , were full of superlatives about germany 's gutsy away win .
but that 1-0 victory was of the knife-edge variety , unlike germany 's 1-0 loss to spain in the 2008 european championships , the last time coach joachim loew had a chance to win a title .
so have germany improved enough to draw level with the spaniards or brazil ?
or are they more on a par with other large european nations like england , the netherlands and italy .
here 's a back-to-front run-through of the strengths and weaknesses of the german squad .
defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adler could become the next in a long line of stellar german national keepers the one position about which loew has absolutely no worries is goal .
24-year-old rene adler was the key to germany 's victory , making a number of world-class saves , and seems to have sealed his position as germany 's number one .
the young keeper 's most brilliant moment in moscow came in the 73rd minute , when russian midfielder igor semshov was clear on the right side and slotted a crisp pass in the direction of two teammates waiting in front of goal .
adler not only got a hand to the ball but cleverly deflected it over the end line .
and should adler get hurt , loew can call on robert enke , manuel neuer or even tim wiese who 've all proved their worth at the international level .
left back philipp lahm is arguably the best in the world at his position so his selection is a no-brainer .
interior defenders per mertesacker and heiko westermann provide a solid anchor in the back four .
youngster serdar tasci could also play a role .
the big question is right back .
jerome boateng , who made his national-team debut in russia , showed he was capable of provided some welcome offensive pressure .
but the 21-year-old also got himself sent off with a red card .
loew 's task will be to get the youngster enough experience in friendlies between now and next june that he no longer poses a risk .
otherwise , he 'll be forced to fall back on arne friedrich , who 's been mediocre at best when wearing the german kit .
defensive midfield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack is a force in midfield but germany could use a threat like russia 's andrei arshavin though not the force he once was german captain michael ballack is the lynchpin of the german squad .
the 33-year-old not only wins lots of challenges but is responsible for the opening passes for germany 's offense .
to cover ballack 's back when he presses forward , simon rolfes is a good choice .
and thomas hitzlsperger is also a more offensive option because of his ability to blast in shots from long-range .
if ballack were to go down to injury , though , germany would be in trouble .
ballack is to germany what gennaro gattuso has been to italy , and loew needs to plan , as best he can , for the eventuality that his captain is unavailable .
the problem is that no one currently on the squad or on the radar screen has the ability to fill the stopper-meets-playmaker role ballack occupies .
offensive midfield and wingers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is counting on youngsters like jerome boateng , marko marin and mesut oezil the emergence of mesut oezil represents the biggest improvement of germany 's likely 2010 squad over the 2008 edition .
the 20-year-old displayed both his pace and his eye for his teammates in setting up the lone goal in moscow that punched germany 's world cup ticket .
but after that , the quality tails off .
bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski are active but relatively inefficient players who 've never lived up their potential .
it will be interesting to see whether youngster marko marin , oezil 's equally fleet-footed teammate at werder bremen , can break into the germany 's starting eleven .
but even if he does , a comparison with the world 's top teams suggests that germany 's offensive midfield is a relative weakness .
spain are spoiled for choice with xabi alonso , xavi , fabregas , iniesta and senna .
brazil , too , can chose from nearly a dozen top-quality midfielders , including kaka , whose skills and creativity are far superior to any member of the german squad .
thus , as the squad stands , germany may find it difficult to come back if they go behind early in matches - something that most teams need to do if they want to take a major international title .
bildunterschrift : klose showed his age in executing his celebratory front flip - he landed on his backside , not his feet the center forward this position is one of the biggest question marks in the team .
if the russia match is anything to go by , loew could likely rely on a 4-3-3 formation for much of the tournament in south africa .
that essentially means the battle to fill the lone central forward slot is between miroslav klose and mario gomez , the same pair of players contesting the same position at their mutual club bayern munich .
for now klose , who will be 32 years old next summer , gets the nod because he , in contrast to gomez , has been effective for the national squad in the past .
but he 's clearly lost a bit of athleticism , so in his heart of hearts , loew might well prefer the 24-year-old gomez .
loew choice will probably be influenced by how much playing time the two strikers get at bayern munich .
however that situation turns out , though , what loew does n't have is a center forward who can create goal opportunities for himself a la wayne rooney for england or thierry henry for france .
that means that germany could have trouble against other defensively oriented teams like italy .
as one of the best teams at the back in the world , germany could certainly fly high in south africa , and no nation will relish facing them .
but their creative deficiencies at the front also mean that loew 's men , if they face tough opponents early on , could end up smack on their backsides .

" logicomix : an epic search for truth " follows british philosopher , logician and pacifist bertrand russell -lrb- 1872-1970 -rrb- in his tortuous quest for the foundations of mathematics , and his search for logic as a shield from the insanity that consumed other members of his family . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " logicomix " tracks the foundation of mathematics the story uses his relationships with the great thinkers and mathematicians of the era , two of his four marriages and historical events in europe such as the rise of nazism as a backdrop for the novel 's more abstract and philosophical subject matter . unexpected success originally published in greek in the fall of 2008 , " logicomix " was a hit at home .
but its authors were unprepared for the reception in the united states and britain , where it sold out on the first day of its release in september . the novel received positive reviews from such publications as the guardian and the new york times , which described the story as presented " with real graphic verve " and " delightful simplicity . " it sped up bestseller lists to occupy top 10 spots in comics , fiction and general book rankings on both amazon.com and amazon.co.uk.
it also recently hit no. 1 on the new york times paperback graphic book list . " i think the publishers -lrb- bloomsbury -rrb- were shocked , " apostolos doxiadis , who co-authored the story with computer science professor christos papadimitriou at the university of california , berkeley , told afp news agency .
" i was shocked too . " bertrand " not a mega-nerd " in searching for a narrator who would fit the novel 's context , doxiadis said bertrand russell was " ideal . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russell was n't a mega-nerd , said doxiadis born into a liberal aristocratic english family and the grandson of a former british prime minister , russell is considered one of the 20th century 's most important philosophers . he was an early advocate of sexual freedom , he was jailed for pacifism during world war i and later campaigned against nuclear proliferation and the vietnam war . " he was a political activist , a womanizer , traveler , adventurer , great talker , a wit and a dandy , " doxiadis told afp .
" he was the only one of these characters who was not a mega-nerd . " the long journey to print from initial discussions between the creators to scripting , drawing , inking and coloring , the novel 's completion took seven years - which the author called " a super-marathon . " like many other cartoon books , the album was pieced together like a movie with wall-to-wall story boards and doxiadis , who has a film-making background , acted out the characters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doxiadis was n't deterred by the unusual theme the aim of " logicomix " is " to tell a fascinating story about the history of ideas , " said doxiadis , who published a novel in 2001 entitled " uncle petros and goldbach 's conjecture " about a boy 's quest for knowledge about his reclusive mathematician uncle . " the fact that this idea looked like , to put it mildly , not a very likely idea for a comic book , never deterred me , " he said .
" in ' logicomix , ' the story i think is in some ways emblematic of much of what happened in the 20th century , with its search for certainty , for knowledge , and what often went with it , for power over life .

24-year-old rene adler was the key to germany 's victory , making a number of world-class saves , and seems to have sealed his position as germany 's number one .
the young keeper 's most brilliant moment in moscow came in the 73rd minute , when russian midfielder igor semshov was clear on the right side and slotted a crisp pass in the direction of two teammates waiting in front of goal .
adler not only got a hand to the ball but cleverly deflected it over the end line .
and should adler get hurt , loew can call on robert enke , manuel neuer or even tim wiese who 've all proved their worth at the international level .
left back philipp lahm is arguably the best in the world at his position so his selection is a no-brainer .
interior defenders per mertesacker and heiko westermann provide a solid anchor in the back four .
youngster serdar tasci could also play a role .
the big question is right back .
jerome boateng , who made his national-team debut in russia , showed he was capable of provided some welcome offensive pressure .
but the 21-year-old also got himself sent off with a red card .
loew 's task will be to get the youngster enough experience in friendlies between now and next june that he no longer poses a risk .
otherwise , he 'll be forced to fall back on arne friedrich , who 's been mediocre at best when wearing the german kit .
defensive midfield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack is a force in midfield but germany could use a threat like russia 's andrei arshavin though not the force he once was german captain michael ballack is the lynchpin of the german squad .
the 33-year-old not only wins lots of challenges but is responsible for the opening passes for germany 's offense .
to cover ballack 's back when he presses forward , simon rolfes is a good choice .
and thomas hitzlsperger is also a more offensive option because of his ability to blast in shots from long-range .
if ballack were to go down to injury , though , germany would be in trouble .
ballack is to germany what gennaro gattuso has been to italy , and loew needs to plan , as best he can , for the eventuality that his captain is unavailable .
the problem is that no one currently on the squad or on the radar screen has the ability to fill the stopper-meets-playmaker role ballack occupies .
offensive midfield and wingers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is counting on youngsters like jerome boateng , marko marin and mesut oezil the emergence of mesut oezil represents the biggest improvement of germany 's likely 2010 squad over the 2008 edition .
the 20-year-old displayed both his pace and his eye for his teammates in setting up the lone goal in moscow that punched germany 's world cup ticket .
but after that , the quality tails off .
bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski are active but relatively inefficient players who 've never lived up their potential .
it will be interesting to see whether youngster marko marin , oezil 's equally fleet-footed teammate at werder bremen , can break into the germany 's starting eleven .
but even if he does , a comparison with the world 's top teams suggests that germany 's offensive midfield is a relative weakness .
spain are spoiled for choice with xabi alonso , xavi , fabregas , iniesta and senna .
brazil , too , can chose from nearly a dozen top-quality midfielders , including kaka , whose skills and creativity are far superior to any member of the german squad .
thus , as the squad stands , germany may find it difficult to come back if they go behind early in matches - something that most teams need to do if they want to take a major international title .
bildunterschrift : klose showed his age in executing his celebratory front flip - he landed on his backside , not his feet the center forward this position is one of the biggest question marks in the team .
if the russia match is anything to go by , loew could likely rely on a 4-3-3 formation for much of the tournament in south africa .
that essentially means the battle to fill the lone central forward slot is between miroslav klose and mario gomez , the same pair of players contesting the same position at their mutual club bayern munich .
for now klose , who will be 32 years old next summer , gets the nod because he , in contrast to gomez , has been effective for the national squad in the past .
but he 's clearly lost a bit of athleticism , so in his heart of hearts , loew might well prefer the 24-year-old gomez .
loew choice will probably be influenced by how much playing time the two strikers get at bayern munich .
however that situation turns out , though , what loew does n't have is a center forward who can create goal opportunities for himself a la wayne rooney for england or thierry henry for france .
that means that germany could have trouble against other defensively oriented teams like italy .
as one of the best teams at the back in the world , germany could certainly fly high in south africa , and no nation will relish facing them .
but their creative deficiencies at the front also mean that loew 's men , if they face tough opponents early on , could end up smack on their backsides .

but how does the team measure up to the world 's top national teams ?
deutsche welle 's jefferson chase takes a closer look . the one moment that best symbolizes the 1-0 win over moscow that qualified germany for the 2010 world cup in south africa was directly after the lone goal was scored .
striker miroslav klose celebrated with one of his trademark forward flips - and only narrowly avoided landing on his backside .
match reports in german newspapers , perhaps understandably , were full of superlatives about germany 's gutsy away win .
but that 1-0 victory was of the knife-edge variety , unlike germany 's 1-0 loss to spain in the 2008 european championships , the last time coach joachim loew had a chance to win a title .
so have germany improved enough to draw level with the spaniards or brazil ?
or are they more on a par with other large european nations like england , the netherlands and italy .
here 's a back-to-front run-through of the strengths and weaknesses of the german squad .

the new power-sharing government of northern ireland , a landmark accord between the protestant conservative , pro-british dup and catholic socialist republicans sinn fein , agreed in principle on the transfer of responsibility from the united kingdom to northern ireland , however , differences over the details of the devolution process led to discord between the parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in march 2009 , two british soldiers died in an attack on military barracks near antrim sinn fein and the dup have been in conflict over when powers for policing should be devolved from london , the former insisting it should have happened already and the latter choosing caution and saying it will only assent to devolution with an adequate financial package in place and broad community confidence . inla lays down arms for peace the peace process , started in 1998 by the good friday agreement , ended three decades of conflict in northern ireland , in which roughly 3,500 people were killed .
its full implementation , rather than squabbling over its fine points , is vital to peaceful governance in northern ireland as stressed by clinton .
clinton 's visit comes as the irish national liberation army -lrb- inla -rrb- , a republican paramilitary group infamous for its violent crimes during northern ireland 's troubles , has signaled it 's prepared to lay down arms .
it has renounced its armed struggle , releasing a statement saying , " following a process of serious debate ... it has concluded that the armed struggle is over .

but that is easier said than done , as the president of the czech republic appears at pains to demonstrate . euroskeptic czech president vaclav klaus chose his moment well .
just hours before poland became a signatory to the much-talked about european treaty , he managed to keep the union 's eyes on him by saying he would not add his name to the pact until he was satisfied it will not destabilize national property rights .
klaus is concerned that the european charter of fundamental rights , part of the lisbon treaty , could allow the three million germans expelled from czechoslovakia at the end of the second world war to reclaim property confiscated from them at the time .
the issue came up after the fall of communism , but the czech courts have thrown out claims brought forth by expellees , and klaus is clearly prepared to go to great lengths to prevent an upsetting of that particular apple cart .
but in so doing , he is attracting much negative attention , and winning no eu popularity contests .
although relations between germany and the czech republic - which border one another - are essentially quite good , klaus 's latest demands have met with criticism in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech president vaclav klaus says he wo n't take no for an answer christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- member and parliamentary secretary for defense , christian schmidt , told the dpa news agency that it was unnecessary to play the german expellees card and that there is already a european convention of human rights .
" everything that concerns the lisbon treaty has been negotiated , " schmidt said .
" to come now , shortly before the end game with new demands , leads to the impression that he only wants to delay . "
if they can , so can we but klaus insists it is his right to demand a binding guarantee that prevents expellees from using eu laws to circumnavigate the czech judicial system .
he cited britain and poland , both of which negotiated an opt-out before the pact was signed at the end of 2007 - britain over fears that collective bargaining rights could lead to increased strike action , and poland in order to protect the values of a deeply catholic society - saying he wanted something similar for his country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president lech kaczynski signed the treaty at the weekend " i am convinced that the czech republic must at least post facto negotiate a similar exemption , " klaus told reporters , adding that he thought a " non-standard " procedure could get the job done quickly .
in order to try and convince the rest of the eu to accommodate his wishes , the czech president would first have to submit a proposal .
the alternative procedure the easier way forward could be to have eu leaders approve a declaration which is not intrinsically a part of the treaty , such as they did when ireland asked for a guarantee that the lisbon treaty would not interfere with laws on taxes and abortion .
but ladislav jakl , an aide to klaus , poured water on that idea on czech television on sunday .
he said the president would " not be satisfied by any declaration but only guarantees for every citizen , " adding that the condition was " fundamental , necessary , unbreachable . "
it is certainly problematic for the eu that klaus has waited until this late stage in the ratification process to ask to see it tweaked in his favor .
what happens next will depend to some degree on the czech parliament which is scheduled to meet on monday to discuss the latest spanner the president has thrown into the ratification process works. tkw / afp / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but that is easier said than done , as the president of the czech republic appears at pains to demonstrate . euroskeptic czech president vaclav klaus chose his moment well .
just hours before poland became a signatory to the much-talked about european treaty , he managed to keep the union 's eyes on him by saying he would not add his name to the pact until he was satisfied it will not destabilize national property rights .
klaus is concerned that the european charter of fundamental rights , part of the lisbon treaty , could allow the three million germans expelled from czechoslovakia at the end of the second world war to reclaim property confiscated from them at the time .
the issue came up after the fall of communism , but the czech courts have thrown out claims brought forth by expellees , and klaus is clearly prepared to go to great lengths to prevent an upsetting of that particular apple cart .
but in so doing , he is attracting much negative attention , and winning no eu popularity contests .
although relations between germany and the czech republic - which border one another - are essentially quite good , klaus 's latest demands have met with criticism in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech president vaclav klaus says he wo n't take no for an answer christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- member and parliamentary secretary for defense , christian schmidt , told the dpa news agency that it was unnecessary to play the german expellees card and that there is already a european convention of human rights .
" everything that concerns the lisbon treaty has been negotiated , " schmidt said .
" to come now , shortly before the end game with new demands , leads to the impression that he only wants to delay . "
if they can , so can we but klaus insists it is his right to demand a binding guarantee that prevents expellees from using eu laws to circumnavigate the czech judicial system .
he cited britain and poland , both of which negotiated an opt-out before the pact was signed at the end of 2007 - britain over fears that collective bargaining rights could lead to increased strike action , and poland in order to protect the values of a deeply catholic society - saying he wanted something similar for his country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president lech kaczynski signed the treaty at the weekend " i am convinced that the czech republic must at least post facto negotiate a similar exemption , " klaus told reporters , adding that he thought a " non-standard " procedure could get the job done quickly .
in order to try and convince the rest of the eu to accommodate his wishes , the czech president would first have to submit a proposal .
the alternative procedure the easier way forward could be to have eu leaders approve a declaration which is not intrinsically a part of the treaty , such as they did when ireland asked for a guarantee that the lisbon treaty would not interfere with laws on taxes and abortion .
but ladislav jakl , an aide to klaus , poured water on that idea on czech television on sunday .
he said the president would " not be satisfied by any declaration but only guarantees for every citizen , " adding that the condition was " fundamental , necessary , unbreachable . "
it is certainly problematic for the eu that klaus has waited until this late stage in the ratification process to ask to see it tweaked in his favor .
what happens next will depend to some degree on the czech parliament which is scheduled to meet on monday to discuss the latest spanner the president has thrown into the ratification process works. tkw / afp / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the weapons were sent in 2006 and were intended for local police and army personnel . arms dealers in the region told german public radio that hundreds of german weapons were for sale carrying a price tag of over 680 euros a piece -lrb- $ 1,000 -rrb- .
in 2006 , the german defense ministry shipped 10,000 old walther-p1 pistols to the afghan interior ministry to equip afghan police and army .
however , both the german government and the responsible us-led security team in afghanistan reportedly failed to properly monitor the guns ' whereabouts .
the us unit said that it only had detailed records of 4,563 pistols out of a total 10,000 . current and former afghan soldiers and police officers are said to be among those illegally selling and trafficking the pistols , some of which have ended up in pakistan 's north-west border provinces and neighboring tribal areas .
the german guns were also being traded in northern afghanistan where german soldiers are stationed .
the team of ndr radio reporters who discovered the black market guns said it 's not clear exactly how they ended up there .
" apparently , most of these pistols have n't been stolen , but were simply taken home and sold by former police officers and soldiers after they 'd left the service , " said christoph heinzle , who headed the ndr team .
" but corruption and theft can not be ruled out because neither the afghan authorities nor the us and german armed forces carry out effective controls to prevent -lsb- theft -rsb- . "
greens , police union call for investigation the 2006 delivery was carried out despite a german government principle that german weapons could not be supplied to non-nato countries .
germany 's then coalition government of social democrats and greens made an exception , but the decision reportedly only reached parliament after the weapons had already arrived in afghanistan .
the fresh allegations have prompted calls for an investigation by germany 's green party and the police trade union .
green party spokesman winfried nachtwei accused the grand coalition government , which was in power when the guns were shipped , of a " grossly negligent course of action , " and called for the matter to be investigated in the interest of german security forces and civilian experts sent to afghanistan .
" it would be truly absurd if soldiers were threatened by weapons irresponsibly delivered by germany , " nachtwei said .
joerg radek of the police union said the danger was that " such weapons could fall into the wrong hands .
it is a risk for the germans deployed there , a risk to security in the country . "
defense ministry spokesman thomas raabe told reporters in berlin on monday that officials in kabul had guaranteed the weapons would only be distributed among security forces .
he said the ministry would be investigating any unlawful sales of the guns .

the weapons were sent in 2006 and were intended for local police and army personnel . arms dealers in the region told german public radio that hundreds of german weapons were for sale carrying a price tag of over 680 euros a piece -lrb- $ 1,000 -rrb- .
in 2006 , the german defense ministry shipped 10,000 old walther-p1 pistols to the afghan interior ministry to equip afghan police and army .
however , both the german government and the responsible us-led security team in afghanistan reportedly failed to properly monitor the guns ' whereabouts .
the us unit said that it only had detailed records of 4,563 pistols out of a total 10,000 . current and former afghan soldiers and police officers are said to be among those illegally selling and trafficking the pistols , some of which have ended up in pakistan 's north-west border provinces and neighboring tribal areas .
the german guns were also being traded in northern afghanistan where german soldiers are stationed .
the team of ndr radio reporters who discovered the black market guns said it 's not clear exactly how they ended up there .
" apparently , most of these pistols have n't been stolen , but were simply taken home and sold by former police officers and soldiers after they 'd left the service , " said christoph heinzle , who headed the ndr team .
" but corruption and theft can not be ruled out because neither the afghan authorities nor the us and german armed forces carry out effective controls to prevent -lsb- theft -rsb- . "
greens , police union call for investigation the 2006 delivery was carried out despite a german government principle that german weapons could not be supplied to non-nato countries .
germany 's then coalition government of social democrats and greens made an exception , but the decision reportedly only reached parliament after the weapons had already arrived in afghanistan .
the fresh allegations have prompted calls for an investigation by germany 's green party and the police trade union .
green party spokesman winfried nachtwei accused the grand coalition government , which was in power when the guns were shipped , of a " grossly negligent course of action , " and called for the matter to be investigated in the interest of german security forces and civilian experts sent to afghanistan .
" it would be truly absurd if soldiers were threatened by weapons irresponsibly delivered by germany , " nachtwei said .
joerg radek of the police union said the danger was that " such weapons could fall into the wrong hands .
it is a risk for the germans deployed there , a risk to security in the country . "
defense ministry spokesman thomas raabe told reporters in berlin on monday that officials in kabul had guaranteed the weapons would only be distributed among security forces .
he said the ministry would be investigating any unlawful sales of the guns .
" of course we 'll be looking for evidence of any wrongdoing , but i want to underscore that the afghan government is independent in its decision-making and that we 'll continue to support its efforts to build up effective security forces .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 12.10.2009 dialect poetry in translation connects regional cultures across europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franconian poetry is closely linked to the land poetry written in regional dialect helps preserve local language and way of life in a globalized world .
but a group of german and scottish poets who have translated it found out just how similar europeans are . from landlocked farms in the franconia region of bavaria to fishing villages on the coast of scotland or the shetland islands , regional dialects throughout consolidated and globalized europe are something of an endangered cultural resource . the task of preserving them goes in part to dialect poets , including two germans and two scots who have been involved in a project to translate regional verse . last year they held a workshop in fife , scotland , where they communicated through oral translators and were provided with literal " gloss " translations in both languages of each other 's poems .
today , they say the experience has had a lasting effect on how they view their poetry . ties to the land the sentiments of dialect poems are often expressed through rustic and geographically-bound language .
while franconian poets often work with imagery and idiomatic expressions based on a life of farming , the scots poets do so with a life of fishing in mind .
in some instances , this makes literal translation impossible and forces the poets to search for comparable literary devices . isabel cole organized the workshop and edits a berlin-based journal of german literature in english translation called " no man 's land . "
she said dialect is less accepted in germany as a form of literary expression than it is in scotland . " i think if people are open-minded about literature , dialects or non-standard literature , it is a real enrichment , " said cole .
" that 's something i actually miss in standard german literature .
one thing i like about germany is how many dialects there are , and how people cultivate their dialects .
they have really different ways of expressing themselves . " bildunterschrift : fishing is an integral part of local scottish culture the personal element fitzgerald kusz , a franconian poet from nuremberg , said that in translating scots poems he was surprised to discover traces of that dialect 's germanic roots .
kusz has spoken franconian since childhood and regards his dialect as an intimate and comfortable form of communication . " on one hand , globalization continues strengthen its hold , " he said , " high german , the unified language , can be heard on television in every village .
but there is , in fact , a movement among the people to keep their languages alive . " and that is one primary goal of dialect literature , he added . one of kusz ' scots counterparts , alexander hutchison , said " a shift into the dialect makes things much more personal … for me it 's just a different instrument . " although hutchison , who lives in glasgow , is not optimistic about current attempts to cultivate dialect in scotland 's schools , he said that in poetry the scots dialect is every bit as viable a form of self-expression as standard english . " if people do n't understand the dialect , they ca n't connect , " he said .
" but if they do understand it , then there 's an immediacy - a personal element - that you can not get in the parent language .
there 's just as much possibility of a lack in the parent language as there is in the dialect .
they operate in different dimensions to me . " the flip-side of globalization franconian poet helmut haberkamm , who grew up in a farming village not far from erlangen , told deutsche welle in an email interview that franconian is " deeply and unmistakably connected to my childhood and the early emotions and experiences which formed me , predetermined parts of my life , and arranged my existence . " franconian is inextricably dissolved in my person .
it is my language of emotion and intimacy , " he added . haberkamm has translated the works of shetlandic poet robert alan jamieson .
although the environments of sheltand and franconia vary greatly , haberkamm said he found striking similarities in the way nature is woven into the lives and languages of both regions . in translating jamieson 's poems , he said he wanted " to bring out the simple , gripping way these people express themselves . " haberkamm described regionalism as the " necessary flip-side of globalization , " adding that " people without an understanding of their roots and concrete values are easily manipulated . " endangered by mobility although hutchison expressed similar sentiments while speaking about his desire to preserve scots and see it flourish , he compared the dialect to a " threatened habitat , " endangered by time and changing patterns of human behavior .
having lived for years in north america , hutchison said he understands the pressures modern existence exerts on local cultures . " people move around , people move off , people do n't stay in one place long enough to develop it , " he said .
" there are new dialects springing up all the time .
if there 's enough settled community , they 'll find a language . " i 'm always wary of standardization , of people trying to impose things .
as a poet , i never want to make rules for other poets . " author : gerhard schneibel editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

lagerfeld slammed the idea as " absurd , " arguing that the world of fashion is supposed to be about " dreams and illusions . "
from 2001 to 2002 , lagerfeld displayed an iron will as he whittled some 40 kilos -lrb- 90 pounds -rrb- off his frame in just 13 months .

but a group of german and scottish poets who have translated it found out just how similar europeans are . from landlocked farms in the franconia region of bavaria to fishing villages on the coast of scotland or the shetland islands , regional dialects throughout consolidated and globalized europe are something of an endangered cultural resource . the task of preserving them goes in part to dialect poets , including two germans and two scots who have been involved in a project to translate regional verse . last year they held a workshop in fife , scotland , where they communicated through oral translators and were provided with literal " gloss " translations in both languages of each other 's poems .
today , they say the experience has had a lasting effect on how they view their poetry . ties to the land the sentiments of dialect poems are often expressed through rustic and geographically-bound language .
while franconian poets often work with imagery and idiomatic expressions based on a life of farming , the scots poets do so with a life of fishing in mind .
in some instances , this makes literal translation impossible and forces the poets to search for comparable literary devices . isabel cole organized the workshop and edits a berlin-based journal of german literature in english translation called " no man 's land . "
she said dialect is less accepted in germany as a form of literary expression than it is in scotland . " i think if people are open-minded about literature , dialects or non-standard literature , it is a real enrichment , " said cole .
" that 's something i actually miss in standard german literature .
one thing i like about germany is how many dialects there are , and how people cultivate their dialects .
they have really different ways of expressing themselves . " bildunterschrift : fishing is an integral part of local scottish culture the personal element fitzgerald kusz , a franconian poet from nuremberg , said that in translating scots poems he was surprised to discover traces of that dialect 's germanic roots .
kusz has spoken franconian since childhood and regards his dialect as an intimate and comfortable form of communication . " on one hand , globalization continues strengthen its hold , " he said , " high german , the unified language , can be heard on television in every village .
but there is , in fact , a movement among the people to keep their languages alive . " and that is one primary goal of dialect literature , he added . one of kusz ' scots counterparts , alexander hutchison , said " a shift into the dialect makes things much more personal … for me it 's just a different instrument . " although hutchison , who lives in glasgow , is not optimistic about current attempts to cultivate dialect in scotland 's schools , he said that in poetry the scots dialect is every bit as viable a form of self-expression as standard english . " if people do n't understand the dialect , they ca n't connect , " he said .
" but if they do understand it , then there 's an immediacy - a personal element - that you can not get in the parent language .
there 's just as much possibility of a lack in the parent language as there is in the dialect .
they operate in different dimensions to me . " the flip-side of globalization franconian poet helmut haberkamm , who grew up in a farming village not far from erlangen , told deutsche welle in an email interview that franconian is " deeply and unmistakably connected to my childhood and the early emotions and experiences which formed me , predetermined parts of my life , and arranged my existence . " franconian is inextricably dissolved in my person .
it is my language of emotion and intimacy , " he added . haberkamm has translated the works of shetlandic poet robert alan jamieson .
although the environments of sheltand and franconia vary greatly , haberkamm said he found striking similarities in the way nature is woven into the lives and languages of both regions . in translating jamieson 's poems , he said he wanted " to bring out the simple , gripping way these people express themselves . " haberkamm described regionalism as the " necessary flip-side of globalization , " adding that " people without an understanding of their roots and concrete values are easily manipulated . " endangered by mobility although hutchison expressed similar sentiments while speaking about his desire to preserve scots and see it flourish , he compared the dialect to a " threatened habitat , " endangered by time and changing patterns of human behavior .
having lived for years in north america , hutchison said he understands the pressures modern existence exerts on local cultures . " people move around , people move off , people do n't stay in one place long enough to develop it , " he said .
" there are new dialects springing up all the time .

can it escape the oil curse and become an example to other developing states ? in many ways ghana serves as a model among african countries .
compared to many other west african nations it has been very stable in recent years .
ghana 's peaceful election last year and the successful transition of government from one party to another this year were considered the pinnacle of the country 's progress , which was highlighted by us president barack obama 's visit to accra this summer .
but after the recent announcement by oil giant exxonmobil that it was buying a four billion-dollar stake in ghana 's jubilee oil field , the country is now facing a task that may be even more challenging than the democratic reform process it has undergone : to prove that it can not only successfully deal with a powerful multinational , but also that the windfall that is generated by what is considered to be one of africa 's biggest oil fields does n't end up in the pockets of a few insiders , but improves the wealth and well-being of ghana 's society .
" the stakes are very high , " writes ian gary , an expert in extractive industries , in a report about ghana 's oil find and its consequences for society for the international aid agency oxfam .
" while many ghanaian government officials are confident they can meet the challenge , oil 's threat to democratic development should not be underestimated . "
high stakes , big profits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exxonmobil 's bid beat out other oil giants while the stakes are high , so is the profit .
according to an estimate by the international monetary fund which is cited by gary , ghana 's government can expect revenues from oil and gas up to 20 billion dollars during the production period between 2012 and 2030 for the jubilee field alone .
so what are ghana 's chances to avoid the spell of the so-called oil curse ? " i think that ghana could really be one country which could be a positive example to the world and it could also be profitable and beneficial for the country , " claudia kemfert , an energy specialist at berlin 's economic research institute diw , tells deutsche welle .
" ghana could really profit from this deal and also from the oil market . "
what 's required , adds kemfert , is that ghana 's government puts in place a good political strategy on how it wants to use the oil revenues .
talking to deutsche welle , ulrike bickel , an energy expert with germany 's catholic relief agency misereor , is more skeptical : " we obviously see the danger that ghana could also become a victim of the oil curse , that its oil wealth wo n't benefit the people and that oil revenues just like in neighboring countries , vanish instead of being spent on health , education or sustainable social development . " while bickel points out that ghana , a country without previous experience in the oil sector , has taken positive steps such as signing on to the so-called extractive industries transparency initiative , which mandates its members to openly document the flow of revenues , she adds that it is still far too early to tell whether it will be implemented .
bildunterschrift : president obama 's visit , with ghana president john atta mills highlighted the country 's progress negative example an example that positive declarations and good intentions do n't necessarily translate into enforceable action is chad .
" before the world bank agreed to a large loan for the chad-cameroon pipeline there was an agreement that a fund for future generations would be created and that up to 70 percent of the oil revenues would be used for priority social sector developments , " says bickel .
" but as soon as the oil revenue started to flow , chad 's government , which was fighting a civil war , dissolved the fund for future generations and extended the priority sector developments to include national security .
that means the oil revenue is used to buy large quantities of weapons . " that does n't mean that agreements and declarations are n't useful .
they definitely are .
but reality eventually is the ultimate test whether those agreements are fulfilled .
ghana , say the analysts , among developing african nations , is perhaps best prepared to manage its oil wealth carefully . as oxfam expert gary wrote in his report on ghana : " oil wealth tends to erode democratic accountability .
ghana 's challenge will be to ensure that the right institutions and transparent policies are in place before oil production starts . "

can it escape the oil curse and become an example to other developing states ? in many ways ghana serves as a model among african countries .
compared to many other west african nations it has been very stable in recent years .
ghana 's peaceful election last year and the successful transition of government from one party to another this year were considered the pinnacle of the country 's progress , which was highlighted by us president barack obama 's visit to accra this summer .
but after the recent announcement by oil giant exxonmobil that it was buying a four billion-dollar stake in ghana 's jubilee oil field , the country is now facing a task that may be even more challenging than the democratic reform process it has undergone : to prove that it can not only successfully deal with a powerful multinational , but also that the windfall that is generated by what is considered to be one of africa 's biggest oil fields does n't end up in the pockets of a few insiders , but improves the wealth and well-being of ghana 's society .
" the stakes are very high , " writes ian gary , an expert in extractive industries , in a report about ghana 's oil find and its consequences for society for the international aid agency oxfam .
" while many ghanaian government officials are confident they can meet the challenge , oil 's threat to democratic development should not be underestimated . "
high stakes , big profits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exxonmobil 's bid beat out other oil giants while the stakes are high , so is the profit .
according to an estimate by the international monetary fund which is cited by gary , ghana 's government can expect revenues from oil and gas up to 20 billion dollars during the production period between 2012 and 2030 for the jubilee field alone .
so what are ghana 's chances to avoid the spell of the so-called oil curse ? " i think that ghana could really be one country which could be a positive example to the world and it could also be profitable and beneficial for the country , " claudia kemfert , an energy specialist at berlin 's economic research institute diw , tells deutsche welle .
" ghana could really profit from this deal and also from the oil market . "
what 's required , adds kemfert , is that ghana 's government puts in place a good political strategy on how it wants to use the oil revenues .
talking to deutsche welle , ulrike bickel , an energy expert with germany 's catholic relief agency misereor , is more skeptical : " we obviously see the danger that ghana could also become a victim of the oil curse , that its oil wealth wo n't benefit the people and that oil revenues just like in neighboring countries , vanish instead of being spent on health , education or sustainable social development . " while bickel points out that ghana , a country without previous experience in the oil sector , has taken positive steps such as signing on to the so-called extractive industries transparency initiative , which mandates its members to openly document the flow of revenues , she adds that it is still far too early to tell whether it will be implemented .
bildunterschrift : president obama 's visit , with ghana president john atta mills highlighted the country 's progress negative example an example that positive declarations and good intentions do n't necessarily translate into enforceable action is chad .
" before the world bank agreed to a large loan for the chad-cameroon pipeline there was an agreement that a fund for future generations would be created and that up to 70 percent of the oil revenues would be used for priority social sector developments , " says bickel .
" but as soon as the oil revenue started to flow , chad 's government , which was fighting a civil war , dissolved the fund for future generations and extended the priority sector developments to include national security .
that means the oil revenue is used to buy large quantities of weapons . " that does n't mean that agreements and declarations are n't useful .
they definitely are .
but reality eventually is the ultimate test whether those agreements are fulfilled .
ghana , say the analysts , among developing african nations , is perhaps best prepared to manage its oil wealth carefully . as oxfam expert gary wrote in his report on ghana : " oil wealth tends to erode democratic accountability .
ghana 's challenge will be to ensure that the right institutions and transparent policies are in place before oil production starts . "
currently oil production at the jubilee field is scheduled for 2010 . author : michael knigge editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but a group of german and scottish poets who have translated it found out just how similar europeans are . from landlocked farms in the franconia region of bavaria to fishing villages on the coast of scotland or the shetland islands , regional dialects throughout consolidated and globalized europe are something of an endangered cultural resource . the task of preserving them goes in part to dialect poets , including two germans and two scots who have been involved in a project to translate regional verse . last year they held a workshop in fife , scotland , where they communicated through oral translators and were provided with literal " gloss " translations in both languages of each other 's poems .
today , they say the experience has had a lasting effect on how they view their poetry . ties to the land the sentiments of dialect poems are often expressed through rustic and geographically-bound language .
while franconian poets often work with imagery and idiomatic expressions based on a life of farming , the scots poets do so with a life of fishing in mind .
in some instances , this makes literal translation impossible and forces the poets to search for comparable literary devices . isabel cole organized the workshop and edits a berlin-based journal of german literature in english translation called " no man 's land . "
she said dialect is less accepted in germany as a form of literary expression than it is in scotland . " i think if people are open-minded about literature , dialects or non-standard literature , it is a real enrichment , " said cole .
" that 's something i actually miss in standard german literature .
one thing i like about germany is how many dialects there are , and how people cultivate their dialects .
they have really different ways of expressing themselves . " bildunterschrift : fishing is an integral part of local scottish culture the personal element fitzgerald kusz , a franconian poet from nuremberg , said that in translating scots poems he was surprised to discover traces of that dialect 's germanic roots .
kusz has spoken franconian since childhood and regards his dialect as an intimate and comfortable form of communication . " on one hand , globalization continues strengthen its hold , " he said , " high german , the unified language , can be heard on television in every village .
but there is , in fact , a movement among the people to keep their languages alive . " and that is one primary goal of dialect literature , he added . one of kusz ' scots counterparts , alexander hutchison , said " a shift into the dialect makes things much more personal … for me it 's just a different instrument . " although hutchison , who lives in glasgow , is not optimistic about current attempts to cultivate dialect in scotland 's schools , he said that in poetry the scots dialect is every bit as viable a form of self-expression as standard english . " if people do n't understand the dialect , they ca n't connect , " he said .
" but if they do understand it , then there 's an immediacy - a personal element - that you can not get in the parent language .
there 's just as much possibility of a lack in the parent language as there is in the dialect .
they operate in different dimensions to me . " the flip-side of globalization franconian poet helmut haberkamm , who grew up in a farming village not far from erlangen , told deutsche welle in an email interview that franconian is " deeply and unmistakably connected to my childhood and the early emotions and experiences which formed me , predetermined parts of my life , and arranged my existence . " franconian is inextricably dissolved in my person .
it is my language of emotion and intimacy , " he added . haberkamm has translated the works of shetlandic poet robert alan jamieson .
although the environments of sheltand and franconia vary greatly , haberkamm said he found striking similarities in the way nature is woven into the lives and languages of both regions . in translating jamieson 's poems , he said he wanted " to bring out the simple , gripping way these people express themselves . " haberkamm described regionalism as the " necessary flip-side of globalization , " adding that " people without an understanding of their roots and concrete values are easily manipulated . " endangered by mobility although hutchison expressed similar sentiments while speaking about his desire to preserve scots and see it flourish , he compared the dialect to a " threatened habitat , " endangered by time and changing patterns of human behavior .
having lived for years in north america , hutchison said he understands the pressures modern existence exerts on local cultures . " people move around , people move off , people do n't stay in one place long enough to develop it , " he said .

can it escape the oil curse and become an example to other developing states ? in many ways ghana serves as a model among african countries .
compared to many other west african nations it has been very stable in recent years .
ghana 's peaceful election last year and the successful transition of government from one party to another this year were considered the pinnacle of the country 's progress , which was highlighted by us president barack obama 's visit to accra this summer .
but after the recent announcement by oil giant exxonmobil that it was buying a four billion-dollar stake in ghana 's jubilee oil field , the country is now facing a task that may be even more challenging than the democratic reform process it has undergone : to prove that it can not only successfully deal with a powerful multinational , but also that the windfall that is generated by what is considered to be one of africa 's biggest oil fields does n't end up in the pockets of a few insiders , but improves the wealth and well-being of ghana 's society .
" the stakes are very high , " writes ian gary , an expert in extractive industries , in a report about ghana 's oil find and its consequences for society for the international aid agency oxfam .
" while many ghanaian government officials are confident they can meet the challenge , oil 's threat to democratic development should not be underestimated . "
high stakes , big profits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exxonmobil 's bid beat out other oil giants while the stakes are high , so is the profit .
according to an estimate by the international monetary fund which is cited by gary , ghana 's government can expect revenues from oil and gas up to 20 billion dollars during the production period between 2012 and 2030 for the jubilee field alone .
so what are ghana 's chances to avoid the spell of the so-called oil curse ? " i think that ghana could really be one country which could be a positive example to the world and it could also be profitable and beneficial for the country , " claudia kemfert , an energy specialist at berlin 's economic research institute diw , tells deutsche welle .
" ghana could really profit from this deal and also from the oil market . "
what 's required , adds kemfert , is that ghana 's government puts in place a good political strategy on how it wants to use the oil revenues .
talking to deutsche welle , ulrike bickel , an energy expert with germany 's catholic relief agency misereor , is more skeptical : " we obviously see the danger that ghana could also become a victim of the oil curse , that its oil wealth wo n't benefit the people and that oil revenues just like in neighboring countries , vanish instead of being spent on health , education or sustainable social development . " while bickel points out that ghana , a country without previous experience in the oil sector , has taken positive steps such as signing on to the so-called extractive industries transparency initiative , which mandates its members to openly document the flow of revenues , she adds that it is still far too early to tell whether it will be implemented .
bildunterschrift : president obama 's visit , with ghana president john atta mills highlighted the country 's progress negative example an example that positive declarations and good intentions do n't necessarily translate into enforceable action is chad .
" before the world bank agreed to a large loan for the chad-cameroon pipeline there was an agreement that a fund for future generations would be created and that up to 70 percent of the oil revenues would be used for priority social sector developments , " says bickel .
" but as soon as the oil revenue started to flow , chad 's government , which was fighting a civil war , dissolved the fund for future generations and extended the priority sector developments to include national security .
that means the oil revenue is used to buy large quantities of weapons . " that does n't mean that agreements and declarations are n't useful .
they definitely are .
but reality eventually is the ultimate test whether those agreements are fulfilled .
ghana , say the analysts , among developing african nations , is perhaps best prepared to manage its oil wealth carefully . as oxfam expert gary wrote in his report on ghana : " oil wealth tends to erode democratic accountability .
ghana 's challenge will be to ensure that the right institutions and transparent policies are in place before oil production starts . "
currently oil production at the jubilee field is scheduled for 2010 . author : michael knigge editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

can it escape the oil curse and become an example to other developing states ? in many ways ghana serves as a model among african countries .
compared to many other west african nations it has been very stable in recent years .
ghana 's peaceful election last year and the successful transition of government from one party to another this year were considered the pinnacle of the country 's progress , which was highlighted by us president barack obama 's visit to accra this summer .
but after the recent announcement by oil giant exxonmobil that it was buying a four billion-dollar stake in ghana 's jubilee oil field , the country is now facing a task that may be even more challenging than the democratic reform process it has undergone : to prove that it can not only successfully deal with a powerful multinational , but also that the windfall that is generated by what is considered to be one of africa 's biggest oil fields does n't end up in the pockets of a few insiders , but improves the wealth and well-being of ghana 's society .
" the stakes are very high , " writes ian gary , an expert in extractive industries , in a report about ghana 's oil find and its consequences for society for the international aid agency oxfam .
" while many ghanaian government officials are confident they can meet the challenge , oil 's threat to democratic development should not be underestimated . "
high stakes , big profits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exxonmobil 's bid beat out other oil giants while the stakes are high , so is the profit .
according to an estimate by the international monetary fund which is cited by gary , ghana 's government can expect revenues from oil and gas up to 20 billion dollars during the production period between 2012 and 2030 for the jubilee field alone .
so what are ghana 's chances to avoid the spell of the so-called oil curse ? " i think that ghana could really be one country which could be a positive example to the world and it could also be profitable and beneficial for the country , " claudia kemfert , an energy specialist at berlin 's economic research institute diw , tells deutsche welle .
" ghana could really profit from this deal and also from the oil market . "
what 's required , adds kemfert , is that ghana 's government puts in place a good political strategy on how it wants to use the oil revenues .
talking to deutsche welle , ulrike bickel , an energy expert with germany 's catholic relief agency misereor , is more skeptical : " we obviously see the danger that ghana could also become a victim of the oil curse , that its oil wealth wo n't benefit the people and that oil revenues just like in neighboring countries , vanish instead of being spent on health , education or sustainable social development . " while bickel points out that ghana , a country without previous experience in the oil sector , has taken positive steps such as signing on to the so-called extractive industries transparency initiative , which mandates its members to openly document the flow of revenues , she adds that it is still far too early to tell whether it will be implemented .
bildunterschrift : president obama 's visit , with ghana president john atta mills highlighted the country 's progress negative example an example that positive declarations and good intentions do n't necessarily translate into enforceable action is chad .
" before the world bank agreed to a large loan for the chad-cameroon pipeline there was an agreement that a fund for future generations would be created and that up to 70 percent of the oil revenues would be used for priority social sector developments , " says bickel .
" but as soon as the oil revenue started to flow , chad 's government , which was fighting a civil war , dissolved the fund for future generations and extended the priority sector developments to include national security .
that means the oil revenue is used to buy large quantities of weapons . " that does n't mean that agreements and declarations are n't useful .
they definitely are .
but reality eventually is the ultimate test whether those agreements are fulfilled .
ghana , say the analysts , among developing african nations , is perhaps best prepared to manage its oil wealth carefully . as oxfam expert gary wrote in his report on ghana : " oil wealth tends to erode democratic accountability .
ghana 's challenge will be to ensure that the right institutions and transparent policies are in place before oil production starts . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 12.10.2009 dialect poetry in translation connects regional cultures across europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franconian poetry is closely linked to the land poetry written in regional dialect helps preserve local language and way of life in a globalized world .
but a group of german and scottish poets who have translated it found out just how similar europeans are . from landlocked farms in the franconia region of bavaria to fishing villages on the coast of scotland or the shetland islands , regional dialects throughout consolidated and globalized europe are something of an endangered cultural resource . the task of preserving them goes in part to dialect poets , including two germans and two scots who have been involved in a project to translate regional verse . last year they held a workshop in fife , scotland , where they communicated through oral translators and were provided with literal " gloss " translations in both languages of each other 's poems .
today , they say the experience has had a lasting effect on how they view their poetry . ties to the land the sentiments of dialect poems are often expressed through rustic and geographically-bound language .
while franconian poets often work with imagery and idiomatic expressions based on a life of farming , the scots poets do so with a life of fishing in mind .
in some instances , this makes literal translation impossible and forces the poets to search for comparable literary devices . isabel cole organized the workshop and edits a berlin-based journal of german literature in english translation called " no man 's land . "
she said dialect is less accepted in germany as a form of literary expression than it is in scotland . " i think if people are open-minded about literature , dialects or non-standard literature , it is a real enrichment , " said cole .
" that 's something i actually miss in standard german literature .
one thing i like about germany is how many dialects there are , and how people cultivate their dialects .
they have really different ways of expressing themselves . " bildunterschrift : fishing is an integral part of local scottish culture the personal element fitzgerald kusz , a franconian poet from nuremberg , said that in translating scots poems he was surprised to discover traces of that dialect 's germanic roots .
kusz has spoken franconian since childhood and regards his dialect as an intimate and comfortable form of communication . " on one hand , globalization continues strengthen its hold , " he said , " high german , the unified language , can be heard on television in every village .
but there is , in fact , a movement among the people to keep their languages alive . " and that is one primary goal of dialect literature , he added . one of kusz ' scots counterparts , alexander hutchison , said " a shift into the dialect makes things much more personal … for me it 's just a different instrument . " although hutchison , who lives in glasgow , is not optimistic about current attempts to cultivate dialect in scotland 's schools , he said that in poetry the scots dialect is every bit as viable a form of self-expression as standard english . " if people do n't understand the dialect , they ca n't connect , " he said .
" but if they do understand it , then there 's an immediacy - a personal element - that you can not get in the parent language .
there 's just as much possibility of a lack in the parent language as there is in the dialect .
they operate in different dimensions to me . " the flip-side of globalization franconian poet helmut haberkamm , who grew up in a farming village not far from erlangen , told deutsche welle in an email interview that franconian is " deeply and unmistakably connected to my childhood and the early emotions and experiences which formed me , predetermined parts of my life , and arranged my existence . " franconian is inextricably dissolved in my person .
it is my language of emotion and intimacy , " he added . haberkamm has translated the works of shetlandic poet robert alan jamieson .
although the environments of sheltand and franconia vary greatly , haberkamm said he found striking similarities in the way nature is woven into the lives and languages of both regions . in translating jamieson 's poems , he said he wanted " to bring out the simple , gripping way these people express themselves . " haberkamm described regionalism as the " necessary flip-side of globalization , " adding that " people without an understanding of their roots and concrete values are easily manipulated . " endangered by mobility although hutchison expressed similar sentiments while speaking about his desire to preserve scots and see it flourish , he compared the dialect to a " threatened habitat , " endangered by time and changing patterns of human behavior .
having lived for years in north america , hutchison said he understands the pressures modern existence exerts on local cultures . " people move around , people move off , people do n't stay in one place long enough to develop it , " he said .
" there are new dialects springing up all the time .
if there 's enough settled community , they 'll find a language . " i 'm always wary of standardization , of people trying to impose things .
as a poet , i never want to make rules for other poets . " author : gerhard schneibel editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but how does the team measure up to the world 's top national teams ?
deutsche welle 's jefferson chase takes a closer look . the one moment that best symbolizes the 1-0 win over moscow that qualified germany for the 2010 world cup in south africa was directly after the lone goal was scored .
striker miroslav klose celebrated with one of his trademark forward flips - and only narrowly avoided landing on his backside .
match reports in german newspapers , perhaps understandably , were full of superlatives about germany 's gutsy away win .
but that 1-0 victory was of the knife-edge variety , unlike germany 's 1-0 loss to spain in the 2008 european championships , the last time coach joachim loew had a chance to win a title .
so have germany improved enough to draw level with the spaniards or brazil ?
or are they more on a par with other large european nations like england , the netherlands and italy .
here 's a back-to-front run-through of the strengths and weaknesses of the german squad .
defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adler could become the next in a long line of stellar german national keepers the one position about which loew has absolutely no worries is goal .
24-year-old rene adler was the key to germany 's victory , making a number of world-class saves , and seems to have sealed his position as germany 's number one .
the young keeper 's most brilliant moment in moscow came in the 73rd minute , when russian midfielder igor semshov was clear on the right side and slotted a crisp pass in the direction of two teammates waiting in front of goal .
adler not only got a hand to the ball but cleverly deflected it over the end line .
and should adler get hurt , loew can call on robert enke , manuel neuer or even tim wiese who 've all proved their worth at the international level .
left back philipp lahm is arguably the best in the world at his position so his selection is a no-brainer .
interior defenders per mertesacker and heiko westermann provide a solid anchor in the back four .
youngster serdar tasci could also play a role .
the big question is right back .
jerome boateng , who made his national-team debut in russia , showed he was capable of provided some welcome offensive pressure .
but the 21-year-old also got himself sent off with a red card .
loew 's task will be to get the youngster enough experience in friendlies between now and next june that he no longer poses a risk .
otherwise , he 'll be forced to fall back on arne friedrich , who 's been mediocre at best when wearing the german kit .
defensive midfield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack is a force in midfield but germany could use a threat like russia 's andrei arshavin though not the force he once was german captain michael ballack is the lynchpin of the german squad .
the 33-year-old not only wins lots of challenges but is responsible for the opening passes for germany 's offense .
to cover ballack 's back when he presses forward , simon rolfes is a good choice .
and thomas hitzlsperger is also a more offensive option because of his ability to blast in shots from long-range .
if ballack were to go down to injury , though , germany would be in trouble .
ballack is to germany what gennaro gattuso has been to italy , and loew needs to plan , as best he can , for the eventuality that his captain is unavailable .
the problem is that no one currently on the squad or on the radar screen has the ability to fill the stopper-meets-playmaker role ballack occupies .
offensive midfield and wingers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is counting on youngsters like jerome boateng , marko marin and mesut oezil the emergence of mesut oezil represents the biggest improvement of germany 's likely 2010 squad over the 2008 edition .
the 20-year-old displayed both his pace and his eye for his teammates in setting up the lone goal in moscow that punched germany 's world cup ticket .
but after that , the quality tails off .
bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski are active but relatively inefficient players who 've never lived up their potential .
it will be interesting to see whether youngster marko marin , oezil 's equally fleet-footed teammate at werder bremen , can break into the germany 's starting eleven .
but even if he does , a comparison with the world 's top teams suggests that germany 's offensive midfield is a relative weakness .
spain are spoiled for choice with xabi alonso , xavi , fabregas , iniesta and senna .
brazil , too , can chose from nearly a dozen top-quality midfielders , including kaka , whose skills and creativity are far superior to any member of the german squad .
thus , as the squad stands , germany may find it difficult to come back if they go behind early in matches - something that most teams need to do if they want to take a major international title .
bildunterschrift : klose showed his age in executing his celebratory front flip - he landed on his backside , not his feet the center forward this position is one of the biggest question marks in the team .
if the russia match is anything to go by , loew could likely rely on a 4-3-3 formation for much of the tournament in south africa .
that essentially means the battle to fill the lone central forward slot is between miroslav klose and mario gomez , the same pair of players contesting the same position at their mutual club bayern munich .
for now klose , who will be 32 years old next summer , gets the nod because he , in contrast to gomez , has been effective for the national squad in the past .
but he 's clearly lost a bit of athleticism , so in his heart of hearts , loew might well prefer the 24-year-old gomez .
loew choice will probably be influenced by how much playing time the two strikers get at bayern munich .
however that situation turns out , though , what loew does n't have is a center forward who can create goal opportunities for himself a la wayne rooney for england or thierry henry for france .
that means that germany could have trouble against other defensively oriented teams like italy .
as one of the best teams at the back in the world , germany could certainly fly high in south africa , and no nation will relish facing them .
but their creative deficiencies at the front also mean that loew 's men , if they face tough opponents early on , could end up smack on their backsides .

a new trend aims to keep classical recordings from becoming a taxidermist ’ s project . methods of recording , distribution , and promotion are changing in the classical music industry , and the companies that once dominated the market have either adapted or faltered .
as estimable names in the industry fall by the wayside , new models arise . one of the most successful projects has been the establishment of classical labels by orchestras , with a focus on live recordings . while exclusive contracts with the big-name labels - emi , deutsche grammophon / decca , sony / rca , telarc / warner - became scarce , and their recording projects fewer and fewer , orchestras are inevitably searching for new ways to reach new audiences with new recordings . recording technology has advanced significantly in the last 20 years so that recording concerts live is no longer an inherently hampered way to preserve an otherwise un-replicable musical event . " recording technology is so mobile that there are no qualitative differences between studio and live recordings , " said chaz jenkins , head of the london symphony orchestra 's own label , lso live . the live experience jenkins is one of the pioneers of the orchestra-record-label industry .
he has been with lso live , the first label of an orchestra to enter the market this way , since it was founded in 2000 .
the concept of the label has been replicated by many other orchestras -lrb- often with the help of lso live -rrb- , which the london orchestra 's efforts paved the way for . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sir colin davis specializes in berlioz the goal of lso live was not to replicate what labels have done in the past , but to do something different , and , in particular , to retain the orchestra 's work in the concert hall . " with 2,000 people in front of them , there ’ s a very different energy and emotion available , " said jenkins .
" when recording companies started to rely on re-releasing recordings , the alarm bells were ringing at the lso … if no new recordings are released , then the public starts to see the whole industry as dead - a museum-culture . " but there is still plenty of interest in concerts and no decline in audiences , so there should be new recordings as well , he added . over three million records sold one of the main reasons to found the label and record around the turn of 1999 was the opportunity to record conductor sir colin davis performing one of his specialties , hector berlioz ' orchestral and choral music . davis , then lso 's music director , recorded a complete cycle and success quickly followed .
the first grammy was awarded to the label in 2002 for the recording of berlioz ' massive opera " le troyens , " which sold an astounding 100,000 copies .
that grabbed attention for the label , which has since issued some 70 albums and sold over three million copies . for lso , unlike traditional record companies , the label is not something that needs to be boosted with a marketing campaign - it is a marketing campaign . money less of an issue this fall , the classical channel of germany 's bavarian broadcasting -lrb- br -rrb- is launching br klassik , a new label for its own orchestras and choir .
the bavarian radio symphony orchestra , the munich radio orchestra , and the bavarian radio chorus now all have the opportunity to pick the finest performances in any given season and immortalize them on record . the model of lso live is behind this new venture , too , but there are significant differences .
as a public radio station , with the aid of radio license fees and a cultural mission to fulfill , the br already records all the concerts of its musical bodies . " rather than having to decide beforehand what to record -lrb- with the subsequent pressure to publish it , no matter the result -rrb- , the artists and artistic advisors can pick the best from the lot , " said br klassik 's label manager stefan piendl .
mahler and bruckner symphonies , conducted by mariss jansons , are among the first releases . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : live recordings are becoming more relevant since the cost of recording is already offset , releasing rare , artistically important works with modest commercial prospects is more feasible . sharing musical treasures the label 's motto is simple : those possessing treasures should share them . " sharing our best musical moments , and deciding ourselves , independent of traditional labels and their naturally different criteria of what makes a successful release , were sone of the main motivations behind the founding of br klassik , " said piendl . with an estimated 20,000 recordings from the past 60 years in its vast archives , the br has a few treasures to share .
the archives include memorable performances by top musicians , which were only broadcast once on radio .
three or four recordings from the vaults are projected to see the light each year . br klassik is the latest example of the beauty of creative destruction .
out of the detritus of the old recording companies , dozens of new labels are springing up with thousands of recordings , offering more choice and rarer works than were ever available before - and that nearly a decade after the declaration of the industry ’ s imminent death . author : jens f. laurson editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

leonid ivlev , a member of the central elections commission , told reporters that the ruling party had garnered almost 80 percent of seats up for grabs in the 75 regional and local elections held up and down the country on sunday .
ivlev said putin 's party picked up 107 of the 135 regional seats and 189 of the 235 seats available in municipal legislatures .
they also emerged victorious in the eagerly-watched race for moscow 's city legislature .
with 99 percent of votes in , the ria-novosti news agency reported a 66 percent win for united russia .
praise from the president the opposition communists were the only rivals to score any seats in the high-profile ballot , which only managed to attract a 35 percent voter turnout .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president dmitry medvedev praised the results in comments on the united russia party website , president dmitry medvedev told his country , which has been particularly hard hit by the economic downturn , that they had voted for the right party .
" only together can we surmount the hardships of the financial crisis , " he wrote , " and the vote obtained by united russia demonstrates that we are together and this is most important . "
he went on to say that the 30 million-strong electorate clearly knew what it wanted .
" taking account that elections in the capital are practically federal ones , we can state that in the crisis situation voters have demonstrated they stay together with the ruling party . "
claims of fraud but the liberal yabloko party , which came away from the vote completely empty-handed , has made claims of systematic vote rigging .
yabloko , which failed to reach the 7 percent hurdle in moscow 's local election , has condemned the 17-year-reign of mayor yury luzhkov , accusing him of carrying out " one of the all-time election frauds in russia 's recent history . "
on sunday , while the ballot boxes were still open , yabloko said it had received a " storm of calls " from the moscow electorate , complaining that they were unable to cast their vote because someone else had already done so using their name .
" united russia used so-called carousel voting , " said yabloko spokesman sergey mitrohin .
" this time , it was busloads of soldiers and police that they took from one polling station to another and had them cast their votes for united russia over and over .
we also have serious reason to believe that the ballot boxes were stuffed with additional ballots . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition parties say they will contest moscow 's municipal ballot yabloko and communist party representatives have already said they will contest the results of the municipal poll in court .
" we can not recognize these elections or consider them normal , " communist party deputy chairman vladimir kashin told ria-novosti .
the independent election watchdog golog has come out behind the opposition parties , and has said it will provide proof of fraud . earlier , head of the watchdog , liliya shibanova , lamented the lack of political competition in russia .
" medvedev says we need competition , we need a multi-party system , but election results show the exact opposite , " she said. tkw / dc / afp / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he was responding to a decision announced last week by top-selling german women 's magazine brigitte to forgo thin professional models .

debate has become hysterical , designer says fellow german designer john ribbe was also quoted in focus , saying the current debate about too-skinny models had become hysterical .
" that 's another one of those cliches , like saying that all models take drugs and get drunk at sex orgies , " ribbe said .
" ninety percent are totally normal , well-proportioned girls with less fat and more muscle , but who also eat pizza and burgers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : starting in january , brigitte will feature " real women " instead of models according to brigitte editor andreas lebert , the average catwalk model today weighs some 23 percent less than the average woman on the street .
a few designers , however , are realizing that not all professional models have to be a size zero .
a case in point is us model crystal renn , who recently released a book entitled " hungry , " in which she details her struggle to meet the demands of agents who told her to lose weight if she wanted to work .
renn became anorexic in her pursuit to fit into the typical fashion mould before deciding that her health was more important .
now a voluptuous us size 12 , her modelling career is taking off .
she has been featured in fashion bible vogue magazine six times and walked the runway for designers such as jeanpaul gaultier .
renn is using her newfound stardom to plead for the world of fashion to recognize a multitude of beauty ideals - including women who are naturally a size two .

" logicomix : an epic search for truth " follows british philosopher , logician and pacifist bertrand russell -lrb- 1872-1970 -rrb- in his tortuous quest for the foundations of mathematics , and his search for logic as a shield from the insanity that consumed other members of his family . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " logicomix " tracks the foundation of mathematics the story uses his relationships with the great thinkers and mathematicians of the era , two of his four marriages and historical events in europe such as the rise of nazism as a backdrop for the novel 's more abstract and philosophical subject matter . unexpected success originally published in greek in the fall of 2008 , " logicomix " was a hit at home .
but its authors were unprepared for the reception in the united states and britain , where it sold out on the first day of its release in september . the novel received positive reviews from such publications as the guardian and the new york times , which described the story as presented " with real graphic verve " and " delightful simplicity . " it sped up bestseller lists to occupy top 10 spots in comics , fiction and general book rankings on both amazon.com and amazon.co.uk.
it also recently hit no. 1 on the new york times paperback graphic book list . " i think the publishers -lrb- bloomsbury -rrb- were shocked , " apostolos doxiadis , who co-authored the story with computer science professor christos papadimitriou at the university of california , berkeley , told afp news agency .
" i was shocked too . " bertrand " not a mega-nerd " in searching for a narrator who would fit the novel 's context , doxiadis said bertrand russell was " ideal . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russell was n't a mega-nerd , said doxiadis born into a liberal aristocratic english family and the grandson of a former british prime minister , russell is considered one of the 20th century 's most important philosophers . he was an early advocate of sexual freedom , he was jailed for pacifism during world war i and later campaigned against nuclear proliferation and the vietnam war . " he was a political activist , a womanizer , traveler , adventurer , great talker , a wit and a dandy , " doxiadis told afp .
" he was the only one of these characters who was not a mega-nerd . " the long journey to print from initial discussions between the creators to scripting , drawing , inking and coloring , the novel 's completion took seven years - which the author called " a super-marathon . " like many other cartoon books , the album was pieced together like a movie with wall-to-wall story boards and doxiadis , who has a film-making background , acted out the characters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doxiadis was n't deterred by the unusual theme the aim of " logicomix " is " to tell a fascinating story about the history of ideas , " said doxiadis , who published a novel in 2001 entitled " uncle petros and goldbach 's conjecture " about a boy 's quest for knowledge about his reclusive mathematician uncle . " the fact that this idea looked like , to put it mildly , not a very likely idea for a comic book , never deterred me , " he said .
" in ' logicomix , ' the story i think is in some ways emblematic of much of what happened in the 20th century , with its search for certainty , for knowledge , and what often went with it , for power over life .

" lagerfeld also said that the current backlash against skinny models was being fuelled by overweight women who resent being reminded of their weight issues .

a new trend aims to keep classical recordings from becoming a taxidermist ’ s project . methods of recording , distribution , and promotion are changing in the classical music industry , and the companies that once dominated the market have either adapted or faltered .
as estimable names in the industry fall by the wayside , new models arise . one of the most successful projects has been the establishment of classical labels by orchestras , with a focus on live recordings . while exclusive contracts with the big-name labels - emi , deutsche grammophon / decca , sony / rca , telarc / warner - became scarce , and their recording projects fewer and fewer , orchestras are inevitably searching for new ways to reach new audiences with new recordings . recording technology has advanced significantly in the last 20 years so that recording concerts live is no longer an inherently hampered way to preserve an otherwise un-replicable musical event . " recording technology is so mobile that there are no qualitative differences between studio and live recordings , " said chaz jenkins , head of the london symphony orchestra 's own label , lso live . the live experience jenkins is one of the pioneers of the orchestra-record-label industry .
he has been with lso live , the first label of an orchestra to enter the market this way , since it was founded in 2000 .
the concept of the label has been replicated by many other orchestras -lrb- often with the help of lso live -rrb- , which the london orchestra 's efforts paved the way for . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sir colin davis specializes in berlioz the goal of lso live was not to replicate what labels have done in the past , but to do something different , and , in particular , to retain the orchestra 's work in the concert hall . " with 2,000 people in front of them , there ’ s a very different energy and emotion available , " said jenkins .
" when recording companies started to rely on re-releasing recordings , the alarm bells were ringing at the lso … if no new recordings are released , then the public starts to see the whole industry as dead - a museum-culture . " but there is still plenty of interest in concerts and no decline in audiences , so there should be new recordings as well , he added . over three million records sold one of the main reasons to found the label and record around the turn of 1999 was the opportunity to record conductor sir colin davis performing one of his specialties , hector berlioz ' orchestral and choral music . davis , then lso 's music director , recorded a complete cycle and success quickly followed .
the first grammy was awarded to the label in 2002 for the recording of berlioz ' massive opera " le troyens , " which sold an astounding 100,000 copies .
that grabbed attention for the label , which has since issued some 70 albums and sold over three million copies . for lso , unlike traditional record companies , the label is not something that needs to be boosted with a marketing campaign - it is a marketing campaign . money less of an issue this fall , the classical channel of germany 's bavarian broadcasting -lrb- br -rrb- is launching br klassik , a new label for its own orchestras and choir .
the bavarian radio symphony orchestra , the munich radio orchestra , and the bavarian radio chorus now all have the opportunity to pick the finest performances in any given season and immortalize them on record . the model of lso live is behind this new venture , too , but there are significant differences .
as a public radio station , with the aid of radio license fees and a cultural mission to fulfill , the br already records all the concerts of its musical bodies . " rather than having to decide beforehand what to record -lrb- with the subsequent pressure to publish it , no matter the result -rrb- , the artists and artistic advisors can pick the best from the lot , " said br klassik 's label manager stefan piendl .
mahler and bruckner symphonies , conducted by mariss jansons , are among the first releases . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : live recordings are becoming more relevant since the cost of recording is already offset , releasing rare , artistically important works with modest commercial prospects is more feasible . sharing musical treasures the label 's motto is simple : those possessing treasures should share them . " sharing our best musical moments , and deciding ourselves , independent of traditional labels and their naturally different criteria of what makes a successful release , were sone of the main motivations behind the founding of br klassik , " said piendl . with an estimated 20,000 recordings from the past 60 years in its vast archives , the br has a few treasures to share .
the archives include memorable performances by top musicians , which were only broadcast once on radio .
three or four recordings from the vaults are projected to see the light each year . br klassik is the latest example of the beauty of creative destruction .
out of the detritus of the old recording companies , dozens of new labels are springing up with thousands of recordings , offering more choice and rarer works than were ever available before - and that nearly a decade after the declaration of the industry ’ s imminent death . author : jens f. laurson editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the weapons were sent in 2006 and were intended for local police and army personnel . arms dealers in the region told german public radio that hundreds of german weapons were for sale carrying a price tag of over 680 euros a piece -lrb- $ 1,000 -rrb- .
in 2006 , the german defense ministry shipped 10,000 old walther-p1 pistols to the afghan interior ministry to equip afghan police and army .
however , both the german government and the responsible us-led security team in afghanistan reportedly failed to properly monitor the guns ' whereabouts .
the us unit said that it only had detailed records of 4,563 pistols out of a total 10,000 . current and former afghan soldiers and police officers are said to be among those illegally selling and trafficking the pistols , some of which have ended up in pakistan 's north-west border provinces and neighboring tribal areas .
the german guns were also being traded in northern afghanistan where german soldiers are stationed .
the team of ndr radio reporters who discovered the black market guns said it 's not clear exactly how they ended up there .
" apparently , most of these pistols have n't been stolen , but were simply taken home and sold by former police officers and soldiers after they 'd left the service , " said christoph heinzle , who headed the ndr team .
" but corruption and theft can not be ruled out because neither the afghan authorities nor the us and german armed forces carry out effective controls to prevent -lsb- theft -rsb- . "
greens , police union call for investigation the 2006 delivery was carried out despite a german government principle that german weapons could not be supplied to non-nato countries .
germany 's then coalition government of social democrats and greens made an exception , but the decision reportedly only reached parliament after the weapons had already arrived in afghanistan .
the fresh allegations have prompted calls for an investigation by germany 's green party and the police trade union .
green party spokesman winfried nachtwei accused the grand coalition government , which was in power when the guns were shipped , of a " grossly negligent course of action , " and called for the matter to be investigated in the interest of german security forces and civilian experts sent to afghanistan .
" it would be truly absurd if soldiers were threatened by weapons irresponsibly delivered by germany , " nachtwei said .
joerg radek of the police union said the danger was that " such weapons could fall into the wrong hands .
it is a risk for the germans deployed there , a risk to security in the country . "
defense ministry spokesman thomas raabe told reporters in berlin on monday that officials in kabul had guaranteed the weapons would only be distributed among security forces .
he said the ministry would be investigating any unlawful sales of the guns .
" of course we 'll be looking for evidence of any wrongdoing , but i want to underscore that the afghan government is independent in its decision-making and that we 'll continue to support its efforts to build up effective security forces .

the weapons were sent in 2006 and were intended for local police and army personnel . arms dealers in the region told german public radio that hundreds of german weapons were for sale carrying a price tag of over 680 euros a piece -lrb- $ 1,000 -rrb- .
in 2006 , the german defense ministry shipped 10,000 old walther-p1 pistols to the afghan interior ministry to equip afghan police and army .
however , both the german government and the responsible us-led security team in afghanistan reportedly failed to properly monitor the guns ' whereabouts .
the us unit said that it only had detailed records of 4,563 pistols out of a total 10,000 . current and former afghan soldiers and police officers are said to be among those illegally selling and trafficking the pistols , some of which have ended up in pakistan 's north-west border provinces and neighboring tribal areas .
the german guns were also being traded in northern afghanistan where german soldiers are stationed .
the team of ndr radio reporters who discovered the black market guns said it 's not clear exactly how they ended up there .
" apparently , most of these pistols have n't been stolen , but were simply taken home and sold by former police officers and soldiers after they 'd left the service , " said christoph heinzle , who headed the ndr team .
" but corruption and theft can not be ruled out because neither the afghan authorities nor the us and german armed forces carry out effective controls to prevent -lsb- theft -rsb- . "
greens , police union call for investigation the 2006 delivery was carried out despite a german government principle that german weapons could not be supplied to non-nato countries .
germany 's then coalition government of social democrats and greens made an exception , but the decision reportedly only reached parliament after the weapons had already arrived in afghanistan .
the fresh allegations have prompted calls for an investigation by germany 's green party and the police trade union .
green party spokesman winfried nachtwei accused the grand coalition government , which was in power when the guns were shipped , of a " grossly negligent course of action , " and called for the matter to be investigated in the interest of german security forces and civilian experts sent to afghanistan .
" it would be truly absurd if soldiers were threatened by weapons irresponsibly delivered by germany , " nachtwei said .
joerg radek of the police union said the danger was that " such weapons could fall into the wrong hands .
it is a risk for the germans deployed there , a risk to security in the country . "
defense ministry spokesman thomas raabe told reporters in berlin on monday that officials in kabul had guaranteed the weapons would only be distributed among security forces .
he said the ministry would be investigating any unlawful sales of the guns .
" of course we 'll be looking for evidence of any wrongdoing , but i want to underscore that the afghan government is independent in its decision-making and that we 'll continue to support its efforts to build up effective security forces .

the deal also received heavy criticism from azerbaijan over unsolved armenian-azeri territorial disputes . even though the ink has dried on the protocols signed by the foreign ministers of turkey and armenia , there is no guarantee that the parties will or can make the agreements a reality .
indeed , turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan was first out of the gate with a cautionary note .
" we want all the borders to be opened at the same time ... , but as long as armenia has not withdrawn from azerbaijani territory that it is occupying , turkey can not have a positive attitude on this subject , " said erdogan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nagorno-karabakh dispute puts the deal at risk in the late 1980 's , as the soviet union was dissolving , violence broke out in the ethnic armenian enclave of nagorno-karabakh within azerbaijan 's internationally recognized borders .
in 1993 a war broke out when armenia sent in troops to support the ethnic armenians and they drove azeri troops from seven districts next to nagorno-karabakh .
they have remained there ever since .
azerbaijan condemns accord in support of the turkic speaking azeris , turkey closed its border with armenia when armenia went into azerbaijan .
hence ankara 's insistence that armenia pull out of azerbaijan before the protocols can be ratified in the turkish parliament .
in azerbaijan , the foreign ministry issued a statement saying that the accords should not have been signed while nagorno-karabakh is still occupied .
" the normalization of relations between turkey and armenia before the withdrawal of armenian troops from occupied azeri territory is in direct contradiction to the national interests of azerbaijan , " said the statement .
by all accounts , the signing was an historic event .
nearly a year in the making , discretely abetted by the swiss .
however , the signing ceremony for the protocols that pledge to establish diplomatic relations , open borders and to set up an historic commission to investigate armenian deaths in world war i , almost fell through when the parties disagreed over some of the wording in the statements to be delivered at the end of the signing ceremony .
protests around the world the agreement between the two countries has sparked widespread controversy .
some 10,000 people marched in the armenian capital yerevan to protest the agreement .
they are part of a global protest movement that fears the signing of the protocols will lessen the emphasis on the mass killings of armenians during world war i. bildunterschrift : the deal between turkey and armenia include a provision to set up a historical commission to investigate the events of world war i. yerevan claims that during the war , the ottoman turks committed genocide by killing more than a million armenians and wants ankara to acknowledge it .
turkey admits that there were deaths , but vehemently deny that the number of dead approach the threshold of the definition for genocide .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de classical -pipe- 12.10.2009 european orchestras start recording labels to defy extinction großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the classical music industry is changing - not yielding the classical music industry has been declared dead several times in the last few years , but it simply refuses to die .
a new trend aims to keep classical recordings from becoming a taxidermist ’ s project . methods of recording , distribution , and promotion are changing in the classical music industry , and the companies that once dominated the market have either adapted or faltered .
as estimable names in the industry fall by the wayside , new models arise . one of the most successful projects has been the establishment of classical labels by orchestras , with a focus on live recordings . while exclusive contracts with the big-name labels - emi , deutsche grammophon / decca , sony / rca , telarc / warner - became scarce , and their recording projects fewer and fewer , orchestras are inevitably searching for new ways to reach new audiences with new recordings . recording technology has advanced significantly in the last 20 years so that recording concerts live is no longer an inherently hampered way to preserve an otherwise un-replicable musical event . " recording technology is so mobile that there are no qualitative differences between studio and live recordings , " said chaz jenkins , head of the london symphony orchestra 's own label , lso live . the live experience jenkins is one of the pioneers of the orchestra-record-label industry .
he has been with lso live , the first label of an orchestra to enter the market this way , since it was founded in 2000 .
the concept of the label has been replicated by many other orchestras -lrb- often with the help of lso live -rrb- , which the london orchestra 's efforts paved the way for . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sir colin davis specializes in berlioz the goal of lso live was not to replicate what labels have done in the past , but to do something different , and , in particular , to retain the orchestra 's work in the concert hall . " with 2,000 people in front of them , there ’ s a very different energy and emotion available , " said jenkins .
" when recording companies started to rely on re-releasing recordings , the alarm bells were ringing at the lso … if no new recordings are released , then the public starts to see the whole industry as dead - a museum-culture . " but there is still plenty of interest in concerts and no decline in audiences , so there should be new recordings as well , he added . over three million records sold one of the main reasons to found the label and record around the turn of 1999 was the opportunity to record conductor sir colin davis performing one of his specialties , hector berlioz ' orchestral and choral music . davis , then lso 's music director , recorded a complete cycle and success quickly followed .
the first grammy was awarded to the label in 2002 for the recording of berlioz ' massive opera " le troyens , " which sold an astounding 100,000 copies .
that grabbed attention for the label , which has since issued some 70 albums and sold over three million copies . for lso , unlike traditional record companies , the label is not something that needs to be boosted with a marketing campaign - it is a marketing campaign . money less of an issue this fall , the classical channel of germany 's bavarian broadcasting -lrb- br -rrb- is launching br klassik , a new label for its own orchestras and choir .
the bavarian radio symphony orchestra , the munich radio orchestra , and the bavarian radio chorus now all have the opportunity to pick the finest performances in any given season and immortalize them on record . the model of lso live is behind this new venture , too , but there are significant differences .
as a public radio station , with the aid of radio license fees and a cultural mission to fulfill , the br already records all the concerts of its musical bodies . " rather than having to decide beforehand what to record -lrb- with the subsequent pressure to publish it , no matter the result -rrb- , the artists and artistic advisors can pick the best from the lot , " said br klassik 's label manager stefan piendl .
mahler and bruckner symphonies , conducted by mariss jansons , are among the first releases . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : live recordings are becoming more relevant since the cost of recording is already offset , releasing rare , artistically important works with modest commercial prospects is more feasible . sharing musical treasures the label 's motto is simple : those possessing treasures should share them . " sharing our best musical moments , and deciding ourselves , independent of traditional labels and their naturally different criteria of what makes a successful release , were sone of the main motivations behind the founding of br klassik , " said piendl . with an estimated 20,000 recordings from the past 60 years in its vast archives , the br has a few treasures to share .
the archives include memorable performances by top musicians , which were only broadcast once on radio .
three or four recordings from the vaults are projected to see the light each year . br klassik is the latest example of the beauty of creative destruction .
out of the detritus of the old recording companies , dozens of new labels are springing up with thousands of recordings , offering more choice and rarer works than were ever available before - and that nearly a decade after the declaration of the industry ’ s imminent death . author : jens f. laurson editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 12.10.2009 germany needs to improve to become a world cup favorite großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany got the result they needed when it counted germany got the job done in a relative easy group and qualified for the world cup .
but how does the team measure up to the world 's top national teams ?
deutsche welle 's jefferson chase takes a closer look . the one moment that best symbolizes the 1-0 win over moscow that qualified germany for the 2010 world cup in south africa was directly after the lone goal was scored .
striker miroslav klose celebrated with one of his trademark forward flips - and only narrowly avoided landing on his backside .
match reports in german newspapers , perhaps understandably , were full of superlatives about germany 's gutsy away win .
but that 1-0 victory was of the knife-edge variety , unlike germany 's 1-0 loss to spain in the 2008 european championships , the last time coach joachim loew had a chance to win a title .
so have germany improved enough to draw level with the spaniards or brazil ?
or are they more on a par with other large european nations like england , the netherlands and italy .
here 's a back-to-front run-through of the strengths and weaknesses of the german squad .
defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adler could become the next in a long line of stellar german national keepers the one position about which loew has absolutely no worries is goal .
24-year-old rene adler was the key to germany 's victory , making a number of world-class saves , and seems to have sealed his position as germany 's number one .
the young keeper 's most brilliant moment in moscow came in the 73rd minute , when russian midfielder igor semshov was clear on the right side and slotted a crisp pass in the direction of two teammates waiting in front of goal .
adler not only got a hand to the ball but cleverly deflected it over the end line .
and should adler get hurt , loew can call on robert enke , manuel neuer or even tim wiese who 've all proved their worth at the international level .
left back philipp lahm is arguably the best in the world at his position so his selection is a no-brainer .
interior defenders per mertesacker and heiko westermann provide a solid anchor in the back four .
youngster serdar tasci could also play a role .
the big question is right back .
jerome boateng , who made his national-team debut in russia , showed he was capable of provided some welcome offensive pressure .
but the 21-year-old also got himself sent off with a red card .
loew 's task will be to get the youngster enough experience in friendlies between now and next june that he no longer poses a risk .
otherwise , he 'll be forced to fall back on arne friedrich , who 's been mediocre at best when wearing the german kit .
defensive midfield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack is a force in midfield but germany could use a threat like russia 's andrei arshavin though not the force he once was german captain michael ballack is the lynchpin of the german squad .
the 33-year-old not only wins lots of challenges but is responsible for the opening passes for germany 's offense .
to cover ballack 's back when he presses forward , simon rolfes is a good choice .
and thomas hitzlsperger is also a more offensive option because of his ability to blast in shots from long-range .
if ballack were to go down to injury , though , germany would be in trouble .
ballack is to germany what gennaro gattuso has been to italy , and loew needs to plan , as best he can , for the eventuality that his captain is unavailable .
the problem is that no one currently on the squad or on the radar screen has the ability to fill the stopper-meets-playmaker role ballack occupies .
offensive midfield and wingers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is counting on youngsters like jerome boateng , marko marin and mesut oezil the emergence of mesut oezil represents the biggest improvement of germany 's likely 2010 squad over the 2008 edition .
the 20-year-old displayed both his pace and his eye for his teammates in setting up the lone goal in moscow that punched germany 's world cup ticket .
but after that , the quality tails off .
bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski are active but relatively inefficient players who 've never lived up their potential .
it will be interesting to see whether youngster marko marin , oezil 's equally fleet-footed teammate at werder bremen , can break into the germany 's starting eleven .
but even if he does , a comparison with the world 's top teams suggests that germany 's offensive midfield is a relative weakness .
spain are spoiled for choice with xabi alonso , xavi , fabregas , iniesta and senna .
brazil , too , can chose from nearly a dozen top-quality midfielders , including kaka , whose skills and creativity are far superior to any member of the german squad .
thus , as the squad stands , germany may find it difficult to come back if they go behind early in matches - something that most teams need to do if they want to take a major international title .
bildunterschrift : klose showed his age in executing his celebratory front flip - he landed on his backside , not his feet the center forward this position is one of the biggest question marks in the team .
if the russia match is anything to go by , loew could likely rely on a 4-3-3 formation for much of the tournament in south africa .
that essentially means the battle to fill the lone central forward slot is between miroslav klose and mario gomez , the same pair of players contesting the same position at their mutual club bayern munich .
for now klose , who will be 32 years old next summer , gets the nod because he , in contrast to gomez , has been effective for the national squad in the past .
but he 's clearly lost a bit of athleticism , so in his heart of hearts , loew might well prefer the 24-year-old gomez .
loew choice will probably be influenced by how much playing time the two strikers get at bayern munich .
however that situation turns out , though , what loew does n't have is a center forward who can create goal opportunities for himself a la wayne rooney for england or thierry henry for france .
that means that germany could have trouble against other defensively oriented teams like italy .
as one of the best teams at the back in the world , germany could certainly fly high in south africa , and no nation will relish facing them .
but their creative deficiencies at the front also mean that loew 's men , if they face tough opponents early on , could end up smack on their backsides .

leonid ivlev , a member of the central elections commission , told reporters that the ruling party had garnered almost 80 percent of seats up for grabs in the 75 regional and local elections held up and down the country on sunday .
ivlev said putin 's party picked up 107 of the 135 regional seats and 189 of the 235 seats available in municipal legislatures .
they also emerged victorious in the eagerly-watched race for moscow 's city legislature .
with 99 percent of votes in , the ria-novosti news agency reported a 66 percent win for united russia .
praise from the president the opposition communists were the only rivals to score any seats in the high-profile ballot , which only managed to attract a 35 percent voter turnout .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president dmitry medvedev praised the results in comments on the united russia party website , president dmitry medvedev told his country , which has been particularly hard hit by the economic downturn , that they had voted for the right party .
" only together can we surmount the hardships of the financial crisis , " he wrote , " and the vote obtained by united russia demonstrates that we are together and this is most important . "
he went on to say that the 30 million-strong electorate clearly knew what it wanted .
" taking account that elections in the capital are practically federal ones , we can state that in the crisis situation voters have demonstrated they stay together with the ruling party . "

" this time , it was busloads of soldiers and police that they took from one polling station to another and had them cast their votes for united russia over and over .

the deal also received heavy criticism from azerbaijan over unsolved armenian-azeri territorial disputes . even though the ink has dried on the protocols signed by the foreign ministers of turkey and armenia , there is no guarantee that the parties will or can make the agreements a reality .
indeed , turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan was first out of the gate with a cautionary note .
" we want all the borders to be opened at the same time ... , but as long as armenia has not withdrawn from azerbaijani territory that it is occupying , turkey can not have a positive attitude on this subject , " said erdogan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nagorno-karabakh dispute puts the deal at risk in the late 1980 's , as the soviet union was dissolving , violence broke out in the ethnic armenian enclave of nagorno-karabakh within azerbaijan 's internationally recognized borders .
in 1993 a war broke out when armenia sent in troops to support the ethnic armenians and they drove azeri troops from seven districts next to nagorno-karabakh .
they have remained there ever since .
azerbaijan condemns accord in support of the turkic speaking azeris , turkey closed its border with armenia when armenia went into azerbaijan .
hence ankara 's insistence that armenia pull out of azerbaijan before the protocols can be ratified in the turkish parliament .
in azerbaijan , the foreign ministry issued a statement saying that the accords should not have been signed while nagorno-karabakh is still occupied .
" the normalization of relations between turkey and armenia before the withdrawal of armenian troops from occupied azeri territory is in direct contradiction to the national interests of azerbaijan , " said the statement .
by all accounts , the signing was an historic event .
nearly a year in the making , discretely abetted by the swiss .
however , the signing ceremony for the protocols that pledge to establish diplomatic relations , open borders and to set up an historic commission to investigate armenian deaths in world war i , almost fell through when the parties disagreed over some of the wording in the statements to be delivered at the end of the signing ceremony .
protests around the world the agreement between the two countries has sparked widespread controversy .
some 10,000 people marched in the armenian capital yerevan to protest the agreement .
they are part of a global protest movement that fears the signing of the protocols will lessen the emphasis on the mass killings of armenians during world war i. bildunterschrift : the deal between turkey and armenia include a provision to set up a historical commission to investigate the events of world war i. yerevan claims that during the war , the ottoman turks committed genocide by killing more than a million armenians and wants ankara to acknowledge it .
turkey admits that there were deaths , but vehemently deny that the number of dead approach the threshold of the definition for genocide .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 12.10.2009 german military guns reportedly sold illegally on afghan , pakistan black market großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guns sent to afghanistan for police and army have ended up on the black market german military pistols are being sold on the black market in afghanistan and pakistan .
the weapons were sent in 2006 and were intended for local police and army personnel . arms dealers in the region told german public radio that hundreds of german weapons were for sale carrying a price tag of over 680 euros a piece -lrb- $ 1,000 -rrb- .
in 2006 , the german defense ministry shipped 10,000 old walther-p1 pistols to the afghan interior ministry to equip afghan police and army .
however , both the german government and the responsible us-led security team in afghanistan reportedly failed to properly monitor the guns ' whereabouts .
the us unit said that it only had detailed records of 4,563 pistols out of a total 10,000 . current and former afghan soldiers and police officers are said to be among those illegally selling and trafficking the pistols , some of which have ended up in pakistan 's north-west border provinces and neighboring tribal areas .
the german guns were also being traded in northern afghanistan where german soldiers are stationed .
the team of ndr radio reporters who discovered the black market guns said it 's not clear exactly how they ended up there .
" apparently , most of these pistols have n't been stolen , but were simply taken home and sold by former police officers and soldiers after they 'd left the service , " said christoph heinzle , who headed the ndr team .
" but corruption and theft can not be ruled out because neither the afghan authorities nor the us and german armed forces carry out effective controls to prevent -lsb- theft -rsb- . "
greens , police union call for investigation the 2006 delivery was carried out despite a german government principle that german weapons could not be supplied to non-nato countries .
germany 's then coalition government of social democrats and greens made an exception , but the decision reportedly only reached parliament after the weapons had already arrived in afghanistan .
the fresh allegations have prompted calls for an investigation by germany 's green party and the police trade union .
green party spokesman winfried nachtwei accused the grand coalition government , which was in power when the guns were shipped , of a " grossly negligent course of action , " and called for the matter to be investigated in the interest of german security forces and civilian experts sent to afghanistan .
" it would be truly absurd if soldiers were threatened by weapons irresponsibly delivered by germany , " nachtwei said .
joerg radek of the police union said the danger was that " such weapons could fall into the wrong hands .
it is a risk for the germans deployed there , a risk to security in the country . "
defense ministry spokesman thomas raabe told reporters in berlin on monday that officials in kabul had guaranteed the weapons would only be distributed among security forces .

the weapons were sent in 2006 and were intended for local police and army personnel . arms dealers in the region told german public radio that hundreds of german weapons were for sale carrying a price tag of over 680 euros a piece -lrb- $ 1,000 -rrb- .
in 2006 , the german defense ministry shipped 10,000 old walther-p1 pistols to the afghan interior ministry to equip afghan police and army .
however , both the german government and the responsible us-led security team in afghanistan reportedly failed to properly monitor the guns ' whereabouts .
the us unit said that it only had detailed records of 4,563 pistols out of a total 10,000 . current and former afghan soldiers and police officers are said to be among those illegally selling and trafficking the pistols , some of which have ended up in pakistan 's north-west border provinces and neighboring tribal areas .
the german guns were also being traded in northern afghanistan where german soldiers are stationed .
the team of ndr radio reporters who discovered the black market guns said it 's not clear exactly how they ended up there .
" apparently , most of these pistols have n't been stolen , but were simply taken home and sold by former police officers and soldiers after they 'd left the service , " said christoph heinzle , who headed the ndr team .
" but corruption and theft can not be ruled out because neither the afghan authorities nor the us and german armed forces carry out effective controls to prevent -lsb- theft -rsb- . "
greens , police union call for investigation the 2006 delivery was carried out despite a german government principle that german weapons could not be supplied to non-nato countries .
germany 's then coalition government of social democrats and greens made an exception , but the decision reportedly only reached parliament after the weapons had already arrived in afghanistan .
the fresh allegations have prompted calls for an investigation by germany 's green party and the police trade union .
green party spokesman winfried nachtwei accused the grand coalition government , which was in power when the guns were shipped , of a " grossly negligent course of action , " and called for the matter to be investigated in the interest of german security forces and civilian experts sent to afghanistan .
" it would be truly absurd if soldiers were threatened by weapons irresponsibly delivered by germany , " nachtwei said .
joerg radek of the police union said the danger was that " such weapons could fall into the wrong hands .
it is a risk for the germans deployed there , a risk to security in the country . "
defense ministry spokesman thomas raabe told reporters in berlin on monday that officials in kabul had guaranteed the weapons would only be distributed among security forces .
he said the ministry would be investigating any unlawful sales of the guns .
" of course we 'll be looking for evidence of any wrongdoing , but i want to underscore that the afghan government is independent in its decision-making and that we 'll continue to support its efforts to build up effective security forces .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russell was n't a mega-nerd , said doxiadis born into a liberal aristocratic english family and the grandson of a former british prime minister , russell is considered one of the 20th century 's most important philosophers . he was an early advocate of sexual freedom , he was jailed for pacifism during world war i and later campaigned against nuclear proliferation and the vietnam war . " he was a political activist , a womanizer , traveler , adventurer , great talker , a wit and a dandy , " doxiadis told afp .
" he was the only one of these characters who was not a mega-nerd . " the long journey to print from initial discussions between the creators to scripting , drawing , inking and coloring , the novel 's completion took seven years - which the author called " a super-marathon . " like many other cartoon books , the album was pieced together like a movie with wall-to-wall story boards and doxiadis , who has a film-making background , acted out the characters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doxiadis was n't deterred by the unusual theme the aim of " logicomix " is " to tell a fascinating story about the history of ideas , " said doxiadis , who published a novel in 2001 entitled " uncle petros and goldbach 's conjecture " about a boy 's quest for knowledge about his reclusive mathematician uncle . " the fact that this idea looked like , to put it mildly , not a very likely idea for a comic book , never deterred me , " he said .
" in ' logicomix , ' the story i think is in some ways emblematic of much of what happened in the 20th century , with its search for certainty , for knowledge , and what often went with it , for power over life .

the weapons were sent in 2006 and were intended for local police and army personnel . arms dealers in the region told german public radio that hundreds of german weapons were for sale carrying a price tag of over 680 euros a piece -lrb- $ 1,000 -rrb- .
in 2006 , the german defense ministry shipped 10,000 old walther-p1 pistols to the afghan interior ministry to equip afghan police and army .
however , both the german government and the responsible us-led security team in afghanistan reportedly failed to properly monitor the guns ' whereabouts .
the us unit said that it only had detailed records of 4,563 pistols out of a total 10,000 . current and former afghan soldiers and police officers are said to be among those illegally selling and trafficking the pistols , some of which have ended up in pakistan 's north-west border provinces and neighboring tribal areas .
the german guns were also being traded in northern afghanistan where german soldiers are stationed .
the team of ndr radio reporters who discovered the black market guns said it 's not clear exactly how they ended up there .
" apparently , most of these pistols have n't been stolen , but were simply taken home and sold by former police officers and soldiers after they 'd left the service , " said christoph heinzle , who headed the ndr team .
" but corruption and theft can not be ruled out because neither the afghan authorities nor the us and german armed forces carry out effective controls to prevent -lsb- theft -rsb- . "
greens , police union call for investigation the 2006 delivery was carried out despite a german government principle that german weapons could not be supplied to non-nato countries .
germany 's then coalition government of social democrats and greens made an exception , but the decision reportedly only reached parliament after the weapons had already arrived in afghanistan .
the fresh allegations have prompted calls for an investigation by germany 's green party and the police trade union .
green party spokesman winfried nachtwei accused the grand coalition government , which was in power when the guns were shipped , of a " grossly negligent course of action , " and called for the matter to be investigated in the interest of german security forces and civilian experts sent to afghanistan .
" it would be truly absurd if soldiers were threatened by weapons irresponsibly delivered by germany , " nachtwei said .
joerg radek of the police union said the danger was that " such weapons could fall into the wrong hands .
it is a risk for the germans deployed there , a risk to security in the country . "
defense ministry spokesman thomas raabe told reporters in berlin on monday that officials in kabul had guaranteed the weapons would only be distributed among security forces .
he said the ministry would be investigating any unlawful sales of the guns .
" of course we 'll be looking for evidence of any wrongdoing , but i want to underscore that the afghan government is independent in its decision-making and that we 'll continue to support its efforts to build up effective security forces .

but that is easier said than done , as the president of the czech republic appears at pains to demonstrate . euroskeptic czech president vaclav klaus chose his moment well .
just hours before poland became a signatory to the much-talked about european treaty , he managed to keep the union 's eyes on him by saying he would not add his name to the pact until he was satisfied it will not destabilize national property rights .
klaus is concerned that the european charter of fundamental rights , part of the lisbon treaty , could allow the three million germans expelled from czechoslovakia at the end of the second world war to reclaim property confiscated from them at the time .
the issue came up after the fall of communism , but the czech courts have thrown out claims brought forth by expellees , and klaus is clearly prepared to go to great lengths to prevent an upsetting of that particular apple cart .
but in so doing , he is attracting much negative attention , and winning no eu popularity contests .
although relations between germany and the czech republic - which border one another - are essentially quite good , klaus 's latest demands have met with criticism in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech president vaclav klaus says he wo n't take no for an answer christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- member and parliamentary secretary for defense , christian schmidt , told the dpa news agency that it was unnecessary to play the german expellees card and that there is already a european convention of human rights .
" everything that concerns the lisbon treaty has been negotiated , " schmidt said .
" to come now , shortly before the end game with new demands , leads to the impression that he only wants to delay . "
if they can , so can we but klaus insists it is his right to demand a binding guarantee that prevents expellees from using eu laws to circumnavigate the czech judicial system .
he cited britain and poland , both of which negotiated an opt-out before the pact was signed at the end of 2007 - britain over fears that collective bargaining rights could lead to increased strike action , and poland in order to protect the values of a deeply catholic society - saying he wanted something similar for his country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president lech kaczynski signed the treaty at the weekend " i am convinced that the czech republic must at least post facto negotiate a similar exemption , " klaus told reporters , adding that he thought a " non-standard " procedure could get the job done quickly .
in order to try and convince the rest of the eu to accommodate his wishes , the czech president would first have to submit a proposal .
the alternative procedure the easier way forward could be to have eu leaders approve a declaration which is not intrinsically a part of the treaty , such as they did when ireland asked for a guarantee that the lisbon treaty would not interfere with laws on taxes and abortion .
but ladislav jakl , an aide to klaus , poured water on that idea on czech television on sunday .
he said the president would " not be satisfied by any declaration but only guarantees for every citizen , " adding that the condition was " fundamental , necessary , unbreachable . "
it is certainly problematic for the eu that klaus has waited until this late stage in the ratification process to ask to see it tweaked in his favor .
what happens next will depend to some degree on the czech parliament which is scheduled to meet on monday to discuss the latest spanner the president has thrown into the ratification process works. tkw / afp / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he cited britain and poland , both of which negotiated an opt-out before the pact was signed at the end of 2007 - britain over fears that collective bargaining rights could lead to increased strike action , and poland in order to protect the values of a deeply catholic society - saying he wanted something similar for his country .

in order to try and convince the rest of the eu to accommodate his wishes , the czech president would first have to submit a proposal .
the alternative procedure the easier way forward could be to have eu leaders approve a declaration which is not intrinsically a part of the treaty , such as they did when ireland asked for a guarantee that the lisbon treaty would not interfere with laws on taxes and abortion .

he said the president would " not be satisfied by any declaration but only guarantees for every citizen , " adding that the condition was " fundamental , necessary , unbreachable . "

but that is easier said than done , as the president of the czech republic appears at pains to demonstrate . euroskeptic czech president vaclav klaus chose his moment well .
just hours before poland became a signatory to the much-talked about european treaty , he managed to keep the union 's eyes on him by saying he would not add his name to the pact until he was satisfied it will not destabilize national property rights .
klaus is concerned that the european charter of fundamental rights , part of the lisbon treaty , could allow the three million germans expelled from czechoslovakia at the end of the second world war to reclaim property confiscated from them at the time .
the issue came up after the fall of communism , but the czech courts have thrown out claims brought forth by expellees , and klaus is clearly prepared to go to great lengths to prevent an upsetting of that particular apple cart .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 12.10.2009 dialect poetry in translation connects regional cultures across europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franconian poetry is closely linked to the land poetry written in regional dialect helps preserve local language and way of life in a globalized world .
but a group of german and scottish poets who have translated it found out just how similar europeans are . from landlocked farms in the franconia region of bavaria to fishing villages on the coast of scotland or the shetland islands , regional dialects throughout consolidated and globalized europe are something of an endangered cultural resource . the task of preserving them goes in part to dialect poets , including two germans and two scots who have been involved in a project to translate regional verse . last year they held a workshop in fife , scotland , where they communicated through oral translators and were provided with literal " gloss " translations in both languages of each other 's poems .
today , they say the experience has had a lasting effect on how they view their poetry . ties to the land the sentiments of dialect poems are often expressed through rustic and geographically-bound language .
while franconian poets often work with imagery and idiomatic expressions based on a life of farming , the scots poets do so with a life of fishing in mind .
in some instances , this makes literal translation impossible and forces the poets to search for comparable literary devices . isabel cole organized the workshop and edits a berlin-based journal of german literature in english translation called " no man 's land . "
she said dialect is less accepted in germany as a form of literary expression than it is in scotland . " i think if people are open-minded about literature , dialects or non-standard literature , it is a real enrichment , " said cole .
" that 's something i actually miss in standard german literature .
one thing i like about germany is how many dialects there are , and how people cultivate their dialects .
they have really different ways of expressing themselves . " bildunterschrift : fishing is an integral part of local scottish culture the personal element fitzgerald kusz , a franconian poet from nuremberg , said that in translating scots poems he was surprised to discover traces of that dialect 's germanic roots .
kusz has spoken franconian since childhood and regards his dialect as an intimate and comfortable form of communication . " on one hand , globalization continues strengthen its hold , " he said , " high german , the unified language , can be heard on television in every village .
but there is , in fact , a movement among the people to keep their languages alive . " and that is one primary goal of dialect literature , he added . one of kusz ' scots counterparts , alexander hutchison , said " a shift into the dialect makes things much more personal … for me it 's just a different instrument . " although hutchison , who lives in glasgow , is not optimistic about current attempts to cultivate dialect in scotland 's schools , he said that in poetry the scots dialect is every bit as viable a form of self-expression as standard english . " if people do n't understand the dialect , they ca n't connect , " he said .
" but if they do understand it , then there 's an immediacy - a personal element - that you can not get in the parent language .
there 's just as much possibility of a lack in the parent language as there is in the dialect .
they operate in different dimensions to me . " the flip-side of globalization franconian poet helmut haberkamm , who grew up in a farming village not far from erlangen , told deutsche welle in an email interview that franconian is " deeply and unmistakably connected to my childhood and the early emotions and experiences which formed me , predetermined parts of my life , and arranged my existence . " franconian is inextricably dissolved in my person .
it is my language of emotion and intimacy , " he added . haberkamm has translated the works of shetlandic poet robert alan jamieson .
although the environments of sheltand and franconia vary greatly , haberkamm said he found striking similarities in the way nature is woven into the lives and languages of both regions . in translating jamieson 's poems , he said he wanted " to bring out the simple , gripping way these people express themselves . " haberkamm described regionalism as the " necessary flip-side of globalization , " adding that " people without an understanding of their roots and concrete values are easily manipulated . " endangered by mobility although hutchison expressed similar sentiments while speaking about his desire to preserve scots and see it flourish , he compared the dialect to a " threatened habitat , " endangered by time and changing patterns of human behavior .
having lived for years in north america , hutchison said he understands the pressures modern existence exerts on local cultures . " people move around , people move off , people do n't stay in one place long enough to develop it , " he said .
" there are new dialects springing up all the time .
if there 's enough settled community , they 'll find a language . " i 'm always wary of standardization , of people trying to impose things .
as a poet , i never want to make rules for other poets . " author : gerhard schneibel editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but that is easier said than done , as the president of the czech republic appears at pains to demonstrate . euroskeptic czech president vaclav klaus chose his moment well .
just hours before poland became a signatory to the much-talked about european treaty , he managed to keep the union 's eyes on him by saying he would not add his name to the pact until he was satisfied it will not destabilize national property rights .
klaus is concerned that the european charter of fundamental rights , part of the lisbon treaty , could allow the three million germans expelled from czechoslovakia at the end of the second world war to reclaim property confiscated from them at the time .
the issue came up after the fall of communism , but the czech courts have thrown out claims brought forth by expellees , and klaus is clearly prepared to go to great lengths to prevent an upsetting of that particular apple cart .
but in so doing , he is attracting much negative attention , and winning no eu popularity contests .
although relations between germany and the czech republic - which border one another - are essentially quite good , klaus 's latest demands have met with criticism in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech president vaclav klaus says he wo n't take no for an answer christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- member and parliamentary secretary for defense , christian schmidt , told the dpa news agency that it was unnecessary to play the german expellees card and that there is already a european convention of human rights .
" everything that concerns the lisbon treaty has been negotiated , " schmidt said .
" to come now , shortly before the end game with new demands , leads to the impression that he only wants to delay . "
if they can , so can we but klaus insists it is his right to demand a binding guarantee that prevents expellees from using eu laws to circumnavigate the czech judicial system .
he cited britain and poland , both of which negotiated an opt-out before the pact was signed at the end of 2007 - britain over fears that collective bargaining rights could lead to increased strike action , and poland in order to protect the values of a deeply catholic society - saying he wanted something similar for his country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president lech kaczynski signed the treaty at the weekend " i am convinced that the czech republic must at least post facto negotiate a similar exemption , " klaus told reporters , adding that he thought a " non-standard " procedure could get the job done quickly .
in order to try and convince the rest of the eu to accommodate his wishes , the czech president would first have to submit a proposal .
the alternative procedure the easier way forward could be to have eu leaders approve a declaration which is not intrinsically a part of the treaty , such as they did when ireland asked for a guarantee that the lisbon treaty would not interfere with laws on taxes and abortion .
but ladislav jakl , an aide to klaus , poured water on that idea on czech television on sunday .
he said the president would " not be satisfied by any declaration but only guarantees for every citizen , " adding that the condition was " fundamental , necessary , unbreachable . "
it is certainly problematic for the eu that klaus has waited until this late stage in the ratification process to ask to see it tweaked in his favor .
what happens next will depend to some degree on the czech parliament which is scheduled to meet on monday to discuss the latest spanner the president has thrown into the ratification process works. tkw / afp / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 12.10.2009 dialect poetry in translation connects regional cultures across europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franconian poetry is closely linked to the land poetry written in regional dialect helps preserve local language and way of life in a globalized world .
but a group of german and scottish poets who have translated it found out just how similar europeans are . from landlocked farms in the franconia region of bavaria to fishing villages on the coast of scotland or the shetland islands , regional dialects throughout consolidated and globalized europe are something of an endangered cultural resource . the task of preserving them goes in part to dialect poets , including two germans and two scots who have been involved in a project to translate regional verse . last year they held a workshop in fife , scotland , where they communicated through oral translators and were provided with literal " gloss " translations in both languages of each other 's poems .
today , they say the experience has had a lasting effect on how they view their poetry . ties to the land the sentiments of dialect poems are often expressed through rustic and geographically-bound language .
while franconian poets often work with imagery and idiomatic expressions based on a life of farming , the scots poets do so with a life of fishing in mind .
in some instances , this makes literal translation impossible and forces the poets to search for comparable literary devices . isabel cole organized the workshop and edits a berlin-based journal of german literature in english translation called " no man 's land . "
she said dialect is less accepted in germany as a form of literary expression than it is in scotland . " i think if people are open-minded about literature , dialects or non-standard literature , it is a real enrichment , " said cole .
" that 's something i actually miss in standard german literature .
one thing i like about germany is how many dialects there are , and how people cultivate their dialects .
they have really different ways of expressing themselves . " bildunterschrift : fishing is an integral part of local scottish culture the personal element fitzgerald kusz , a franconian poet from nuremberg , said that in translating scots poems he was surprised to discover traces of that dialect 's germanic roots .
kusz has spoken franconian since childhood and regards his dialect as an intimate and comfortable form of communication . " on one hand , globalization continues strengthen its hold , " he said , " high german , the unified language , can be heard on television in every village .
but there is , in fact , a movement among the people to keep their languages alive . " and that is one primary goal of dialect literature , he added . one of kusz ' scots counterparts , alexander hutchison , said " a shift into the dialect makes things much more personal … for me it 's just a different instrument . " although hutchison , who lives in glasgow , is not optimistic about current attempts to cultivate dialect in scotland 's schools , he said that in poetry the scots dialect is every bit as viable a form of self-expression as standard english . " if people do n't understand the dialect , they ca n't connect , " he said .
" but if they do understand it , then there 's an immediacy - a personal element - that you can not get in the parent language .
there 's just as much possibility of a lack in the parent language as there is in the dialect .
they operate in different dimensions to me . " the flip-side of globalization franconian poet helmut haberkamm , who grew up in a farming village not far from erlangen , told deutsche welle in an email interview that franconian is " deeply and unmistakably connected to my childhood and the early emotions and experiences which formed me , predetermined parts of my life , and arranged my existence . " franconian is inextricably dissolved in my person .
it is my language of emotion and intimacy , " he added . haberkamm has translated the works of shetlandic poet robert alan jamieson .
although the environments of sheltand and franconia vary greatly , haberkamm said he found striking similarities in the way nature is woven into the lives and languages of both regions . in translating jamieson 's poems , he said he wanted " to bring out the simple , gripping way these people express themselves . " haberkamm described regionalism as the " necessary flip-side of globalization , " adding that " people without an understanding of their roots and concrete values are easily manipulated . " endangered by mobility although hutchison expressed similar sentiments while speaking about his desire to preserve scots and see it flourish , he compared the dialect to a " threatened habitat , " endangered by time and changing patterns of human behavior .
having lived for years in north america , hutchison said he understands the pressures modern existence exerts on local cultures . " people move around , people move off , people do n't stay in one place long enough to develop it , " he said .
" there are new dialects springing up all the time .
if there 's enough settled community , they 'll find a language . " i 'm always wary of standardization , of people trying to impose things .
as a poet , i never want to make rules for other poets . " author : gerhard schneibel editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 12.10.2009 germany needs to improve to become a world cup favorite großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany got the result they needed when it counted germany got the job done in a relative easy group and qualified for the world cup .
but how does the team measure up to the world 's top national teams ?
deutsche welle 's jefferson chase takes a closer look . the one moment that best symbolizes the 1-0 win over moscow that qualified germany for the 2010 world cup in south africa was directly after the lone goal was scored .
striker miroslav klose celebrated with one of his trademark forward flips - and only narrowly avoided landing on his backside .
match reports in german newspapers , perhaps understandably , were full of superlatives about germany 's gutsy away win .
but that 1-0 victory was of the knife-edge variety , unlike germany 's 1-0 loss to spain in the 2008 european championships , the last time coach joachim loew had a chance to win a title .
so have germany improved enough to draw level with the spaniards or brazil ?
or are they more on a par with other large european nations like england , the netherlands and italy .
here 's a back-to-front run-through of the strengths and weaknesses of the german squad .
defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adler could become the next in a long line of stellar german national keepers the one position about which loew has absolutely no worries is goal .
24-year-old rene adler was the key to germany 's victory , making a number of world-class saves , and seems to have sealed his position as germany 's number one .
the young keeper 's most brilliant moment in moscow came in the 73rd minute , when russian midfielder igor semshov was clear on the right side and slotted a crisp pass in the direction of two teammates waiting in front of goal .
adler not only got a hand to the ball but cleverly deflected it over the end line .
and should adler get hurt , loew can call on robert enke , manuel neuer or even tim wiese who 've all proved their worth at the international level .
left back philipp lahm is arguably the best in the world at his position so his selection is a no-brainer .
interior defenders per mertesacker and heiko westermann provide a solid anchor in the back four .
youngster serdar tasci could also play a role .
the big question is right back .
jerome boateng , who made his national-team debut in russia , showed he was capable of provided some welcome offensive pressure .
but the 21-year-old also got himself sent off with a red card .
loew 's task will be to get the youngster enough experience in friendlies between now and next june that he no longer poses a risk .
otherwise , he 'll be forced to fall back on arne friedrich , who 's been mediocre at best when wearing the german kit .
defensive midfield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack is a force in midfield but germany could use a threat like russia 's andrei arshavin though not the force he once was german captain michael ballack is the lynchpin of the german squad .
the 33-year-old not only wins lots of challenges but is responsible for the opening passes for germany 's offense .
to cover ballack 's back when he presses forward , simon rolfes is a good choice .
and thomas hitzlsperger is also a more offensive option because of his ability to blast in shots from long-range .
if ballack were to go down to injury , though , germany would be in trouble .
ballack is to germany what gennaro gattuso has been to italy , and loew needs to plan , as best he can , for the eventuality that his captain is unavailable .
the problem is that no one currently on the squad or on the radar screen has the ability to fill the stopper-meets-playmaker role ballack occupies .
offensive midfield and wingers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is counting on youngsters like jerome boateng , marko marin and mesut oezil the emergence of mesut oezil represents the biggest improvement of germany 's likely 2010 squad over the 2008 edition .
the 20-year-old displayed both his pace and his eye for his teammates in setting up the lone goal in moscow that punched germany 's world cup ticket .
but after that , the quality tails off .
bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski are active but relatively inefficient players who 've never lived up their potential .
it will be interesting to see whether youngster marko marin , oezil 's equally fleet-footed teammate at werder bremen , can break into the germany 's starting eleven .
but even if he does , a comparison with the world 's top teams suggests that germany 's offensive midfield is a relative weakness .
spain are spoiled for choice with xabi alonso , xavi , fabregas , iniesta and senna .
brazil , too , can chose from nearly a dozen top-quality midfielders , including kaka , whose skills and creativity are far superior to any member of the german squad .
thus , as the squad stands , germany may find it difficult to come back if they go behind early in matches - something that most teams need to do if they want to take a major international title .
bildunterschrift : klose showed his age in executing his celebratory front flip - he landed on his backside , not his feet the center forward this position is one of the biggest question marks in the team .
if the russia match is anything to go by , loew could likely rely on a 4-3-3 formation for much of the tournament in south africa .
that essentially means the battle to fill the lone central forward slot is between miroslav klose and mario gomez , the same pair of players contesting the same position at their mutual club bayern munich .
for now klose , who will be 32 years old next summer , gets the nod because he , in contrast to gomez , has been effective for the national squad in the past .
but he 's clearly lost a bit of athleticism , so in his heart of hearts , loew might well prefer the 24-year-old gomez .
loew choice will probably be influenced by how much playing time the two strikers get at bayern munich .
however that situation turns out , though , what loew does n't have is a center forward who can create goal opportunities for himself a la wayne rooney for england or thierry henry for france .
that means that germany could have trouble against other defensively oriented teams like italy .
as one of the best teams at the back in the world , germany could certainly fly high in south africa , and no nation will relish facing them .
but their creative deficiencies at the front also mean that loew 's men , if they face tough opponents early on , could end up smack on their backsides .

but a group of german and scottish poets who have translated it found out just how similar europeans are . from landlocked farms in the franconia region of bavaria to fishing villages on the coast of scotland or the shetland islands , regional dialects throughout consolidated and globalized europe are something of an endangered cultural resource . the task of preserving them goes in part to dialect poets , including two germans and two scots who have been involved in a project to translate regional verse . last year they held a workshop in fife , scotland , where they communicated through oral translators and were provided with literal " gloss " translations in both languages of each other 's poems .
today , they say the experience has had a lasting effect on how they view their poetry . ties to the land the sentiments of dialect poems are often expressed through rustic and geographically-bound language .
while franconian poets often work with imagery and idiomatic expressions based on a life of farming , the scots poets do so with a life of fishing in mind .
in some instances , this makes literal translation impossible and forces the poets to search for comparable literary devices . isabel cole organized the workshop and edits a berlin-based journal of german literature in english translation called " no man 's land . "
she said dialect is less accepted in germany as a form of literary expression than it is in scotland . " i think if people are open-minded about literature , dialects or non-standard literature , it is a real enrichment , " said cole .
" that 's something i actually miss in standard german literature .
one thing i like about germany is how many dialects there are , and how people cultivate their dialects .

" lagerfeld also said that the current backlash against skinny models was being fuelled by overweight women who resent being reminded of their weight issues .
" these are fat moms sitting with their bags of chips in front of the tv and saying that thin models are ugly , " lagerfeld said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl lagerfeld the head designer for chanel made the comments in monday 's edition of german news magazine focus .
he was responding to a decision announced last week by top-selling german women 's magazine brigitte to forgo thin professional models .
instead , brigitte 's editors plan to feature real women they say represent more relatable ideals of beauty .
lagerfeld slammed the idea as " absurd , " arguing that the world of fashion is supposed to be about " dreams and illusions . "
from 2001 to 2002 , lagerfeld displayed an iron will as he whittled some 40 kilos -lrb- 90 pounds -rrb- off his frame in just 13 months .
since then , he has been outspoken when it comes to the correlation between fashion and size .
in 2004 , for example , he announced his irritation over a decision by swedish retailer h & m to make his designs for a one-off collection available in larger sizes .
" what i created was fashion for slim , slender people , " he said then , vowing never to work with the company again .
debate has become hysterical , designer says fellow german designer john ribbe was also quoted in focus , saying the current debate about too-skinny models had become hysterical .
" that 's another one of those cliches , like saying that all models take drugs and get drunk at sex orgies , " ribbe said .
" ninety percent are totally normal , well-proportioned girls with less fat and more muscle , but who also eat pizza and burgers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : starting in january , brigitte will feature " real women " instead of models according to brigitte editor andreas lebert , the average catwalk model today weighs some 23 percent less than the average woman on the street .
a few designers , however , are realizing that not all professional models have to be a size zero .
a case in point is us model crystal renn , who recently released a book entitled " hungry , " in which she details her struggle to meet the demands of agents who told her to lose weight if she wanted to work .
renn became anorexic in her pursuit to fit into the typical fashion mould before deciding that her health was more important .
now a voluptuous us size 12 , her modelling career is taking off .
she has been featured in fashion bible vogue magazine six times and walked the runway for designers such as jeanpaul gaultier .
renn is using her newfound stardom to plead for the world of fashion to recognize a multitude of beauty ideals - including women who are naturally a size two .
" all women bring something different to the table and we have to appreciate them all , " she said. dc / ap / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the deal also received heavy criticism from azerbaijan over unsolved armenian-azeri territorial disputes . even though the ink has dried on the protocols signed by the foreign ministers of turkey and armenia , there is no guarantee that the parties will or can make the agreements a reality .
indeed , turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan was first out of the gate with a cautionary note .
" we want all the borders to be opened at the same time ... , but as long as armenia has not withdrawn from azerbaijani territory that it is occupying , turkey can not have a positive attitude on this subject , " said erdogan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nagorno-karabakh dispute puts the deal at risk in the late 1980 's , as the soviet union was dissolving , violence broke out in the ethnic armenian enclave of nagorno-karabakh within azerbaijan 's internationally recognized borders .
in 1993 a war broke out when armenia sent in troops to support the ethnic armenians and they drove azeri troops from seven districts next to nagorno-karabakh .
they have remained there ever since .
azerbaijan condemns accord in support of the turkic speaking azeris , turkey closed its border with armenia when armenia went into azerbaijan .
hence ankara 's insistence that armenia pull out of azerbaijan before the protocols can be ratified in the turkish parliament .
in azerbaijan , the foreign ministry issued a statement saying that the accords should not have been signed while nagorno-karabakh is still occupied .
" the normalization of relations between turkey and armenia before the withdrawal of armenian troops from occupied azeri territory is in direct contradiction to the national interests of azerbaijan , " said the statement .
by all accounts , the signing was an historic event .
nearly a year in the making , discretely abetted by the swiss .
however , the signing ceremony for the protocols that pledge to establish diplomatic relations , open borders and to set up an historic commission to investigate armenian deaths in world war i , almost fell through when the parties disagreed over some of the wording in the statements to be delivered at the end of the signing ceremony .
protests around the world the agreement between the two countries has sparked widespread controversy .
some 10,000 people marched in the armenian capital yerevan to protest the agreement .
they are part of a global protest movement that fears the signing of the protocols will lessen the emphasis on the mass killings of armenians during world war i. bildunterschrift : the deal between turkey and armenia include a provision to set up a historical commission to investigate the events of world war i. yerevan claims that during the war , the ottoman turks committed genocide by killing more than a million armenians and wants ankara to acknowledge it .
turkey admits that there were deaths , but vehemently deny that the number of dead approach the threshold of the definition for genocide .

the deal also received heavy criticism from azerbaijan over unsolved armenian-azeri territorial disputes . even though the ink has dried on the protocols signed by the foreign ministers of turkey and armenia , there is no guarantee that the parties will or can make the agreements a reality .
indeed , turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan was first out of the gate with a cautionary note .
" we want all the borders to be opened at the same time ... , but as long as armenia has not withdrawn from azerbaijani territory that it is occupying , turkey can not have a positive attitude on this subject , " said erdogan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nagorno-karabakh dispute puts the deal at risk in the late 1980 's , as the soviet union was dissolving , violence broke out in the ethnic armenian enclave of nagorno-karabakh within azerbaijan 's internationally recognized borders .
in 1993 a war broke out when armenia sent in troops to support the ethnic armenians and they drove azeri troops from seven districts next to nagorno-karabakh .
they have remained there ever since .
azerbaijan condemns accord in support of the turkic speaking azeris , turkey closed its border with armenia when armenia went into azerbaijan .
hence ankara 's insistence that armenia pull out of azerbaijan before the protocols can be ratified in the turkish parliament .
in azerbaijan , the foreign ministry issued a statement saying that the accords should not have been signed while nagorno-karabakh is still occupied .
" the normalization of relations between turkey and armenia before the withdrawal of armenian troops from occupied azeri territory is in direct contradiction to the national interests of azerbaijan , " said the statement .
by all accounts , the signing was an historic event .
nearly a year in the making , discretely abetted by the swiss .
however , the signing ceremony for the protocols that pledge to establish diplomatic relations , open borders and to set up an historic commission to investigate armenian deaths in world war i , almost fell through when the parties disagreed over some of the wording in the statements to be delivered at the end of the signing ceremony .
protests around the world the agreement between the two countries has sparked widespread controversy .
some 10,000 people marched in the armenian capital yerevan to protest the agreement .
they are part of a global protest movement that fears the signing of the protocols will lessen the emphasis on the mass killings of armenians during world war i. bildunterschrift : the deal between turkey and armenia include a provision to set up a historical commission to investigate the events of world war i. yerevan claims that during the war , the ottoman turks committed genocide by killing more than a million armenians and wants ankara to acknowledge it .
turkey admits that there were deaths , but vehemently deny that the number of dead approach the threshold of the definition for genocide .

larsson , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , said that although the pandemic has n't hurt the european population as much as feared , it still makes sense to be vaccinated .
" experts have told us that the pandemic will continue for some years , " larsson said .
" if you protect yourself , that will be protection not just for the current situation and the nearest months , but the nearest years . "
the emergence of swine flu in april led to widespread public fears , but since then , two new vaccines have been developed and concerns have abated .
but the eu wants to play it safe , and that means seeing to it that as many people as possible are vaccinated , thereby diminishing the likelihood that the disease will ever get a real grip on the population .
help further afield in that vein , larsson said she and her fellow health ministers would also debate whether it made sense to share their vaccine supplies with developing nations outside the eu .

can it escape the oil curse and become an example to other developing states ? in many ways ghana serves as a model among african countries .
compared to many other west african nations it has been very stable in recent years .
ghana 's peaceful election last year and the successful transition of government from one party to another this year were considered the pinnacle of the country 's progress , which was highlighted by us president barack obama 's visit to accra this summer .
but after the recent announcement by oil giant exxonmobil that it was buying a four billion-dollar stake in ghana 's jubilee oil field , the country is now facing a task that may be even more challenging than the democratic reform process it has undergone : to prove that it can not only successfully deal with a powerful multinational , but also that the windfall that is generated by what is considered to be one of africa 's biggest oil fields does n't end up in the pockets of a few insiders , but improves the wealth and well-being of ghana 's society .
" the stakes are very high , " writes ian gary , an expert in extractive industries , in a report about ghana 's oil find and its consequences for society for the international aid agency oxfam .
" while many ghanaian government officials are confident they can meet the challenge , oil 's threat to democratic development should not be underestimated . "
high stakes , big profits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exxonmobil 's bid beat out other oil giants while the stakes are high , so is the profit .
according to an estimate by the international monetary fund which is cited by gary , ghana 's government can expect revenues from oil and gas up to 20 billion dollars during the production period between 2012 and 2030 for the jubilee field alone .
so what are ghana 's chances to avoid the spell of the so-called oil curse ? " i think that ghana could really be one country which could be a positive example to the world and it could also be profitable and beneficial for the country , " claudia kemfert , an energy specialist at berlin 's economic research institute diw , tells deutsche welle .
" ghana could really profit from this deal and also from the oil market . "
what 's required , adds kemfert , is that ghana 's government puts in place a good political strategy on how it wants to use the oil revenues .
talking to deutsche welle , ulrike bickel , an energy expert with germany 's catholic relief agency misereor , is more skeptical : " we obviously see the danger that ghana could also become a victim of the oil curse , that its oil wealth wo n't benefit the people and that oil revenues just like in neighboring countries , vanish instead of being spent on health , education or sustainable social development . " while bickel points out that ghana , a country without previous experience in the oil sector , has taken positive steps such as signing on to the so-called extractive industries transparency initiative , which mandates its members to openly document the flow of revenues , she adds that it is still far too early to tell whether it will be implemented .
bildunterschrift : president obama 's visit , with ghana president john atta mills highlighted the country 's progress negative example an example that positive declarations and good intentions do n't necessarily translate into enforceable action is chad .
" before the world bank agreed to a large loan for the chad-cameroon pipeline there was an agreement that a fund for future generations would be created and that up to 70 percent of the oil revenues would be used for priority social sector developments , " says bickel .
" but as soon as the oil revenue started to flow , chad 's government , which was fighting a civil war , dissolved the fund for future generations and extended the priority sector developments to include national security .
that means the oil revenue is used to buy large quantities of weapons . " that does n't mean that agreements and declarations are n't useful .
they definitely are .
but reality eventually is the ultimate test whether those agreements are fulfilled .
ghana , say the analysts , among developing african nations , is perhaps best prepared to manage its oil wealth carefully . as oxfam expert gary wrote in his report on ghana : " oil wealth tends to erode democratic accountability .
ghana 's challenge will be to ensure that the right institutions and transparent policies are in place before oil production starts . "
currently oil production at the jubilee field is scheduled for 2010 . author : michael knigge editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

can it escape the oil curse and become an example to other developing states ? in many ways ghana serves as a model among african countries .
compared to many other west african nations it has been very stable in recent years .
ghana 's peaceful election last year and the successful transition of government from one party to another this year were considered the pinnacle of the country 's progress , which was highlighted by us president barack obama 's visit to accra this summer .
but after the recent announcement by oil giant exxonmobil that it was buying a four billion-dollar stake in ghana 's jubilee oil field , the country is now facing a task that may be even more challenging than the democratic reform process it has undergone : to prove that it can not only successfully deal with a powerful multinational , but also that the windfall that is generated by what is considered to be one of africa 's biggest oil fields does n't end up in the pockets of a few insiders , but improves the wealth and well-being of ghana 's society .
" the stakes are very high , " writes ian gary , an expert in extractive industries , in a report about ghana 's oil find and its consequences for society for the international aid agency oxfam .
" while many ghanaian government officials are confident they can meet the challenge , oil 's threat to democratic development should not be underestimated . "
high stakes , big profits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exxonmobil 's bid beat out other oil giants while the stakes are high , so is the profit .
according to an estimate by the international monetary fund which is cited by gary , ghana 's government can expect revenues from oil and gas up to 20 billion dollars during the production period between 2012 and 2030 for the jubilee field alone .
so what are ghana 's chances to avoid the spell of the so-called oil curse ? " i think that ghana could really be one country which could be a positive example to the world and it could also be profitable and beneficial for the country , " claudia kemfert , an energy specialist at berlin 's economic research institute diw , tells deutsche welle .
" ghana could really profit from this deal and also from the oil market . "
what 's required , adds kemfert , is that ghana 's government puts in place a good political strategy on how it wants to use the oil revenues .
talking to deutsche welle , ulrike bickel , an energy expert with germany 's catholic relief agency misereor , is more skeptical : " we obviously see the danger that ghana could also become a victim of the oil curse , that its oil wealth wo n't benefit the people and that oil revenues just like in neighboring countries , vanish instead of being spent on health , education or sustainable social development . " while bickel points out that ghana , a country without previous experience in the oil sector , has taken positive steps such as signing on to the so-called extractive industries transparency initiative , which mandates its members to openly document the flow of revenues , she adds that it is still far too early to tell whether it will be implemented .

leonid ivlev , a member of the central elections commission , told reporters that the ruling party had garnered almost 80 percent of seats up for grabs in the 75 regional and local elections held up and down the country on sunday .
ivlev said putin 's party picked up 107 of the 135 regional seats and 189 of the 235 seats available in municipal legislatures .
they also emerged victorious in the eagerly-watched race for moscow 's city legislature .
with 99 percent of votes in , the ria-novosti news agency reported a 66 percent win for united russia .
praise from the president the opposition communists were the only rivals to score any seats in the high-profile ballot , which only managed to attract a 35 percent voter turnout .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president dmitry medvedev praised the results in comments on the united russia party website , president dmitry medvedev told his country , which has been particularly hard hit by the economic downturn , that they had voted for the right party .
" only together can we surmount the hardships of the financial crisis , " he wrote , " and the vote obtained by united russia demonstrates that we are together and this is most important . "
he went on to say that the 30 million-strong electorate clearly knew what it wanted .
" taking account that elections in the capital are practically federal ones , we can state that in the crisis situation voters have demonstrated they stay together with the ruling party . "
claims of fraud but the liberal yabloko party , which came away from the vote completely empty-handed , has made claims of systematic vote rigging .
yabloko , which failed to reach the 7 percent hurdle in moscow 's local election , has condemned the 17-year-reign of mayor yury luzhkov , accusing him of carrying out " one of the all-time election frauds in russia 's recent history . "
on sunday , while the ballot boxes were still open , yabloko said it had received a " storm of calls " from the moscow electorate , complaining that they were unable to cast their vote because someone else had already done so using their name .
" united russia used so-called carousel voting , " said yabloko spokesman sergey mitrohin .
" this time , it was busloads of soldiers and police that they took from one polling station to another and had them cast their votes for united russia over and over .
we also have serious reason to believe that the ballot boxes were stuffed with additional ballots . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition parties say they will contest moscow 's municipal ballot yabloko and communist party representatives have already said they will contest the results of the municipal poll in court .
" we can not recognize these elections or consider them normal , " communist party deputy chairman vladimir kashin told ria-novosti .
the independent election watchdog golog has come out behind the opposition parties , and has said it will provide proof of fraud . earlier , head of the watchdog , liliya shibanova , lamented the lack of political competition in russia .
" medvedev says we need competition , we need a multi-party system , but election results show the exact opposite , " she said. tkw / dc / afp / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de classical -pipe- 12.10.2009 european orchestras start recording labels to defy extinction großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the classical music industry is changing - not yielding the classical music industry has been declared dead several times in the last few years , but it simply refuses to die .
a new trend aims to keep classical recordings from becoming a taxidermist ’ s project . methods of recording , distribution , and promotion are changing in the classical music industry , and the companies that once dominated the market have either adapted or faltered .
as estimable names in the industry fall by the wayside , new models arise . one of the most successful projects has been the establishment of classical labels by orchestras , with a focus on live recordings . while exclusive contracts with the big-name labels - emi , deutsche grammophon / decca , sony / rca , telarc / warner - became scarce , and their recording projects fewer and fewer , orchestras are inevitably searching for new ways to reach new audiences with new recordings . recording technology has advanced significantly in the last 20 years so that recording concerts live is no longer an inherently hampered way to preserve an otherwise un-replicable musical event . " recording technology is so mobile that there are no qualitative differences between studio and live recordings , " said chaz jenkins , head of the london symphony orchestra 's own label , lso live . the live experience jenkins is one of the pioneers of the orchestra-record-label industry .
he has been with lso live , the first label of an orchestra to enter the market this way , since it was founded in 2000 .
the concept of the label has been replicated by many other orchestras -lrb- often with the help of lso live -rrb- , which the london orchestra 's efforts paved the way for . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sir colin davis specializes in berlioz the goal of lso live was not to replicate what labels have done in the past , but to do something different , and , in particular , to retain the orchestra 's work in the concert hall . " with 2,000 people in front of them , there ’ s a very different energy and emotion available , " said jenkins .
" when recording companies started to rely on re-releasing recordings , the alarm bells were ringing at the lso … if no new recordings are released , then the public starts to see the whole industry as dead - a museum-culture . " but there is still plenty of interest in concerts and no decline in audiences , so there should be new recordings as well , he added . over three million records sold one of the main reasons to found the label and record around the turn of 1999 was the opportunity to record conductor sir colin davis performing one of his specialties , hector berlioz ' orchestral and choral music . davis , then lso 's music director , recorded a complete cycle and success quickly followed .
the first grammy was awarded to the label in 2002 for the recording of berlioz ' massive opera " le troyens , " which sold an astounding 100,000 copies .
that grabbed attention for the label , which has since issued some 70 albums and sold over three million copies . for lso , unlike traditional record companies , the label is not something that needs to be boosted with a marketing campaign - it is a marketing campaign . money less of an issue this fall , the classical channel of germany 's bavarian broadcasting -lrb- br -rrb- is launching br klassik , a new label for its own orchestras and choir .
the bavarian radio symphony orchestra , the munich radio orchestra , and the bavarian radio chorus now all have the opportunity to pick the finest performances in any given season and immortalize them on record . the model of lso live is behind this new venture , too , but there are significant differences .
as a public radio station , with the aid of radio license fees and a cultural mission to fulfill , the br already records all the concerts of its musical bodies . " rather than having to decide beforehand what to record -lrb- with the subsequent pressure to publish it , no matter the result -rrb- , the artists and artistic advisors can pick the best from the lot , " said br klassik 's label manager stefan piendl .
mahler and bruckner symphonies , conducted by mariss jansons , are among the first releases . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : live recordings are becoming more relevant since the cost of recording is already offset , releasing rare , artistically important works with modest commercial prospects is more feasible . sharing musical treasures the label 's motto is simple : those possessing treasures should share them . " sharing our best musical moments , and deciding ourselves , independent of traditional labels and their naturally different criteria of what makes a successful release , were sone of the main motivations behind the founding of br klassik , " said piendl . with an estimated 20,000 recordings from the past 60 years in its vast archives , the br has a few treasures to share .
the archives include memorable performances by top musicians , which were only broadcast once on radio .
three or four recordings from the vaults are projected to see the light each year . br klassik is the latest example of the beauty of creative destruction .
out of the detritus of the old recording companies , dozens of new labels are springing up with thousands of recordings , offering more choice and rarer works than were ever available before - and that nearly a decade after the declaration of the industry ’ s imminent death . author : jens f. laurson editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a new trend aims to keep classical recordings from becoming a taxidermist ’ s project . methods of recording , distribution , and promotion are changing in the classical music industry , and the companies that once dominated the market have either adapted or faltered .
as estimable names in the industry fall by the wayside , new models arise . one of the most successful projects has been the establishment of classical labels by orchestras , with a focus on live recordings . while exclusive contracts with the big-name labels - emi , deutsche grammophon / decca , sony / rca , telarc / warner - became scarce , and their recording projects fewer and fewer , orchestras are inevitably searching for new ways to reach new audiences with new recordings . recording technology has advanced significantly in the last 20 years so that recording concerts live is no longer an inherently hampered way to preserve an otherwise un-replicable musical event . " recording technology is so mobile that there are no qualitative differences between studio and live recordings , " said chaz jenkins , head of the london symphony orchestra 's own label , lso live . the live experience jenkins is one of the pioneers of the orchestra-record-label industry .
he has been with lso live , the first label of an orchestra to enter the market this way , since it was founded in 2000 .

" with 2,000 people in front of them , there ’ s a very different energy and emotion available , " said jenkins .
" when recording companies started to rely on re-releasing recordings , the alarm bells were ringing at the lso … if no new recordings are released , then the public starts to see the whole industry as dead - a museum-culture .

the first grammy was awarded to the label in 2002 for the recording of berlioz ' massive opera " le troyens , " which sold an astounding 100,000 copies .
that grabbed attention for the label , which has since issued some 70 albums and sold over three million copies . for lso , unlike traditional record companies , the label is not something that needs to be boosted with a marketing campaign - it is a marketing campaign . money less of an issue this fall , the classical channel of germany 's bavarian broadcasting -lrb- br -rrb- is launching br klassik , a new label for its own orchestras and choir .

can it escape the oil curse and become an example to other developing states ? in many ways ghana serves as a model among african countries .
compared to many other west african nations it has been very stable in recent years .
ghana 's peaceful election last year and the successful transition of government from one party to another this year were considered the pinnacle of the country 's progress , which was highlighted by us president barack obama 's visit to accra this summer .
but after the recent announcement by oil giant exxonmobil that it was buying a four billion-dollar stake in ghana 's jubilee oil field , the country is now facing a task that may be even more challenging than the democratic reform process it has undergone : to prove that it can not only successfully deal with a powerful multinational , but also that the windfall that is generated by what is considered to be one of africa 's biggest oil fields does n't end up in the pockets of a few insiders , but improves the wealth and well-being of ghana 's society .
" the stakes are very high , " writes ian gary , an expert in extractive industries , in a report about ghana 's oil find and its consequences for society for the international aid agency oxfam .
" while many ghanaian government officials are confident they can meet the challenge , oil 's threat to democratic development should not be underestimated . "
high stakes , big profits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exxonmobil 's bid beat out other oil giants while the stakes are high , so is the profit .
according to an estimate by the international monetary fund which is cited by gary , ghana 's government can expect revenues from oil and gas up to 20 billion dollars during the production period between 2012 and 2030 for the jubilee field alone .
so what are ghana 's chances to avoid the spell of the so-called oil curse ? " i think that ghana could really be one country which could be a positive example to the world and it could also be profitable and beneficial for the country , " claudia kemfert , an energy specialist at berlin 's economic research institute diw , tells deutsche welle .
" ghana could really profit from this deal and also from the oil market . "
what 's required , adds kemfert , is that ghana 's government puts in place a good political strategy on how it wants to use the oil revenues .
talking to deutsche welle , ulrike bickel , an energy expert with germany 's catholic relief agency misereor , is more skeptical : " we obviously see the danger that ghana could also become a victim of the oil curse , that its oil wealth wo n't benefit the people and that oil revenues just like in neighboring countries , vanish instead of being spent on health , education or sustainable social development . " while bickel points out that ghana , a country without previous experience in the oil sector , has taken positive steps such as signing on to the so-called extractive industries transparency initiative , which mandates its members to openly document the flow of revenues , she adds that it is still far too early to tell whether it will be implemented .
bildunterschrift : president obama 's visit , with ghana president john atta mills highlighted the country 's progress negative example an example that positive declarations and good intentions do n't necessarily translate into enforceable action is chad .
" before the world bank agreed to a large loan for the chad-cameroon pipeline there was an agreement that a fund for future generations would be created and that up to 70 percent of the oil revenues would be used for priority social sector developments , " says bickel .
" but as soon as the oil revenue started to flow , chad 's government , which was fighting a civil war , dissolved the fund for future generations and extended the priority sector developments to include national security .
that means the oil revenue is used to buy large quantities of weapons . " that does n't mean that agreements and declarations are n't useful .
they definitely are .
but reality eventually is the ultimate test whether those agreements are fulfilled .
ghana , say the analysts , among developing african nations , is perhaps best prepared to manage its oil wealth carefully . as oxfam expert gary wrote in his report on ghana : " oil wealth tends to erode democratic accountability .
ghana 's challenge will be to ensure that the right institutions and transparent policies are in place before oil production starts . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 12.10.2009 dialect poetry in translation connects regional cultures across europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franconian poetry is closely linked to the land poetry written in regional dialect helps preserve local language and way of life in a globalized world .
but a group of german and scottish poets who have translated it found out just how similar europeans are . from landlocked farms in the franconia region of bavaria to fishing villages on the coast of scotland or the shetland islands , regional dialects throughout consolidated and globalized europe are something of an endangered cultural resource . the task of preserving them goes in part to dialect poets , including two germans and two scots who have been involved in a project to translate regional verse . last year they held a workshop in fife , scotland , where they communicated through oral translators and were provided with literal " gloss " translations in both languages of each other 's poems .
today , they say the experience has had a lasting effect on how they view their poetry . ties to the land the sentiments of dialect poems are often expressed through rustic and geographically-bound language .
while franconian poets often work with imagery and idiomatic expressions based on a life of farming , the scots poets do so with a life of fishing in mind .
in some instances , this makes literal translation impossible and forces the poets to search for comparable literary devices . isabel cole organized the workshop and edits a berlin-based journal of german literature in english translation called " no man 's land . "
she said dialect is less accepted in germany as a form of literary expression than it is in scotland . " i think if people are open-minded about literature , dialects or non-standard literature , it is a real enrichment , " said cole .
" that 's something i actually miss in standard german literature .
one thing i like about germany is how many dialects there are , and how people cultivate their dialects .
they have really different ways of expressing themselves . " bildunterschrift : fishing is an integral part of local scottish culture the personal element fitzgerald kusz , a franconian poet from nuremberg , said that in translating scots poems he was surprised to discover traces of that dialect 's germanic roots .
kusz has spoken franconian since childhood and regards his dialect as an intimate and comfortable form of communication . " on one hand , globalization continues strengthen its hold , " he said , " high german , the unified language , can be heard on television in every village .
but there is , in fact , a movement among the people to keep their languages alive . " and that is one primary goal of dialect literature , he added . one of kusz ' scots counterparts , alexander hutchison , said " a shift into the dialect makes things much more personal … for me it 's just a different instrument . " although hutchison , who lives in glasgow , is not optimistic about current attempts to cultivate dialect in scotland 's schools , he said that in poetry the scots dialect is every bit as viable a form of self-expression as standard english . " if people do n't understand the dialect , they ca n't connect , " he said .
" but if they do understand it , then there 's an immediacy - a personal element - that you can not get in the parent language .
there 's just as much possibility of a lack in the parent language as there is in the dialect .
they operate in different dimensions to me . " the flip-side of globalization franconian poet helmut haberkamm , who grew up in a farming village not far from erlangen , told deutsche welle in an email interview that franconian is " deeply and unmistakably connected to my childhood and the early emotions and experiences which formed me , predetermined parts of my life , and arranged my existence . " franconian is inextricably dissolved in my person .
it is my language of emotion and intimacy , " he added . haberkamm has translated the works of shetlandic poet robert alan jamieson .
although the environments of sheltand and franconia vary greatly , haberkamm said he found striking similarities in the way nature is woven into the lives and languages of both regions . in translating jamieson 's poems , he said he wanted " to bring out the simple , gripping way these people express themselves . " haberkamm described regionalism as the " necessary flip-side of globalization , " adding that " people without an understanding of their roots and concrete values are easily manipulated . " endangered by mobility although hutchison expressed similar sentiments while speaking about his desire to preserve scots and see it flourish , he compared the dialect to a " threatened habitat , " endangered by time and changing patterns of human behavior .
having lived for years in north america , hutchison said he understands the pressures modern existence exerts on local cultures . " people move around , people move off , people do n't stay in one place long enough to develop it , " he said .
" there are new dialects springing up all the time .
if there 's enough settled community , they 'll find a language . " i 'm always wary of standardization , of people trying to impose things .
as a poet , i never want to make rules for other poets . " author : gerhard schneibel editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

larsson , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , said that although the pandemic has n't hurt the european population as much as feared , it still makes sense to be vaccinated .
" experts have told us that the pandemic will continue for some years , " larsson said .
" if you protect yourself , that will be protection not just for the current situation and the nearest months , but the nearest years . "
the emergence of swine flu in april led to widespread public fears , but since then , two new vaccines have been developed and concerns have abated .
but the eu wants to play it safe , and that means seeing to it that as many people as possible are vaccinated , thereby diminishing the likelihood that the disease will ever get a real grip on the population .

the deal also received heavy criticism from azerbaijan over unsolved armenian-azeri territorial disputes . even though the ink has dried on the protocols signed by the foreign ministers of turkey and armenia , there is no guarantee that the parties will or can make the agreements a reality .
indeed , turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan was first out of the gate with a cautionary note .
" we want all the borders to be opened at the same time ... , but as long as armenia has not withdrawn from azerbaijani territory that it is occupying , turkey can not have a positive attitude on this subject , " said erdogan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nagorno-karabakh dispute puts the deal at risk in the late 1980 's , as the soviet union was dissolving , violence broke out in the ethnic armenian enclave of nagorno-karabakh within azerbaijan 's internationally recognized borders .
in 1993 a war broke out when armenia sent in troops to support the ethnic armenians and they drove azeri troops from seven districts next to nagorno-karabakh .
they have remained there ever since .
azerbaijan condemns accord in support of the turkic speaking azeris , turkey closed its border with armenia when armenia went into azerbaijan .
hence ankara 's insistence that armenia pull out of azerbaijan before the protocols can be ratified in the turkish parliament .
in azerbaijan , the foreign ministry issued a statement saying that the accords should not have been signed while nagorno-karabakh is still occupied .
" the normalization of relations between turkey and armenia before the withdrawal of armenian troops from occupied azeri territory is in direct contradiction to the national interests of azerbaijan , " said the statement .
by all accounts , the signing was an historic event .
nearly a year in the making , discretely abetted by the swiss .
however , the signing ceremony for the protocols that pledge to establish diplomatic relations , open borders and to set up an historic commission to investigate armenian deaths in world war i , almost fell through when the parties disagreed over some of the wording in the statements to be delivered at the end of the signing ceremony .
protests around the world the agreement between the two countries has sparked widespread controversy .
some 10,000 people marched in the armenian capital yerevan to protest the agreement .
they are part of a global protest movement that fears the signing of the protocols will lessen the emphasis on the mass killings of armenians during world war i. bildunterschrift : the deal between turkey and armenia include a provision to set up a historical commission to investigate the events of world war i. yerevan claims that during the war , the ottoman turks committed genocide by killing more than a million armenians and wants ankara to acknowledge it .
turkey admits that there were deaths , but vehemently deny that the number of dead approach the threshold of the definition for genocide .

but how does the team measure up to the world 's top national teams ?
deutsche welle 's jefferson chase takes a closer look . the one moment that best symbolizes the 1-0 win over moscow that qualified germany for the 2010 world cup in south africa was directly after the lone goal was scored .
striker miroslav klose celebrated with one of his trademark forward flips - and only narrowly avoided landing on his backside .
match reports in german newspapers , perhaps understandably , were full of superlatives about germany 's gutsy away win .
but that 1-0 victory was of the knife-edge variety , unlike germany 's 1-0 loss to spain in the 2008 european championships , the last time coach joachim loew had a chance to win a title .
so have germany improved enough to draw level with the spaniards or brazil ?
or are they more on a par with other large european nations like england , the netherlands and italy .
here 's a back-to-front run-through of the strengths and weaknesses of the german squad .
defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adler could become the next in a long line of stellar german national keepers the one position about which loew has absolutely no worries is goal .
24-year-old rene adler was the key to germany 's victory , making a number of world-class saves , and seems to have sealed his position as germany 's number one .
the young keeper 's most brilliant moment in moscow came in the 73rd minute , when russian midfielder igor semshov was clear on the right side and slotted a crisp pass in the direction of two teammates waiting in front of goal .
adler not only got a hand to the ball but cleverly deflected it over the end line .
and should adler get hurt , loew can call on robert enke , manuel neuer or even tim wiese who 've all proved their worth at the international level .
left back philipp lahm is arguably the best in the world at his position so his selection is a no-brainer .
interior defenders per mertesacker and heiko westermann provide a solid anchor in the back four .
youngster serdar tasci could also play a role .
the big question is right back .
jerome boateng , who made his national-team debut in russia , showed he was capable of provided some welcome offensive pressure .
but the 21-year-old also got himself sent off with a red card .
loew 's task will be to get the youngster enough experience in friendlies between now and next june that he no longer poses a risk .
otherwise , he 'll be forced to fall back on arne friedrich , who 's been mediocre at best when wearing the german kit .
defensive midfield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack is a force in midfield but germany could use a threat like russia 's andrei arshavin though not the force he once was german captain michael ballack is the lynchpin of the german squad .
the 33-year-old not only wins lots of challenges but is responsible for the opening passes for germany 's offense .
to cover ballack 's back when he presses forward , simon rolfes is a good choice .
and thomas hitzlsperger is also a more offensive option because of his ability to blast in shots from long-range .
if ballack were to go down to injury , though , germany would be in trouble .
ballack is to germany what gennaro gattuso has been to italy , and loew needs to plan , as best he can , for the eventuality that his captain is unavailable .
the problem is that no one currently on the squad or on the radar screen has the ability to fill the stopper-meets-playmaker role ballack occupies .
offensive midfield and wingers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is counting on youngsters like jerome boateng , marko marin and mesut oezil the emergence of mesut oezil represents the biggest improvement of germany 's likely 2010 squad over the 2008 edition .
the 20-year-old displayed both his pace and his eye for his teammates in setting up the lone goal in moscow that punched germany 's world cup ticket .
but after that , the quality tails off .
bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski are active but relatively inefficient players who 've never lived up their potential .
it will be interesting to see whether youngster marko marin , oezil 's equally fleet-footed teammate at werder bremen , can break into the germany 's starting eleven .
but even if he does , a comparison with the world 's top teams suggests that germany 's offensive midfield is a relative weakness .
spain are spoiled for choice with xabi alonso , xavi , fabregas , iniesta and senna .
brazil , too , can chose from nearly a dozen top-quality midfielders , including kaka , whose skills and creativity are far superior to any member of the german squad .
thus , as the squad stands , germany may find it difficult to come back if they go behind early in matches - something that most teams need to do if they want to take a major international title .
bildunterschrift : klose showed his age in executing his celebratory front flip - he landed on his backside , not his feet the center forward this position is one of the biggest question marks in the team .
if the russia match is anything to go by , loew could likely rely on a 4-3-3 formation for much of the tournament in south africa .
that essentially means the battle to fill the lone central forward slot is between miroslav klose and mario gomez , the same pair of players contesting the same position at their mutual club bayern munich .
for now klose , who will be 32 years old next summer , gets the nod because he , in contrast to gomez , has been effective for the national squad in the past .
but he 's clearly lost a bit of athleticism , so in his heart of hearts , loew might well prefer the 24-year-old gomez .
loew choice will probably be influenced by how much playing time the two strikers get at bayern munich .
however that situation turns out , though , what loew does n't have is a center forward who can create goal opportunities for himself a la wayne rooney for england or thierry henry for france .
that means that germany could have trouble against other defensively oriented teams like italy .
as one of the best teams at the back in the world , germany could certainly fly high in south africa , and no nation will relish facing them .
but their creative deficiencies at the front also mean that loew 's men , if they face tough opponents early on , could end up smack on their backsides .

but how does the team measure up to the world 's top national teams ?
deutsche welle 's jefferson chase takes a closer look . the one moment that best symbolizes the 1-0 win over moscow that qualified germany for the 2010 world cup in south africa was directly after the lone goal was scored .
striker miroslav klose celebrated with one of his trademark forward flips - and only narrowly avoided landing on his backside .
match reports in german newspapers , perhaps understandably , were full of superlatives about germany 's gutsy away win .
but that 1-0 victory was of the knife-edge variety , unlike germany 's 1-0 loss to spain in the 2008 european championships , the last time coach joachim loew had a chance to win a title .
so have germany improved enough to draw level with the spaniards or brazil ?
or are they more on a par with other large european nations like england , the netherlands and italy .
here 's a back-to-front run-through of the strengths and weaknesses of the german squad .
defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adler could become the next in a long line of stellar german national keepers the one position about which loew has absolutely no worries is goal .
24-year-old rene adler was the key to germany 's victory , making a number of world-class saves , and seems to have sealed his position as germany 's number one .
the young keeper 's most brilliant moment in moscow came in the 73rd minute , when russian midfielder igor semshov was clear on the right side and slotted a crisp pass in the direction of two teammates waiting in front of goal .
adler not only got a hand to the ball but cleverly deflected it over the end line .
and should adler get hurt , loew can call on robert enke , manuel neuer or even tim wiese who 've all proved their worth at the international level .
left back philipp lahm is arguably the best in the world at his position so his selection is a no-brainer .
interior defenders per mertesacker and heiko westermann provide a solid anchor in the back four .
youngster serdar tasci could also play a role .
the big question is right back .
jerome boateng , who made his national-team debut in russia , showed he was capable of provided some welcome offensive pressure .
but the 21-year-old also got himself sent off with a red card .
loew 's task will be to get the youngster enough experience in friendlies between now and next june that he no longer poses a risk .
otherwise , he 'll be forced to fall back on arne friedrich , who 's been mediocre at best when wearing the german kit .
defensive midfield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack is a force in midfield but germany could use a threat like russia 's andrei arshavin though not the force he once was german captain michael ballack is the lynchpin of the german squad .
the 33-year-old not only wins lots of challenges but is responsible for the opening passes for germany 's offense .
to cover ballack 's back when he presses forward , simon rolfes is a good choice .
and thomas hitzlsperger is also a more offensive option because of his ability to blast in shots from long-range .
if ballack were to go down to injury , though , germany would be in trouble .
ballack is to germany what gennaro gattuso has been to italy , and loew needs to plan , as best he can , for the eventuality that his captain is unavailable .
the problem is that no one currently on the squad or on the radar screen has the ability to fill the stopper-meets-playmaker role ballack occupies .
offensive midfield and wingers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is counting on youngsters like jerome boateng , marko marin and mesut oezil the emergence of mesut oezil represents the biggest improvement of germany 's likely 2010 squad over the 2008 edition .
the 20-year-old displayed both his pace and his eye for his teammates in setting up the lone goal in moscow that punched germany 's world cup ticket .
but after that , the quality tails off .
bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski are active but relatively inefficient players who 've never lived up their potential .
it will be interesting to see whether youngster marko marin , oezil 's equally fleet-footed teammate at werder bremen , can break into the germany 's starting eleven .
but even if he does , a comparison with the world 's top teams suggests that germany 's offensive midfield is a relative weakness .
spain are spoiled for choice with xabi alonso , xavi , fabregas , iniesta and senna .
brazil , too , can chose from nearly a dozen top-quality midfielders , including kaka , whose skills and creativity are far superior to any member of the german squad .
thus , as the squad stands , germany may find it difficult to come back if they go behind early in matches - something that most teams need to do if they want to take a major international title .
bildunterschrift : klose showed his age in executing his celebratory front flip - he landed on his backside , not his feet the center forward this position is one of the biggest question marks in the team .
if the russia match is anything to go by , loew could likely rely on a 4-3-3 formation for much of the tournament in south africa .

a new trend aims to keep classical recordings from becoming a taxidermist ’ s project . methods of recording , distribution , and promotion are changing in the classical music industry , and the companies that once dominated the market have either adapted or faltered .
as estimable names in the industry fall by the wayside , new models arise . one of the most successful projects has been the establishment of classical labels by orchestras , with a focus on live recordings . while exclusive contracts with the big-name labels - emi , deutsche grammophon / decca , sony / rca , telarc / warner - became scarce , and their recording projects fewer and fewer , orchestras are inevitably searching for new ways to reach new audiences with new recordings . recording technology has advanced significantly in the last 20 years so that recording concerts live is no longer an inherently hampered way to preserve an otherwise un-replicable musical event . " recording technology is so mobile that there are no qualitative differences between studio and live recordings , " said chaz jenkins , head of the london symphony orchestra 's own label , lso live . the live experience jenkins is one of the pioneers of the orchestra-record-label industry .
he has been with lso live , the first label of an orchestra to enter the market this way , since it was founded in 2000 .
the concept of the label has been replicated by many other orchestras -lrb- often with the help of lso live -rrb- , which the london orchestra 's efforts paved the way for . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sir colin davis specializes in berlioz the goal of lso live was not to replicate what labels have done in the past , but to do something different , and , in particular , to retain the orchestra 's work in the concert hall . " with 2,000 people in front of them , there ’ s a very different energy and emotion available , " said jenkins .
" when recording companies started to rely on re-releasing recordings , the alarm bells were ringing at the lso … if no new recordings are released , then the public starts to see the whole industry as dead - a museum-culture . " but there is still plenty of interest in concerts and no decline in audiences , so there should be new recordings as well , he added . over three million records sold one of the main reasons to found the label and record around the turn of 1999 was the opportunity to record conductor sir colin davis performing one of his specialties , hector berlioz ' orchestral and choral music . davis , then lso 's music director , recorded a complete cycle and success quickly followed .
the first grammy was awarded to the label in 2002 for the recording of berlioz ' massive opera " le troyens , " which sold an astounding 100,000 copies .
that grabbed attention for the label , which has since issued some 70 albums and sold over three million copies . for lso , unlike traditional record companies , the label is not something that needs to be boosted with a marketing campaign - it is a marketing campaign . money less of an issue this fall , the classical channel of germany 's bavarian broadcasting -lrb- br -rrb- is launching br klassik , a new label for its own orchestras and choir .
the bavarian radio symphony orchestra , the munich radio orchestra , and the bavarian radio chorus now all have the opportunity to pick the finest performances in any given season and immortalize them on record . the model of lso live is behind this new venture , too , but there are significant differences .
as a public radio station , with the aid of radio license fees and a cultural mission to fulfill , the br already records all the concerts of its musical bodies . " rather than having to decide beforehand what to record -lrb- with the subsequent pressure to publish it , no matter the result -rrb- , the artists and artistic advisors can pick the best from the lot , " said br klassik 's label manager stefan piendl .
mahler and bruckner symphonies , conducted by mariss jansons , are among the first releases . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : live recordings are becoming more relevant since the cost of recording is already offset , releasing rare , artistically important works with modest commercial prospects is more feasible . sharing musical treasures the label 's motto is simple : those possessing treasures should share them . " sharing our best musical moments , and deciding ourselves , independent of traditional labels and their naturally different criteria of what makes a successful release , were sone of the main motivations behind the founding of br klassik , " said piendl . with an estimated 20,000 recordings from the past 60 years in its vast archives , the br has a few treasures to share .
the archives include memorable performances by top musicians , which were only broadcast once on radio .
three or four recordings from the vaults are projected to see the light each year . br klassik is the latest example of the beauty of creative destruction .
out of the detritus of the old recording companies , dozens of new labels are springing up with thousands of recordings , offering more choice and rarer works than were ever available before - and that nearly a decade after the declaration of the industry ’ s imminent death . author : jens f. laurson editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now a voluptuous us size 12 , her modelling career is taking off .
she has been featured in fashion bible vogue magazine six times and walked the runway for designers such as jeanpaul gaultier .
renn is using her newfound stardom to plead for the world of fashion to recognize a multitude of beauty ideals - including women who are naturally a size two .

but a group of german and scottish poets who have translated it found out just how similar europeans are . from landlocked farms in the franconia region of bavaria to fishing villages on the coast of scotland or the shetland islands , regional dialects throughout consolidated and globalized europe are something of an endangered cultural resource . the task of preserving them goes in part to dialect poets , including two germans and two scots who have been involved in a project to translate regional verse . last year they held a workshop in fife , scotland , where they communicated through oral translators and were provided with literal " gloss " translations in both languages of each other 's poems .
today , they say the experience has had a lasting effect on how they view their poetry . ties to the land the sentiments of dialect poems are often expressed through rustic and geographically-bound language .
while franconian poets often work with imagery and idiomatic expressions based on a life of farming , the scots poets do so with a life of fishing in mind .
in some instances , this makes literal translation impossible and forces the poets to search for comparable literary devices . isabel cole organized the workshop and edits a berlin-based journal of german literature in english translation called " no man 's land . "
she said dialect is less accepted in germany as a form of literary expression than it is in scotland . " i think if people are open-minded about literature , dialects or non-standard literature , it is a real enrichment , " said cole .
" that 's something i actually miss in standard german literature .
one thing i like about germany is how many dialects there are , and how people cultivate their dialects .
they have really different ways of expressing themselves . " bildunterschrift : fishing is an integral part of local scottish culture the personal element fitzgerald kusz , a franconian poet from nuremberg , said that in translating scots poems he was surprised to discover traces of that dialect 's germanic roots .
kusz has spoken franconian since childhood and regards his dialect as an intimate and comfortable form of communication . " on one hand , globalization continues strengthen its hold , " he said , " high german , the unified language , can be heard on television in every village .
but there is , in fact , a movement among the people to keep their languages alive . " and that is one primary goal of dialect literature , he added . one of kusz ' scots counterparts , alexander hutchison , said " a shift into the dialect makes things much more personal … for me it 's just a different instrument . " although hutchison , who lives in glasgow , is not optimistic about current attempts to cultivate dialect in scotland 's schools , he said that in poetry the scots dialect is every bit as viable a form of self-expression as standard english . " if people do n't understand the dialect , they ca n't connect , " he said .
" but if they do understand it , then there 's an immediacy - a personal element - that you can not get in the parent language .
there 's just as much possibility of a lack in the parent language as there is in the dialect .
they operate in different dimensions to me . " the flip-side of globalization franconian poet helmut haberkamm , who grew up in a farming village not far from erlangen , told deutsche welle in an email interview that franconian is " deeply and unmistakably connected to my childhood and the early emotions and experiences which formed me , predetermined parts of my life , and arranged my existence . " franconian is inextricably dissolved in my person .
it is my language of emotion and intimacy , " he added . haberkamm has translated the works of shetlandic poet robert alan jamieson .
although the environments of sheltand and franconia vary greatly , haberkamm said he found striking similarities in the way nature is woven into the lives and languages of both regions . in translating jamieson 's poems , he said he wanted " to bring out the simple , gripping way these people express themselves . " haberkamm described regionalism as the " necessary flip-side of globalization , " adding that " people without an understanding of their roots and concrete values are easily manipulated . " endangered by mobility although hutchison expressed similar sentiments while speaking about his desire to preserve scots and see it flourish , he compared the dialect to a " threatened habitat , " endangered by time and changing patterns of human behavior .
having lived for years in north america , hutchison said he understands the pressures modern existence exerts on local cultures . " people move around , people move off , people do n't stay in one place long enough to develop it , " he said .
" there are new dialects springing up all the time .
if there 's enough settled community , they 'll find a language . " i 'm always wary of standardization , of people trying to impose things .
as a poet , i never want to make rules for other poets . " author : gerhard schneibel editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but a group of german and scottish poets who have translated it found out just how similar europeans are . from landlocked farms in the franconia region of bavaria to fishing villages on the coast of scotland or the shetland islands , regional dialects throughout consolidated and globalized europe are something of an endangered cultural resource . the task of preserving them goes in part to dialect poets , including two germans and two scots who have been involved in a project to translate regional verse . last year they held a workshop in fife , scotland , where they communicated through oral translators and were provided with literal " gloss " translations in both languages of each other 's poems .
today , they say the experience has had a lasting effect on how they view their poetry . ties to the land the sentiments of dialect poems are often expressed through rustic and geographically-bound language .
while franconian poets often work with imagery and idiomatic expressions based on a life of farming , the scots poets do so with a life of fishing in mind .
in some instances , this makes literal translation impossible and forces the poets to search for comparable literary devices . isabel cole organized the workshop and edits a berlin-based journal of german literature in english translation called " no man 's land . "
she said dialect is less accepted in germany as a form of literary expression than it is in scotland . " i think if people are open-minded about literature , dialects or non-standard literature , it is a real enrichment , " said cole .
" that 's something i actually miss in standard german literature .
one thing i like about germany is how many dialects there are , and how people cultivate their dialects .
they have really different ways of expressing themselves . " bildunterschrift : fishing is an integral part of local scottish culture the personal element fitzgerald kusz , a franconian poet from nuremberg , said that in translating scots poems he was surprised to discover traces of that dialect 's germanic roots .
kusz has spoken franconian since childhood and regards his dialect as an intimate and comfortable form of communication . " on one hand , globalization continues strengthen its hold , " he said , " high german , the unified language , can be heard on television in every village .
but there is , in fact , a movement among the people to keep their languages alive . " and that is one primary goal of dialect literature , he added . one of kusz ' scots counterparts , alexander hutchison , said " a shift into the dialect makes things much more personal … for me it 's just a different instrument . " although hutchison , who lives in glasgow , is not optimistic about current attempts to cultivate dialect in scotland 's schools , he said that in poetry the scots dialect is every bit as viable a form of self-expression as standard english . " if people do n't understand the dialect , they ca n't connect , " he said .
" but if they do understand it , then there 's an immediacy - a personal element - that you can not get in the parent language .
there 's just as much possibility of a lack in the parent language as there is in the dialect .
they operate in different dimensions to me . " the flip-side of globalization franconian poet helmut haberkamm , who grew up in a farming village not far from erlangen , told deutsche welle in an email interview that franconian is " deeply and unmistakably connected to my childhood and the early emotions and experiences which formed me , predetermined parts of my life , and arranged my existence . " franconian is inextricably dissolved in my person .
it is my language of emotion and intimacy , " he added . haberkamm has translated the works of shetlandic poet robert alan jamieson .
although the environments of sheltand and franconia vary greatly , haberkamm said he found striking similarities in the way nature is woven into the lives and languages of both regions . in translating jamieson 's poems , he said he wanted " to bring out the simple , gripping way these people express themselves . " haberkamm described regionalism as the " necessary flip-side of globalization , " adding that " people without an understanding of their roots and concrete values are easily manipulated . " endangered by mobility although hutchison expressed similar sentiments while speaking about his desire to preserve scots and see it flourish , he compared the dialect to a " threatened habitat , " endangered by time and changing patterns of human behavior .
having lived for years in north america , hutchison said he understands the pressures modern existence exerts on local cultures . " people move around , people move off , people do n't stay in one place long enough to develop it , " he said .

but a group of german and scottish poets who have translated it found out just how similar europeans are . from landlocked farms in the franconia region of bavaria to fishing villages on the coast of scotland or the shetland islands , regional dialects throughout consolidated and globalized europe are something of an endangered cultural resource . the task of preserving them goes in part to dialect poets , including two germans and two scots who have been involved in a project to translate regional verse . last year they held a workshop in fife , scotland , where they communicated through oral translators and were provided with literal " gloss " translations in both languages of each other 's poems .
today , they say the experience has had a lasting effect on how they view their poetry . ties to the land the sentiments of dialect poems are often expressed through rustic and geographically-bound language .
while franconian poets often work with imagery and idiomatic expressions based on a life of farming , the scots poets do so with a life of fishing in mind .
in some instances , this makes literal translation impossible and forces the poets to search for comparable literary devices . isabel cole organized the workshop and edits a berlin-based journal of german literature in english translation called " no man 's land . "
she said dialect is less accepted in germany as a form of literary expression than it is in scotland . " i think if people are open-minded about literature , dialects or non-standard literature , it is a real enrichment , " said cole .
" that 's something i actually miss in standard german literature .
one thing i like about germany is how many dialects there are , and how people cultivate their dialects .
they have really different ways of expressing themselves . " bildunterschrift : fishing is an integral part of local scottish culture the personal element fitzgerald kusz , a franconian poet from nuremberg , said that in translating scots poems he was surprised to discover traces of that dialect 's germanic roots .
kusz has spoken franconian since childhood and regards his dialect as an intimate and comfortable form of communication . " on one hand , globalization continues strengthen its hold , " he said , " high german , the unified language , can be heard on television in every village .
but there is , in fact , a movement among the people to keep their languages alive . " and that is one primary goal of dialect literature , he added . one of kusz ' scots counterparts , alexander hutchison , said " a shift into the dialect makes things much more personal … for me it 's just a different instrument . " although hutchison , who lives in glasgow , is not optimistic about current attempts to cultivate dialect in scotland 's schools , he said that in poetry the scots dialect is every bit as viable a form of self-expression as standard english . " if people do n't understand the dialect , they ca n't connect , " he said .
" but if they do understand it , then there 's an immediacy - a personal element - that you can not get in the parent language .
there 's just as much possibility of a lack in the parent language as there is in the dialect .
they operate in different dimensions to me . " the flip-side of globalization franconian poet helmut haberkamm , who grew up in a farming village not far from erlangen , told deutsche welle in an email interview that franconian is " deeply and unmistakably connected to my childhood and the early emotions and experiences which formed me , predetermined parts of my life , and arranged my existence . " franconian is inextricably dissolved in my person .
it is my language of emotion and intimacy , " he added . haberkamm has translated the works of shetlandic poet robert alan jamieson .
although the environments of sheltand and franconia vary greatly , haberkamm said he found striking similarities in the way nature is woven into the lives and languages of both regions . in translating jamieson 's poems , he said he wanted " to bring out the simple , gripping way these people express themselves . " haberkamm described regionalism as the " necessary flip-side of globalization , " adding that " people without an understanding of their roots and concrete values are easily manipulated . " endangered by mobility although hutchison expressed similar sentiments while speaking about his desire to preserve scots and see it flourish , he compared the dialect to a " threatened habitat , " endangered by time and changing patterns of human behavior .
having lived for years in north america , hutchison said he understands the pressures modern existence exerts on local cultures . " people move around , people move off , people do n't stay in one place long enough to develop it , " he said .
" there are new dialects springing up all the time .

can it escape the oil curse and become an example to other developing states ? in many ways ghana serves as a model among african countries .
compared to many other west african nations it has been very stable in recent years .
ghana 's peaceful election last year and the successful transition of government from one party to another this year were considered the pinnacle of the country 's progress , which was highlighted by us president barack obama 's visit to accra this summer .
but after the recent announcement by oil giant exxonmobil that it was buying a four billion-dollar stake in ghana 's jubilee oil field , the country is now facing a task that may be even more challenging than the democratic reform process it has undergone : to prove that it can not only successfully deal with a powerful multinational , but also that the windfall that is generated by what is considered to be one of africa 's biggest oil fields does n't end up in the pockets of a few insiders , but improves the wealth and well-being of ghana 's society .
" the stakes are very high , " writes ian gary , an expert in extractive industries , in a report about ghana 's oil find and its consequences for society for the international aid agency oxfam .
" while many ghanaian government officials are confident they can meet the challenge , oil 's threat to democratic development should not be underestimated . "
high stakes , big profits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exxonmobil 's bid beat out other oil giants while the stakes are high , so is the profit .
according to an estimate by the international monetary fund which is cited by gary , ghana 's government can expect revenues from oil and gas up to 20 billion dollars during the production period between 2012 and 2030 for the jubilee field alone .
so what are ghana 's chances to avoid the spell of the so-called oil curse ? " i think that ghana could really be one country which could be a positive example to the world and it could also be profitable and beneficial for the country , " claudia kemfert , an energy specialist at berlin 's economic research institute diw , tells deutsche welle .
" ghana could really profit from this deal and also from the oil market . "
what 's required , adds kemfert , is that ghana 's government puts in place a good political strategy on how it wants to use the oil revenues .
talking to deutsche welle , ulrike bickel , an energy expert with germany 's catholic relief agency misereor , is more skeptical : " we obviously see the danger that ghana could also become a victim of the oil curse , that its oil wealth wo n't benefit the people and that oil revenues just like in neighboring countries , vanish instead of being spent on health , education or sustainable social development . " while bickel points out that ghana , a country without previous experience in the oil sector , has taken positive steps such as signing on to the so-called extractive industries transparency initiative , which mandates its members to openly document the flow of revenues , she adds that it is still far too early to tell whether it will be implemented .
bildunterschrift : president obama 's visit , with ghana president john atta mills highlighted the country 's progress negative example an example that positive declarations and good intentions do n't necessarily translate into enforceable action is chad .
" before the world bank agreed to a large loan for the chad-cameroon pipeline there was an agreement that a fund for future generations would be created and that up to 70 percent of the oil revenues would be used for priority social sector developments , " says bickel .
" but as soon as the oil revenue started to flow , chad 's government , which was fighting a civil war , dissolved the fund for future generations and extended the priority sector developments to include national security .
that means the oil revenue is used to buy large quantities of weapons . " that does n't mean that agreements and declarations are n't useful .
they definitely are .
but reality eventually is the ultimate test whether those agreements are fulfilled .
ghana , say the analysts , among developing african nations , is perhaps best prepared to manage its oil wealth carefully . as oxfam expert gary wrote in his report on ghana : " oil wealth tends to erode democratic accountability .
ghana 's challenge will be to ensure that the right institutions and transparent policies are in place before oil production starts . "

can it escape the oil curse and become an example to other developing states ? in many ways ghana serves as a model among african countries .
compared to many other west african nations it has been very stable in recent years .
ghana 's peaceful election last year and the successful transition of government from one party to another this year were considered the pinnacle of the country 's progress , which was highlighted by us president barack obama 's visit to accra this summer .
but after the recent announcement by oil giant exxonmobil that it was buying a four billion-dollar stake in ghana 's jubilee oil field , the country is now facing a task that may be even more challenging than the democratic reform process it has undergone : to prove that it can not only successfully deal with a powerful multinational , but also that the windfall that is generated by what is considered to be one of africa 's biggest oil fields does n't end up in the pockets of a few insiders , but improves the wealth and well-being of ghana 's society .
" the stakes are very high , " writes ian gary , an expert in extractive industries , in a report about ghana 's oil find and its consequences for society for the international aid agency oxfam .
" while many ghanaian government officials are confident they can meet the challenge , oil 's threat to democratic development should not be underestimated . "
high stakes , big profits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exxonmobil 's bid beat out other oil giants while the stakes are high , so is the profit .
according to an estimate by the international monetary fund which is cited by gary , ghana 's government can expect revenues from oil and gas up to 20 billion dollars during the production period between 2012 and 2030 for the jubilee field alone .
so what are ghana 's chances to avoid the spell of the so-called oil curse ? " i think that ghana could really be one country which could be a positive example to the world and it could also be profitable and beneficial for the country , " claudia kemfert , an energy specialist at berlin 's economic research institute diw , tells deutsche welle .
" ghana could really profit from this deal and also from the oil market . "
what 's required , adds kemfert , is that ghana 's government puts in place a good political strategy on how it wants to use the oil revenues .
talking to deutsche welle , ulrike bickel , an energy expert with germany 's catholic relief agency misereor , is more skeptical : " we obviously see the danger that ghana could also become a victim of the oil curse , that its oil wealth wo n't benefit the people and that oil revenues just like in neighboring countries , vanish instead of being spent on health , education or sustainable social development . " while bickel points out that ghana , a country without previous experience in the oil sector , has taken positive steps such as signing on to the so-called extractive industries transparency initiative , which mandates its members to openly document the flow of revenues , she adds that it is still far too early to tell whether it will be implemented .
bildunterschrift : president obama 's visit , with ghana president john atta mills highlighted the country 's progress negative example an example that positive declarations and good intentions do n't necessarily translate into enforceable action is chad .
" before the world bank agreed to a large loan for the chad-cameroon pipeline there was an agreement that a fund for future generations would be created and that up to 70 percent of the oil revenues would be used for priority social sector developments , " says bickel .
" but as soon as the oil revenue started to flow , chad 's government , which was fighting a civil war , dissolved the fund for future generations and extended the priority sector developments to include national security .
that means the oil revenue is used to buy large quantities of weapons . " that does n't mean that agreements and declarations are n't useful .
they definitely are .
but reality eventually is the ultimate test whether those agreements are fulfilled .
ghana , say the analysts , among developing african nations , is perhaps best prepared to manage its oil wealth carefully . as oxfam expert gary wrote in his report on ghana : " oil wealth tends to erode democratic accountability .
ghana 's challenge will be to ensure that the right institutions and transparent policies are in place before oil production starts . "

" while many ghanaian government officials are confident they can meet the challenge , oil 's threat to democratic development should not be underestimated . "
high stakes , big profits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exxonmobil 's bid beat out other oil giants while the stakes are high , so is the profit .
according to an estimate by the international monetary fund which is cited by gary , ghana 's government can expect revenues from oil and gas up to 20 billion dollars during the production period between 2012 and 2030 for the jubilee field alone .
so what are ghana 's chances to avoid the spell of the so-called oil curse ? " i think that ghana could really be one country which could be a positive example to the world and it could also be profitable and beneficial for the country , " claudia kemfert , an energy specialist at berlin 's economic research institute diw , tells deutsche welle .
" ghana could really profit from this deal and also from the oil market . "
what 's required , adds kemfert , is that ghana 's government puts in place a good political strategy on how it wants to use the oil revenues .
talking to deutsche welle , ulrike bickel , an energy expert with germany 's catholic relief agency misereor , is more skeptical : " we obviously see the danger that ghana could also become a victim of the oil curse , that its oil wealth wo n't benefit the people and that oil revenues just like in neighboring countries , vanish instead of being spent on health , education or sustainable social development . " while bickel points out that ghana , a country without previous experience in the oil sector , has taken positive steps such as signing on to the so-called extractive industries transparency initiative , which mandates its members to openly document the flow of revenues , she adds that it is still far too early to tell whether it will be implemented .
bildunterschrift : president obama 's visit , with ghana president john atta mills highlighted the country 's progress negative example an example that positive declarations and good intentions do n't necessarily translate into enforceable action is chad .
" before the world bank agreed to a large loan for the chad-cameroon pipeline there was an agreement that a fund for future generations would be created and that up to 70 percent of the oil revenues would be used for priority social sector developments , " says bickel .
" but as soon as the oil revenue started to flow , chad 's government , which was fighting a civil war , dissolved the fund for future generations and extended the priority sector developments to include national security .
that means the oil revenue is used to buy large quantities of weapons . " that does n't mean that agreements and declarations are n't useful .
they definitely are .
but reality eventually is the ultimate test whether those agreements are fulfilled .
ghana , say the analysts , among developing african nations , is perhaps best prepared to manage its oil wealth carefully . as oxfam expert gary wrote in his report on ghana : " oil wealth tends to erode democratic accountability .
ghana 's challenge will be to ensure that the right institutions and transparent policies are in place before oil production starts . "

the deal also received heavy criticism from azerbaijan over unsolved armenian-azeri territorial disputes . even though the ink has dried on the protocols signed by the foreign ministers of turkey and armenia , there is no guarantee that the parties will or can make the agreements a reality .
indeed , turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan was first out of the gate with a cautionary note .
" we want all the borders to be opened at the same time ... , but as long as armenia has not withdrawn from azerbaijani territory that it is occupying , turkey can not have a positive attitude on this subject , " said erdogan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nagorno-karabakh dispute puts the deal at risk in the late 1980 's , as the soviet union was dissolving , violence broke out in the ethnic armenian enclave of nagorno-karabakh within azerbaijan 's internationally recognized borders .

" the normalization of relations between turkey and armenia before the withdrawal of armenian troops from occupied azeri territory is in direct contradiction to the national interests of azerbaijan , " said the statement .
by all accounts , the signing was an historic event .
nearly a year in the making , discretely abetted by the swiss .
however , the signing ceremony for the protocols that pledge to establish diplomatic relations , open borders and to set up an historic commission to investigate armenian deaths in world war i , almost fell through when the parties disagreed over some of the wording in the statements to be delivered at the end of the signing ceremony .
protests around the world the agreement between the two countries has sparked widespread controversy .

the deal also received heavy criticism from azerbaijan over unsolved armenian-azeri territorial disputes . even though the ink has dried on the protocols signed by the foreign ministers of turkey and armenia , there is no guarantee that the parties will or can make the agreements a reality .
indeed , turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan was first out of the gate with a cautionary note .

the weapons were sent in 2006 and were intended for local police and army personnel . arms dealers in the region told german public radio that hundreds of german weapons were for sale carrying a price tag of over 680 euros a piece -lrb- $ 1,000 -rrb- .
in 2006 , the german defense ministry shipped 10,000 old walther-p1 pistols to the afghan interior ministry to equip afghan police and army .
however , both the german government and the responsible us-led security team in afghanistan reportedly failed to properly monitor the guns ' whereabouts .
the us unit said that it only had detailed records of 4,563 pistols out of a total 10,000 . current and former afghan soldiers and police officers are said to be among those illegally selling and trafficking the pistols , some of which have ended up in pakistan 's north-west border provinces and neighboring tribal areas .
the german guns were also being traded in northern afghanistan where german soldiers are stationed .
the team of ndr radio reporters who discovered the black market guns said it 's not clear exactly how they ended up there .
" apparently , most of these pistols have n't been stolen , but were simply taken home and sold by former police officers and soldiers after they 'd left the service , " said christoph heinzle , who headed the ndr team .
" but corruption and theft can not be ruled out because neither the afghan authorities nor the us and german armed forces carry out effective controls to prevent -lsb- theft -rsb- . "
greens , police union call for investigation the 2006 delivery was carried out despite a german government principle that german weapons could not be supplied to non-nato countries .
germany 's then coalition government of social democrats and greens made an exception , but the decision reportedly only reached parliament after the weapons had already arrived in afghanistan .
the fresh allegations have prompted calls for an investigation by germany 's green party and the police trade union .
green party spokesman winfried nachtwei accused the grand coalition government , which was in power when the guns were shipped , of a " grossly negligent course of action , " and called for the matter to be investigated in the interest of german security forces and civilian experts sent to afghanistan .
" it would be truly absurd if soldiers were threatened by weapons irresponsibly delivered by germany , " nachtwei said .
joerg radek of the police union said the danger was that " such weapons could fall into the wrong hands .
it is a risk for the germans deployed there , a risk to security in the country . "
defense ministry spokesman thomas raabe told reporters in berlin on monday that officials in kabul had guaranteed the weapons would only be distributed among security forces .
he said the ministry would be investigating any unlawful sales of the guns .
" of course we 'll be looking for evidence of any wrongdoing , but i want to underscore that the afghan government is independent in its decision-making and that we 'll continue to support its efforts to build up effective security forces .

the weapons were sent in 2006 and were intended for local police and army personnel . arms dealers in the region told german public radio that hundreds of german weapons were for sale carrying a price tag of over 680 euros a piece -lrb- $ 1,000 -rrb- .
in 2006 , the german defense ministry shipped 10,000 old walther-p1 pistols to the afghan interior ministry to equip afghan police and army .
however , both the german government and the responsible us-led security team in afghanistan reportedly failed to properly monitor the guns ' whereabouts .
the us unit said that it only had detailed records of 4,563 pistols out of a total 10,000 . current and former afghan soldiers and police officers are said to be among those illegally selling and trafficking the pistols , some of which have ended up in pakistan 's north-west border provinces and neighboring tribal areas .
the german guns were also being traded in northern afghanistan where german soldiers are stationed .
the team of ndr radio reporters who discovered the black market guns said it 's not clear exactly how they ended up there .
" apparently , most of these pistols have n't been stolen , but were simply taken home and sold by former police officers and soldiers after they 'd left the service , " said christoph heinzle , who headed the ndr team .
" but corruption and theft can not be ruled out because neither the afghan authorities nor the us and german armed forces carry out effective controls to prevent -lsb- theft -rsb- . "
greens , police union call for investigation the 2006 delivery was carried out despite a german government principle that german weapons could not be supplied to non-nato countries .
germany 's then coalition government of social democrats and greens made an exception , but the decision reportedly only reached parliament after the weapons had already arrived in afghanistan .
the fresh allegations have prompted calls for an investigation by germany 's green party and the police trade union .
green party spokesman winfried nachtwei accused the grand coalition government , which was in power when the guns were shipped , of a " grossly negligent course of action , " and called for the matter to be investigated in the interest of german security forces and civilian experts sent to afghanistan .
" it would be truly absurd if soldiers were threatened by weapons irresponsibly delivered by germany , " nachtwei said .
joerg radek of the police union said the danger was that " such weapons could fall into the wrong hands .
it is a risk for the germans deployed there , a risk to security in the country . "
defense ministry spokesman thomas raabe told reporters in berlin on monday that officials in kabul had guaranteed the weapons would only be distributed among security forces .
he said the ministry would be investigating any unlawful sales of the guns .
" of course we 'll be looking for evidence of any wrongdoing , but i want to underscore that the afghan government is independent in its decision-making and that we 'll continue to support its efforts to build up effective security forces .

the weapons were sent in 2006 and were intended for local police and army personnel . arms dealers in the region told german public radio that hundreds of german weapons were for sale carrying a price tag of over 680 euros a piece -lrb- $ 1,000 -rrb- .
in 2006 , the german defense ministry shipped 10,000 old walther-p1 pistols to the afghan interior ministry to equip afghan police and army .
however , both the german government and the responsible us-led security team in afghanistan reportedly failed to properly monitor the guns ' whereabouts .
the us unit said that it only had detailed records of 4,563 pistols out of a total 10,000 . current and former afghan soldiers and police officers are said to be among those illegally selling and trafficking the pistols , some of which have ended up in pakistan 's north-west border provinces and neighboring tribal areas .
the german guns were also being traded in northern afghanistan where german soldiers are stationed .
the team of ndr radio reporters who discovered the black market guns said it 's not clear exactly how they ended up there .
" apparently , most of these pistols have n't been stolen , but were simply taken home and sold by former police officers and soldiers after they 'd left the service , " said christoph heinzle , who headed the ndr team .
" but corruption and theft can not be ruled out because neither the afghan authorities nor the us and german armed forces carry out effective controls to prevent -lsb- theft -rsb- . "
greens , police union call for investigation the 2006 delivery was carried out despite a german government principle that german weapons could not be supplied to non-nato countries .
germany 's then coalition government of social democrats and greens made an exception , but the decision reportedly only reached parliament after the weapons had already arrived in afghanistan .
the fresh allegations have prompted calls for an investigation by germany 's green party and the police trade union .
green party spokesman winfried nachtwei accused the grand coalition government , which was in power when the guns were shipped , of a " grossly negligent course of action , " and called for the matter to be investigated in the interest of german security forces and civilian experts sent to afghanistan .
" it would be truly absurd if soldiers were threatened by weapons irresponsibly delivered by germany , " nachtwei said .
joerg radek of the police union said the danger was that " such weapons could fall into the wrong hands .
it is a risk for the germans deployed there , a risk to security in the country . "
defense ministry spokesman thomas raabe told reporters in berlin on monday that officials in kabul had guaranteed the weapons would only be distributed among security forces .
he said the ministry would be investigating any unlawful sales of the guns .
" of course we 'll be looking for evidence of any wrongdoing , but i want to underscore that the afghan government is independent in its decision-making and that we 'll continue to support its efforts to build up effective security forces .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 12.10.2009 germans criticize czech demand for lisbon treaty opt-out großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vaclav klaus wants a guarantee that czech property remains such with poland 's signature on the lisbon treaty in the bag , there is just one left to collect .
but that is easier said than done , as the president of the czech republic appears at pains to demonstrate . euroskeptic czech president vaclav klaus chose his moment well .
just hours before poland became a signatory to the much-talked about european treaty , he managed to keep the union 's eyes on him by saying he would not add his name to the pact until he was satisfied it will not destabilize national property rights .
klaus is concerned that the european charter of fundamental rights , part of the lisbon treaty , could allow the three million germans expelled from czechoslovakia at the end of the second world war to reclaim property confiscated from them at the time .
the issue came up after the fall of communism , but the czech courts have thrown out claims brought forth by expellees , and klaus is clearly prepared to go to great lengths to prevent an upsetting of that particular apple cart .
but in so doing , he is attracting much negative attention , and winning no eu popularity contests .
although relations between germany and the czech republic - which border one another - are essentially quite good , klaus 's latest demands have met with criticism in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech president vaclav klaus says he wo n't take no for an answer christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- member and parliamentary secretary for defense , christian schmidt , told the dpa news agency that it was unnecessary to play the german expellees card and that there is already a european convention of human rights .
" everything that concerns the lisbon treaty has been negotiated , " schmidt said .
" to come now , shortly before the end game with new demands , leads to the impression that he only wants to delay . "
if they can , so can we but klaus insists it is his right to demand a binding guarantee that prevents expellees from using eu laws to circumnavigate the czech judicial system .
he cited britain and poland , both of which negotiated an opt-out before the pact was signed at the end of 2007 - britain over fears that collective bargaining rights could lead to increased strike action , and poland in order to protect the values of a deeply catholic society - saying he wanted something similar for his country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president lech kaczynski signed the treaty at the weekend " i am convinced that the czech republic must at least post facto negotiate a similar exemption , " klaus told reporters , adding that he thought a " non-standard " procedure could get the job done quickly .
in order to try and convince the rest of the eu to accommodate his wishes , the czech president would first have to submit a proposal .
the alternative procedure the easier way forward could be to have eu leaders approve a declaration which is not intrinsically a part of the treaty , such as they did when ireland asked for a guarantee that the lisbon treaty would not interfere with laws on taxes and abortion .
but ladislav jakl , an aide to klaus , poured water on that idea on czech television on sunday .
he said the president would " not be satisfied by any declaration but only guarantees for every citizen , " adding that the condition was " fundamental , necessary , unbreachable . "
it is certainly problematic for the eu that klaus has waited until this late stage in the ratification process to ask to see it tweaked in his favor .
what happens next will depend to some degree on the czech parliament which is scheduled to meet on monday to discuss the latest spanner the president has thrown into the ratification process works. tkw / afp / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but that is easier said than done , as the president of the czech republic appears at pains to demonstrate . euroskeptic czech president vaclav klaus chose his moment well .
just hours before poland became a signatory to the much-talked about european treaty , he managed to keep the union 's eyes on him by saying he would not add his name to the pact until he was satisfied it will not destabilize national property rights .
klaus is concerned that the european charter of fundamental rights , part of the lisbon treaty , could allow the three million germans expelled from czechoslovakia at the end of the second world war to reclaim property confiscated from them at the time .
the issue came up after the fall of communism , but the czech courts have thrown out claims brought forth by expellees , and klaus is clearly prepared to go to great lengths to prevent an upsetting of that particular apple cart .
but in so doing , he is attracting much negative attention , and winning no eu popularity contests .
although relations between germany and the czech republic - which border one another - are essentially quite good , klaus 's latest demands have met with criticism in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech president vaclav klaus says he wo n't take no for an answer christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- member and parliamentary secretary for defense , christian schmidt , told the dpa news agency that it was unnecessary to play the german expellees card and that there is already a european convention of human rights .
" everything that concerns the lisbon treaty has been negotiated , " schmidt said .
" to come now , shortly before the end game with new demands , leads to the impression that he only wants to delay . "
if they can , so can we but klaus insists it is his right to demand a binding guarantee that prevents expellees from using eu laws to circumnavigate the czech judicial system .
he cited britain and poland , both of which negotiated an opt-out before the pact was signed at the end of 2007 - britain over fears that collective bargaining rights could lead to increased strike action , and poland in order to protect the values of a deeply catholic society - saying he wanted something similar for his country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president lech kaczynski signed the treaty at the weekend " i am convinced that the czech republic must at least post facto negotiate a similar exemption , " klaus told reporters , adding that he thought a " non-standard " procedure could get the job done quickly .
in order to try and convince the rest of the eu to accommodate his wishes , the czech president would first have to submit a proposal .
the alternative procedure the easier way forward could be to have eu leaders approve a declaration which is not intrinsically a part of the treaty , such as they did when ireland asked for a guarantee that the lisbon treaty would not interfere with laws on taxes and abortion .
but ladislav jakl , an aide to klaus , poured water on that idea on czech television on sunday .
he said the president would " not be satisfied by any declaration but only guarantees for every citizen , " adding that the condition was " fundamental , necessary , unbreachable . "
it is certainly problematic for the eu that klaus has waited until this late stage in the ratification process to ask to see it tweaked in his favor .
what happens next will depend to some degree on the czech parliament which is scheduled to meet on monday to discuss the latest spanner the president has thrown into the ratification process works. tkw / afp / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the step of devolution for policing and justice is an absolutely essential milestone , " the us secretary of state told reporters .
" clearly there are questions and some apprehensions , but i believe that due to the concerted efforts of the british government , irish government and support of friends like us in the us , that the parties understand that this is a step they must take together . "
northern ireland 's main parties have been at loggerheads over the details of its devolution process from the united kingdom , resulting in a row which has brought its administration to a standstill with no clear resolution in sight . clinton says progress " within reach " clinton 's presence in northern ireland has narrowed the gap between northern ireland 's main parties , a step regarded as crucial to resolving the stand-off and pushing on with the devolution process .
" it will take the leaders of both communities working together to continue not only the devolution but then to make day-to-day governing a reality , and i 'm confident that that is within reach . "
the new power-sharing government of northern ireland , a landmark accord between the protestant conservative , pro-british dup and catholic socialist republicans sinn fein , agreed in principle on the transfer of responsibility from the united kingdom to northern ireland , however , differences over the details of the devolution process led to discord between the parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in march 2009 , two british soldiers died in an attack on military barracks near antrim sinn fein and the dup have been in conflict over when powers for policing should be devolved from london , the former insisting it should have happened already and the latter choosing caution and saying it will only assent to devolution with an adequate financial package in place and broad community confidence . inla lays down arms for peace the peace process , started in 1998 by the good friday agreement , ended three decades of conflict in northern ireland , in which roughly 3,500 people were killed .
its full implementation , rather than squabbling over its fine points , is vital to peaceful governance in northern ireland as stressed by clinton .
clinton 's visit comes as the irish national liberation army -lrb- inla -rrb- , a republican paramilitary group infamous for its violent crimes during northern ireland 's troubles , has signaled it 's prepared to lay down arms .
it has renounced its armed struggle , releasing a statement saying , " following a process of serious debate ... it has concluded that the armed struggle is over .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 12.10.2009 germany needs to improve to become a world cup favorite großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany got the result they needed when it counted germany got the job done in a relative easy group and qualified for the world cup .
but how does the team measure up to the world 's top national teams ?
deutsche welle 's jefferson chase takes a closer look . the one moment that best symbolizes the 1-0 win over moscow that qualified germany for the 2010 world cup in south africa was directly after the lone goal was scored .
striker miroslav klose celebrated with one of his trademark forward flips - and only narrowly avoided landing on his backside .
match reports in german newspapers , perhaps understandably , were full of superlatives about germany 's gutsy away win .
but that 1-0 victory was of the knife-edge variety , unlike germany 's 1-0 loss to spain in the 2008 european championships , the last time coach joachim loew had a chance to win a title .
so have germany improved enough to draw level with the spaniards or brazil ?
or are they more on a par with other large european nations like england , the netherlands and italy .
here 's a back-to-front run-through of the strengths and weaknesses of the german squad .
defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adler could become the next in a long line of stellar german national keepers the one position about which loew has absolutely no worries is goal .
24-year-old rene adler was the key to germany 's victory , making a number of world-class saves , and seems to have sealed his position as germany 's number one .
the young keeper 's most brilliant moment in moscow came in the 73rd minute , when russian midfielder igor semshov was clear on the right side and slotted a crisp pass in the direction of two teammates waiting in front of goal .
adler not only got a hand to the ball but cleverly deflected it over the end line .
and should adler get hurt , loew can call on robert enke , manuel neuer or even tim wiese who 've all proved their worth at the international level .
left back philipp lahm is arguably the best in the world at his position so his selection is a no-brainer .
interior defenders per mertesacker and heiko westermann provide a solid anchor in the back four .
youngster serdar tasci could also play a role .
the big question is right back .
jerome boateng , who made his national-team debut in russia , showed he was capable of provided some welcome offensive pressure .
but the 21-year-old also got himself sent off with a red card .
loew 's task will be to get the youngster enough experience in friendlies between now and next june that he no longer poses a risk .
otherwise , he 'll be forced to fall back on arne friedrich , who 's been mediocre at best when wearing the german kit .
defensive midfield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack is a force in midfield but germany could use a threat like russia 's andrei arshavin though not the force he once was german captain michael ballack is the lynchpin of the german squad .
the 33-year-old not only wins lots of challenges but is responsible for the opening passes for germany 's offense .
to cover ballack 's back when he presses forward , simon rolfes is a good choice .
and thomas hitzlsperger is also a more offensive option because of his ability to blast in shots from long-range .
if ballack were to go down to injury , though , germany would be in trouble .
ballack is to germany what gennaro gattuso has been to italy , and loew needs to plan , as best he can , for the eventuality that his captain is unavailable .
the problem is that no one currently on the squad or on the radar screen has the ability to fill the stopper-meets-playmaker role ballack occupies .
offensive midfield and wingers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is counting on youngsters like jerome boateng , marko marin and mesut oezil the emergence of mesut oezil represents the biggest improvement of germany 's likely 2010 squad over the 2008 edition .
the 20-year-old displayed both his pace and his eye for his teammates in setting up the lone goal in moscow that punched germany 's world cup ticket .
but after that , the quality tails off .
bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski are active but relatively inefficient players who 've never lived up their potential .
it will be interesting to see whether youngster marko marin , oezil 's equally fleet-footed teammate at werder bremen , can break into the germany 's starting eleven .
but even if he does , a comparison with the world 's top teams suggests that germany 's offensive midfield is a relative weakness .
spain are spoiled for choice with xabi alonso , xavi , fabregas , iniesta and senna .
brazil , too , can chose from nearly a dozen top-quality midfielders , including kaka , whose skills and creativity are far superior to any member of the german squad .
thus , as the squad stands , germany may find it difficult to come back if they go behind early in matches - something that most teams need to do if they want to take a major international title .
bildunterschrift : klose showed his age in executing his celebratory front flip - he landed on his backside , not his feet the center forward this position is one of the biggest question marks in the team .
if the russia match is anything to go by , loew could likely rely on a 4-3-3 formation for much of the tournament in south africa .
that essentially means the battle to fill the lone central forward slot is between miroslav klose and mario gomez , the same pair of players contesting the same position at their mutual club bayern munich .
for now klose , who will be 32 years old next summer , gets the nod because he , in contrast to gomez , has been effective for the national squad in the past .
but he 's clearly lost a bit of athleticism , so in his heart of hearts , loew might well prefer the 24-year-old gomez .
loew choice will probably be influenced by how much playing time the two strikers get at bayern munich .
however that situation turns out , though , what loew does n't have is a center forward who can create goal opportunities for himself a la wayne rooney for england or thierry henry for france .
that means that germany could have trouble against other defensively oriented teams like italy .
as one of the best teams at the back in the world , germany could certainly fly high in south africa , and no nation will relish facing them .
but their creative deficiencies at the front also mean that loew 's men , if they face tough opponents early on , could end up smack on their backsides .

but how does the team measure up to the world 's top national teams ?
deutsche welle 's jefferson chase takes a closer look . the one moment that best symbolizes the 1-0 win over moscow that qualified germany for the 2010 world cup in south africa was directly after the lone goal was scored .
striker miroslav klose celebrated with one of his trademark forward flips - and only narrowly avoided landing on his backside .
match reports in german newspapers , perhaps understandably , were full of superlatives about germany 's gutsy away win .
but that 1-0 victory was of the knife-edge variety , unlike germany 's 1-0 loss to spain in the 2008 european championships , the last time coach joachim loew had a chance to win a title .
so have germany improved enough to draw level with the spaniards or brazil ?
or are they more on a par with other large european nations like england , the netherlands and italy .
here 's a back-to-front run-through of the strengths and weaknesses of the german squad .
defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adler could become the next in a long line of stellar german national keepers the one position about which loew has absolutely no worries is goal .
24-year-old rene adler was the key to germany 's victory , making a number of world-class saves , and seems to have sealed his position as germany 's number one .
the young keeper 's most brilliant moment in moscow came in the 73rd minute , when russian midfielder igor semshov was clear on the right side and slotted a crisp pass in the direction of two teammates waiting in front of goal .
adler not only got a hand to the ball but cleverly deflected it over the end line .
and should adler get hurt , loew can call on robert enke , manuel neuer or even tim wiese who 've all proved their worth at the international level .
left back philipp lahm is arguably the best in the world at his position so his selection is a no-brainer .
interior defenders per mertesacker and heiko westermann provide a solid anchor in the back four .
youngster serdar tasci could also play a role .
the big question is right back .
jerome boateng , who made his national-team debut in russia , showed he was capable of provided some welcome offensive pressure .
but the 21-year-old also got himself sent off with a red card .
loew 's task will be to get the youngster enough experience in friendlies between now and next june that he no longer poses a risk .
otherwise , he 'll be forced to fall back on arne friedrich , who 's been mediocre at best when wearing the german kit .
defensive midfield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack is a force in midfield but germany could use a threat like russia 's andrei arshavin though not the force he once was german captain michael ballack is the lynchpin of the german squad .
the 33-year-old not only wins lots of challenges but is responsible for the opening passes for germany 's offense .
to cover ballack 's back when he presses forward , simon rolfes is a good choice .
and thomas hitzlsperger is also a more offensive option because of his ability to blast in shots from long-range .
if ballack were to go down to injury , though , germany would be in trouble .
ballack is to germany what gennaro gattuso has been to italy , and loew needs to plan , as best he can , for the eventuality that his captain is unavailable .
the problem is that no one currently on the squad or on the radar screen has the ability to fill the stopper-meets-playmaker role ballack occupies .
offensive midfield and wingers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is counting on youngsters like jerome boateng , marko marin and mesut oezil the emergence of mesut oezil represents the biggest improvement of germany 's likely 2010 squad over the 2008 edition .
the 20-year-old displayed both his pace and his eye for his teammates in setting up the lone goal in moscow that punched germany 's world cup ticket .
but after that , the quality tails off .
bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski are active but relatively inefficient players who 've never lived up their potential .
it will be interesting to see whether youngster marko marin , oezil 's equally fleet-footed teammate at werder bremen , can break into the germany 's starting eleven .
but even if he does , a comparison with the world 's top teams suggests that germany 's offensive midfield is a relative weakness .
spain are spoiled for choice with xabi alonso , xavi , fabregas , iniesta and senna .
brazil , too , can chose from nearly a dozen top-quality midfielders , including kaka , whose skills and creativity are far superior to any member of the german squad .
thus , as the squad stands , germany may find it difficult to come back if they go behind early in matches - something that most teams need to do if they want to take a major international title .
bildunterschrift : klose showed his age in executing his celebratory front flip - he landed on his backside , not his feet the center forward this position is one of the biggest question marks in the team .
if the russia match is anything to go by , loew could likely rely on a 4-3-3 formation for much of the tournament in south africa .
that essentially means the battle to fill the lone central forward slot is between miroslav klose and mario gomez , the same pair of players contesting the same position at their mutual club bayern munich .
for now klose , who will be 32 years old next summer , gets the nod because he , in contrast to gomez , has been effective for the national squad in the past .
but he 's clearly lost a bit of athleticism , so in his heart of hearts , loew might well prefer the 24-year-old gomez .

but how does the team measure up to the world 's top national teams ?
deutsche welle 's jefferson chase takes a closer look . the one moment that best symbolizes the 1-0 win over moscow that qualified germany for the 2010 world cup in south africa was directly after the lone goal was scored .
striker miroslav klose celebrated with one of his trademark forward flips - and only narrowly avoided landing on his backside .
match reports in german newspapers , perhaps understandably , were full of superlatives about germany 's gutsy away win .
but that 1-0 victory was of the knife-edge variety , unlike germany 's 1-0 loss to spain in the 2008 european championships , the last time coach joachim loew had a chance to win a title .
so have germany improved enough to draw level with the spaniards or brazil ?
or are they more on a par with other large european nations like england , the netherlands and italy .
here 's a back-to-front run-through of the strengths and weaknesses of the german squad .
defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adler could become the next in a long line of stellar german national keepers the one position about which loew has absolutely no worries is goal .
24-year-old rene adler was the key to germany 's victory , making a number of world-class saves , and seems to have sealed his position as germany 's number one .
the young keeper 's most brilliant moment in moscow came in the 73rd minute , when russian midfielder igor semshov was clear on the right side and slotted a crisp pass in the direction of two teammates waiting in front of goal .
adler not only got a hand to the ball but cleverly deflected it over the end line .
and should adler get hurt , loew can call on robert enke , manuel neuer or even tim wiese who 've all proved their worth at the international level .
left back philipp lahm is arguably the best in the world at his position so his selection is a no-brainer .
interior defenders per mertesacker and heiko westermann provide a solid anchor in the back four .
youngster serdar tasci could also play a role .
the big question is right back .
jerome boateng , who made his national-team debut in russia , showed he was capable of provided some welcome offensive pressure .
but the 21-year-old also got himself sent off with a red card .
loew 's task will be to get the youngster enough experience in friendlies between now and next june that he no longer poses a risk .
otherwise , he 'll be forced to fall back on arne friedrich , who 's been mediocre at best when wearing the german kit .
defensive midfield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack is a force in midfield but germany could use a threat like russia 's andrei arshavin though not the force he once was german captain michael ballack is the lynchpin of the german squad .
the 33-year-old not only wins lots of challenges but is responsible for the opening passes for germany 's offense .
to cover ballack 's back when he presses forward , simon rolfes is a good choice .
and thomas hitzlsperger is also a more offensive option because of his ability to blast in shots from long-range .
if ballack were to go down to injury , though , germany would be in trouble .
ballack is to germany what gennaro gattuso has been to italy , and loew needs to plan , as best he can , for the eventuality that his captain is unavailable .
the problem is that no one currently on the squad or on the radar screen has the ability to fill the stopper-meets-playmaker role ballack occupies .
offensive midfield and wingers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is counting on youngsters like jerome boateng , marko marin and mesut oezil the emergence of mesut oezil represents the biggest improvement of germany 's likely 2010 squad over the 2008 edition .
the 20-year-old displayed both his pace and his eye for his teammates in setting up the lone goal in moscow that punched germany 's world cup ticket .
but after that , the quality tails off .
bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski are active but relatively inefficient players who 've never lived up their potential .
it will be interesting to see whether youngster marko marin , oezil 's equally fleet-footed teammate at werder bremen , can break into the germany 's starting eleven .
but even if he does , a comparison with the world 's top teams suggests that germany 's offensive midfield is a relative weakness .
spain are spoiled for choice with xabi alonso , xavi , fabregas , iniesta and senna .
brazil , too , can chose from nearly a dozen top-quality midfielders , including kaka , whose skills and creativity are far superior to any member of the german squad .
thus , as the squad stands , germany may find it difficult to come back if they go behind early in matches - something that most teams need to do if they want to take a major international title .
bildunterschrift : klose showed his age in executing his celebratory front flip - he landed on his backside , not his feet the center forward this position is one of the biggest question marks in the team .
if the russia match is anything to go by , loew could likely rely on a 4-3-3 formation for much of the tournament in south africa .
that essentially means the battle to fill the lone central forward slot is between miroslav klose and mario gomez , the same pair of players contesting the same position at their mutual club bayern munich .
for now klose , who will be 32 years old next summer , gets the nod because he , in contrast to gomez , has been effective for the national squad in the past .
but he 's clearly lost a bit of athleticism , so in his heart of hearts , loew might well prefer the 24-year-old gomez .
loew choice will probably be influenced by how much playing time the two strikers get at bayern munich .
however that situation turns out , though , what loew does n't have is a center forward who can create goal opportunities for himself a la wayne rooney for england or thierry henry for france .
that means that germany could have trouble against other defensively oriented teams like italy .
as one of the best teams at the back in the world , germany could certainly fly high in south africa , and no nation will relish facing them .
but their creative deficiencies at the front also mean that loew 's men , if they face tough opponents early on , could end up smack on their backsides .

the young keeper 's most brilliant moment in moscow came in the 73rd minute , when russian midfielder igor semshov was clear on the right side and slotted a crisp pass in the direction of two teammates waiting in front of goal .
adler not only got a hand to the ball but cleverly deflected it over the end line .
and should adler get hurt , loew can call on robert enke , manuel neuer or even tim wiese who 've all proved their worth at the international level .
left back philipp lahm is arguably the best in the world at his position so his selection is a no-brainer .
interior defenders per mertesacker and heiko westermann provide a solid anchor in the back four .
youngster serdar tasci could also play a role .
the big question is right back .
jerome boateng , who made his national-team debut in russia , showed he was capable of provided some welcome offensive pressure .
but the 21-year-old also got himself sent off with a red card .
loew 's task will be to get the youngster enough experience in friendlies between now and next june that he no longer poses a risk .
otherwise , he 'll be forced to fall back on arne friedrich , who 's been mediocre at best when wearing the german kit .
defensive midfield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack is a force in midfield but germany could use a threat like russia 's andrei arshavin though not the force he once was german captain michael ballack is the lynchpin of the german squad .
the 33-year-old not only wins lots of challenges but is responsible for the opening passes for germany 's offense .
to cover ballack 's back when he presses forward , simon rolfes is a good choice .
and thomas hitzlsperger is also a more offensive option because of his ability to blast in shots from long-range .
if ballack were to go down to injury , though , germany would be in trouble .
ballack is to germany what gennaro gattuso has been to italy , and loew needs to plan , as best he can , for the eventuality that his captain is unavailable .
the problem is that no one currently on the squad or on the radar screen has the ability to fill the stopper-meets-playmaker role ballack occupies .
offensive midfield and wingers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is counting on youngsters like jerome boateng , marko marin and mesut oezil the emergence of mesut oezil represents the biggest improvement of germany 's likely 2010 squad over the 2008 edition .
the 20-year-old displayed both his pace and his eye for his teammates in setting up the lone goal in moscow that punched germany 's world cup ticket .
but after that , the quality tails off .
bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski are active but relatively inefficient players who 've never lived up their potential .
it will be interesting to see whether youngster marko marin , oezil 's equally fleet-footed teammate at werder bremen , can break into the germany 's starting eleven .
but even if he does , a comparison with the world 's top teams suggests that germany 's offensive midfield is a relative weakness .
spain are spoiled for choice with xabi alonso , xavi , fabregas , iniesta and senna .
brazil , too , can chose from nearly a dozen top-quality midfielders , including kaka , whose skills and creativity are far superior to any member of the german squad .
thus , as the squad stands , germany may find it difficult to come back if they go behind early in matches - something that most teams need to do if they want to take a major international title .
bildunterschrift : klose showed his age in executing his celebratory front flip - he landed on his backside , not his feet the center forward this position is one of the biggest question marks in the team .
if the russia match is anything to go by , loew could likely rely on a 4-3-3 formation for much of the tournament in south africa .
that essentially means the battle to fill the lone central forward slot is between miroslav klose and mario gomez , the same pair of players contesting the same position at their mutual club bayern munich .
for now klose , who will be 32 years old next summer , gets the nod because he , in contrast to gomez , has been effective for the national squad in the past .
but he 's clearly lost a bit of athleticism , so in his heart of hearts , loew might well prefer the 24-year-old gomez .
loew choice will probably be influenced by how much playing time the two strikers get at bayern munich .
however that situation turns out , though , what loew does n't have is a center forward who can create goal opportunities for himself a la wayne rooney for england or thierry henry for france .
that means that germany could have trouble against other defensively oriented teams like italy .
as one of the best teams at the back in the world , germany could certainly fly high in south africa , and no nation will relish facing them .
but their creative deficiencies at the front also mean that loew 's men , if they face tough opponents early on , could end up smack on their backsides .

dw-world.de the young man with a deadly left foot at first , some said he was too small to be taken seriously as a professional soccer player .
now , mesut oezil has proven himself as one of the big boys on germany 's national team .

leonid ivlev , a member of the central elections commission , told reporters that the ruling party had garnered almost 80 percent of seats up for grabs in the 75 regional and local elections held up and down the country on sunday .
ivlev said putin 's party picked up 107 of the 135 regional seats and 189 of the 235 seats available in municipal legislatures .
they also emerged victorious in the eagerly-watched race for moscow 's city legislature .
with 99 percent of votes in , the ria-novosti news agency reported a 66 percent win for united russia .

yabloko , which failed to reach the 7 percent hurdle in moscow 's local election , has condemned the 17-year-reign of mayor yury luzhkov , accusing him of carrying out " one of the all-time election frauds in russia 's recent history . "
on sunday , while the ballot boxes were still open , yabloko said it had received a " storm of calls " from the moscow electorate , complaining that they were unable to cast their vote because someone else had already done so using their name .
" united russia used so-called carousel voting , " said yabloko spokesman sergey mitrohin .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 12.10.2009 germany shows commitment to scientific research großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is spending more on research making sure that germany remains internationally competitive in the field of science is a question of both funds and creativity . latest statistics show that research and development funding in germany has continually increased over the past few years .
according to germany 's federal statistical office , non-university research institutions alone spent 8.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.5 billion -rrb- on research and development in 2007 - a 4.7 percent increase from the previous year .
for 2009 , the federal government planned a 10-billion-euro investment in this area . universities , research institutes and the industry are viewed as the " three pillars " that support german scientific research - a field that has undergone much change in recent years . striving for excellence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rwth aachen - one of germany 's " excellence universities " one of these changes can be seen in the so-called excellence initiative , thanks to which 1.9 billion euros in public money will be invested into cutting-edge university research by 2012 .
this program is carried out by the german research foundation -lrb- dfg -rrb- . " looking back at the last two years , you have to admit that there has never before been a measure or initiative in german science that has created so much dynamic , " said dfg president matthias kleiner .
" and this includes both the successful and not so successful activities . " nine german schools have proven that they can contribute something new to cutting-edge research and can officially call themselves " excellence universities . " in addition , there are 40 new graduate schools offering structured postgraduate programs and around 40 so-called " excellence clusters , " in which university experts and scientists cooperate in research field development . working with the best these " excellence clusters " often involve working together with the max planck society - a group of 76 institutes germany-wide that conduct basic research in the interest of the general public .
several thousand scientists work at these institutes in areas such as biology , chemistry , medicine and humanities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harald zur hausen won the nobel prize for his cancer and virus research another of germany 's renowned research organizations is the helmholtz association , whose mission is " strategic research in the national interest , " according to its president juergen mlynek .
this involves " taking on projects that a university or a smaller research institute sometimes can not take on . " the helmholtz association regularly attracts attention through its research achievements .
these include breakthroughs - like finding the link between a viral infection and cervical cancer .
for this discovery , scientist harald zur hausen was awarded the nobel prize for medicine in 2008 . another of the association 's recent achievements was the development of a tsunami warning system in response to the 2004 tsunami disaster in south-east asia . industry support is vital apart from universities and research centers , industry is the third " pillar " of german science .
industry-based research institutes spend roughly twice as much money on research as government institutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rwth university wants to create a better industry connection for its science students however , this does not necessarily have to be seen as competition , since numerous businesses work together with universities on innovative projects .
a good example of such cooperation is the rhenish-westphalian university of aachen -lrb- rwth -rrb- , which is currently setting up a new science campus to strengthen its industry connection .
the project was initiated by guenther schuh , a production engineering professor at the university .
" for industries this is certainly the most cost-efficient way of developing core capabilities in new knowledge areas and technologies , " said schuh . overall , there is a lot going on in the world of german research .
many things are being done to strengthen the cooperation between universities , research institutes and industry - all for the sake of cutting-edge research . author : britta mersch -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

larsson , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , said that although the pandemic has n't hurt the european population as much as feared , it still makes sense to be vaccinated .
" experts have told us that the pandemic will continue for some years , " larsson said .
" if you protect yourself , that will be protection not just for the current situation and the nearest months , but the nearest years . "
the emergence of swine flu in april led to widespread public fears , but since then , two new vaccines have been developed and concerns have abated .
but the eu wants to play it safe , and that means seeing to it that as many people as possible are vaccinated , thereby diminishing the likelihood that the disease will ever get a real grip on the population .
help further afield in that vein , larsson said she and her fellow health ministers would also debate whether it made sense to share their vaccine supplies with developing nations outside the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : handkerchiefs are not the kind of protection the eu is talking about also on monday , the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- announced that some 100 developing countries were in line to receive international donations of swine flu vaccines .
marie-paule kieny , who runs the who 's vaccine research unit , said the director general would approve a list of countries later in the day and hoped to start getting supplies to their recipients very soon .
" we are trying to have the first deliveries in november , " she said , adding that the vaccines will largely go to low income countries and will target some two percent of their population over the next four to five months. tkw / ap / afp / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" logicomix : an epic search for truth " follows british philosopher , logician and pacifist bertrand russell -lrb- 1872-1970 -rrb- in his tortuous quest for the foundations of mathematics , and his search for logic as a shield from the insanity that consumed other members of his family . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " logicomix " tracks the foundation of mathematics the story uses his relationships with the great thinkers and mathematicians of the era , two of his four marriages and historical events in europe such as the rise of nazism as a backdrop for the novel 's more abstract and philosophical subject matter . unexpected success originally published in greek in the fall of 2008 , " logicomix " was a hit at home .
but its authors were unprepared for the reception in the united states and britain , where it sold out on the first day of its release in september . the novel received positive reviews from such publications as the guardian and the new york times , which described the story as presented " with real graphic verve " and " delightful simplicity . " it sped up bestseller lists to occupy top 10 spots in comics , fiction and general book rankings on both amazon.com and amazon.co.uk.
it also recently hit no. 1 on the new york times paperback graphic book list . " i think the publishers -lrb- bloomsbury -rrb- were shocked , " apostolos doxiadis , who co-authored the story with computer science professor christos papadimitriou at the university of california , berkeley , told afp news agency .
" i was shocked too . " bertrand " not a mega-nerd " in searching for a narrator who would fit the novel 's context , doxiadis said bertrand russell was " ideal . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russell was n't a mega-nerd , said doxiadis born into a liberal aristocratic english family and the grandson of a former british prime minister , russell is considered one of the 20th century 's most important philosophers . he was an early advocate of sexual freedom , he was jailed for pacifism during world war i and later campaigned against nuclear proliferation and the vietnam war . " he was a political activist , a womanizer , traveler , adventurer , great talker , a wit and a dandy , " doxiadis told afp .
" he was the only one of these characters who was not a mega-nerd . " the long journey to print from initial discussions between the creators to scripting , drawing , inking and coloring , the novel 's completion took seven years - which the author called " a super-marathon . " like many other cartoon books , the album was pieced together like a movie with wall-to-wall story boards and doxiadis , who has a film-making background , acted out the characters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doxiadis was n't deterred by the unusual theme the aim of " logicomix " is " to tell a fascinating story about the history of ideas , " said doxiadis , who published a novel in 2001 entitled " uncle petros and goldbach 's conjecture " about a boy 's quest for knowledge about his reclusive mathematician uncle . " the fact that this idea looked like , to put it mildly , not a very likely idea for a comic book , never deterred me , " he said .
" in ' logicomix , ' the story i think is in some ways emblematic of much of what happened in the 20th century , with its search for certainty , for knowledge , and what often went with it , for power over life .

" lagerfeld also said that the current backlash against skinny models was being fuelled by overweight women who resent being reminded of their weight issues .
" these are fat moms sitting with their bags of chips in front of the tv and saying that thin models are ugly , " lagerfeld said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl lagerfeld the head designer for chanel made the comments in monday 's edition of german news magazine focus .
he was responding to a decision announced last week by top-selling german women 's magazine brigitte to forgo thin professional models .
instead , brigitte 's editors plan to feature real women they say represent more relatable ideals of beauty .
lagerfeld slammed the idea as " absurd , " arguing that the world of fashion is supposed to be about " dreams and illusions . "
from 2001 to 2002 , lagerfeld displayed an iron will as he whittled some 40 kilos -lrb- 90 pounds -rrb- off his frame in just 13 months .
since then , he has been outspoken when it comes to the correlation between fashion and size .
in 2004 , for example , he announced his irritation over a decision by swedish retailer h & m to make his designs for a one-off collection available in larger sizes .
" what i created was fashion for slim , slender people , " he said then , vowing never to work with the company again .
debate has become hysterical , designer says fellow german designer john ribbe was also quoted in focus , saying the current debate about too-skinny models had become hysterical .
" that 's another one of those cliches , like saying that all models take drugs and get drunk at sex orgies , " ribbe said .
" ninety percent are totally normal , well-proportioned girls with less fat and more muscle , but who also eat pizza and burgers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : starting in january , brigitte will feature " real women " instead of models according to brigitte editor andreas lebert , the average catwalk model today weighs some 23 percent less than the average woman on the street .
a few designers , however , are realizing that not all professional models have to be a size zero .
a case in point is us model crystal renn , who recently released a book entitled " hungry , " in which she details her struggle to meet the demands of agents who told her to lose weight if she wanted to work .
renn became anorexic in her pursuit to fit into the typical fashion mould before deciding that her health was more important .
now a voluptuous us size 12 , her modelling career is taking off .
she has been featured in fashion bible vogue magazine six times and walked the runway for designers such as jeanpaul gaultier .
renn is using her newfound stardom to plead for the world of fashion to recognize a multitude of beauty ideals - including women who are naturally a size two .

in 2006 , the german defense ministry shipped 10,000 old walther-p1 pistols to the afghan interior ministry to equip afghan police and army .
however , both the german government and the responsible us-led security team in afghanistan reportedly failed to properly monitor the guns ' whereabouts .
the us unit said that it only had detailed records of 4,563 pistols out of a total 10,000 . current and former afghan soldiers and police officers are said to be among those illegally selling and trafficking the pistols , some of which have ended up in pakistan 's north-west border provinces and neighboring tribal areas .

germany 's then coalition government of social democrats and greens made an exception , but the decision reportedly only reached parliament after the weapons had already arrived in afghanistan .
the fresh allegations have prompted calls for an investigation by germany 's green party and the police trade union .
green party spokesman winfried nachtwei accused the grand coalition government , which was in power when the guns were shipped , of a " grossly negligent course of action , " and called for the matter to be investigated in the interest of german security forces and civilian experts sent to afghanistan .
" it would be truly absurd if soldiers were threatened by weapons irresponsibly delivered by germany , " nachtwei said .
joerg radek of the police union said the danger was that " such weapons could fall into the wrong hands .
it is a risk for the germans deployed there , a risk to security in the country . "
defense ministry spokesman thomas raabe told reporters in berlin on monday that officials in kabul had guaranteed the weapons would only be distributed among security forces .
he said the ministry would be investigating any unlawful sales of the guns .

but that is easier said than done , as the president of the czech republic appears at pains to demonstrate . euroskeptic czech president vaclav klaus chose his moment well .
just hours before poland became a signatory to the much-talked about european treaty , he managed to keep the union 's eyes on him by saying he would not add his name to the pact until he was satisfied it will not destabilize national property rights .
klaus is concerned that the european charter of fundamental rights , part of the lisbon treaty , could allow the three million germans expelled from czechoslovakia at the end of the second world war to reclaim property confiscated from them at the time .
the issue came up after the fall of communism , but the czech courts have thrown out claims brought forth by expellees , and klaus is clearly prepared to go to great lengths to prevent an upsetting of that particular apple cart .
but in so doing , he is attracting much negative attention , and winning no eu popularity contests .
although relations between germany and the czech republic - which border one another - are essentially quite good , klaus 's latest demands have met with criticism in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech president vaclav klaus says he wo n't take no for an answer christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- member and parliamentary secretary for defense , christian schmidt , told the dpa news agency that it was unnecessary to play the german expellees card and that there is already a european convention of human rights .
" everything that concerns the lisbon treaty has been negotiated , " schmidt said .
" to come now , shortly before the end game with new demands , leads to the impression that he only wants to delay . "
if they can , so can we but klaus insists it is his right to demand a binding guarantee that prevents expellees from using eu laws to circumnavigate the czech judicial system .
he cited britain and poland , both of which negotiated an opt-out before the pact was signed at the end of 2007 - britain over fears that collective bargaining rights could lead to increased strike action , and poland in order to protect the values of a deeply catholic society - saying he wanted something similar for his country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president lech kaczynski signed the treaty at the weekend " i am convinced that the czech republic must at least post facto negotiate a similar exemption , " klaus told reporters , adding that he thought a " non-standard " procedure could get the job done quickly .
in order to try and convince the rest of the eu to accommodate his wishes , the czech president would first have to submit a proposal .
the alternative procedure the easier way forward could be to have eu leaders approve a declaration which is not intrinsically a part of the treaty , such as they did when ireland asked for a guarantee that the lisbon treaty would not interfere with laws on taxes and abortion .
but ladislav jakl , an aide to klaus , poured water on that idea on czech television on sunday .
he said the president would " not be satisfied by any declaration but only guarantees for every citizen , " adding that the condition was " fundamental , necessary , unbreachable . "
it is certainly problematic for the eu that klaus has waited until this late stage in the ratification process to ask to see it tweaked in his favor .
what happens next will depend to some degree on the czech parliament which is scheduled to meet on monday to discuss the latest spanner the president has thrown into the ratification process works. tkw / afp / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the step of devolution for policing and justice is an absolutely essential milestone , " the us secretary of state told reporters .
" clearly there are questions and some apprehensions , but i believe that due to the concerted efforts of the british government , irish government and support of friends like us in the us , that the parties understand that this is a step they must take together . "
northern ireland 's main parties have been at loggerheads over the details of its devolution process from the united kingdom , resulting in a row which has brought its administration to a standstill with no clear resolution in sight . clinton says progress " within reach " clinton 's presence in northern ireland has narrowed the gap between northern ireland 's main parties , a step regarded as crucial to resolving the stand-off and pushing on with the devolution process .
" it will take the leaders of both communities working together to continue not only the devolution but then to make day-to-day governing a reality , and i 'm confident that that is within reach . "
the new power-sharing government of northern ireland , a landmark accord between the protestant conservative , pro-british dup and catholic socialist republicans sinn fein , agreed in principle on the transfer of responsibility from the united kingdom to northern ireland , however , differences over the details of the devolution process led to discord between the parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in march 2009 , two british soldiers died in an attack on military barracks near antrim sinn fein and the dup have been in conflict over when powers for policing should be devolved from london , the former insisting it should have happened already and the latter choosing caution and saying it will only assent to devolution with an adequate financial package in place and broad community confidence . inla lays down arms for peace the peace process , started in 1998 by the good friday agreement , ended three decades of conflict in northern ireland , in which roughly 3,500 people were killed .
its full implementation , rather than squabbling over its fine points , is vital to peaceful governance in northern ireland as stressed by clinton .
clinton 's visit comes as the irish national liberation army -lrb- inla -rrb- , a republican paramilitary group infamous for its violent crimes during northern ireland 's troubles , has signaled it 's prepared to lay down arms .
it has renounced its armed struggle , releasing a statement saying , " following a process of serious debate ... it has concluded that the armed struggle is over .

can it escape the oil curse and become an example to other developing states ? in many ways ghana serves as a model among african countries .
compared to many other west african nations it has been very stable in recent years .
ghana 's peaceful election last year and the successful transition of government from one party to another this year were considered the pinnacle of the country 's progress , which was highlighted by us president barack obama 's visit to accra this summer .
but after the recent announcement by oil giant exxonmobil that it was buying a four billion-dollar stake in ghana 's jubilee oil field , the country is now facing a task that may be even more challenging than the democratic reform process it has undergone : to prove that it can not only successfully deal with a powerful multinational , but also that the windfall that is generated by what is considered to be one of africa 's biggest oil fields does n't end up in the pockets of a few insiders , but improves the wealth and well-being of ghana 's society .
" the stakes are very high , " writes ian gary , an expert in extractive industries , in a report about ghana 's oil find and its consequences for society for the international aid agency oxfam .
" while many ghanaian government officials are confident they can meet the challenge , oil 's threat to democratic development should not be underestimated . "
high stakes , big profits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exxonmobil 's bid beat out other oil giants while the stakes are high , so is the profit .
according to an estimate by the international monetary fund which is cited by gary , ghana 's government can expect revenues from oil and gas up to 20 billion dollars during the production period between 2012 and 2030 for the jubilee field alone .
so what are ghana 's chances to avoid the spell of the so-called oil curse ? " i think that ghana could really be one country which could be a positive example to the world and it could also be profitable and beneficial for the country , " claudia kemfert , an energy specialist at berlin 's economic research institute diw , tells deutsche welle .
" ghana could really profit from this deal and also from the oil market . "
what 's required , adds kemfert , is that ghana 's government puts in place a good political strategy on how it wants to use the oil revenues .
talking to deutsche welle , ulrike bickel , an energy expert with germany 's catholic relief agency misereor , is more skeptical : " we obviously see the danger that ghana could also become a victim of the oil curse , that its oil wealth wo n't benefit the people and that oil revenues just like in neighboring countries , vanish instead of being spent on health , education or sustainable social development . " while bickel points out that ghana , a country without previous experience in the oil sector , has taken positive steps such as signing on to the so-called extractive industries transparency initiative , which mandates its members to openly document the flow of revenues , she adds that it is still far too early to tell whether it will be implemented .
bildunterschrift : president obama 's visit , with ghana president john atta mills highlighted the country 's progress negative example an example that positive declarations and good intentions do n't necessarily translate into enforceable action is chad .
" before the world bank agreed to a large loan for the chad-cameroon pipeline there was an agreement that a fund for future generations would be created and that up to 70 percent of the oil revenues would be used for priority social sector developments , " says bickel .
" but as soon as the oil revenue started to flow , chad 's government , which was fighting a civil war , dissolved the fund for future generations and extended the priority sector developments to include national security .
that means the oil revenue is used to buy large quantities of weapons . " that does n't mean that agreements and declarations are n't useful .
they definitely are .
but reality eventually is the ultimate test whether those agreements are fulfilled .
ghana , say the analysts , among developing african nations , is perhaps best prepared to manage its oil wealth carefully . as oxfam expert gary wrote in his report on ghana : " oil wealth tends to erode democratic accountability .
ghana 's challenge will be to ensure that the right institutions and transparent policies are in place before oil production starts . "

can it escape the oil curse and become an example to other developing states ? in many ways ghana serves as a model among african countries .
compared to many other west african nations it has been very stable in recent years .
ghana 's peaceful election last year and the successful transition of government from one party to another this year were considered the pinnacle of the country 's progress , which was highlighted by us president barack obama 's visit to accra this summer .
but after the recent announcement by oil giant exxonmobil that it was buying a four billion-dollar stake in ghana 's jubilee oil field , the country is now facing a task that may be even more challenging than the democratic reform process it has undergone : to prove that it can not only successfully deal with a powerful multinational , but also that the windfall that is generated by what is considered to be one of africa 's biggest oil fields does n't end up in the pockets of a few insiders , but improves the wealth and well-being of ghana 's society .
" the stakes are very high , " writes ian gary , an expert in extractive industries , in a report about ghana 's oil find and its consequences for society for the international aid agency oxfam .
" while many ghanaian government officials are confident they can meet the challenge , oil 's threat to democratic development should not be underestimated . "
high stakes , big profits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exxonmobil 's bid beat out other oil giants while the stakes are high , so is the profit .
according to an estimate by the international monetary fund which is cited by gary , ghana 's government can expect revenues from oil and gas up to 20 billion dollars during the production period between 2012 and 2030 for the jubilee field alone .
so what are ghana 's chances to avoid the spell of the so-called oil curse ? " i think that ghana could really be one country which could be a positive example to the world and it could also be profitable and beneficial for the country , " claudia kemfert , an energy specialist at berlin 's economic research institute diw , tells deutsche welle .
" ghana could really profit from this deal and also from the oil market . "
what 's required , adds kemfert , is that ghana 's government puts in place a good political strategy on how it wants to use the oil revenues .
talking to deutsche welle , ulrike bickel , an energy expert with germany 's catholic relief agency misereor , is more skeptical : " we obviously see the danger that ghana could also become a victim of the oil curse , that its oil wealth wo n't benefit the people and that oil revenues just like in neighboring countries , vanish instead of being spent on health , education or sustainable social development . " while bickel points out that ghana , a country without previous experience in the oil sector , has taken positive steps such as signing on to the so-called extractive industries transparency initiative , which mandates its members to openly document the flow of revenues , she adds that it is still far too early to tell whether it will be implemented .
bildunterschrift : president obama 's visit , with ghana president john atta mills highlighted the country 's progress negative example an example that positive declarations and good intentions do n't necessarily translate into enforceable action is chad .
" before the world bank agreed to a large loan for the chad-cameroon pipeline there was an agreement that a fund for future generations would be created and that up to 70 percent of the oil revenues would be used for priority social sector developments , " says bickel .
" but as soon as the oil revenue started to flow , chad 's government , which was fighting a civil war , dissolved the fund for future generations and extended the priority sector developments to include national security .
that means the oil revenue is used to buy large quantities of weapons . " that does n't mean that agreements and declarations are n't useful .
they definitely are .
but reality eventually is the ultimate test whether those agreements are fulfilled .
ghana , say the analysts , among developing african nations , is perhaps best prepared to manage its oil wealth carefully . as oxfam expert gary wrote in his report on ghana : " oil wealth tends to erode democratic accountability .
ghana 's challenge will be to ensure that the right institutions and transparent policies are in place before oil production starts . "
currently oil production at the jubilee field is scheduled for 2010 . author : michael knigge editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de fashion -pipe- 12.10.2009 karl lagerfeld weighs in on skinny models debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the recent chanel show in paris , thin was still in iconic fashion designer karl lagerfeld has defended the use of ultra-thin models on the runway , telling a german news magazine that " no one wants to see curvy women . " lagerfeld also said that the current backlash against skinny models was being fuelled by overweight women who resent being reminded of their weight issues .
" these are fat moms sitting with their bags of chips in front of the tv and saying that thin models are ugly , " lagerfeld said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl lagerfeld the head designer for chanel made the comments in monday 's edition of german news magazine focus .
he was responding to a decision announced last week by top-selling german women 's magazine brigitte to forgo thin professional models .
instead , brigitte 's editors plan to feature real women they say represent more relatable ideals of beauty .
lagerfeld slammed the idea as " absurd , " arguing that the world of fashion is supposed to be about " dreams and illusions . "
from 2001 to 2002 , lagerfeld displayed an iron will as he whittled some 40 kilos -lrb- 90 pounds -rrb- off his frame in just 13 months .
since then , he has been outspoken when it comes to the correlation between fashion and size .
in 2004 , for example , he announced his irritation over a decision by swedish retailer h & m to make his designs for a one-off collection available in larger sizes .
" what i created was fashion for slim , slender people , " he said then , vowing never to work with the company again .
debate has become hysterical , designer says fellow german designer john ribbe was also quoted in focus , saying the current debate about too-skinny models had become hysterical .
" that 's another one of those cliches , like saying that all models take drugs and get drunk at sex orgies , " ribbe said .
" ninety percent are totally normal , well-proportioned girls with less fat and more muscle , but who also eat pizza and burgers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : starting in january , brigitte will feature " real women " instead of models according to brigitte editor andreas lebert , the average catwalk model today weighs some 23 percent less than the average woman on the street .
a few designers , however , are realizing that not all professional models have to be a size zero .
a case in point is us model crystal renn , who recently released a book entitled " hungry , " in which she details her struggle to meet the demands of agents who told her to lose weight if she wanted to work .
renn became anorexic in her pursuit to fit into the typical fashion mould before deciding that her health was more important .
now a voluptuous us size 12 , her modelling career is taking off .
she has been featured in fashion bible vogue magazine six times and walked the runway for designers such as jeanpaul gaultier .
renn is using her newfound stardom to plead for the world of fashion to recognize a multitude of beauty ideals - including women who are naturally a size two .
" all women bring something different to the table and we have to appreciate them all , " she said. dc / ap / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but how does the team measure up to the world 's top national teams ?
deutsche welle 's jefferson chase takes a closer look . the one moment that best symbolizes the 1-0 win over moscow that qualified germany for the 2010 world cup in south africa was directly after the lone goal was scored .
striker miroslav klose celebrated with one of his trademark forward flips - and only narrowly avoided landing on his backside .
match reports in german newspapers , perhaps understandably , were full of superlatives about germany 's gutsy away win .
but that 1-0 victory was of the knife-edge variety , unlike germany 's 1-0 loss to spain in the 2008 european championships , the last time coach joachim loew had a chance to win a title .
so have germany improved enough to draw level with the spaniards or brazil ?
or are they more on a par with other large european nations like england , the netherlands and italy .
here 's a back-to-front run-through of the strengths and weaknesses of the german squad .
defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adler could become the next in a long line of stellar german national keepers the one position about which loew has absolutely no worries is goal .
24-year-old rene adler was the key to germany 's victory , making a number of world-class saves , and seems to have sealed his position as germany 's number one .
the young keeper 's most brilliant moment in moscow came in the 73rd minute , when russian midfielder igor semshov was clear on the right side and slotted a crisp pass in the direction of two teammates waiting in front of goal .
adler not only got a hand to the ball but cleverly deflected it over the end line .
and should adler get hurt , loew can call on robert enke , manuel neuer or even tim wiese who 've all proved their worth at the international level .
left back philipp lahm is arguably the best in the world at his position so his selection is a no-brainer .
interior defenders per mertesacker and heiko westermann provide a solid anchor in the back four .
youngster serdar tasci could also play a role .
the big question is right back .
jerome boateng , who made his national-team debut in russia , showed he was capable of provided some welcome offensive pressure .
but the 21-year-old also got himself sent off with a red card .
loew 's task will be to get the youngster enough experience in friendlies between now and next june that he no longer poses a risk .
otherwise , he 'll be forced to fall back on arne friedrich , who 's been mediocre at best when wearing the german kit .
defensive midfield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack is a force in midfield but germany could use a threat like russia 's andrei arshavin though not the force he once was german captain michael ballack is the lynchpin of the german squad .
the 33-year-old not only wins lots of challenges but is responsible for the opening passes for germany 's offense .
to cover ballack 's back when he presses forward , simon rolfes is a good choice .
and thomas hitzlsperger is also a more offensive option because of his ability to blast in shots from long-range .
if ballack were to go down to injury , though , germany would be in trouble .
ballack is to germany what gennaro gattuso has been to italy , and loew needs to plan , as best he can , for the eventuality that his captain is unavailable .
the problem is that no one currently on the squad or on the radar screen has the ability to fill the stopper-meets-playmaker role ballack occupies .
offensive midfield and wingers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is counting on youngsters like jerome boateng , marko marin and mesut oezil the emergence of mesut oezil represents the biggest improvement of germany 's likely 2010 squad over the 2008 edition .
the 20-year-old displayed both his pace and his eye for his teammates in setting up the lone goal in moscow that punched germany 's world cup ticket .
but after that , the quality tails off .
bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski are active but relatively inefficient players who 've never lived up their potential .
it will be interesting to see whether youngster marko marin , oezil 's equally fleet-footed teammate at werder bremen , can break into the germany 's starting eleven .
but even if he does , a comparison with the world 's top teams suggests that germany 's offensive midfield is a relative weakness .
spain are spoiled for choice with xabi alonso , xavi , fabregas , iniesta and senna .
brazil , too , can chose from nearly a dozen top-quality midfielders , including kaka , whose skills and creativity are far superior to any member of the german squad .
thus , as the squad stands , germany may find it difficult to come back if they go behind early in matches - something that most teams need to do if they want to take a major international title .
bildunterschrift : klose showed his age in executing his celebratory front flip - he landed on his backside , not his feet the center forward this position is one of the biggest question marks in the team .
if the russia match is anything to go by , loew could likely rely on a 4-3-3 formation for much of the tournament in south africa .
that essentially means the battle to fill the lone central forward slot is between miroslav klose and mario gomez , the same pair of players contesting the same position at their mutual club bayern munich .
for now klose , who will be 32 years old next summer , gets the nod because he , in contrast to gomez , has been effective for the national squad in the past .
but he 's clearly lost a bit of athleticism , so in his heart of hearts , loew might well prefer the 24-year-old gomez .
loew choice will probably be influenced by how much playing time the two strikers get at bayern munich .
however that situation turns out , though , what loew does n't have is a center forward who can create goal opportunities for himself a la wayne rooney for england or thierry henry for france .
that means that germany could have trouble against other defensively oriented teams like italy .
as one of the best teams at the back in the world , germany could certainly fly high in south africa , and no nation will relish facing them .
but their creative deficiencies at the front also mean that loew 's men , if they face tough opponents early on , could end up smack on their backsides .

but how does the team measure up to the world 's top national teams ?
deutsche welle 's jefferson chase takes a closer look . the one moment that best symbolizes the 1-0 win over moscow that qualified germany for the 2010 world cup in south africa was directly after the lone goal was scored .
striker miroslav klose celebrated with one of his trademark forward flips - and only narrowly avoided landing on his backside .
match reports in german newspapers , perhaps understandably , were full of superlatives about germany 's gutsy away win .
but that 1-0 victory was of the knife-edge variety , unlike germany 's 1-0 loss to spain in the 2008 european championships , the last time coach joachim loew had a chance to win a title .
so have germany improved enough to draw level with the spaniards or brazil ?
or are they more on a par with other large european nations like england , the netherlands and italy .
here 's a back-to-front run-through of the strengths and weaknesses of the german squad .
defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adler could become the next in a long line of stellar german national keepers the one position about which loew has absolutely no worries is goal .
24-year-old rene adler was the key to germany 's victory , making a number of world-class saves , and seems to have sealed his position as germany 's number one .
the young keeper 's most brilliant moment in moscow came in the 73rd minute , when russian midfielder igor semshov was clear on the right side and slotted a crisp pass in the direction of two teammates waiting in front of goal .
adler not only got a hand to the ball but cleverly deflected it over the end line .
and should adler get hurt , loew can call on robert enke , manuel neuer or even tim wiese who 've all proved their worth at the international level .
left back philipp lahm is arguably the best in the world at his position so his selection is a no-brainer .
interior defenders per mertesacker and heiko westermann provide a solid anchor in the back four .
youngster serdar tasci could also play a role .
the big question is right back .
jerome boateng , who made his national-team debut in russia , showed he was capable of provided some welcome offensive pressure .
but the 21-year-old also got himself sent off with a red card .
loew 's task will be to get the youngster enough experience in friendlies between now and next june that he no longer poses a risk .
otherwise , he 'll be forced to fall back on arne friedrich , who 's been mediocre at best when wearing the german kit .
defensive midfield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack is a force in midfield but germany could use a threat like russia 's andrei arshavin though not the force he once was german captain michael ballack is the lynchpin of the german squad .
the 33-year-old not only wins lots of challenges but is responsible for the opening passes for germany 's offense .
to cover ballack 's back when he presses forward , simon rolfes is a good choice .
and thomas hitzlsperger is also a more offensive option because of his ability to blast in shots from long-range .
if ballack were to go down to injury , though , germany would be in trouble .
ballack is to germany what gennaro gattuso has been to italy , and loew needs to plan , as best he can , for the eventuality that his captain is unavailable .
the problem is that no one currently on the squad or on the radar screen has the ability to fill the stopper-meets-playmaker role ballack occupies .
offensive midfield and wingers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is counting on youngsters like jerome boateng , marko marin and mesut oezil the emergence of mesut oezil represents the biggest improvement of germany 's likely 2010 squad over the 2008 edition .
the 20-year-old displayed both his pace and his eye for his teammates in setting up the lone goal in moscow that punched germany 's world cup ticket .
but after that , the quality tails off .
bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski are active but relatively inefficient players who 've never lived up their potential .
it will be interesting to see whether youngster marko marin , oezil 's equally fleet-footed teammate at werder bremen , can break into the germany 's starting eleven .
but even if he does , a comparison with the world 's top teams suggests that germany 's offensive midfield is a relative weakness .
spain are spoiled for choice with xabi alonso , xavi , fabregas , iniesta and senna .
brazil , too , can chose from nearly a dozen top-quality midfielders , including kaka , whose skills and creativity are far superior to any member of the german squad .
thus , as the squad stands , germany may find it difficult to come back if they go behind early in matches - something that most teams need to do if they want to take a major international title .
bildunterschrift : klose showed his age in executing his celebratory front flip - he landed on his backside , not his feet the center forward this position is one of the biggest question marks in the team .
if the russia match is anything to go by , loew could likely rely on a 4-3-3 formation for much of the tournament in south africa .
that essentially means the battle to fill the lone central forward slot is between miroslav klose and mario gomez , the same pair of players contesting the same position at their mutual club bayern munich .
for now klose , who will be 32 years old next summer , gets the nod because he , in contrast to gomez , has been effective for the national squad in the past .
but he 's clearly lost a bit of athleticism , so in his heart of hearts , loew might well prefer the 24-year-old gomez .
loew choice will probably be influenced by how much playing time the two strikers get at bayern munich .
however that situation turns out , though , what loew does n't have is a center forward who can create goal opportunities for himself a la wayne rooney for england or thierry henry for france .
that means that germany could have trouble against other defensively oriented teams like italy .
as one of the best teams at the back in the world , germany could certainly fly high in south africa , and no nation will relish facing them .
but their creative deficiencies at the front also mean that loew 's men , if they face tough opponents early on , could end up smack on their backsides .

deutsche welle 's jefferson chase takes a closer look . the one moment that best symbolizes the 1-0 win over moscow that qualified germany for the 2010 world cup in south africa was directly after the lone goal was scored .
striker miroslav klose celebrated with one of his trademark forward flips - and only narrowly avoided landing on his backside .
match reports in german newspapers , perhaps understandably , were full of superlatives about germany 's gutsy away win .
but that 1-0 victory was of the knife-edge variety , unlike germany 's 1-0 loss to spain in the 2008 european championships , the last time coach joachim loew had a chance to win a title .
so have germany improved enough to draw level with the spaniards or brazil ?
or are they more on a par with other large european nations like england , the netherlands and italy .
here 's a back-to-front run-through of the strengths and weaknesses of the german squad .
defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adler could become the next in a long line of stellar german national keepers the one position about which loew has absolutely no worries is goal .
24-year-old rene adler was the key to germany 's victory , making a number of world-class saves , and seems to have sealed his position as germany 's number one .
the young keeper 's most brilliant moment in moscow came in the 73rd minute , when russian midfielder igor semshov was clear on the right side and slotted a crisp pass in the direction of two teammates waiting in front of goal .
adler not only got a hand to the ball but cleverly deflected it over the end line .
and should adler get hurt , loew can call on robert enke , manuel neuer or even tim wiese who 've all proved their worth at the international level .
left back philipp lahm is arguably the best in the world at his position so his selection is a no-brainer .
interior defenders per mertesacker and heiko westermann provide a solid anchor in the back four .
youngster serdar tasci could also play a role .
the big question is right back .
jerome boateng , who made his national-team debut in russia , showed he was capable of provided some welcome offensive pressure .
but the 21-year-old also got himself sent off with a red card .
loew 's task will be to get the youngster enough experience in friendlies between now and next june that he no longer poses a risk .
otherwise , he 'll be forced to fall back on arne friedrich , who 's been mediocre at best when wearing the german kit .
defensive midfield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack is a force in midfield but germany could use a threat like russia 's andrei arshavin though not the force he once was german captain michael ballack is the lynchpin of the german squad .
the 33-year-old not only wins lots of challenges but is responsible for the opening passes for germany 's offense .
to cover ballack 's back when he presses forward , simon rolfes is a good choice .
and thomas hitzlsperger is also a more offensive option because of his ability to blast in shots from long-range .
if ballack were to go down to injury , though , germany would be in trouble .
ballack is to germany what gennaro gattuso has been to italy , and loew needs to plan , as best he can , for the eventuality that his captain is unavailable .
the problem is that no one currently on the squad or on the radar screen has the ability to fill the stopper-meets-playmaker role ballack occupies .
offensive midfield and wingers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is counting on youngsters like jerome boateng , marko marin and mesut oezil the emergence of mesut oezil represents the biggest improvement of germany 's likely 2010 squad over the 2008 edition .
the 20-year-old displayed both his pace and his eye for his teammates in setting up the lone goal in moscow that punched germany 's world cup ticket .
but after that , the quality tails off .
bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski are active but relatively inefficient players who 've never lived up their potential .
it will be interesting to see whether youngster marko marin , oezil 's equally fleet-footed teammate at werder bremen , can break into the germany 's starting eleven .
but even if he does , a comparison with the world 's top teams suggests that germany 's offensive midfield is a relative weakness .
spain are spoiled for choice with xabi alonso , xavi , fabregas , iniesta and senna .
brazil , too , can chose from nearly a dozen top-quality midfielders , including kaka , whose skills and creativity are far superior to any member of the german squad .
thus , as the squad stands , germany may find it difficult to come back if they go behind early in matches - something that most teams need to do if they want to take a major international title .
bildunterschrift : klose showed his age in executing his celebratory front flip - he landed on his backside , not his feet the center forward this position is one of the biggest question marks in the team .
if the russia match is anything to go by , loew could likely rely on a 4-3-3 formation for much of the tournament in south africa .
that essentially means the battle to fill the lone central forward slot is between miroslav klose and mario gomez , the same pair of players contesting the same position at their mutual club bayern munich .
for now klose , who will be 32 years old next summer , gets the nod because he , in contrast to gomez , has been effective for the national squad in the past .
but he 's clearly lost a bit of athleticism , so in his heart of hearts , loew might well prefer the 24-year-old gomez .
loew choice will probably be influenced by how much playing time the two strikers get at bayern munich .
however that situation turns out , though , what loew does n't have is a center forward who can create goal opportunities for himself a la wayne rooney for england or thierry henry for france .
that means that germany could have trouble against other defensively oriented teams like italy .
as one of the best teams at the back in the world , germany could certainly fly high in south africa , and no nation will relish facing them .
but their creative deficiencies at the front also mean that loew 's men , if they face tough opponents early on , could end up smack on their backsides .

dw-world.de the young man with a deadly left foot at first , some said he was too small to be taken seriously as a professional soccer player .
now , mesut oezil has proven himself as one of the big boys on germany 's national team .

can it escape the oil curse and become an example to other developing states ? in many ways ghana serves as a model among african countries .
compared to many other west african nations it has been very stable in recent years .
ghana 's peaceful election last year and the successful transition of government from one party to another this year were considered the pinnacle of the country 's progress , which was highlighted by us president barack obama 's visit to accra this summer .
but after the recent announcement by oil giant exxonmobil that it was buying a four billion-dollar stake in ghana 's jubilee oil field , the country is now facing a task that may be even more challenging than the democratic reform process it has undergone : to prove that it can not only successfully deal with a powerful multinational , but also that the windfall that is generated by what is considered to be one of africa 's biggest oil fields does n't end up in the pockets of a few insiders , but improves the wealth and well-being of ghana 's society .
" the stakes are very high , " writes ian gary , an expert in extractive industries , in a report about ghana 's oil find and its consequences for society for the international aid agency oxfam .
" while many ghanaian government officials are confident they can meet the challenge , oil 's threat to democratic development should not be underestimated . "
high stakes , big profits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exxonmobil 's bid beat out other oil giants while the stakes are high , so is the profit .
according to an estimate by the international monetary fund which is cited by gary , ghana 's government can expect revenues from oil and gas up to 20 billion dollars during the production period between 2012 and 2030 for the jubilee field alone .
so what are ghana 's chances to avoid the spell of the so-called oil curse ? " i think that ghana could really be one country which could be a positive example to the world and it could also be profitable and beneficial for the country , " claudia kemfert , an energy specialist at berlin 's economic research institute diw , tells deutsche welle .
" ghana could really profit from this deal and also from the oil market . "
what 's required , adds kemfert , is that ghana 's government puts in place a good political strategy on how it wants to use the oil revenues .
talking to deutsche welle , ulrike bickel , an energy expert with germany 's catholic relief agency misereor , is more skeptical : " we obviously see the danger that ghana could also become a victim of the oil curse , that its oil wealth wo n't benefit the people and that oil revenues just like in neighboring countries , vanish instead of being spent on health , education or sustainable social development . " while bickel points out that ghana , a country without previous experience in the oil sector , has taken positive steps such as signing on to the so-called extractive industries transparency initiative , which mandates its members to openly document the flow of revenues , she adds that it is still far too early to tell whether it will be implemented .
bildunterschrift : president obama 's visit , with ghana president john atta mills highlighted the country 's progress negative example an example that positive declarations and good intentions do n't necessarily translate into enforceable action is chad .
" before the world bank agreed to a large loan for the chad-cameroon pipeline there was an agreement that a fund for future generations would be created and that up to 70 percent of the oil revenues would be used for priority social sector developments , " says bickel .
" but as soon as the oil revenue started to flow , chad 's government , which was fighting a civil war , dissolved the fund for future generations and extended the priority sector developments to include national security .
that means the oil revenue is used to buy large quantities of weapons . " that does n't mean that agreements and declarations are n't useful .
they definitely are .
but reality eventually is the ultimate test whether those agreements are fulfilled .
ghana , say the analysts , among developing african nations , is perhaps best prepared to manage its oil wealth carefully . as oxfam expert gary wrote in his report on ghana : " oil wealth tends to erode democratic accountability .
ghana 's challenge will be to ensure that the right institutions and transparent policies are in place before oil production starts . "
currently oil production at the jubilee field is scheduled for 2010 . author : michael knigge editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

leonid ivlev , a member of the central elections commission , told reporters that the ruling party had garnered almost 80 percent of seats up for grabs in the 75 regional and local elections held up and down the country on sunday .
ivlev said putin 's party picked up 107 of the 135 regional seats and 189 of the 235 seats available in municipal legislatures .
they also emerged victorious in the eagerly-watched race for moscow 's city legislature .
with 99 percent of votes in , the ria-novosti news agency reported a 66 percent win for united russia .
praise from the president the opposition communists were the only rivals to score any seats in the high-profile ballot , which only managed to attract a 35 percent voter turnout .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president dmitry medvedev praised the results in comments on the united russia party website , president dmitry medvedev told his country , which has been particularly hard hit by the economic downturn , that they had voted for the right party .
" only together can we surmount the hardships of the financial crisis , " he wrote , " and the vote obtained by united russia demonstrates that we are together and this is most important . "
he went on to say that the 30 million-strong electorate clearly knew what it wanted .
" taking account that elections in the capital are practically federal ones , we can state that in the crisis situation voters have demonstrated they stay together with the ruling party . "
claims of fraud but the liberal yabloko party , which came away from the vote completely empty-handed , has made claims of systematic vote rigging .
yabloko , which failed to reach the 7 percent hurdle in moscow 's local election , has condemned the 17-year-reign of mayor yury luzhkov , accusing him of carrying out " one of the all-time election frauds in russia 's recent history . "
on sunday , while the ballot boxes were still open , yabloko said it had received a " storm of calls " from the moscow electorate , complaining that they were unable to cast their vote because someone else had already done so using their name .
" united russia used so-called carousel voting , " said yabloko spokesman sergey mitrohin .
" this time , it was busloads of soldiers and police that they took from one polling station to another and had them cast their votes for united russia over and over .
we also have serious reason to believe that the ballot boxes were stuffed with additional ballots . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition parties say they will contest moscow 's municipal ballot yabloko and communist party representatives have already said they will contest the results of the municipal poll in court .
" we can not recognize these elections or consider them normal , " communist party deputy chairman vladimir kashin told ria-novosti .
the independent election watchdog golog has come out behind the opposition parties , and has said it will provide proof of fraud . earlier , head of the watchdog , liliya shibanova , lamented the lack of political competition in russia .
" medvedev says we need competition , we need a multi-party system , but election results show the exact opposite , " she said. tkw / dc / afp / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

leonid ivlev , a member of the central elections commission , told reporters that the ruling party had garnered almost 80 percent of seats up for grabs in the 75 regional and local elections held up and down the country on sunday .
ivlev said putin 's party picked up 107 of the 135 regional seats and 189 of the 235 seats available in municipal legislatures .
they also emerged victorious in the eagerly-watched race for moscow 's city legislature .
with 99 percent of votes in , the ria-novosti news agency reported a 66 percent win for united russia .

yabloko , which failed to reach the 7 percent hurdle in moscow 's local election , has condemned the 17-year-reign of mayor yury luzhkov , accusing him of carrying out " one of the all-time election frauds in russia 's recent history . "
on sunday , while the ballot boxes were still open , yabloko said it had received a " storm of calls " from the moscow electorate , complaining that they were unable to cast their vote because someone else had already done so using their name .
" united russia used so-called carousel voting , " said yabloko spokesman sergey mitrohin .
" this time , it was busloads of soldiers and police that they took from one polling station to another and had them cast their votes for united russia over and over .
we also have serious reason to believe that the ballot boxes were stuffed with additional ballots . "

" logicomix : an epic search for truth " follows british philosopher , logician and pacifist bertrand russell -lrb- 1872-1970 -rrb- in his tortuous quest for the foundations of mathematics , and his search for logic as a shield from the insanity that consumed other members of his family . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " logicomix " tracks the foundation of mathematics the story uses his relationships with the great thinkers and mathematicians of the era , two of his four marriages and historical events in europe such as the rise of nazism as a backdrop for the novel 's more abstract and philosophical subject matter . unexpected success originally published in greek in the fall of 2008 , " logicomix " was a hit at home .
but its authors were unprepared for the reception in the united states and britain , where it sold out on the first day of its release in september . the novel received positive reviews from such publications as the guardian and the new york times , which described the story as presented " with real graphic verve " and " delightful simplicity . " it sped up bestseller lists to occupy top 10 spots in comics , fiction and general book rankings on both amazon.com and amazon.co.uk.
it also recently hit no. 1 on the new york times paperback graphic book list .

" lagerfeld also said that the current backlash against skinny models was being fuelled by overweight women who resent being reminded of their weight issues .
" these are fat moms sitting with their bags of chips in front of the tv and saying that thin models are ugly , " lagerfeld said .

he was responding to a decision announced last week by top-selling german women 's magazine brigitte to forgo thin professional models .
instead , brigitte 's editors plan to feature real women they say represent more relatable ideals of beauty .
lagerfeld slammed the idea as " absurd , " arguing that the world of fashion is supposed to be about " dreams and illusions . "
from 2001 to 2002 , lagerfeld displayed an iron will as he whittled some 40 kilos -lrb- 90 pounds -rrb- off his frame in just 13 months .

" what i created was fashion for slim , slender people , " he said then , vowing never to work with the company again .
debate has become hysterical , designer says fellow german designer john ribbe was also quoted in focus , saying the current debate about too-skinny models had become hysterical .

" ninety percent are totally normal , well-proportioned girls with less fat and more muscle , but who also eat pizza and burgers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : starting in january , brigitte will feature " real women " instead of models according to brigitte editor andreas lebert , the average catwalk model today weighs some 23 percent less than the average woman on the street .
a few designers , however , are realizing that not all professional models have to be a size zero .
a case in point is us model crystal renn , who recently released a book entitled " hungry , " in which she details her struggle to meet the demands of agents who told her to lose weight if she wanted to work .
renn became anorexic in her pursuit to fit into the typical fashion mould before deciding that her health was more important .
now a voluptuous us size 12 , her modelling career is taking off .
she has been featured in fashion bible vogue magazine six times and walked the runway for designers such as jeanpaul gaultier .
renn is using her newfound stardom to plead for the world of fashion to recognize a multitude of beauty ideals - including women who are naturally a size two .
" all women bring something different to the table and we have to appreciate them all , " she said. dc / ap / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" lagerfeld also said that the current backlash against skinny models was being fuelled by overweight women who resent being reminded of their weight issues .
" these are fat moms sitting with their bags of chips in front of the tv and saying that thin models are ugly , " lagerfeld said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl lagerfeld the head designer for chanel made the comments in monday 's edition of german news magazine focus .
he was responding to a decision announced last week by top-selling german women 's magazine brigitte to forgo thin professional models .
instead , brigitte 's editors plan to feature real women they say represent more relatable ideals of beauty .
lagerfeld slammed the idea as " absurd , " arguing that the world of fashion is supposed to be about " dreams and illusions . "
from 2001 to 2002 , lagerfeld displayed an iron will as he whittled some 40 kilos -lrb- 90 pounds -rrb- off his frame in just 13 months .
since then , he has been outspoken when it comes to the correlation between fashion and size .
in 2004 , for example , he announced his irritation over a decision by swedish retailer h & m to make his designs for a one-off collection available in larger sizes .
" what i created was fashion for slim , slender people , " he said then , vowing never to work with the company again .
debate has become hysterical , designer says fellow german designer john ribbe was also quoted in focus , saying the current debate about too-skinny models had become hysterical .
" that 's another one of those cliches , like saying that all models take drugs and get drunk at sex orgies , " ribbe said .
" ninety percent are totally normal , well-proportioned girls with less fat and more muscle , but who also eat pizza and burgers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : starting in january , brigitte will feature " real women " instead of models according to brigitte editor andreas lebert , the average catwalk model today weighs some 23 percent less than the average woman on the street .
a few designers , however , are realizing that not all professional models have to be a size zero .
a case in point is us model crystal renn , who recently released a book entitled " hungry , " in which she details her struggle to meet the demands of agents who told her to lose weight if she wanted to work .
renn became anorexic in her pursuit to fit into the typical fashion mould before deciding that her health was more important .
now a voluptuous us size 12 , her modelling career is taking off .
she has been featured in fashion bible vogue magazine six times and walked the runway for designers such as jeanpaul gaultier .
renn is using her newfound stardom to plead for the world of fashion to recognize a multitude of beauty ideals - including women who are naturally a size two .
" all women bring something different to the table and we have to appreciate them all , " she said. dc / ap / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the decision is part of a wider debate over fashion and body image in the media .

" these are fat moms sitting with their bags of chips in front of the tv and saying that thin models are ugly , " lagerfeld said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl lagerfeld the head designer for chanel made the comments in monday 's edition of german news magazine focus .
he was responding to a decision announced last week by top-selling german women 's magazine brigitte to forgo thin professional models .
instead , brigitte 's editors plan to feature real women they say represent more relatable ideals of beauty .
lagerfeld slammed the idea as " absurd , " arguing that the world of fashion is supposed to be about " dreams and illusions . "
from 2001 to 2002 , lagerfeld displayed an iron will as he whittled some 40 kilos -lrb- 90 pounds -rrb- off his frame in just 13 months .
since then , he has been outspoken when it comes to the correlation between fashion and size .
in 2004 , for example , he announced his irritation over a decision by swedish retailer h & m to make his designs for a one-off collection available in larger sizes .
" what i created was fashion for slim , slender people , " he said then , vowing never to work with the company again .

he was responding to a decision announced last week by top-selling german women 's magazine brigitte to forgo thin professional models .
instead , brigitte 's editors plan to feature real women they say represent more relatable ideals of beauty .
lagerfeld slammed the idea as " absurd , " arguing that the world of fashion is supposed to be about " dreams and illusions . "

the weapons were sent in 2006 and were intended for local police and army personnel . arms dealers in the region told german public radio that hundreds of german weapons were for sale carrying a price tag of over 680 euros a piece -lrb- $ 1,000 -rrb- .
in 2006 , the german defense ministry shipped 10,000 old walther-p1 pistols to the afghan interior ministry to equip afghan police and army .
however , both the german government and the responsible us-led security team in afghanistan reportedly failed to properly monitor the guns ' whereabouts .
the us unit said that it only had detailed records of 4,563 pistols out of a total 10,000 . current and former afghan soldiers and police officers are said to be among those illegally selling and trafficking the pistols , some of which have ended up in pakistan 's north-west border provinces and neighboring tribal areas .
the german guns were also being traded in northern afghanistan where german soldiers are stationed .
the team of ndr radio reporters who discovered the black market guns said it 's not clear exactly how they ended up there .
" apparently , most of these pistols have n't been stolen , but were simply taken home and sold by former police officers and soldiers after they 'd left the service , " said christoph heinzle , who headed the ndr team .
" but corruption and theft can not be ruled out because neither the afghan authorities nor the us and german armed forces carry out effective controls to prevent -lsb- theft -rsb- . "
greens , police union call for investigation the 2006 delivery was carried out despite a german government principle that german weapons could not be supplied to non-nato countries .
germany 's then coalition government of social democrats and greens made an exception , but the decision reportedly only reached parliament after the weapons had already arrived in afghanistan .
the fresh allegations have prompted calls for an investigation by germany 's green party and the police trade union .
green party spokesman winfried nachtwei accused the grand coalition government , which was in power when the guns were shipped , of a " grossly negligent course of action , " and called for the matter to be investigated in the interest of german security forces and civilian experts sent to afghanistan .
" it would be truly absurd if soldiers were threatened by weapons irresponsibly delivered by germany , " nachtwei said .
joerg radek of the police union said the danger was that " such weapons could fall into the wrong hands .
it is a risk for the germans deployed there , a risk to security in the country . "
defense ministry spokesman thomas raabe told reporters in berlin on monday that officials in kabul had guaranteed the weapons would only be distributed among security forces .
he said the ministry would be investigating any unlawful sales of the guns .
" of course we 'll be looking for evidence of any wrongdoing , but i want to underscore that the afghan government is independent in its decision-making and that we 'll continue to support its efforts to build up effective security forces .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 12.10.2009 dialect poetry in translation connects regional cultures across europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franconian poetry is closely linked to the land poetry written in regional dialect helps preserve local language and way of life in a globalized world .
but a group of german and scottish poets who have translated it found out just how similar europeans are . from landlocked farms in the franconia region of bavaria to fishing villages on the coast of scotland or the shetland islands , regional dialects throughout consolidated and globalized europe are something of an endangered cultural resource . the task of preserving them goes in part to dialect poets , including two germans and two scots who have been involved in a project to translate regional verse . last year they held a workshop in fife , scotland , where they communicated through oral translators and were provided with literal " gloss " translations in both languages of each other 's poems .
today , they say the experience has had a lasting effect on how they view their poetry . ties to the land the sentiments of dialect poems are often expressed through rustic and geographically-bound language .
while franconian poets often work with imagery and idiomatic expressions based on a life of farming , the scots poets do so with a life of fishing in mind .
in some instances , this makes literal translation impossible and forces the poets to search for comparable literary devices . isabel cole organized the workshop and edits a berlin-based journal of german literature in english translation called " no man 's land . "
she said dialect is less accepted in germany as a form of literary expression than it is in scotland . " i think if people are open-minded about literature , dialects or non-standard literature , it is a real enrichment , " said cole .
" that 's something i actually miss in standard german literature .
one thing i like about germany is how many dialects there are , and how people cultivate their dialects .
they have really different ways of expressing themselves . " bildunterschrift : fishing is an integral part of local scottish culture the personal element fitzgerald kusz , a franconian poet from nuremberg , said that in translating scots poems he was surprised to discover traces of that dialect 's germanic roots .
kusz has spoken franconian since childhood and regards his dialect as an intimate and comfortable form of communication . " on one hand , globalization continues strengthen its hold , " he said , " high german , the unified language , can be heard on television in every village .
but there is , in fact , a movement among the people to keep their languages alive . " and that is one primary goal of dialect literature , he added . one of kusz ' scots counterparts , alexander hutchison , said " a shift into the dialect makes things much more personal … for me it 's just a different instrument . " although hutchison , who lives in glasgow , is not optimistic about current attempts to cultivate dialect in scotland 's schools , he said that in poetry the scots dialect is every bit as viable a form of self-expression as standard english . " if people do n't understand the dialect , they ca n't connect , " he said .
" but if they do understand it , then there 's an immediacy - a personal element - that you can not get in the parent language .
there 's just as much possibility of a lack in the parent language as there is in the dialect .
they operate in different dimensions to me . " the flip-side of globalization franconian poet helmut haberkamm , who grew up in a farming village not far from erlangen , told deutsche welle in an email interview that franconian is " deeply and unmistakably connected to my childhood and the early emotions and experiences which formed me , predetermined parts of my life , and arranged my existence . " franconian is inextricably dissolved in my person .
it is my language of emotion and intimacy , " he added . haberkamm has translated the works of shetlandic poet robert alan jamieson .
although the environments of sheltand and franconia vary greatly , haberkamm said he found striking similarities in the way nature is woven into the lives and languages of both regions . in translating jamieson 's poems , he said he wanted " to bring out the simple , gripping way these people express themselves . " haberkamm described regionalism as the " necessary flip-side of globalization , " adding that " people without an understanding of their roots and concrete values are easily manipulated . " endangered by mobility although hutchison expressed similar sentiments while speaking about his desire to preserve scots and see it flourish , he compared the dialect to a " threatened habitat , " endangered by time and changing patterns of human behavior .
having lived for years in north america , hutchison said he understands the pressures modern existence exerts on local cultures . " people move around , people move off , people do n't stay in one place long enough to develop it , " he said .
" there are new dialects springing up all the time .
if there 's enough settled community , they 'll find a language . " i 'm always wary of standardization , of people trying to impose things .
as a poet , i never want to make rules for other poets . " author : gerhard schneibel editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

can it escape the oil curse and become an example to other developing states ? in many ways ghana serves as a model among african countries .
compared to many other west african nations it has been very stable in recent years .
ghana 's peaceful election last year and the successful transition of government from one party to another this year were considered the pinnacle of the country 's progress , which was highlighted by us president barack obama 's visit to accra this summer .
but after the recent announcement by oil giant exxonmobil that it was buying a four billion-dollar stake in ghana 's jubilee oil field , the country is now facing a task that may be even more challenging than the democratic reform process it has undergone : to prove that it can not only successfully deal with a powerful multinational , but also that the windfall that is generated by what is considered to be one of africa 's biggest oil fields does n't end up in the pockets of a few insiders , but improves the wealth and well-being of ghana 's society .
" the stakes are very high , " writes ian gary , an expert in extractive industries , in a report about ghana 's oil find and its consequences for society for the international aid agency oxfam .
" while many ghanaian government officials are confident they can meet the challenge , oil 's threat to democratic development should not be underestimated . "
high stakes , big profits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exxonmobil 's bid beat out other oil giants while the stakes are high , so is the profit .
according to an estimate by the international monetary fund which is cited by gary , ghana 's government can expect revenues from oil and gas up to 20 billion dollars during the production period between 2012 and 2030 for the jubilee field alone .
so what are ghana 's chances to avoid the spell of the so-called oil curse ? " i think that ghana could really be one country which could be a positive example to the world and it could also be profitable and beneficial for the country , " claudia kemfert , an energy specialist at berlin 's economic research institute diw , tells deutsche welle .
" ghana could really profit from this deal and also from the oil market . "
what 's required , adds kemfert , is that ghana 's government puts in place a good political strategy on how it wants to use the oil revenues .
talking to deutsche welle , ulrike bickel , an energy expert with germany 's catholic relief agency misereor , is more skeptical : " we obviously see the danger that ghana could also become a victim of the oil curse , that its oil wealth wo n't benefit the people and that oil revenues just like in neighboring countries , vanish instead of being spent on health , education or sustainable social development . " while bickel points out that ghana , a country without previous experience in the oil sector , has taken positive steps such as signing on to the so-called extractive industries transparency initiative , which mandates its members to openly document the flow of revenues , she adds that it is still far too early to tell whether it will be implemented .
bildunterschrift : president obama 's visit , with ghana president john atta mills highlighted the country 's progress negative example an example that positive declarations and good intentions do n't necessarily translate into enforceable action is chad .
" before the world bank agreed to a large loan for the chad-cameroon pipeline there was an agreement that a fund for future generations would be created and that up to 70 percent of the oil revenues would be used for priority social sector developments , " says bickel .
" but as soon as the oil revenue started to flow , chad 's government , which was fighting a civil war , dissolved the fund for future generations and extended the priority sector developments to include national security .
that means the oil revenue is used to buy large quantities of weapons . " that does n't mean that agreements and declarations are n't useful .
they definitely are .
but reality eventually is the ultimate test whether those agreements are fulfilled .
ghana , say the analysts , among developing african nations , is perhaps best prepared to manage its oil wealth carefully . as oxfam expert gary wrote in his report on ghana : " oil wealth tends to erode democratic accountability .
ghana 's challenge will be to ensure that the right institutions and transparent policies are in place before oil production starts . "

talking to deutsche welle , ulrike bickel , an energy expert with germany 's catholic relief agency misereor , is more skeptical : " we obviously see the danger that ghana could also become a victim of the oil curse , that its oil wealth wo n't benefit the people and that oil revenues just like in neighboring countries , vanish instead of being spent on health , education or sustainable social development . " while bickel points out that ghana , a country without previous experience in the oil sector , has taken positive steps such as signing on to the so-called extractive industries transparency initiative , which mandates its members to openly document the flow of revenues , she adds that it is still far too early to tell whether it will be implemented .
bildunterschrift : president obama 's visit , with ghana president john atta mills highlighted the country 's progress negative example an example that positive declarations and good intentions do n't necessarily translate into enforceable action is chad .
" before the world bank agreed to a large loan for the chad-cameroon pipeline there was an agreement that a fund for future generations would be created and that up to 70 percent of the oil revenues would be used for priority social sector developments , " says bickel .
" but as soon as the oil revenue started to flow , chad 's government , which was fighting a civil war , dissolved the fund for future generations and extended the priority sector developments to include national security .
that means the oil revenue is used to buy large quantities of weapons . " that does n't mean that agreements and declarations are n't useful .
they definitely are .
but reality eventually is the ultimate test whether those agreements are fulfilled .
ghana , say the analysts , among developing african nations , is perhaps best prepared to manage its oil wealth carefully . as oxfam expert gary wrote in his report on ghana : " oil wealth tends to erode democratic accountability .
ghana 's challenge will be to ensure that the right institutions and transparent policies are in place before oil production starts . "

the deal also received heavy criticism from azerbaijan over unsolved armenian-azeri territorial disputes . even though the ink has dried on the protocols signed by the foreign ministers of turkey and armenia , there is no guarantee that the parties will or can make the agreements a reality .
indeed , turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan was first out of the gate with a cautionary note .
" we want all the borders to be opened at the same time ... , but as long as armenia has not withdrawn from azerbaijani territory that it is occupying , turkey can not have a positive attitude on this subject , " said erdogan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nagorno-karabakh dispute puts the deal at risk in the late 1980 's , as the soviet union was dissolving , violence broke out in the ethnic armenian enclave of nagorno-karabakh within azerbaijan 's internationally recognized borders .
in 1993 a war broke out when armenia sent in troops to support the ethnic armenians and they drove azeri troops from seven districts next to nagorno-karabakh .
they have remained there ever since .
azerbaijan condemns accord in support of the turkic speaking azeris , turkey closed its border with armenia when armenia went into azerbaijan .
hence ankara 's insistence that armenia pull out of azerbaijan before the protocols can be ratified in the turkish parliament .
in azerbaijan , the foreign ministry issued a statement saying that the accords should not have been signed while nagorno-karabakh is still occupied .
" the normalization of relations between turkey and armenia before the withdrawal of armenian troops from occupied azeri territory is in direct contradiction to the national interests of azerbaijan , " said the statement .
by all accounts , the signing was an historic event .
nearly a year in the making , discretely abetted by the swiss .
however , the signing ceremony for the protocols that pledge to establish diplomatic relations , open borders and to set up an historic commission to investigate armenian deaths in world war i , almost fell through when the parties disagreed over some of the wording in the statements to be delivered at the end of the signing ceremony .
protests around the world the agreement between the two countries has sparked widespread controversy .
some 10,000 people marched in the armenian capital yerevan to protest the agreement .
they are part of a global protest movement that fears the signing of the protocols will lessen the emphasis on the mass killings of armenians during world war i. bildunterschrift : the deal between turkey and armenia include a provision to set up a historical commission to investigate the events of world war i. yerevan claims that during the war , the ottoman turks committed genocide by killing more than a million armenians and wants ankara to acknowledge it .
turkey admits that there were deaths , but vehemently deny that the number of dead approach the threshold of the definition for genocide .

but a group of german and scottish poets who have translated it found out just how similar europeans are . from landlocked farms in the franconia region of bavaria to fishing villages on the coast of scotland or the shetland islands , regional dialects throughout consolidated and globalized europe are something of an endangered cultural resource . the task of preserving them goes in part to dialect poets , including two germans and two scots who have been involved in a project to translate regional verse . last year they held a workshop in fife , scotland , where they communicated through oral translators and were provided with literal " gloss " translations in both languages of each other 's poems .
today , they say the experience has had a lasting effect on how they view their poetry . ties to the land the sentiments of dialect poems are often expressed through rustic and geographically-bound language .
while franconian poets often work with imagery and idiomatic expressions based on a life of farming , the scots poets do so with a life of fishing in mind .
in some instances , this makes literal translation impossible and forces the poets to search for comparable literary devices . isabel cole organized the workshop and edits a berlin-based journal of german literature in english translation called " no man 's land . "
she said dialect is less accepted in germany as a form of literary expression than it is in scotland . " i think if people are open-minded about literature , dialects or non-standard literature , it is a real enrichment , " said cole .
" that 's something i actually miss in standard german literature .
one thing i like about germany is how many dialects there are , and how people cultivate their dialects .
they have really different ways of expressing themselves . " bildunterschrift : fishing is an integral part of local scottish culture the personal element fitzgerald kusz , a franconian poet from nuremberg , said that in translating scots poems he was surprised to discover traces of that dialect 's germanic roots .
kusz has spoken franconian since childhood and regards his dialect as an intimate and comfortable form of communication . " on one hand , globalization continues strengthen its hold , " he said , " high german , the unified language , can be heard on television in every village .
but there is , in fact , a movement among the people to keep their languages alive . " and that is one primary goal of dialect literature , he added . one of kusz ' scots counterparts , alexander hutchison , said " a shift into the dialect makes things much more personal … for me it 's just a different instrument . " although hutchison , who lives in glasgow , is not optimistic about current attempts to cultivate dialect in scotland 's schools , he said that in poetry the scots dialect is every bit as viable a form of self-expression as standard english . " if people do n't understand the dialect , they ca n't connect , " he said .
" but if they do understand it , then there 's an immediacy - a personal element - that you can not get in the parent language .
there 's just as much possibility of a lack in the parent language as there is in the dialect .
they operate in different dimensions to me . " the flip-side of globalization franconian poet helmut haberkamm , who grew up in a farming village not far from erlangen , told deutsche welle in an email interview that franconian is " deeply and unmistakably connected to my childhood and the early emotions and experiences which formed me , predetermined parts of my life , and arranged my existence . " franconian is inextricably dissolved in my person .
it is my language of emotion and intimacy , " he added . haberkamm has translated the works of shetlandic poet robert alan jamieson .
although the environments of sheltand and franconia vary greatly , haberkamm said he found striking similarities in the way nature is woven into the lives and languages of both regions . in translating jamieson 's poems , he said he wanted " to bring out the simple , gripping way these people express themselves . " haberkamm described regionalism as the " necessary flip-side of globalization , " adding that " people without an understanding of their roots and concrete values are easily manipulated . " endangered by mobility although hutchison expressed similar sentiments while speaking about his desire to preserve scots and see it flourish , he compared the dialect to a " threatened habitat , " endangered by time and changing patterns of human behavior .

" logicomix : an epic search for truth " follows british philosopher , logician and pacifist bertrand russell -lrb- 1872-1970 -rrb- in his tortuous quest for the foundations of mathematics , and his search for logic as a shield from the insanity that consumed other members of his family . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " logicomix " tracks the foundation of mathematics the story uses his relationships with the great thinkers and mathematicians of the era , two of his four marriages and historical events in europe such as the rise of nazism as a backdrop for the novel 's more abstract and philosophical subject matter . unexpected success originally published in greek in the fall of 2008 , " logicomix " was a hit at home .
but its authors were unprepared for the reception in the united states and britain , where it sold out on the first day of its release in september . the novel received positive reviews from such publications as the guardian and the new york times , which described the story as presented " with real graphic verve " and " delightful simplicity .

the weapons were sent in 2006 and were intended for local police and army personnel . arms dealers in the region told german public radio that hundreds of german weapons were for sale carrying a price tag of over 680 euros a piece -lrb- $ 1,000 -rrb- .
in 2006 , the german defense ministry shipped 10,000 old walther-p1 pistols to the afghan interior ministry to equip afghan police and army .
however , both the german government and the responsible us-led security team in afghanistan reportedly failed to properly monitor the guns ' whereabouts .
the us unit said that it only had detailed records of 4,563 pistols out of a total 10,000 . current and former afghan soldiers and police officers are said to be among those illegally selling and trafficking the pistols , some of which have ended up in pakistan 's north-west border provinces and neighboring tribal areas .
the german guns were also being traded in northern afghanistan where german soldiers are stationed .

germany 's then coalition government of social democrats and greens made an exception , but the decision reportedly only reached parliament after the weapons had already arrived in afghanistan .
the fresh allegations have prompted calls for an investigation by germany 's green party and the police trade union .
green party spokesman winfried nachtwei accused the grand coalition government , which was in power when the guns were shipped , of a " grossly negligent course of action , " and called for the matter to be investigated in the interest of german security forces and civilian experts sent to afghanistan .
" it would be truly absurd if soldiers were threatened by weapons irresponsibly delivered by germany , " nachtwei said .
joerg radek of the police union said the danger was that " such weapons could fall into the wrong hands .
it is a risk for the germans deployed there , a risk to security in the country . "
defense ministry spokesman thomas raabe told reporters in berlin on monday that officials in kabul had guaranteed the weapons would only be distributed among security forces .
he said the ministry would be investigating any unlawful sales of the guns .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de fashion -pipe- 12.10.2009 karl lagerfeld weighs in on skinny models debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the recent chanel show in paris , thin was still in iconic fashion designer karl lagerfeld has defended the use of ultra-thin models on the runway , telling a german news magazine that " no one wants to see curvy women . " lagerfeld also said that the current backlash against skinny models was being fuelled by overweight women who resent being reminded of their weight issues .
" these are fat moms sitting with their bags of chips in front of the tv and saying that thin models are ugly , " lagerfeld said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl lagerfeld the head designer for chanel made the comments in monday 's edition of german news magazine focus .
he was responding to a decision announced last week by top-selling german women 's magazine brigitte to forgo thin professional models .
instead , brigitte 's editors plan to feature real women they say represent more relatable ideals of beauty .
lagerfeld slammed the idea as " absurd , " arguing that the world of fashion is supposed to be about " dreams and illusions . "
from 2001 to 2002 , lagerfeld displayed an iron will as he whittled some 40 kilos -lrb- 90 pounds -rrb- off his frame in just 13 months .
since then , he has been outspoken when it comes to the correlation between fashion and size .
in 2004 , for example , he announced his irritation over a decision by swedish retailer h & m to make his designs for a one-off collection available in larger sizes .
" what i created was fashion for slim , slender people , " he said then , vowing never to work with the company again .
debate has become hysterical , designer says fellow german designer john ribbe was also quoted in focus , saying the current debate about too-skinny models had become hysterical .
" that 's another one of those cliches , like saying that all models take drugs and get drunk at sex orgies , " ribbe said .
" ninety percent are totally normal , well-proportioned girls with less fat and more muscle , but who also eat pizza and burgers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : starting in january , brigitte will feature " real women " instead of models according to brigitte editor andreas lebert , the average catwalk model today weighs some 23 percent less than the average woman on the street .
a few designers , however , are realizing that not all professional models have to be a size zero .
a case in point is us model crystal renn , who recently released a book entitled " hungry , " in which she details her struggle to meet the demands of agents who told her to lose weight if she wanted to work .
renn became anorexic in her pursuit to fit into the typical fashion mould before deciding that her health was more important .
now a voluptuous us size 12 , her modelling career is taking off .
she has been featured in fashion bible vogue magazine six times and walked the runway for designers such as jeanpaul gaultier .
renn is using her newfound stardom to plead for the world of fashion to recognize a multitude of beauty ideals - including women who are naturally a size two .
" all women bring something different to the table and we have to appreciate them all , " she said. dc / ap / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the decision is part of a wider debate over fashion and body image in the media .

" the step of devolution for policing and justice is an absolutely essential milestone , " the us secretary of state told reporters .
" clearly there are questions and some apprehensions , but i believe that due to the concerted efforts of the british government , irish government and support of friends like us in the us , that the parties understand that this is a step they must take together . "

the weapons were sent in 2006 and were intended for local police and army personnel . arms dealers in the region told german public radio that hundreds of german weapons were for sale carrying a price tag of over 680 euros a piece -lrb- $ 1,000 -rrb- .
in 2006 , the german defense ministry shipped 10,000 old walther-p1 pistols to the afghan interior ministry to equip afghan police and army .
however , both the german government and the responsible us-led security team in afghanistan reportedly failed to properly monitor the guns ' whereabouts .
the us unit said that it only had detailed records of 4,563 pistols out of a total 10,000 . current and former afghan soldiers and police officers are said to be among those illegally selling and trafficking the pistols , some of which have ended up in pakistan 's north-west border provinces and neighboring tribal areas .
the german guns were also being traded in northern afghanistan where german soldiers are stationed .
the team of ndr radio reporters who discovered the black market guns said it 's not clear exactly how they ended up there .
" apparently , most of these pistols have n't been stolen , but were simply taken home and sold by former police officers and soldiers after they 'd left the service , " said christoph heinzle , who headed the ndr team .
" but corruption and theft can not be ruled out because neither the afghan authorities nor the us and german armed forces carry out effective controls to prevent -lsb- theft -rsb- . "
greens , police union call for investigation the 2006 delivery was carried out despite a german government principle that german weapons could not be supplied to non-nato countries .
germany 's then coalition government of social democrats and greens made an exception , but the decision reportedly only reached parliament after the weapons had already arrived in afghanistan .
the fresh allegations have prompted calls for an investigation by germany 's green party and the police trade union .
green party spokesman winfried nachtwei accused the grand coalition government , which was in power when the guns were shipped , of a " grossly negligent course of action , " and called for the matter to be investigated in the interest of german security forces and civilian experts sent to afghanistan .
" it would be truly absurd if soldiers were threatened by weapons irresponsibly delivered by germany , " nachtwei said .
joerg radek of the police union said the danger was that " such weapons could fall into the wrong hands .
it is a risk for the germans deployed there , a risk to security in the country . "
defense ministry spokesman thomas raabe told reporters in berlin on monday that officials in kabul had guaranteed the weapons would only be distributed among security forces .
he said the ministry would be investigating any unlawful sales of the guns .
" of course we 'll be looking for evidence of any wrongdoing , but i want to underscore that the afghan government is independent in its decision-making and that we 'll continue to support its efforts to build up effective security forces .

" the step of devolution for policing and justice is an absolutely essential milestone , " the us secretary of state told reporters .
" clearly there are questions and some apprehensions , but i believe that due to the concerted efforts of the british government , irish government and support of friends like us in the us , that the parties understand that this is a step they must take together . "
northern ireland 's main parties have been at loggerheads over the details of its devolution process from the united kingdom , resulting in a row which has brought its administration to a standstill with no clear resolution in sight . clinton says progress " within reach " clinton 's presence in northern ireland has narrowed the gap between northern ireland 's main parties , a step regarded as crucial to resolving the stand-off and pushing on with the devolution process .
" it will take the leaders of both communities working together to continue not only the devolution but then to make day-to-day governing a reality , and i 'm confident that that is within reach . "
the new power-sharing government of northern ireland , a landmark accord between the protestant conservative , pro-british dup and catholic socialist republicans sinn fein , agreed in principle on the transfer of responsibility from the united kingdom to northern ireland , however , differences over the details of the devolution process led to discord between the parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in march 2009 , two british soldiers died in an attack on military barracks near antrim sinn fein and the dup have been in conflict over when powers for policing should be devolved from london , the former insisting it should have happened already and the latter choosing caution and saying it will only assent to devolution with an adequate financial package in place and broad community confidence . inla lays down arms for peace the peace process , started in 1998 by the good friday agreement , ended three decades of conflict in northern ireland , in which roughly 3,500 people were killed .
its full implementation , rather than squabbling over its fine points , is vital to peaceful governance in northern ireland as stressed by clinton .
clinton 's visit comes as the irish national liberation army -lrb- inla -rrb- , a republican paramilitary group infamous for its violent crimes during northern ireland 's troubles , has signaled it 's prepared to lay down arms .

" the step of devolution for policing and justice is an absolutely essential milestone , " the us secretary of state told reporters .
" clearly there are questions and some apprehensions , but i believe that due to the concerted efforts of the british government , irish government and support of friends like us in the us , that the parties understand that this is a step they must take together . "
northern ireland 's main parties have been at loggerheads over the details of its devolution process from the united kingdom , resulting in a row which has brought its administration to a standstill with no clear resolution in sight . clinton says progress " within reach " clinton 's presence in northern ireland has narrowed the gap between northern ireland 's main parties , a step regarded as crucial to resolving the stand-off and pushing on with the devolution process .
" it will take the leaders of both communities working together to continue not only the devolution but then to make day-to-day governing a reality , and i 'm confident that that is within reach . "
the new power-sharing government of northern ireland , a landmark accord between the protestant conservative , pro-british dup and catholic socialist republicans sinn fein , agreed in principle on the transfer of responsibility from the united kingdom to northern ireland , however , differences over the details of the devolution process led to discord between the parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in march 2009 , two british soldiers died in an attack on military barracks near antrim sinn fein and the dup have been in conflict over when powers for policing should be devolved from london , the former insisting it should have happened already and the latter choosing caution and saying it will only assent to devolution with an adequate financial package in place and broad community confidence . inla lays down arms for peace the peace process , started in 1998 by the good friday agreement , ended three decades of conflict in northern ireland , in which roughly 3,500 people were killed .
its full implementation , rather than squabbling over its fine points , is vital to peaceful governance in northern ireland as stressed by clinton .
clinton 's visit comes as the irish national liberation army -lrb- inla -rrb- , a republican paramilitary group infamous for its violent crimes during northern ireland 's troubles , has signaled it 's prepared to lay down arms .
it has renounced its armed struggle , releasing a statement saying , " following a process of serious debate ... it has concluded that the armed struggle is over .

" lagerfeld also said that the current backlash against skinny models was being fuelled by overweight women who resent being reminded of their weight issues .
" these are fat moms sitting with their bags of chips in front of the tv and saying that thin models are ugly , " lagerfeld said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl lagerfeld the head designer for chanel made the comments in monday 's edition of german news magazine focus .
he was responding to a decision announced last week by top-selling german women 's magazine brigitte to forgo thin professional models .
instead , brigitte 's editors plan to feature real women they say represent more relatable ideals of beauty .
lagerfeld slammed the idea as " absurd , " arguing that the world of fashion is supposed to be about " dreams and illusions . "
from 2001 to 2002 , lagerfeld displayed an iron will as he whittled some 40 kilos -lrb- 90 pounds -rrb- off his frame in just 13 months .
since then , he has been outspoken when it comes to the correlation between fashion and size .
in 2004 , for example , he announced his irritation over a decision by swedish retailer h & m to make his designs for a one-off collection available in larger sizes .
" what i created was fashion for slim , slender people , " he said then , vowing never to work with the company again .
debate has become hysterical , designer says fellow german designer john ribbe was also quoted in focus , saying the current debate about too-skinny models had become hysterical .
" that 's another one of those cliches , like saying that all models take drugs and get drunk at sex orgies , " ribbe said .
" ninety percent are totally normal , well-proportioned girls with less fat and more muscle , but who also eat pizza and burgers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : starting in january , brigitte will feature " real women " instead of models according to brigitte editor andreas lebert , the average catwalk model today weighs some 23 percent less than the average woman on the street .
a few designers , however , are realizing that not all professional models have to be a size zero .
a case in point is us model crystal renn , who recently released a book entitled " hungry , " in which she details her struggle to meet the demands of agents who told her to lose weight if she wanted to work .
renn became anorexic in her pursuit to fit into the typical fashion mould before deciding that her health was more important .
now a voluptuous us size 12 , her modelling career is taking off .
she has been featured in fashion bible vogue magazine six times and walked the runway for designers such as jeanpaul gaultier .
renn is using her newfound stardom to plead for the world of fashion to recognize a multitude of beauty ideals - including women who are naturally a size two .
" all women bring something different to the table and we have to appreciate them all , " she said. dc / ap / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de fashion -pipe- 12.10.2009 karl lagerfeld weighs in on skinny models debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the recent chanel show in paris , thin was still in iconic fashion designer karl lagerfeld has defended the use of ultra-thin models on the runway , telling a german news magazine that " no one wants to see curvy women . " lagerfeld also said that the current backlash against skinny models was being fuelled by overweight women who resent being reminded of their weight issues .
" these are fat moms sitting with their bags of chips in front of the tv and saying that thin models are ugly , " lagerfeld said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl lagerfeld the head designer for chanel made the comments in monday 's edition of german news magazine focus .
he was responding to a decision announced last week by top-selling german women 's magazine brigitte to forgo thin professional models .
instead , brigitte 's editors plan to feature real women they say represent more relatable ideals of beauty .
lagerfeld slammed the idea as " absurd , " arguing that the world of fashion is supposed to be about " dreams and illusions . "
from 2001 to 2002 , lagerfeld displayed an iron will as he whittled some 40 kilos -lrb- 90 pounds -rrb- off his frame in just 13 months .
since then , he has been outspoken when it comes to the correlation between fashion and size .
in 2004 , for example , he announced his irritation over a decision by swedish retailer h & m to make his designs for a one-off collection available in larger sizes .
" what i created was fashion for slim , slender people , " he said then , vowing never to work with the company again .
debate has become hysterical , designer says fellow german designer john ribbe was also quoted in focus , saying the current debate about too-skinny models had become hysterical .
" that 's another one of those cliches , like saying that all models take drugs and get drunk at sex orgies , " ribbe said .
" ninety percent are totally normal , well-proportioned girls with less fat and more muscle , but who also eat pizza and burgers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : starting in january , brigitte will feature " real women " instead of models according to brigitte editor andreas lebert , the average catwalk model today weighs some 23 percent less than the average woman on the street .
a few designers , however , are realizing that not all professional models have to be a size zero .
a case in point is us model crystal renn , who recently released a book entitled " hungry , " in which she details her struggle to meet the demands of agents who told her to lose weight if she wanted to work .
renn became anorexic in her pursuit to fit into the typical fashion mould before deciding that her health was more important .
now a voluptuous us size 12 , her modelling career is taking off .
she has been featured in fashion bible vogue magazine six times and walked the runway for designers such as jeanpaul gaultier .
renn is using her newfound stardom to plead for the world of fashion to recognize a multitude of beauty ideals - including women who are naturally a size two .

" the step of devolution for policing and justice is an absolutely essential milestone , " the us secretary of state told reporters .
" clearly there are questions and some apprehensions , but i believe that due to the concerted efforts of the british government , irish government and support of friends like us in the us , that the parties understand that this is a step they must take together . "
northern ireland 's main parties have been at loggerheads over the details of its devolution process from the united kingdom , resulting in a row which has brought its administration to a standstill with no clear resolution in sight . clinton says progress " within reach " clinton 's presence in northern ireland has narrowed the gap between northern ireland 's main parties , a step regarded as crucial to resolving the stand-off and pushing on with the devolution process .
" it will take the leaders of both communities working together to continue not only the devolution but then to make day-to-day governing a reality , and i 'm confident that that is within reach . "
the new power-sharing government of northern ireland , a landmark accord between the protestant conservative , pro-british dup and catholic socialist republicans sinn fein , agreed in principle on the transfer of responsibility from the united kingdom to northern ireland , however , differences over the details of the devolution process led to discord between the parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in march 2009 , two british soldiers died in an attack on military barracks near antrim sinn fein and the dup have been in conflict over when powers for policing should be devolved from london , the former insisting it should have happened already and the latter choosing caution and saying it will only assent to devolution with an adequate financial package in place and broad community confidence . inla lays down arms for peace the peace process , started in 1998 by the good friday agreement , ended three decades of conflict in northern ireland , in which roughly 3,500 people were killed .
its full implementation , rather than squabbling over its fine points , is vital to peaceful governance in northern ireland as stressed by clinton .
clinton 's visit comes as the irish national liberation army -lrb- inla -rrb- , a republican paramilitary group infamous for its violent crimes during northern ireland 's troubles , has signaled it 's prepared to lay down arms .
it has renounced its armed struggle , releasing a statement saying , " following a process of serious debate ... it has concluded that the armed struggle is over .

larsson , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , said that although the pandemic has n't hurt the european population as much as feared , it still makes sense to be vaccinated .
" experts have told us that the pandemic will continue for some years , " larsson said .

" logicomix : an epic search for truth " follows british philosopher , logician and pacifist bertrand russell -lrb- 1872-1970 -rrb- in his tortuous quest for the foundations of mathematics , and his search for logic as a shield from the insanity that consumed other members of his family . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " logicomix " tracks the foundation of mathematics the story uses his relationships with the great thinkers and mathematicians of the era , two of his four marriages and historical events in europe such as the rise of nazism as a backdrop for the novel 's more abstract and philosophical subject matter . unexpected success originally published in greek in the fall of 2008 , " logicomix " was a hit at home .
but its authors were unprepared for the reception in the united states and britain , where it sold out on the first day of its release in september . the novel received positive reviews from such publications as the guardian and the new york times , which described the story as presented " with real graphic verve " and " delightful simplicity . " it sped up bestseller lists to occupy top 10 spots in comics , fiction and general book rankings on both amazon.com and amazon.co.uk.
it also recently hit no. 1 on the new york times paperback graphic book list . " i think the publishers -lrb- bloomsbury -rrb- were shocked , " apostolos doxiadis , who co-authored the story with computer science professor christos papadimitriou at the university of california , berkeley , told afp news agency .
" i was shocked too . " bertrand " not a mega-nerd " in searching for a narrator who would fit the novel 's context , doxiadis said bertrand russell was " ideal . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russell was n't a mega-nerd , said doxiadis born into a liberal aristocratic english family and the grandson of a former british prime minister , russell is considered one of the 20th century 's most important philosophers . he was an early advocate of sexual freedom , he was jailed for pacifism during world war i and later campaigned against nuclear proliferation and the vietnam war . " he was a political activist , a womanizer , traveler , adventurer , great talker , a wit and a dandy , " doxiadis told afp .
" he was the only one of these characters who was not a mega-nerd . " the long journey to print from initial discussions between the creators to scripting , drawing , inking and coloring , the novel 's completion took seven years - which the author called " a super-marathon . " like many other cartoon books , the album was pieced together like a movie with wall-to-wall story boards and doxiadis , who has a film-making background , acted out the characters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doxiadis was n't deterred by the unusual theme the aim of " logicomix " is " to tell a fascinating story about the history of ideas , " said doxiadis , who published a novel in 2001 entitled " uncle petros and goldbach 's conjecture " about a boy 's quest for knowledge about his reclusive mathematician uncle . " the fact that this idea looked like , to put it mildly , not a very likely idea for a comic book , never deterred me , " he said .
" in ' logicomix , ' the story i think is in some ways emblematic of much of what happened in the 20th century , with its search for certainty , for knowledge , and what often went with it , for power over life .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 12.10.2009 germany needs to improve to become a world cup favorite großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany got the result they needed when it counted germany got the job done in a relative easy group and qualified for the world cup .
but how does the team measure up to the world 's top national teams ?
deutsche welle 's jefferson chase takes a closer look . the one moment that best symbolizes the 1-0 win over moscow that qualified germany for the 2010 world cup in south africa was directly after the lone goal was scored .
striker miroslav klose celebrated with one of his trademark forward flips - and only narrowly avoided landing on his backside .
match reports in german newspapers , perhaps understandably , were full of superlatives about germany 's gutsy away win .
but that 1-0 victory was of the knife-edge variety , unlike germany 's 1-0 loss to spain in the 2008 european championships , the last time coach joachim loew had a chance to win a title .
so have germany improved enough to draw level with the spaniards or brazil ?
or are they more on a par with other large european nations like england , the netherlands and italy .
here 's a back-to-front run-through of the strengths and weaknesses of the german squad .
defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adler could become the next in a long line of stellar german national keepers the one position about which loew has absolutely no worries is goal .
24-year-old rene adler was the key to germany 's victory , making a number of world-class saves , and seems to have sealed his position as germany 's number one .
the young keeper 's most brilliant moment in moscow came in the 73rd minute , when russian midfielder igor semshov was clear on the right side and slotted a crisp pass in the direction of two teammates waiting in front of goal .
adler not only got a hand to the ball but cleverly deflected it over the end line .
and should adler get hurt , loew can call on robert enke , manuel neuer or even tim wiese who 've all proved their worth at the international level .
left back philipp lahm is arguably the best in the world at his position so his selection is a no-brainer .
interior defenders per mertesacker and heiko westermann provide a solid anchor in the back four .
youngster serdar tasci could also play a role .
the big question is right back .
jerome boateng , who made his national-team debut in russia , showed he was capable of provided some welcome offensive pressure .
but the 21-year-old also got himself sent off with a red card .
loew 's task will be to get the youngster enough experience in friendlies between now and next june that he no longer poses a risk .
otherwise , he 'll be forced to fall back on arne friedrich , who 's been mediocre at best when wearing the german kit .
defensive midfield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack is a force in midfield but germany could use a threat like russia 's andrei arshavin though not the force he once was german captain michael ballack is the lynchpin of the german squad .
the 33-year-old not only wins lots of challenges but is responsible for the opening passes for germany 's offense .
to cover ballack 's back when he presses forward , simon rolfes is a good choice .
and thomas hitzlsperger is also a more offensive option because of his ability to blast in shots from long-range .
if ballack were to go down to injury , though , germany would be in trouble .
ballack is to germany what gennaro gattuso has been to italy , and loew needs to plan , as best he can , for the eventuality that his captain is unavailable .
the problem is that no one currently on the squad or on the radar screen has the ability to fill the stopper-meets-playmaker role ballack occupies .
offensive midfield and wingers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is counting on youngsters like jerome boateng , marko marin and mesut oezil the emergence of mesut oezil represents the biggest improvement of germany 's likely 2010 squad over the 2008 edition .
the 20-year-old displayed both his pace and his eye for his teammates in setting up the lone goal in moscow that punched germany 's world cup ticket .
but after that , the quality tails off .
bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski are active but relatively inefficient players who 've never lived up their potential .
it will be interesting to see whether youngster marko marin , oezil 's equally fleet-footed teammate at werder bremen , can break into the germany 's starting eleven .
but even if he does , a comparison with the world 's top teams suggests that germany 's offensive midfield is a relative weakness .
spain are spoiled for choice with xabi alonso , xavi , fabregas , iniesta and senna .
brazil , too , can chose from nearly a dozen top-quality midfielders , including kaka , whose skills and creativity are far superior to any member of the german squad .
thus , as the squad stands , germany may find it difficult to come back if they go behind early in matches - something that most teams need to do if they want to take a major international title .
bildunterschrift : klose showed his age in executing his celebratory front flip - he landed on his backside , not his feet the center forward this position is one of the biggest question marks in the team .
if the russia match is anything to go by , loew could likely rely on a 4-3-3 formation for much of the tournament in south africa .
that essentially means the battle to fill the lone central forward slot is between miroslav klose and mario gomez , the same pair of players contesting the same position at their mutual club bayern munich .
for now klose , who will be 32 years old next summer , gets the nod because he , in contrast to gomez , has been effective for the national squad in the past .
but he 's clearly lost a bit of athleticism , so in his heart of hearts , loew might well prefer the 24-year-old gomez .
loew choice will probably be influenced by how much playing time the two strikers get at bayern munich .
however that situation turns out , though , what loew does n't have is a center forward who can create goal opportunities for himself a la wayne rooney for england or thierry henry for france .
that means that germany could have trouble against other defensively oriented teams like italy .
as one of the best teams at the back in the world , germany could certainly fly high in south africa , and no nation will relish facing them .
but their creative deficiencies at the front also mean that loew 's men , if they face tough opponents early on , could end up smack on their backsides .

dw-world.de the young man with a deadly left foot at first , some said he was too small to be taken seriously as a professional soccer player .
now , mesut oezil has proven himself as one of the big boys on germany 's national team .
-lrb- 11.10.2009 -rrb- germany beats russia to gain spot in world cup even playing one man short for the last twenty minutes , germany managed a win against russia in moscow and will now play in the 2010 world cup in south africa .
-lrb- 10.10.2009 -rrb- is germany heading for a fall on artificial turf ?

but how does the team measure up to the world 's top national teams ?
deutsche welle 's jefferson chase takes a closer look . the one moment that best symbolizes the 1-0 win over moscow that qualified germany for the 2010 world cup in south africa was directly after the lone goal was scored .
striker miroslav klose celebrated with one of his trademark forward flips - and only narrowly avoided landing on his backside .
match reports in german newspapers , perhaps understandably , were full of superlatives about germany 's gutsy away win .
but that 1-0 victory was of the knife-edge variety , unlike germany 's 1-0 loss to spain in the 2008 european championships , the last time coach joachim loew had a chance to win a title .
so have germany improved enough to draw level with the spaniards or brazil ?
or are they more on a par with other large european nations like england , the netherlands and italy .
here 's a back-to-front run-through of the strengths and weaknesses of the german squad .
defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adler could become the next in a long line of stellar german national keepers the one position about which loew has absolutely no worries is goal .
24-year-old rene adler was the key to germany 's victory , making a number of world-class saves , and seems to have sealed his position as germany 's number one .
the young keeper 's most brilliant moment in moscow came in the 73rd minute , when russian midfielder igor semshov was clear on the right side and slotted a crisp pass in the direction of two teammates waiting in front of goal .
adler not only got a hand to the ball but cleverly deflected it over the end line .
and should adler get hurt , loew can call on robert enke , manuel neuer or even tim wiese who 've all proved their worth at the international level .
left back philipp lahm is arguably the best in the world at his position so his selection is a no-brainer .
interior defenders per mertesacker and heiko westermann provide a solid anchor in the back four .
youngster serdar tasci could also play a role .
the big question is right back .
jerome boateng , who made his national-team debut in russia , showed he was capable of provided some welcome offensive pressure .
but the 21-year-old also got himself sent off with a red card .
loew 's task will be to get the youngster enough experience in friendlies between now and next june that he no longer poses a risk .
otherwise , he 'll be forced to fall back on arne friedrich , who 's been mediocre at best when wearing the german kit .
defensive midfield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack is a force in midfield but germany could use a threat like russia 's andrei arshavin though not the force he once was german captain michael ballack is the lynchpin of the german squad .
the 33-year-old not only wins lots of challenges but is responsible for the opening passes for germany 's offense .
to cover ballack 's back when he presses forward , simon rolfes is a good choice .
and thomas hitzlsperger is also a more offensive option because of his ability to blast in shots from long-range .
if ballack were to go down to injury , though , germany would be in trouble .
ballack is to germany what gennaro gattuso has been to italy , and loew needs to plan , as best he can , for the eventuality that his captain is unavailable .
the problem is that no one currently on the squad or on the radar screen has the ability to fill the stopper-meets-playmaker role ballack occupies .
offensive midfield and wingers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is counting on youngsters like jerome boateng , marko marin and mesut oezil the emergence of mesut oezil represents the biggest improvement of germany 's likely 2010 squad over the 2008 edition .
the 20-year-old displayed both his pace and his eye for his teammates in setting up the lone goal in moscow that punched germany 's world cup ticket .
but after that , the quality tails off .
bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski are active but relatively inefficient players who 've never lived up their potential .
it will be interesting to see whether youngster marko marin , oezil 's equally fleet-footed teammate at werder bremen , can break into the germany 's starting eleven .
but even if he does , a comparison with the world 's top teams suggests that germany 's offensive midfield is a relative weakness .
spain are spoiled for choice with xabi alonso , xavi , fabregas , iniesta and senna .
brazil , too , can chose from nearly a dozen top-quality midfielders , including kaka , whose skills and creativity are far superior to any member of the german squad .
thus , as the squad stands , germany may find it difficult to come back if they go behind early in matches - something that most teams need to do if they want to take a major international title .
bildunterschrift : klose showed his age in executing his celebratory front flip - he landed on his backside , not his feet the center forward this position is one of the biggest question marks in the team .
if the russia match is anything to go by , loew could likely rely on a 4-3-3 formation for much of the tournament in south africa .
that essentially means the battle to fill the lone central forward slot is between miroslav klose and mario gomez , the same pair of players contesting the same position at their mutual club bayern munich .
for now klose , who will be 32 years old next summer , gets the nod because he , in contrast to gomez , has been effective for the national squad in the past .
but he 's clearly lost a bit of athleticism , so in his heart of hearts , loew might well prefer the 24-year-old gomez .
loew choice will probably be influenced by how much playing time the two strikers get at bayern munich .
however that situation turns out , though , what loew does n't have is a center forward who can create goal opportunities for himself a la wayne rooney for england or thierry henry for france .
that means that germany could have trouble against other defensively oriented teams like italy .
as one of the best teams at the back in the world , germany could certainly fly high in south africa , and no nation will relish facing them .
but their creative deficiencies at the front also mean that loew 's men , if they face tough opponents early on , could end up smack on their backsides .

the deal also received heavy criticism from azerbaijan over unsolved armenian-azeri territorial disputes . even though the ink has dried on the protocols signed by the foreign ministers of turkey and armenia , there is no guarantee that the parties will or can make the agreements a reality .
indeed , turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan was first out of the gate with a cautionary note .

but how does the team measure up to the world 's top national teams ?
deutsche welle 's jefferson chase takes a closer look . the one moment that best symbolizes the 1-0 win over moscow that qualified germany for the 2010 world cup in south africa was directly after the lone goal was scored .
striker miroslav klose celebrated with one of his trademark forward flips - and only narrowly avoided landing on his backside .
match reports in german newspapers , perhaps understandably , were full of superlatives about germany 's gutsy away win .
but that 1-0 victory was of the knife-edge variety , unlike germany 's 1-0 loss to spain in the 2008 european championships , the last time coach joachim loew had a chance to win a title .
so have germany improved enough to draw level with the spaniards or brazil ?
or are they more on a par with other large european nations like england , the netherlands and italy .
here 's a back-to-front run-through of the strengths and weaknesses of the german squad .
defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adler could become the next in a long line of stellar german national keepers the one position about which loew has absolutely no worries is goal .
24-year-old rene adler was the key to germany 's victory , making a number of world-class saves , and seems to have sealed his position as germany 's number one .
the young keeper 's most brilliant moment in moscow came in the 73rd minute , when russian midfielder igor semshov was clear on the right side and slotted a crisp pass in the direction of two teammates waiting in front of goal .
adler not only got a hand to the ball but cleverly deflected it over the end line .
and should adler get hurt , loew can call on robert enke , manuel neuer or even tim wiese who 've all proved their worth at the international level .
left back philipp lahm is arguably the best in the world at his position so his selection is a no-brainer .
interior defenders per mertesacker and heiko westermann provide a solid anchor in the back four .
youngster serdar tasci could also play a role .
the big question is right back .
jerome boateng , who made his national-team debut in russia , showed he was capable of provided some welcome offensive pressure .
but the 21-year-old also got himself sent off with a red card .
loew 's task will be to get the youngster enough experience in friendlies between now and next june that he no longer poses a risk .
otherwise , he 'll be forced to fall back on arne friedrich , who 's been mediocre at best when wearing the german kit .
defensive midfield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack is a force in midfield but germany could use a threat like russia 's andrei arshavin though not the force he once was german captain michael ballack is the lynchpin of the german squad .
the 33-year-old not only wins lots of challenges but is responsible for the opening passes for germany 's offense .
to cover ballack 's back when he presses forward , simon rolfes is a good choice .
and thomas hitzlsperger is also a more offensive option because of his ability to blast in shots from long-range .
if ballack were to go down to injury , though , germany would be in trouble .
ballack is to germany what gennaro gattuso has been to italy , and loew needs to plan , as best he can , for the eventuality that his captain is unavailable .
the problem is that no one currently on the squad or on the radar screen has the ability to fill the stopper-meets-playmaker role ballack occupies .
offensive midfield and wingers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is counting on youngsters like jerome boateng , marko marin and mesut oezil the emergence of mesut oezil represents the biggest improvement of germany 's likely 2010 squad over the 2008 edition .
the 20-year-old displayed both his pace and his eye for his teammates in setting up the lone goal in moscow that punched germany 's world cup ticket .
but after that , the quality tails off .
bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski are active but relatively inefficient players who 've never lived up their potential .
it will be interesting to see whether youngster marko marin , oezil 's equally fleet-footed teammate at werder bremen , can break into the germany 's starting eleven .
but even if he does , a comparison with the world 's top teams suggests that germany 's offensive midfield is a relative weakness .
spain are spoiled for choice with xabi alonso , xavi , fabregas , iniesta and senna .
brazil , too , can chose from nearly a dozen top-quality midfielders , including kaka , whose skills and creativity are far superior to any member of the german squad .
thus , as the squad stands , germany may find it difficult to come back if they go behind early in matches - something that most teams need to do if they want to take a major international title .
bildunterschrift : klose showed his age in executing his celebratory front flip - he landed on his backside , not his feet the center forward this position is one of the biggest question marks in the team .
if the russia match is anything to go by , loew could likely rely on a 4-3-3 formation for much of the tournament in south africa .
that essentially means the battle to fill the lone central forward slot is between miroslav klose and mario gomez , the same pair of players contesting the same position at their mutual club bayern munich .
for now klose , who will be 32 years old next summer , gets the nod because he , in contrast to gomez , has been effective for the national squad in the past .
but he 's clearly lost a bit of athleticism , so in his heart of hearts , loew might well prefer the 24-year-old gomez .
loew choice will probably be influenced by how much playing time the two strikers get at bayern munich .
however that situation turns out , though , what loew does n't have is a center forward who can create goal opportunities for himself a la wayne rooney for england or thierry henry for france .
that means that germany could have trouble against other defensively oriented teams like italy .
as one of the best teams at the back in the world , germany could certainly fly high in south africa , and no nation will relish facing them .
but their creative deficiencies at the front also mean that loew 's men , if they face tough opponents early on , could end up smack on their backsides .

the problem is that no one currently on the squad or on the radar screen has the ability to fill the stopper-meets-playmaker role ballack occupies .
offensive midfield and wingers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is counting on youngsters like jerome boateng , marko marin and mesut oezil the emergence of mesut oezil represents the biggest improvement of germany 's likely 2010 squad over the 2008 edition .
the 20-year-old displayed both his pace and his eye for his teammates in setting up the lone goal in moscow that punched germany 's world cup ticket .
but after that , the quality tails off .
bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski are active but relatively inefficient players who 've never lived up their potential .
it will be interesting to see whether youngster marko marin , oezil 's equally fleet-footed teammate at werder bremen , can break into the germany 's starting eleven .
but even if he does , a comparison with the world 's top teams suggests that germany 's offensive midfield is a relative weakness .
spain are spoiled for choice with xabi alonso , xavi , fabregas , iniesta and senna .
brazil , too , can chose from nearly a dozen top-quality midfielders , including kaka , whose skills and creativity are far superior to any member of the german squad .
thus , as the squad stands , germany may find it difficult to come back if they go behind early in matches - something that most teams need to do if they want to take a major international title .
bildunterschrift : klose showed his age in executing his celebratory front flip - he landed on his backside , not his feet the center forward this position is one of the biggest question marks in the team .
if the russia match is anything to go by , loew could likely rely on a 4-3-3 formation for much of the tournament in south africa .
that essentially means the battle to fill the lone central forward slot is between miroslav klose and mario gomez , the same pair of players contesting the same position at their mutual club bayern munich .
for now klose , who will be 32 years old next summer , gets the nod because he , in contrast to gomez , has been effective for the national squad in the past .
but he 's clearly lost a bit of athleticism , so in his heart of hearts , loew might well prefer the 24-year-old gomez .
loew choice will probably be influenced by how much playing time the two strikers get at bayern munich .
however that situation turns out , though , what loew does n't have is a center forward who can create goal opportunities for himself a la wayne rooney for england or thierry henry for france .
that means that germany could have trouble against other defensively oriented teams like italy .
as one of the best teams at the back in the world , germany could certainly fly high in south africa , and no nation will relish facing them .
but their creative deficiencies at the front also mean that loew 's men , if they face tough opponents early on , could end up smack on their backsides .

but how does the team measure up to the world 's top national teams ?
deutsche welle 's jefferson chase takes a closer look . the one moment that best symbolizes the 1-0 win over moscow that qualified germany for the 2010 world cup in south africa was directly after the lone goal was scored .
striker miroslav klose celebrated with one of his trademark forward flips - and only narrowly avoided landing on his backside .
match reports in german newspapers , perhaps understandably , were full of superlatives about germany 's gutsy away win .
but that 1-0 victory was of the knife-edge variety , unlike germany 's 1-0 loss to spain in the 2008 european championships , the last time coach joachim loew had a chance to win a title .
so have germany improved enough to draw level with the spaniards or brazil ?
or are they more on a par with other large european nations like england , the netherlands and italy .
here 's a back-to-front run-through of the strengths and weaknesses of the german squad .
defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adler could become the next in a long line of stellar german national keepers the one position about which loew has absolutely no worries is goal .
24-year-old rene adler was the key to germany 's victory , making a number of world-class saves , and seems to have sealed his position as germany 's number one .
the young keeper 's most brilliant moment in moscow came in the 73rd minute , when russian midfielder igor semshov was clear on the right side and slotted a crisp pass in the direction of two teammates waiting in front of goal .
adler not only got a hand to the ball but cleverly deflected it over the end line .
and should adler get hurt , loew can call on robert enke , manuel neuer or even tim wiese who 've all proved their worth at the international level .
left back philipp lahm is arguably the best in the world at his position so his selection is a no-brainer .
interior defenders per mertesacker and heiko westermann provide a solid anchor in the back four .
youngster serdar tasci could also play a role .
the big question is right back .
jerome boateng , who made his national-team debut in russia , showed he was capable of provided some welcome offensive pressure .
but the 21-year-old also got himself sent off with a red card .
loew 's task will be to get the youngster enough experience in friendlies between now and next june that he no longer poses a risk .
otherwise , he 'll be forced to fall back on arne friedrich , who 's been mediocre at best when wearing the german kit .
defensive midfield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack is a force in midfield but germany could use a threat like russia 's andrei arshavin though not the force he once was german captain michael ballack is the lynchpin of the german squad .
the 33-year-old not only wins lots of challenges but is responsible for the opening passes for germany 's offense .
to cover ballack 's back when he presses forward , simon rolfes is a good choice .
and thomas hitzlsperger is also a more offensive option because of his ability to blast in shots from long-range .
if ballack were to go down to injury , though , germany would be in trouble .
ballack is to germany what gennaro gattuso has been to italy , and loew needs to plan , as best he can , for the eventuality that his captain is unavailable .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de classical -pipe- 12.10.2009 european orchestras start recording labels to defy extinction großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the classical music industry is changing - not yielding the classical music industry has been declared dead several times in the last few years , but it simply refuses to die .
a new trend aims to keep classical recordings from becoming a taxidermist ’ s project . methods of recording , distribution , and promotion are changing in the classical music industry , and the companies that once dominated the market have either adapted or faltered .
as estimable names in the industry fall by the wayside , new models arise . one of the most successful projects has been the establishment of classical labels by orchestras , with a focus on live recordings . while exclusive contracts with the big-name labels - emi , deutsche grammophon / decca , sony / rca , telarc / warner - became scarce , and their recording projects fewer and fewer , orchestras are inevitably searching for new ways to reach new audiences with new recordings . recording technology has advanced significantly in the last 20 years so that recording concerts live is no longer an inherently hampered way to preserve an otherwise un-replicable musical event . " recording technology is so mobile that there are no qualitative differences between studio and live recordings , " said chaz jenkins , head of the london symphony orchestra 's own label , lso live . the live experience jenkins is one of the pioneers of the orchestra-record-label industry .
he has been with lso live , the first label of an orchestra to enter the market this way , since it was founded in 2000 .
the concept of the label has been replicated by many other orchestras -lrb- often with the help of lso live -rrb- , which the london orchestra 's efforts paved the way for . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sir colin davis specializes in berlioz the goal of lso live was not to replicate what labels have done in the past , but to do something different , and , in particular , to retain the orchestra 's work in the concert hall . " with 2,000 people in front of them , there ’ s a very different energy and emotion available , " said jenkins .
" when recording companies started to rely on re-releasing recordings , the alarm bells were ringing at the lso … if no new recordings are released , then the public starts to see the whole industry as dead - a museum-culture . " but there is still plenty of interest in concerts and no decline in audiences , so there should be new recordings as well , he added . over three million records sold one of the main reasons to found the label and record around the turn of 1999 was the opportunity to record conductor sir colin davis performing one of his specialties , hector berlioz ' orchestral and choral music . davis , then lso 's music director , recorded a complete cycle and success quickly followed .
the first grammy was awarded to the label in 2002 for the recording of berlioz ' massive opera " le troyens , " which sold an astounding 100,000 copies .
that grabbed attention for the label , which has since issued some 70 albums and sold over three million copies . for lso , unlike traditional record companies , the label is not something that needs to be boosted with a marketing campaign - it is a marketing campaign . money less of an issue this fall , the classical channel of germany 's bavarian broadcasting -lrb- br -rrb- is launching br klassik , a new label for its own orchestras and choir .
the bavarian radio symphony orchestra , the munich radio orchestra , and the bavarian radio chorus now all have the opportunity to pick the finest performances in any given season and immortalize them on record . the model of lso live is behind this new venture , too , but there are significant differences .
as a public radio station , with the aid of radio license fees and a cultural mission to fulfill , the br already records all the concerts of its musical bodies . " rather than having to decide beforehand what to record -lrb- with the subsequent pressure to publish it , no matter the result -rrb- , the artists and artistic advisors can pick the best from the lot , " said br klassik 's label manager stefan piendl .
mahler and bruckner symphonies , conducted by mariss jansons , are among the first releases . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : live recordings are becoming more relevant since the cost of recording is already offset , releasing rare , artistically important works with modest commercial prospects is more feasible . sharing musical treasures the label 's motto is simple : those possessing treasures should share them . " sharing our best musical moments , and deciding ourselves , independent of traditional labels and their naturally different criteria of what makes a successful release , were sone of the main motivations behind the founding of br klassik , " said piendl . with an estimated 20,000 recordings from the past 60 years in its vast archives , the br has a few treasures to share .
the archives include memorable performances by top musicians , which were only broadcast once on radio .
three or four recordings from the vaults are projected to see the light each year . br klassik is the latest example of the beauty of creative destruction .
out of the detritus of the old recording companies , dozens of new labels are springing up with thousands of recordings , offering more choice and rarer works than were ever available before - and that nearly a decade after the declaration of the industry ’ s imminent death . author : jens f. laurson editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

leonid ivlev , a member of the central elections commission , told reporters that the ruling party had garnered almost 80 percent of seats up for grabs in the 75 regional and local elections held up and down the country on sunday .
ivlev said putin 's party picked up 107 of the 135 regional seats and 189 of the 235 seats available in municipal legislatures .
they also emerged victorious in the eagerly-watched race for moscow 's city legislature .
with 99 percent of votes in , the ria-novosti news agency reported a 66 percent win for united russia .
praise from the president the opposition communists were the only rivals to score any seats in the high-profile ballot , which only managed to attract a 35 percent voter turnout .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president dmitry medvedev praised the results in comments on the united russia party website , president dmitry medvedev told his country , which has been particularly hard hit by the economic downturn , that they had voted for the right party .
" only together can we surmount the hardships of the financial crisis , " he wrote , " and the vote obtained by united russia demonstrates that we are together and this is most important . "
he went on to say that the 30 million-strong electorate clearly knew what it wanted .
" taking account that elections in the capital are practically federal ones , we can state that in the crisis situation voters have demonstrated they stay together with the ruling party . "
claims of fraud but the liberal yabloko party , which came away from the vote completely empty-handed , has made claims of systematic vote rigging .
yabloko , which failed to reach the 7 percent hurdle in moscow 's local election , has condemned the 17-year-reign of mayor yury luzhkov , accusing him of carrying out " one of the all-time election frauds in russia 's recent history . "
on sunday , while the ballot boxes were still open , yabloko said it had received a " storm of calls " from the moscow electorate , complaining that they were unable to cast their vote because someone else had already done so using their name .
" united russia used so-called carousel voting , " said yabloko spokesman sergey mitrohin .
" this time , it was busloads of soldiers and police that they took from one polling station to another and had them cast their votes for united russia over and over .
we also have serious reason to believe that the ballot boxes were stuffed with additional ballots . "

leonid ivlev , a member of the central elections commission , told reporters that the ruling party had garnered almost 80 percent of seats up for grabs in the 75 regional and local elections held up and down the country on sunday .
ivlev said putin 's party picked up 107 of the 135 regional seats and 189 of the 235 seats available in municipal legislatures .
they also emerged victorious in the eagerly-watched race for moscow 's city legislature .
with 99 percent of votes in , the ria-novosti news agency reported a 66 percent win for united russia .
praise from the president the opposition communists were the only rivals to score any seats in the high-profile ballot , which only managed to attract a 35 percent voter turnout .

" only together can we surmount the hardships of the financial crisis , " he wrote , " and the vote obtained by united russia demonstrates that we are together and this is most important . "
he went on to say that the 30 million-strong electorate clearly knew what it wanted .
" taking account that elections in the capital are practically federal ones , we can state that in the crisis situation voters have demonstrated they stay together with the ruling party . "
claims of fraud but the liberal yabloko party , which came away from the vote completely empty-handed , has made claims of systematic vote rigging .
yabloko , which failed to reach the 7 percent hurdle in moscow 's local election , has condemned the 17-year-reign of mayor yury luzhkov , accusing him of carrying out " one of the all-time election frauds in russia 's recent history . "
on sunday , while the ballot boxes were still open , yabloko said it had received a " storm of calls " from the moscow electorate , complaining that they were unable to cast their vote because someone else had already done so using their name .
" united russia used so-called carousel voting , " said yabloko spokesman sergey mitrohin .

we also have serious reason to believe that the ballot boxes were stuffed with additional ballots . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 12.10.2009 germans criticize czech demand for lisbon treaty opt-out großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vaclav klaus wants a guarantee that czech property remains such with poland 's signature on the lisbon treaty in the bag , there is just one left to collect .
but that is easier said than done , as the president of the czech republic appears at pains to demonstrate . euroskeptic czech president vaclav klaus chose his moment well .
just hours before poland became a signatory to the much-talked about european treaty , he managed to keep the union 's eyes on him by saying he would not add his name to the pact until he was satisfied it will not destabilize national property rights .
klaus is concerned that the european charter of fundamental rights , part of the lisbon treaty , could allow the three million germans expelled from czechoslovakia at the end of the second world war to reclaim property confiscated from them at the time .
the issue came up after the fall of communism , but the czech courts have thrown out claims brought forth by expellees , and klaus is clearly prepared to go to great lengths to prevent an upsetting of that particular apple cart .
but in so doing , he is attracting much negative attention , and winning no eu popularity contests .
although relations between germany and the czech republic - which border one another - are essentially quite good , klaus 's latest demands have met with criticism in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech president vaclav klaus says he wo n't take no for an answer christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- member and parliamentary secretary for defense , christian schmidt , told the dpa news agency that it was unnecessary to play the german expellees card and that there is already a european convention of human rights .
" everything that concerns the lisbon treaty has been negotiated , " schmidt said .
" to come now , shortly before the end game with new demands , leads to the impression that he only wants to delay . "
if they can , so can we but klaus insists it is his right to demand a binding guarantee that prevents expellees from using eu laws to circumnavigate the czech judicial system .
he cited britain and poland , both of which negotiated an opt-out before the pact was signed at the end of 2007 - britain over fears that collective bargaining rights could lead to increased strike action , and poland in order to protect the values of a deeply catholic society - saying he wanted something similar for his country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president lech kaczynski signed the treaty at the weekend " i am convinced that the czech republic must at least post facto negotiate a similar exemption , " klaus told reporters , adding that he thought a " non-standard " procedure could get the job done quickly .
in order to try and convince the rest of the eu to accommodate his wishes , the czech president would first have to submit a proposal .
the alternative procedure the easier way forward could be to have eu leaders approve a declaration which is not intrinsically a part of the treaty , such as they did when ireland asked for a guarantee that the lisbon treaty would not interfere with laws on taxes and abortion .
but ladislav jakl , an aide to klaus , poured water on that idea on czech television on sunday .
he said the president would " not be satisfied by any declaration but only guarantees for every citizen , " adding that the condition was " fundamental , necessary , unbreachable . "
it is certainly problematic for the eu that klaus has waited until this late stage in the ratification process to ask to see it tweaked in his favor .
what happens next will depend to some degree on the czech parliament which is scheduled to meet on monday to discuss the latest spanner the president has thrown into the ratification process works. tkw / afp / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but that is easier said than done , as the president of the czech republic appears at pains to demonstrate . euroskeptic czech president vaclav klaus chose his moment well .
just hours before poland became a signatory to the much-talked about european treaty , he managed to keep the union 's eyes on him by saying he would not add his name to the pact until he was satisfied it will not destabilize national property rights .
klaus is concerned that the european charter of fundamental rights , part of the lisbon treaty , could allow the three million germans expelled from czechoslovakia at the end of the second world war to reclaim property confiscated from them at the time .
the issue came up after the fall of communism , but the czech courts have thrown out claims brought forth by expellees , and klaus is clearly prepared to go to great lengths to prevent an upsetting of that particular apple cart .
but in so doing , he is attracting much negative attention , and winning no eu popularity contests .
although relations between germany and the czech republic - which border one another - are essentially quite good , klaus 's latest demands have met with criticism in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech president vaclav klaus says he wo n't take no for an answer christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- member and parliamentary secretary for defense , christian schmidt , told the dpa news agency that it was unnecessary to play the german expellees card and that there is already a european convention of human rights .
" everything that concerns the lisbon treaty has been negotiated , " schmidt said .
" to come now , shortly before the end game with new demands , leads to the impression that he only wants to delay . "
if they can , so can we but klaus insists it is his right to demand a binding guarantee that prevents expellees from using eu laws to circumnavigate the czech judicial system .
he cited britain and poland , both of which negotiated an opt-out before the pact was signed at the end of 2007 - britain over fears that collective bargaining rights could lead to increased strike action , and poland in order to protect the values of a deeply catholic society - saying he wanted something similar for his country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president lech kaczynski signed the treaty at the weekend " i am convinced that the czech republic must at least post facto negotiate a similar exemption , " klaus told reporters , adding that he thought a " non-standard " procedure could get the job done quickly .
in order to try and convince the rest of the eu to accommodate his wishes , the czech president would first have to submit a proposal .
the alternative procedure the easier way forward could be to have eu leaders approve a declaration which is not intrinsically a part of the treaty , such as they did when ireland asked for a guarantee that the lisbon treaty would not interfere with laws on taxes and abortion .
but ladislav jakl , an aide to klaus , poured water on that idea on czech television on sunday .
he said the president would " not be satisfied by any declaration but only guarantees for every citizen , " adding that the condition was " fundamental , necessary , unbreachable . "
it is certainly problematic for the eu that klaus has waited until this late stage in the ratification process to ask to see it tweaked in his favor .
what happens next will depend to some degree on the czech parliament which is scheduled to meet on monday to discuss the latest spanner the president has thrown into the ratification process works. tkw / afp / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but that is easier said than done , as the president of the czech republic appears at pains to demonstrate . euroskeptic czech president vaclav klaus chose his moment well .
just hours before poland became a signatory to the much-talked about european treaty , he managed to keep the union 's eyes on him by saying he would not add his name to the pact until he was satisfied it will not destabilize national property rights .
klaus is concerned that the european charter of fundamental rights , part of the lisbon treaty , could allow the three million germans expelled from czechoslovakia at the end of the second world war to reclaim property confiscated from them at the time .
the issue came up after the fall of communism , but the czech courts have thrown out claims brought forth by expellees , and klaus is clearly prepared to go to great lengths to prevent an upsetting of that particular apple cart .
but in so doing , he is attracting much negative attention , and winning no eu popularity contests .
although relations between germany and the czech republic - which border one another - are essentially quite good , klaus 's latest demands have met with criticism in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech president vaclav klaus says he wo n't take no for an answer christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- member and parliamentary secretary for defense , christian schmidt , told the dpa news agency that it was unnecessary to play the german expellees card and that there is already a european convention of human rights .
" everything that concerns the lisbon treaty has been negotiated , " schmidt said .
" to come now , shortly before the end game with new demands , leads to the impression that he only wants to delay . "
if they can , so can we but klaus insists it is his right to demand a binding guarantee that prevents expellees from using eu laws to circumnavigate the czech judicial system .
he cited britain and poland , both of which negotiated an opt-out before the pact was signed at the end of 2007 - britain over fears that collective bargaining rights could lead to increased strike action , and poland in order to protect the values of a deeply catholic society - saying he wanted something similar for his country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president lech kaczynski signed the treaty at the weekend " i am convinced that the czech republic must at least post facto negotiate a similar exemption , " klaus told reporters , adding that he thought a " non-standard " procedure could get the job done quickly .
in order to try and convince the rest of the eu to accommodate his wishes , the czech president would first have to submit a proposal .
the alternative procedure the easier way forward could be to have eu leaders approve a declaration which is not intrinsically a part of the treaty , such as they did when ireland asked for a guarantee that the lisbon treaty would not interfere with laws on taxes and abortion .
but ladislav jakl , an aide to klaus , poured water on that idea on czech television on sunday .
he said the president would " not be satisfied by any declaration but only guarantees for every citizen , " adding that the condition was " fundamental , necessary , unbreachable . "
it is certainly problematic for the eu that klaus has waited until this late stage in the ratification process to ask to see it tweaked in his favor .
what happens next will depend to some degree on the czech parliament which is scheduled to meet on monday to discuss the latest spanner the president has thrown into the ratification process works. tkw / afp / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the weapons were sent in 2006 and were intended for local police and army personnel . arms dealers in the region told german public radio that hundreds of german weapons were for sale carrying a price tag of over 680 euros a piece -lrb- $ 1,000 -rrb- .
in 2006 , the german defense ministry shipped 10,000 old walther-p1 pistols to the afghan interior ministry to equip afghan police and army .
however , both the german government and the responsible us-led security team in afghanistan reportedly failed to properly monitor the guns ' whereabouts .
the us unit said that it only had detailed records of 4,563 pistols out of a total 10,000 . current and former afghan soldiers and police officers are said to be among those illegally selling and trafficking the pistols , some of which have ended up in pakistan 's north-west border provinces and neighboring tribal areas .
the german guns were also being traded in northern afghanistan where german soldiers are stationed .
the team of ndr radio reporters who discovered the black market guns said it 's not clear exactly how they ended up there .
" apparently , most of these pistols have n't been stolen , but were simply taken home and sold by former police officers and soldiers after they 'd left the service , " said christoph heinzle , who headed the ndr team .
" but corruption and theft can not be ruled out because neither the afghan authorities nor the us and german armed forces carry out effective controls to prevent -lsb- theft -rsb- . "
greens , police union call for investigation the 2006 delivery was carried out despite a german government principle that german weapons could not be supplied to non-nato countries .
germany 's then coalition government of social democrats and greens made an exception , but the decision reportedly only reached parliament after the weapons had already arrived in afghanistan .
the fresh allegations have prompted calls for an investigation by germany 's green party and the police trade union .
green party spokesman winfried nachtwei accused the grand coalition government , which was in power when the guns were shipped , of a " grossly negligent course of action , " and called for the matter to be investigated in the interest of german security forces and civilian experts sent to afghanistan .
" it would be truly absurd if soldiers were threatened by weapons irresponsibly delivered by germany , " nachtwei said .
joerg radek of the police union said the danger was that " such weapons could fall into the wrong hands .
it is a risk for the germans deployed there , a risk to security in the country . "
defense ministry spokesman thomas raabe told reporters in berlin on monday that officials in kabul had guaranteed the weapons would only be distributed among security forces .
he said the ministry would be investigating any unlawful sales of the guns .
" of course we 'll be looking for evidence of any wrongdoing , but i want to underscore that the afghan government is independent in its decision-making and that we 'll continue to support its efforts to build up effective security forces .

" logicomix : an epic search for truth " follows british philosopher , logician and pacifist bertrand russell -lrb- 1872-1970 -rrb- in his tortuous quest for the foundations of mathematics , and his search for logic as a shield from the insanity that consumed other members of his family . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " logicomix " tracks the foundation of mathematics the story uses his relationships with the great thinkers and mathematicians of the era , two of his four marriages and historical events in europe such as the rise of nazism as a backdrop for the novel 's more abstract and philosophical subject matter . unexpected success originally published in greek in the fall of 2008 , " logicomix " was a hit at home .
but its authors were unprepared for the reception in the united states and britain , where it sold out on the first day of its release in september . the novel received positive reviews from such publications as the guardian and the new york times , which described the story as presented " with real graphic verve " and " delightful simplicity . " it sped up bestseller lists to occupy top 10 spots in comics , fiction and general book rankings on both amazon.com and amazon.co.uk.
it also recently hit no. 1 on the new york times paperback graphic book list . " i think the publishers -lrb- bloomsbury -rrb- were shocked , " apostolos doxiadis , who co-authored the story with computer science professor christos papadimitriou at the university of california , berkeley , told afp news agency .

the deal also received heavy criticism from azerbaijan over unsolved armenian-azeri territorial disputes . even though the ink has dried on the protocols signed by the foreign ministers of turkey and armenia , there is no guarantee that the parties will or can make the agreements a reality .
indeed , turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan was first out of the gate with a cautionary note .
" we want all the borders to be opened at the same time ... , but as long as armenia has not withdrawn from azerbaijani territory that it is occupying , turkey can not have a positive attitude on this subject , " said erdogan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nagorno-karabakh dispute puts the deal at risk in the late 1980 's , as the soviet union was dissolving , violence broke out in the ethnic armenian enclave of nagorno-karabakh within azerbaijan 's internationally recognized borders .
in 1993 a war broke out when armenia sent in troops to support the ethnic armenians and they drove azeri troops from seven districts next to nagorno-karabakh .
they have remained there ever since .
azerbaijan condemns accord in support of the turkic speaking azeris , turkey closed its border with armenia when armenia went into azerbaijan .
hence ankara 's insistence that armenia pull out of azerbaijan before the protocols can be ratified in the turkish parliament .
in azerbaijan , the foreign ministry issued a statement saying that the accords should not have been signed while nagorno-karabakh is still occupied .
" the normalization of relations between turkey and armenia before the withdrawal of armenian troops from occupied azeri territory is in direct contradiction to the national interests of azerbaijan , " said the statement .
by all accounts , the signing was an historic event .
nearly a year in the making , discretely abetted by the swiss .
however , the signing ceremony for the protocols that pledge to establish diplomatic relations , open borders and to set up an historic commission to investigate armenian deaths in world war i , almost fell through when the parties disagreed over some of the wording in the statements to be delivered at the end of the signing ceremony .
protests around the world the agreement between the two countries has sparked widespread controversy .
some 10,000 people marched in the armenian capital yerevan to protest the agreement .
they are part of a global protest movement that fears the signing of the protocols will lessen the emphasis on the mass killings of armenians during world war i. bildunterschrift : the deal between turkey and armenia include a provision to set up a historical commission to investigate the events of world war i. yerevan claims that during the war , the ottoman turks committed genocide by killing more than a million armenians and wants ankara to acknowledge it .
turkey admits that there were deaths , but vehemently deny that the number of dead approach the threshold of the definition for genocide .

leonid ivlev , a member of the central elections commission , told reporters that the ruling party had garnered almost 80 percent of seats up for grabs in the 75 regional and local elections held up and down the country on sunday .
ivlev said putin 's party picked up 107 of the 135 regional seats and 189 of the 235 seats available in municipal legislatures .
they also emerged victorious in the eagerly-watched race for moscow 's city legislature .
with 99 percent of votes in , the ria-novosti news agency reported a 66 percent win for united russia .
praise from the president the opposition communists were the only rivals to score any seats in the high-profile ballot , which only managed to attract a 35 percent voter turnout .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president dmitry medvedev praised the results in comments on the united russia party website , president dmitry medvedev told his country , which has been particularly hard hit by the economic downturn , that they had voted for the right party .
" only together can we surmount the hardships of the financial crisis , " he wrote , " and the vote obtained by united russia demonstrates that we are together and this is most important . "
he went on to say that the 30 million-strong electorate clearly knew what it wanted .
" taking account that elections in the capital are practically federal ones , we can state that in the crisis situation voters have demonstrated they stay together with the ruling party . "
claims of fraud but the liberal yabloko party , which came away from the vote completely empty-handed , has made claims of systematic vote rigging .
yabloko , which failed to reach the 7 percent hurdle in moscow 's local election , has condemned the 17-year-reign of mayor yury luzhkov , accusing him of carrying out " one of the all-time election frauds in russia 's recent history . "
on sunday , while the ballot boxes were still open , yabloko said it had received a " storm of calls " from the moscow electorate , complaining that they were unable to cast their vote because someone else had already done so using their name .
" united russia used so-called carousel voting , " said yabloko spokesman sergey mitrohin .
" this time , it was busloads of soldiers and police that they took from one polling station to another and had them cast their votes for united russia over and over .
we also have serious reason to believe that the ballot boxes were stuffed with additional ballots . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition parties say they will contest moscow 's municipal ballot yabloko and communist party representatives have already said they will contest the results of the municipal poll in court .
" we can not recognize these elections or consider them normal , " communist party deputy chairman vladimir kashin told ria-novosti .
the independent election watchdog golog has come out behind the opposition parties , and has said it will provide proof of fraud . earlier , head of the watchdog , liliya shibanova , lamented the lack of political competition in russia .
" medvedev says we need competition , we need a multi-party system , but election results show the exact opposite , " she said. tkw / dc / afp / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

larsson , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , said that although the pandemic has n't hurt the european population as much as feared , it still makes sense to be vaccinated .
" experts have told us that the pandemic will continue for some years , " larsson said .
" if you protect yourself , that will be protection not just for the current situation and the nearest months , but the nearest years . "
the emergence of swine flu in april led to widespread public fears , but since then , two new vaccines have been developed and concerns have abated .
but the eu wants to play it safe , and that means seeing to it that as many people as possible are vaccinated , thereby diminishing the likelihood that the disease will ever get a real grip on the population .
help further afield in that vein , larsson said she and her fellow health ministers would also debate whether it made sense to share their vaccine supplies with developing nations outside the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : handkerchiefs are not the kind of protection the eu is talking about also on monday , the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- announced that some 100 developing countries were in line to receive international donations of swine flu vaccines .
marie-paule kieny , who runs the who 's vaccine research unit , said the director general would approve a list of countries later in the day and hoped to start getting supplies to their recipients very soon .
" we are trying to have the first deliveries in november , " she said , adding that the vaccines will largely go to low income countries and will target some two percent of their population over the next four to five months. tkw / ap / afp / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 12.10.2009 germany needs to improve to become a world cup favorite großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany got the result they needed when it counted germany got the job done in a relative easy group and qualified for the world cup .
but how does the team measure up to the world 's top national teams ?
deutsche welle 's jefferson chase takes a closer look . the one moment that best symbolizes the 1-0 win over moscow that qualified germany for the 2010 world cup in south africa was directly after the lone goal was scored .
striker miroslav klose celebrated with one of his trademark forward flips - and only narrowly avoided landing on his backside .
match reports in german newspapers , perhaps understandably , were full of superlatives about germany 's gutsy away win .
but that 1-0 victory was of the knife-edge variety , unlike germany 's 1-0 loss to spain in the 2008 european championships , the last time coach joachim loew had a chance to win a title .
so have germany improved enough to draw level with the spaniards or brazil ?
or are they more on a par with other large european nations like england , the netherlands and italy .
here 's a back-to-front run-through of the strengths and weaknesses of the german squad .
defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adler could become the next in a long line of stellar german national keepers the one position about which loew has absolutely no worries is goal .
24-year-old rene adler was the key to germany 's victory , making a number of world-class saves , and seems to have sealed his position as germany 's number one .
the young keeper 's most brilliant moment in moscow came in the 73rd minute , when russian midfielder igor semshov was clear on the right side and slotted a crisp pass in the direction of two teammates waiting in front of goal .
adler not only got a hand to the ball but cleverly deflected it over the end line .
and should adler get hurt , loew can call on robert enke , manuel neuer or even tim wiese who 've all proved their worth at the international level .
left back philipp lahm is arguably the best in the world at his position so his selection is a no-brainer .
interior defenders per mertesacker and heiko westermann provide a solid anchor in the back four .
youngster serdar tasci could also play a role .
the big question is right back .
jerome boateng , who made his national-team debut in russia , showed he was capable of provided some welcome offensive pressure .
but the 21-year-old also got himself sent off with a red card .
loew 's task will be to get the youngster enough experience in friendlies between now and next june that he no longer poses a risk .
otherwise , he 'll be forced to fall back on arne friedrich , who 's been mediocre at best when wearing the german kit .
defensive midfield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack is a force in midfield but germany could use a threat like russia 's andrei arshavin though not the force he once was german captain michael ballack is the lynchpin of the german squad .
the 33-year-old not only wins lots of challenges but is responsible for the opening passes for germany 's offense .
to cover ballack 's back when he presses forward , simon rolfes is a good choice .
and thomas hitzlsperger is also a more offensive option because of his ability to blast in shots from long-range .
if ballack were to go down to injury , though , germany would be in trouble .
ballack is to germany what gennaro gattuso has been to italy , and loew needs to plan , as best he can , for the eventuality that his captain is unavailable .
the problem is that no one currently on the squad or on the radar screen has the ability to fill the stopper-meets-playmaker role ballack occupies .
offensive midfield and wingers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is counting on youngsters like jerome boateng , marko marin and mesut oezil the emergence of mesut oezil represents the biggest improvement of germany 's likely 2010 squad over the 2008 edition .
the 20-year-old displayed both his pace and his eye for his teammates in setting up the lone goal in moscow that punched germany 's world cup ticket .
but after that , the quality tails off .
bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski are active but relatively inefficient players who 've never lived up their potential .
it will be interesting to see whether youngster marko marin , oezil 's equally fleet-footed teammate at werder bremen , can break into the germany 's starting eleven .
but even if he does , a comparison with the world 's top teams suggests that germany 's offensive midfield is a relative weakness .
spain are spoiled for choice with xabi alonso , xavi , fabregas , iniesta and senna .
brazil , too , can chose from nearly a dozen top-quality midfielders , including kaka , whose skills and creativity are far superior to any member of the german squad .
thus , as the squad stands , germany may find it difficult to come back if they go behind early in matches - something that most teams need to do if they want to take a major international title .
bildunterschrift : klose showed his age in executing his celebratory front flip - he landed on his backside , not his feet the center forward this position is one of the biggest question marks in the team .
if the russia match is anything to go by , loew could likely rely on a 4-3-3 formation for much of the tournament in south africa .
that essentially means the battle to fill the lone central forward slot is between miroslav klose and mario gomez , the same pair of players contesting the same position at their mutual club bayern munich .
for now klose , who will be 32 years old next summer , gets the nod because he , in contrast to gomez , has been effective for the national squad in the past .
but he 's clearly lost a bit of athleticism , so in his heart of hearts , loew might well prefer the 24-year-old gomez .
loew choice will probably be influenced by how much playing time the two strikers get at bayern munich .
however that situation turns out , though , what loew does n't have is a center forward who can create goal opportunities for himself a la wayne rooney for england or thierry henry for france .
that means that germany could have trouble against other defensively oriented teams like italy .
as one of the best teams at the back in the world , germany could certainly fly high in south africa , and no nation will relish facing them .
but their creative deficiencies at the front also mean that loew 's men , if they face tough opponents early on , could end up smack on their backsides .

but that is easier said than done , as the president of the czech republic appears at pains to demonstrate . euroskeptic czech president vaclav klaus chose his moment well .
just hours before poland became a signatory to the much-talked about european treaty , he managed to keep the union 's eyes on him by saying he would not add his name to the pact until he was satisfied it will not destabilize national property rights .
klaus is concerned that the european charter of fundamental rights , part of the lisbon treaty , could allow the three million germans expelled from czechoslovakia at the end of the second world war to reclaim property confiscated from them at the time .
the issue came up after the fall of communism , but the czech courts have thrown out claims brought forth by expellees , and klaus is clearly prepared to go to great lengths to prevent an upsetting of that particular apple cart .
but in so doing , he is attracting much negative attention , and winning no eu popularity contests .
although relations between germany and the czech republic - which border one another - are essentially quite good , klaus 's latest demands have met with criticism in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech president vaclav klaus says he wo n't take no for an answer christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- member and parliamentary secretary for defense , christian schmidt , told the dpa news agency that it was unnecessary to play the german expellees card and that there is already a european convention of human rights .
" everything that concerns the lisbon treaty has been negotiated , " schmidt said .
" to come now , shortly before the end game with new demands , leads to the impression that he only wants to delay . "
if they can , so can we but klaus insists it is his right to demand a binding guarantee that prevents expellees from using eu laws to circumnavigate the czech judicial system .
he cited britain and poland , both of which negotiated an opt-out before the pact was signed at the end of 2007 - britain over fears that collective bargaining rights could lead to increased strike action , and poland in order to protect the values of a deeply catholic society - saying he wanted something similar for his country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president lech kaczynski signed the treaty at the weekend " i am convinced that the czech republic must at least post facto negotiate a similar exemption , " klaus told reporters , adding that he thought a " non-standard " procedure could get the job done quickly .
in order to try and convince the rest of the eu to accommodate his wishes , the czech president would first have to submit a proposal .
the alternative procedure the easier way forward could be to have eu leaders approve a declaration which is not intrinsically a part of the treaty , such as they did when ireland asked for a guarantee that the lisbon treaty would not interfere with laws on taxes and abortion .
but ladislav jakl , an aide to klaus , poured water on that idea on czech television on sunday .
he said the president would " not be satisfied by any declaration but only guarantees for every citizen , " adding that the condition was " fundamental , necessary , unbreachable . "
it is certainly problematic for the eu that klaus has waited until this late stage in the ratification process to ask to see it tweaked in his favor .
what happens next will depend to some degree on the czech parliament which is scheduled to meet on monday to discuss the latest spanner the president has thrown into the ratification process works. tkw / afp / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but a group of german and scottish poets who have translated it found out just how similar europeans are . from landlocked farms in the franconia region of bavaria to fishing villages on the coast of scotland or the shetland islands , regional dialects throughout consolidated and globalized europe are something of an endangered cultural resource . the task of preserving them goes in part to dialect poets , including two germans and two scots who have been involved in a project to translate regional verse . last year they held a workshop in fife , scotland , where they communicated through oral translators and were provided with literal " gloss " translations in both languages of each other 's poems .
today , they say the experience has had a lasting effect on how they view their poetry . ties to the land the sentiments of dialect poems are often expressed through rustic and geographically-bound language .
while franconian poets often work with imagery and idiomatic expressions based on a life of farming , the scots poets do so with a life of fishing in mind .
in some instances , this makes literal translation impossible and forces the poets to search for comparable literary devices . isabel cole organized the workshop and edits a berlin-based journal of german literature in english translation called " no man 's land . "
she said dialect is less accepted in germany as a form of literary expression than it is in scotland . " i think if people are open-minded about literature , dialects or non-standard literature , it is a real enrichment , " said cole .
" that 's something i actually miss in standard german literature .
one thing i like about germany is how many dialects there are , and how people cultivate their dialects .
they have really different ways of expressing themselves . " bildunterschrift : fishing is an integral part of local scottish culture the personal element fitzgerald kusz , a franconian poet from nuremberg , said that in translating scots poems he was surprised to discover traces of that dialect 's germanic roots .
kusz has spoken franconian since childhood and regards his dialect as an intimate and comfortable form of communication . " on one hand , globalization continues strengthen its hold , " he said , " high german , the unified language , can be heard on television in every village .
but there is , in fact , a movement among the people to keep their languages alive . " and that is one primary goal of dialect literature , he added . one of kusz ' scots counterparts , alexander hutchison , said " a shift into the dialect makes things much more personal … for me it 's just a different instrument . " although hutchison , who lives in glasgow , is not optimistic about current attempts to cultivate dialect in scotland 's schools , he said that in poetry the scots dialect is every bit as viable a form of self-expression as standard english . " if people do n't understand the dialect , they ca n't connect , " he said .
" but if they do understand it , then there 's an immediacy - a personal element - that you can not get in the parent language .
there 's just as much possibility of a lack in the parent language as there is in the dialect .
they operate in different dimensions to me . " the flip-side of globalization franconian poet helmut haberkamm , who grew up in a farming village not far from erlangen , told deutsche welle in an email interview that franconian is " deeply and unmistakably connected to my childhood and the early emotions and experiences which formed me , predetermined parts of my life , and arranged my existence . " franconian is inextricably dissolved in my person .
it is my language of emotion and intimacy , " he added . haberkamm has translated the works of shetlandic poet robert alan jamieson .
although the environments of sheltand and franconia vary greatly , haberkamm said he found striking similarities in the way nature is woven into the lives and languages of both regions . in translating jamieson 's poems , he said he wanted " to bring out the simple , gripping way these people express themselves . " haberkamm described regionalism as the " necessary flip-side of globalization , " adding that " people without an understanding of their roots and concrete values are easily manipulated . " endangered by mobility although hutchison expressed similar sentiments while speaking about his desire to preserve scots and see it flourish , he compared the dialect to a " threatened habitat , " endangered by time and changing patterns of human behavior .
having lived for years in north america , hutchison said he understands the pressures modern existence exerts on local cultures . " people move around , people move off , people do n't stay in one place long enough to develop it , " he said .
" there are new dialects springing up all the time .
if there 's enough settled community , they 'll find a language . " i 'm always wary of standardization , of people trying to impose things .
as a poet , i never want to make rules for other poets . " author : gerhard schneibel editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

police in eastern jharkhand state , where the two-day strike is most pronounced , say suspected rebels also killed two people in the pakor area .
two managers of a coal mine were gunned down during their morning walk but no-one has claimed responsibility .
india says that maoist insurgents pose its biggest security threat .
they operate in many states and say they are fighting for the rights of the poor and landless .
the rebels have called for a two-day strike in five affected states of jharkhand , bihar , west bengal , chhattisgarh and andhra pradesh in protest against " police atrocities " .
no casualties jharkhand appeared to be the most affected state with public transport suspended and deserted highways in affected areas , our correspondent salman ravi says .
also markets are shut and roads are deserted in affected areas such as latehar and palamau .
no casualties have been reported in small explosions triggered off by the rebels , the police said .
the strike comes days ahead of a planned offensive by the government against the rebels , whom it describes as the " greatest internal threat " to india .
maoists have a presence in more than 223 of india 's 600-odd districts across 20 states , according to the government .
there have been more than 1,400 cases related to violence by maoists between january and august , according to official records .
nearly 600 civilians have died over that period .
the insurgents wield most influence in areas which are mostly poor and dominated by tribes people .
they are also areas widely seen as being rich in mineral wealth which the maoists say is being handed over to corporate firms while the poor remain deprived .
indian prime minister manmohan singh said on sunday that the rise in the activities of rebels " obliges us to look at what causes this sense of alienation among certain sections of the community , especially the tribal community " .
" it could be indicative of the deficiencies in the pace of development .
we are looking at that aspect , but groups of individuals have no right to take law and order into their own hands , " he said .
last week , at least 17 policemen were killed in a battle with maoist insurgents in the western state of maharashtra .
mr singh told police chiefs last month that a campaign against the rebels had failed to produce results .

police in eastern jharkhand state , where the two-day strike is most pronounced , say suspected rebels also killed two people in the pakor area .
two managers of a coal mine were gunned down during their morning walk but no-one has claimed responsibility .
india says that maoist insurgents pose its biggest security threat .
they operate in many states and say they are fighting for the rights of the poor and landless .
the rebels have called for a two-day strike in five affected states of jharkhand , bihar , west bengal , chhattisgarh and andhra pradesh in protest against " police atrocities " .
no casualties jharkhand appeared to be the most affected state with public transport suspended and deserted highways in affected areas , our correspondent salman ravi says .
also markets are shut and roads are deserted in affected areas such as latehar and palamau .
no casualties have been reported in small explosions triggered off by the rebels , the police said .
a massive security operation against the rebels will be launched soon the strike comes days ahead of a planned offensive by the government against the rebels , whom it describes as the " greatest internal threat " to india .
maoists have a presence in more than 223 of india 's 600-odd districts across 20 states , according to the government .
there have been more than 1,400 cases related to violence by maoists between january and august , according to official records .
nearly 600 civilians have died over that period .
the insurgents wield most influence in areas which are mostly poor and dominated by tribes people .
they are also areas widely seen as being rich in mineral wealth which the maoists say is being handed over to corporate firms while the poor remain deprived .
indian prime minister manmohan singh said on sunday that the rise in the activities of rebels " obliges us to look at what causes this sense of alienation among certain sections of the community , especially the tribal community " .
" it could be indicative of the deficiencies in the pace of development .

police in eastern jharkhand state , where the two-day strike is most pronounced , say suspected rebels also killed two people in the pakor area .
two managers of a coal mine were gunned down during their morning walk but no-one has claimed responsibility .
india says that maoist insurgents pose its biggest security threat .
they operate in many states and say they are fighting for the rights of the poor and landless .
the rebels have called for a two-day strike in five affected states of jharkhand , bihar , west bengal , chhattisgarh and andhra pradesh in protest against " police atrocities " .
no casualties jharkhand appeared to be the most affected state with public transport suspended and deserted highways in affected areas , our correspondent salman ravi says .
also markets are shut and roads are deserted in affected areas such as latehar and palamau .
no casualties have been reported in small explosions triggered off by the rebels , the police said .
a massive security operation against the rebels will be launched soon the strike comes days ahead of a planned offensive by the government against the rebels , whom it describes as the " greatest internal threat " to india .
maoists have a presence in more than 223 of india 's 600-odd districts across 20 states , according to the government .
there have been more than 1,400 cases related to violence by maoists between january and august , according to official records .
nearly 600 civilians have died over that period .
the insurgents wield most influence in areas which are mostly poor and dominated by tribes people .
they are also areas widely seen as being rich in mineral wealth which the maoists say is being handed over to corporate firms while the poor remain deprived .
indian prime minister manmohan singh said on sunday that the rise in the activities of rebels " obliges us to look at what causes this sense of alienation among certain sections of the community , especially the tribal community " .
" it could be indicative of the deficiencies in the pace of development .
we are looking at that aspect , but groups of individuals have no right to take law and order into their own hands , " he said .
last week , at least 17 policemen were killed in a battle with maoist insurgents in the western state of maharashtra .
mr singh told police chiefs last month that a campaign against the rebels had failed to produce results .

her promotion to home secretary , when gordon brown became prime minister in 2007 , surprised many at westminster and she has hardly been out of the headlines since .
born in malvern , the mp for redditch , worcestershire , is a graduate of hertford college , oxford .
before being elected she was head of economics at haybridge high school in hagley and a councillor .
ms smith , who has two sons , was one of the incoming " blair babes " pictured with tony blair in the headily optimistic days after labour 's 1997 election victory .
a keen supporter of mr blair 's modernising agenda , her rise within government was rapid .
' making peace ' she became a junior education minister within two years of entering parliament , a minister of state at the department of health after the 2001 election and , in the june 2003 reshuffle , was made a department of trade and industry minister , and deputy minister for women .
in may 2005 , ms smith was appointed schools minister , before becoming chief whip in may 2006 - a role in which the bbc 's political editor nick robinson said she had been incredibly effective in " making peace between the warring blair and brown factions " .
during these years , her profile within the labour party and at westminster steadily grew , but gordon brown 's takeover as prime minister in 2007 marked a huge change in her life - and profile .
he promoted ms smith to home secretary , making her the first woman to hold the post .
the job 's previous incumbents had been dogged by a series of controversies - from the row over foreign prisoners to overcrowded prisons - which led her predecessor , john reid , to dub parts of the home office " not fit for purpose " .
pay dispute before she had time to familiarise herself with her new brief , ms smith was chairing the government 's cobra emergency planning committee in the wake of three failed car bombings in london and glasgow .
both she and mr brown won plaudits for the " cool and steadfast " way they had handled the crisis .
but she then had the task of extending the limit on pre-charge detention periods for terror suspects to a maximum of 42 days , a measure which failed after it was voted down in the house of lords .
she was also in charge of bringing in id cards , a policy which provoked furious opposition among tories , lib dems and some of her own party .
meanwhile , she became the focus of much antagonism when the government and police were in dispute over pay .
many parliamentary colleagues were angered when ms smith refused to condemn the arrest of tory mp damian green as part of a home office leaks inquiry last year .
promotion much of this could be described as the ordinary rough and tumble of being home secretary - one of the most difficult jobs in politics - but revelations of her use of parliamentary expenses were more damaging .
she hit the headlines over adult films watched by her husband - richard timney - in the family 's constituency home in redditch , worcestershire .
ms smith has apologised for " mistakenly " claiming second home allowances for the viewings , much to her - and her husband 's - embarrassment .
this comes on top of an on-going investigation by parliamentary standards commissioner john lyon into claims worth £ 22,948 in 2007-8 for the redditch home , which ms smith said was her second residence .
she claimed £ 157,631 in total allowances , details of mps ' expenses showed .
the former home secretary argued that her main home - where she spends most nights - is her sister 's house in london which she shares during the week .
these expenses revelations were a foretaste of the expenses details revealed by the daily telegraph during 2009 .
but ms smith is reportedly determined to fight on to defend her marginal seat in the next general election .

her promotion to home secretary , when gordon brown became prime minister in 2007 , surprised many at westminster and she has hardly been out of the headlines since .
born in malvern , the mp for redditch , worcestershire , is a graduate of hertford college , oxford .
before being elected she was head of economics at haybridge high school in hagley and a councillor .
ms smith , who has two sons , was one of the incoming " blair babes " pictured with tony blair in the headily optimistic days after labour 's 1997 election victory .
a keen supporter of mr blair 's modernising agenda , her rise within government was rapid .
' making peace ' she became a junior education minister within two years of entering parliament , a minister of state at the department of health after the 2001 election and , in the june 2003 reshuffle , was made a department of trade and industry minister , and deputy minister for women .
in may 2005 , ms smith was appointed schools minister , before becoming chief whip in may 2006 - a role in which the bbc 's political editor nick robinson said she had been incredibly effective in " making peace between the warring blair and brown factions " .
during these years , her profile within the labour party and at westminster steadily grew , but gordon brown 's takeover as prime minister in 2007 marked a huge change in her life - and profile .
he promoted ms smith to home secretary , making her the first woman to hold the post .
the job 's previous incumbents had been dogged by a series of controversies - from the row over foreign prisoners to overcrowded prisons - which led her predecessor , john reid , to dub parts of the home office " not fit for purpose " .
pay dispute before she had time to familiarise herself with her new brief , ms smith was chairing the government 's cobra emergency planning committee in the wake of three failed car bombings in london and glasgow .
both she and mr brown won plaudits for the " cool and steadfast " way they had handled the crisis .
but she then had the task of extending the limit on pre-charge detention periods for terror suspects to a maximum of 42 days , a measure which failed after it was voted down in the house of lords .
she was also in charge of bringing in id cards , a policy which provoked furious opposition among tories , lib dems and some of her own party .
meanwhile , she became the focus of much antagonism when the government and police were in dispute over pay .
many parliamentary colleagues were angered when ms smith refused to condemn the arrest of tory mp damian green as part of a home office leaks inquiry last year .
promotion much of this could be described as the ordinary rough and tumble of being home secretary - one of the most difficult jobs in politics - but revelations of her use of parliamentary expenses were more damaging .
she hit the headlines over adult films watched by her husband - richard timney - in the family 's constituency home in redditch , worcestershire .
ms smith has apologised for " mistakenly " claiming second home allowances for the viewings , much to her - and her husband 's - embarrassment .
this comes on top of an on-going investigation by parliamentary standards commissioner john lyon into claims worth £ 22,948 in 2007-8 for the redditch home , which ms smith said was her second residence .
she claimed £ 157,631 in total allowances , details of mps ' expenses showed .
the former home secretary argued that her main home - where she spends most nights - is her sister 's house in london which she shares during the week .
these expenses revelations were a foretaste of the expenses details revealed by the daily telegraph during 2009 .
but ms smith is reportedly determined to fight on to defend her marginal seat in the next general election .

her promotion to home secretary , when gordon brown became prime minister in 2007 , surprised many at westminster and she has hardly been out of the headlines since .
born in malvern , the mp for redditch , worcestershire , is a graduate of hertford college , oxford .
before being elected she was head of economics at haybridge high school in hagley and a councillor .
ms smith , who has two sons , was one of the incoming " blair babes " pictured with tony blair in the headily optimistic days after labour 's 1997 election victory .
a keen supporter of mr blair 's modernising agenda , her rise within government was rapid .
' making peace ' she became a junior education minister within two years of entering parliament , a minister of state at the department of health after the 2001 election and , in the june 2003 reshuffle , was made a department of trade and industry minister , and deputy minister for women .
in may 2005 , ms smith was appointed schools minister , before becoming chief whip in may 2006 - a role in which the bbc 's political editor nick robinson said she had been incredibly effective in " making peace between the warring blair and brown factions " .
during these years , her profile within the labour party and at westminster steadily grew , but gordon brown 's takeover as prime minister in 2007 marked a huge change in her life - and profile .
he promoted ms smith to home secretary , making her the first woman to hold the post .
the job 's previous incumbents had been dogged by a series of controversies - from the row over foreign prisoners to overcrowded prisons - which led her predecessor , john reid , to dub parts of the home office " not fit for purpose " .
pay dispute before she had time to familiarise herself with her new brief , ms smith was chairing the government 's cobra emergency planning committee in the wake of three failed car bombings in london and glasgow .
both she and mr brown won plaudits for the " cool and steadfast " way they had handled the crisis .
but she then had the task of extending the limit on pre-charge detention periods for terror suspects to a maximum of 42 days , a measure which failed after it was voted down in the house of lords .
she was also in charge of bringing in id cards , a policy which provoked furious opposition among tories , lib dems and some of her own party .
meanwhile , she became the focus of much antagonism when the government and police were in dispute over pay .
many parliamentary colleagues were angered when ms smith refused to condemn the arrest of tory mp damian green as part of a home office leaks inquiry last year .
promotion much of this could be described as the ordinary rough and tumble of being home secretary - one of the most difficult jobs in politics - but revelations of her use of parliamentary expenses were more damaging .
she hit the headlines over adult films watched by her husband - richard timney - in the family 's constituency home in redditch , worcestershire .
ms smith has apologised for " mistakenly " claiming second home allowances for the viewings , much to her - and her husband 's - embarrassment .
this comes on top of an on-going investigation by parliamentary standards commissioner john lyon into claims worth £ 22,948 in 2007-8 for the redditch home , which ms smith said was her second residence .
she claimed £ 157,631 in total allowances , details of mps ' expenses showed .
the former home secretary argued that her main home - where she spends most nights - is her sister 's house in london which she shares during the week .
these expenses revelations were a foretaste of the expenses details revealed by the daily telegraph during 2009 .
but ms smith is reportedly determined to fight on to defend her marginal seat in the next general election .

the centre for economics and business research -lrb- cebr -rrb- believes the rate will remain at its current 0.5 % level until 2011 and not reach 2 % until 2014 .
the report predicted the pound will weaken further , falling to $ 1.40 and " possibly " below 1 euro .
its forecast is based on the government managing to slash the uk budget deficit by £ 100bn over the next parliament .
it says that about £ 80bn of this would come from spending cuts , and a further £ 20bn from tax rises .
' policy mix ' such a squeeze on public finances would severely limit economic growth , meaning the bank of england had to keep rates low to make borrowing money affordable , the cebr argues .
" we are likely to see an exciting policy mix , with the fiscal policy lever pulled right back while the monetary lever is fast forward , " said douglas mcwilliams , cebr chief executive and one of the report 's authors .
" our analysis says that this ought to work .
if it does so , we are likely to see a major rerating of equities and property which in turn should stimulate economic growth after a lag . "
last week the bank of england held interest rates at a record low of 0.5 % for the seventh consecutive month .
the cebr added that the bank programme to increase the amount of money in the economy - so-called quantitative easing - would increase by £ 75bn from the £ 175bn so far announced .
and it predicted that the uk economy would grow by 1.3 % in 2010 - having shrunk by 4.3 % this year .
