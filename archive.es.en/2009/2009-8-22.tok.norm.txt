" i regret that the board has not after all taken a decision , " karl-theodor zu guttenberg was quoted as saying by the online edition of the hamburger abendblatt newspaper on saturday , aug .

" the gm board of directors met today to discuss options for opel , " gm spokeswoman karin kirchner said in a statement late on friday .
" no decision was taken . " an anonymous source familiar with the situation told the wall street journal that board chair edward whitacre had argued that the offer from rhj should be taken more seriously . according to the source , gm 's board opted to ask the german government for more information on state financing for a deal with rhj . gm itself emerged from bankruptcy in july after wiping out $ 47 billion -lrb- 33 billion euros -rrb- in debt in a restructuring that left it majority-owned by the us government . setback for german government 's plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magna 's stronach has already agreed a deal with opel the news is a setback to the german government and opel 's 25,000 german employees , who were expecting opel 's life-saving sale to magna to be confirmed at the gm board meeting .
economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg was quoted on thursday as expecting " a clear signal " on the future of opel to emerge at friday 's conference . magna 's bid for opel is backed by the german government , which has offered a financial incentive of $ 6.4 billion .
but germany set out tough financial requirements for gm , asking for help with dealing with opel 's possible deficit of $ 1.7 billion . chancellor angela merkel told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper on thursday that magna 's experience in the auto industry and its " better concept " for opel made it a superior buyer than rhj .
facing elections next month , merkel is convinced a deal with magna would be the best option to save jobs . complicated deal but it is precisely magna 's expertise that considerably complicates the deal for gm .
should gm approve a sale to magna , keeping only a minority stake of 35 percent , it would lose most of its influence on opel 's production and distribution in europe . on top of this , magna 's bid also includes a 27.5-percent stake for the russian state bank sberbank , with russian carmaker gaz as an industrial partner holding the option to buy sberbank 's stake .
gm 's board fears that a deal with magna would therefore create a serious competitor not only in the european automobile market , but the growing russian market .
a deal with magna would also rule out the option of opel 's eventual re-absorption into gm . the offer of financial investor rhj is much friendlier .
according to reports , rhj would allow gm to keep control of the technological side of opel , and to retain the possibility of re-acquiring its european subsidiary in a more secure future financial climate . " if you want to know why the board is agonizing over this decision , take a look at the competing spheres of interest , " summed up one commentator in news magazine der spiegel , " either gm surrenders its access to opel , or it loses the money from the german government .

a texas oil executive says his company was one of several that bought stolen mexican petroleum and sold the illicit products to large corporations including german chemical giant basf . basf spokesman daniel pepitone said the company has received a subpoena from the american justice department and is cooperating with authorities to clear up the case .
he confirmed that basf did business with trammo petroleum , but said , " we have no reason to believe that basf had any involvement in the alleged wrongdoing . " according to court documents released on friday , houston-based president of trammo petroleum donald schroeder testified that he was contacted by two fuel company representatives from continental fuels and murphy energy .
" they told me they had some mexican condensate that they would like to sell , " he told the federal court in may . schroeder admitted that he bought and re-sold the liquid hydrocarbon condensate , a substance that refiners can blend with crude oil to produce fuel and other products , knowing that it had been stolen . current investigations indicate that the condensate was tapped from pipelines belonging to the mexican oil company pemex and smuggled into the usa by road tankers .
the oil was then collected at a port in brownsville , texas , from where it was delivered to customers including basf .
pemex , which is the only legal owner and exporter of mexican oil to the us , has been struggling for years to stop an endless series of illegal taps on its pipelines . schroeder is the first to be convicted as a result of the two-year cross-border investigation into oil smuggling from mexico tied to organized crime .
he has already paid a fine of $ 2 million -lrb- 1.4 million euros -rrb- while he awaits his sentencing december . bk / ap / apa editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but this year 's celebration of the baltic way , which showed the world the baltic countries ' desire for autonomy apart from the soviet union , is looking backward in an attempt to recapture that hope in difficult economic times .

twenty years later , the former " baltic tigers " are trying to show courage in the face of recession . their hands stretching across forests and fields , standing along highways and country roads , as many as 2 million estonians , latvians and lithuanians joined in a 671-kilometer -lrb- 417-mile -rrb- human chain 20 years ago , looking forward to a better future .
but this year 's celebration of the baltic way , which showed the world the baltic countries ' desire for autonomy apart from the soviet union , is looking backward in an attempt to recapture that hope in difficult economic times .
the commemorations include exhibits and academic conferences , but the most hailed event is heartbeats for the baltics , a relay run along the baltic way route .
about 13,500 people will run in one-kilometer stretches , but organizers say anyone can join the relay along the way for any length .
the first runners left the estonian capital , tallinn , for the latvian capital of riga on saturday morning .
a second group of runners was scheduled to leave the lithuanian capital of vilnius later in the day and head north to meet the first group at riga 's freedom monument on sunday .
bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousands joined hands for the baltic way in 1989 the end of communism the baltic way human chain on aug .
23 , 1989 coincided with the 50th anniversary of the molotov-ribbentrop pact , which had divided the baltic states into spheres of influence and led to the eventual annexation by the soviet union in 1940 .
the participation of 2 million people , in a region whose population is around 7 million , would have been a significant accomplishment even if it had n't occurred under the shadow of soviet control .
" people are always looking to break records , but what we did , it was not a record attempt , " said nomeda marcenaite , who was there in 1989 .
" it was a spiritual thing , perhaps a spiritual record . "
putting on the running shoes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators along the 1989 baltic way latvian president valdis zatlers will be joining in on the last leg of the commemorative run on sunday .
the relay was his pet project , and he said that he hoped it would inspire the generation of people too young to remember the original event .
" we gave a clear signal : we are organized , we have overcome the molotov-ribbentrop pact and we are ready to go forward and be dynamic in a challenging world , " zatlers said .
" that 's the way balts do things . "
sixten sild , who helped organize this year 's event as chairman of the estonian orienteering association board , will be running three kilometers early sunday morning near the latvian-estonian border .
" i want to run there because 20 years ago that was where i stood in the baltic chain with my parents , " sild said .
his two adult sons will be participating as well .
fresh courage needed estonia and the other baltic states have been hit hard by the global financial crisis .
the european union 's statistical office eurostat counted the three countries ' economic performance as the worst in the euro zone .
lithuania 's economy has contracted 12.3 percent over the same quarter last year , estonia lost 3.7 percent , and latvia 1.6 percent .
estonia has had to raise sales taxes and make serious budget cuts , tough decisions which ultimately led to the collapse of its coalition government in may .
in latvia , unemployment has also soared to 16.7 percent .
the world bank estimates that the number of lithuanian families living in poverty could increase by 49 percent this year .
" it is once again very important to stand together and to show that we can reduce the negative consequences of the recession , undertake greater responsibilities , and be more courageous in dealing with the challenges of our age , " said lithuanian president dalia grybauskaite. svs / reuters / dpa / afp editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i regret that the board has not after all taken a decision , " karl-theodor zu guttenberg was quoted as saying by the online edition of the hamburger abendblatt newspaper on saturday , aug .
22 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's guttenberg is disappointed by the news coming from detroit the german government had " provided gm with all the necessary information , " the minister added . the 100-year-old company , once the world 's largest automaker , is feeling the heat from the german government which wants it to sell opel to magna international , a canadian auto parts manufacturer backed by state-owned russian bank sberbank . but gm 's newly-appointed board at a meeting on friday in detroit failed to support the magna sale , backed by its executives , because of a rival bid from belgian investor rhj international . " the gm board of directors met today to discuss options for opel , " gm spokeswoman karin kirchner said in a statement late on friday .
" no decision was taken . " an anonymous source familiar with the situation told the wall street journal that board chair edward whitacre had argued that the offer from rhj should be taken more seriously . according to the source , gm 's board opted to ask the german government for more information on state financing for a deal with rhj . gm itself emerged from bankruptcy in july after wiping out $ 47 billion -lrb- 33 billion euros -rrb- in debt in a restructuring that left it majority-owned by the us government . setback for german government 's plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magna 's stronach has already agreed a deal with opel the news is a setback to the german government and opel 's 25,000 german employees , who were expecting opel 's life-saving sale to magna to be confirmed at the gm board meeting .
economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg was quoted on thursday as expecting " a clear signal " on the future of opel to emerge at friday 's conference . magna 's bid for opel is backed by the german government , which has offered a financial incentive of $ 6.4 billion .
but germany set out tough financial requirements for gm , asking for help with dealing with opel 's possible deficit of $ 1.7 billion . chancellor angela merkel told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper on thursday that magna 's experience in the auto industry and its " better concept " for opel made it a superior buyer than rhj .
facing elections next month , merkel is convinced a deal with magna would be the best option to save jobs . complicated deal but it is precisely magna 's expertise that considerably complicates the deal for gm .
should gm approve a sale to magna , keeping only a minority stake of 35 percent , it would lose most of its influence on opel 's production and distribution in europe . on top of this , magna 's bid also includes a 27.5-percent stake for the russian state bank sberbank , with russian carmaker gaz as an industrial partner holding the option to buy sberbank 's stake .
gm 's board fears that a deal with magna would therefore create a serious competitor not only in the european automobile market , but the growing russian market .
a deal with magna would also rule out the option of opel 's eventual re-absorption into gm . the offer of financial investor rhj is much friendlier .
according to reports , rhj would allow gm to keep control of the technological side of opel , and to retain the possibility of re-acquiring its european subsidiary in a more secure future financial climate . " if you want to know why the board is agonizing over this decision , take a look at the competing spheres of interest , " summed up one commentator in news magazine der spiegel , " either gm surrenders its access to opel , or it loses the money from the german government .

a texas oil executive says his company was one of several that bought stolen mexican petroleum and sold the illicit products to large corporations including german chemical giant basf . basf spokesman daniel pepitone said the company has received a subpoena from the american justice department and is cooperating with authorities to clear up the case .
he confirmed that basf did business with trammo petroleum , but said , " we have no reason to believe that basf had any involvement in the alleged wrongdoing . " according to court documents released on friday , houston-based president of trammo petroleum donald schroeder testified that he was contacted by two fuel company representatives from continental fuels and murphy energy .
" they told me they had some mexican condensate that they would like to sell , " he told the federal court in may . schroeder admitted that he bought and re-sold the liquid hydrocarbon condensate , a substance that refiners can blend with crude oil to produce fuel and other products , knowing that it had been stolen . current investigations indicate that the condensate was tapped from pipelines belonging to the mexican oil company pemex and smuggled into the usa by road tankers .
the oil was then collected at a port in brownsville , texas , from where it was delivered to customers including basf .
pemex , which is the only legal owner and exporter of mexican oil to the us , has been struggling for years to stop an endless series of illegal taps on its pipelines . schroeder is the first to be convicted as a result of the two-year cross-border investigation into oil smuggling from mexico tied to organized crime .

" i regret that the board has not after all taken a decision , " karl-theodor zu guttenberg was quoted as saying by the online edition of the hamburger abendblatt newspaper on saturday , aug .
22 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's guttenberg is disappointed by the news coming from detroit the german government had " provided gm with all the necessary information , " the minister added . the 100-year-old company , once the world 's largest automaker , is feeling the heat from the german government which wants it to sell opel to magna international , a canadian auto parts manufacturer backed by state-owned russian bank sberbank . but gm 's newly-appointed board at a meeting on friday in detroit failed to support the magna sale , backed by its executives , because of a rival bid from belgian investor rhj international . " the gm board of directors met today to discuss options for opel , " gm spokeswoman karin kirchner said in a statement late on friday .
" no decision was taken . " an anonymous source familiar with the situation told the wall street journal that board chair edward whitacre had argued that the offer from rhj should be taken more seriously . according to the source , gm 's board opted to ask the german government for more information on state financing for a deal with rhj . gm itself emerged from bankruptcy in july after wiping out $ 47 billion -lrb- 33 billion euros -rrb- in debt in a restructuring that left it majority-owned by the us government . setback for german government 's plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magna 's stronach has already agreed a deal with opel the news is a setback to the german government and opel 's 25,000 german employees , who were expecting opel 's life-saving sale to magna to be confirmed at the gm board meeting .
economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg was quoted on thursday as expecting " a clear signal " on the future of opel to emerge at friday 's conference . magna 's bid for opel is backed by the german government , which has offered a financial incentive of $ 6.4 billion .
but germany set out tough financial requirements for gm , asking for help with dealing with opel 's possible deficit of $ 1.7 billion . chancellor angela merkel told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper on thursday that magna 's experience in the auto industry and its " better concept " for opel made it a superior buyer than rhj .
facing elections next month , merkel is convinced a deal with magna would be the best option to save jobs . complicated deal but it is precisely magna 's expertise that considerably complicates the deal for gm .
should gm approve a sale to magna , keeping only a minority stake of 35 percent , it would lose most of its influence on opel 's production and distribution in europe . on top of this , magna 's bid also includes a 27.5-percent stake for the russian state bank sberbank , with russian carmaker gaz as an industrial partner holding the option to buy sberbank 's stake .
gm 's board fears that a deal with magna would therefore create a serious competitor not only in the european automobile market , but the growing russian market .
a deal with magna would also rule out the option of opel 's eventual re-absorption into gm . the offer of financial investor rhj is much friendlier .
according to reports , rhj would allow gm to keep control of the technological side of opel , and to retain the possibility of re-acquiring its european subsidiary in a more secure future financial climate . " if you want to know why the board is agonizing over this decision , take a look at the competing spheres of interest , " summed up one commentator in news magazine der spiegel , " either gm surrenders its access to opel , or it loses the money from the german government .
the question : which is costlier ? " european branches watch opel saga with bated breath bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel workers fear for their jobs if a deal is not reached the sale of opel is being keenly watched , as billions of euros in government aid are riding on the outcome , as are the jobs of thousands of opel workers in europe . apart from its 25,000 german employees in four major plants , making everything from three-door corsa subcompacts to zafira vans , there are two key opel factories that produce cars under the vauxhall badge in the uk . opel has other facilities in belgium , poland and spain . no date has been set for another gm board meeting or a deadline for a decision .
the alternative to a sale of opel would be insolvency , analysts have said . bk / reuters / afp editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a texas oil executive says his company was one of several that bought stolen mexican petroleum and sold the illicit products to large corporations including german chemical giant basf . basf spokesman daniel pepitone said the company has received a subpoena from the american justice department and is cooperating with authorities to clear up the case .
he confirmed that basf did business with trammo petroleum , but said , " we have no reason to believe that basf had any involvement in the alleged wrongdoing . " according to court documents released on friday , houston-based president of trammo petroleum donald schroeder testified that he was contacted by two fuel company representatives from continental fuels and murphy energy .
" they told me they had some mexican condensate that they would like to sell , " he told the federal court in may . schroeder admitted that he bought and re-sold the liquid hydrocarbon condensate , a substance that refiners can blend with crude oil to produce fuel and other products , knowing that it had been stolen . current investigations indicate that the condensate was tapped from pipelines belonging to the mexican oil company pemex and smuggled into the usa by road tankers .
the oil was then collected at a port in brownsville , texas , from where it was delivered to customers including basf .
pemex , which is the only legal owner and exporter of mexican oil to the us , has been struggling for years to stop an endless series of illegal taps on its pipelines . schroeder is the first to be convicted as a result of the two-year cross-border investigation into oil smuggling from mexico tied to organized crime .

twenty years later , the former " baltic tigers " are trying to show courage in the face of recession . their hands stretching across forests and fields , standing along highways and country roads , as many as 2 million estonians , latvians and lithuanians joined in a 671-kilometer -lrb- 417-mile -rrb- human chain 20 years ago , looking forward to a better future .
but this year 's celebration of the baltic way , which showed the world the baltic countries ' desire for autonomy apart from the soviet union , is looking backward in an attempt to recapture that hope in difficult economic times .
the commemorations include exhibits and academic conferences , but the most hailed event is heartbeats for the baltics , a relay run along the baltic way route .
about 13,500 people will run in one-kilometer stretches , but organizers say anyone can join the relay along the way for any length .
the first runners left the estonian capital , tallinn , for the latvian capital of riga on saturday morning .
a second group of runners was scheduled to leave the lithuanian capital of vilnius later in the day and head north to meet the first group at riga 's freedom monument on sunday .
bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousands joined hands for the baltic way in 1989 the end of communism the baltic way human chain on aug .
23 , 1989 coincided with the 50th anniversary of the molotov-ribbentrop pact , which had divided the baltic states into spheres of influence and led to the eventual annexation by the soviet union in 1940 .
the participation of 2 million people , in a region whose population is around 7 million , would have been a significant accomplishment even if it had n't occurred under the shadow of soviet control .
" people are always looking to break records , but what we did , it was not a record attempt , " said nomeda marcenaite , who was there in 1989 .
" it was a spiritual thing , perhaps a spiritual record . "
putting on the running shoes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators along the 1989 baltic way latvian president valdis zatlers will be joining in on the last leg of the commemorative run on sunday .
the relay was his pet project , and he said that he hoped it would inspire the generation of people too young to remember the original event .
" we gave a clear signal : we are organized , we have overcome the molotov-ribbentrop pact and we are ready to go forward and be dynamic in a challenging world , " zatlers said .
" that 's the way balts do things . "
sixten sild , who helped organize this year 's event as chairman of the estonian orienteering association board , will be running three kilometers early sunday morning near the latvian-estonian border .
" i want to run there because 20 years ago that was where i stood in the baltic chain with my parents , " sild said .
his two adult sons will be participating as well .
fresh courage needed estonia and the other baltic states have been hit hard by the global financial crisis .
the european union 's statistical office eurostat counted the three countries ' economic performance as the worst in the euro zone .
lithuania 's economy has contracted 12.3 percent over the same quarter last year , estonia lost 3.7 percent , and latvia 1.6 percent .
estonia has had to raise sales taxes and make serious budget cuts , tough decisions which ultimately led to the collapse of its coalition government in may .
in latvia , unemployment has also soared to 16.7 percent .
the world bank estimates that the number of lithuanian families living in poverty could increase by 49 percent this year .
" it is once again very important to stand together and to show that we can reduce the negative consequences of the recession , undertake greater responsibilities , and be more courageous in dealing with the challenges of our age , " said lithuanian president dalia grybauskaite. svs / reuters / dpa / afp editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in hungary , presidential spokeswoman szilvia szotak told the local news agency mti that solyom would not enter slovak territory .
" he will make a statement on the hungarian side of the border , " she said .
august 21 is remembered here as the day in 1968 when what was then czechoslovakia was occupied by warsaw pact troops - including hungary 's - to crush the " prague spring " reform drive by the country 's communist leadership .
solyom was scheduled to attend the unveiling of a statue of stephen , a medieval king of hungary , in the southern slovak town of komarno .
the hungarian town of komarom lies on the southern bank of the river danube , which marks the two countries ' border .
hungarians make up 10 percent of slovakia 's population of 5.4 million people , mostly living along the frontier .
" komarno lies in slovakia 's territory , it 's not a hungarian town , " slovak prime minister robert fico told reporters earlier friday , adding that solyom would be welcome at any other time , but that coming on august 21 was " mere provocation " .
" he wants to spark a conflict , we want to avoid it , " fico insisted .
hungarian president barred fico had said that the slovak foreign ministry had handed a diplomatic note to the hungarian ambassador saying slovakia would not let solyom in .
" if he decides to ignore the note it would be a violation of international law and slovakia 's sovereignty , " fico warned .
" we wo n't prevent him from crossing the border by force .
we want to behave in a diplomatic way , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fico accused solyom of wanting to start a conflict on tuesday , fico , slovak president ivan gasparovic and parliamentary speaker pavol paska had issued a sharply-worded joint statement saying solyom would not be welcome in slovakia and described his planned trip as " insensitive and tactless " .
solyom was invited by komarno mayor tibor bastrnak , who is a member of slovakia 's opposition ethnic-hungarian smk party .
critics have noted that the mayor failed to invite slovak leaders , allegedly paving the way for the dispute - but in tuesday 's statement , the leaders had also blasted solyom for allegedly failing to show any interest in meeting with them .
the past is deeply sensitive for slovakia , which was ruled by hungary for centuries and has only been an independent state since czechoslovakia split in 1993 . but the spat also hinges on a present-day dispute .
hungary has protested to the united nations over slovakia 's new language law , which it dubs discriminatory to the hungarian minority - a move blasted by slovakia 's leaders .
the law slaps fines of up to 5,000 euros -lrb- $ 7,000 -rrb- on the use of minority languages in government and other public services .
ties between the two ex-soviet bloc neighbors , both of whom joined the european union in 2004 , have been tense since 2006 when the far-right sns party , known for its antipathy towards minorities , entered the government steered by fico 's left-wing populist smer party .

" free was not the case in some parts of the territory due to terror installed , " eu chief election observer philippe morillon told reporters .
" fair - generally what we have observed was considered by our observers with our methodology good and fair , " he added , stressing it was still early days in assessing the presidential and provincial council elections .
the election , which took place on thursday , has been widely hailed as a success by the international community , which has pumped billions into afghanistan and deployed 100,000 troops to contain a taliban insurgency .
" we can say it is a victory , a victory for the afghan people , " morillon told a news conference in kabul .
turnout high in north , low in south bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : morillon said attacks had prevented some casting their votes the eu election observation mission to afghanistan said in a statement based on its preliminary findings that participation was " considerably higher in the north of the country and particularly low in the south . "
" election day was marred by a number of violent incidents , including rocket attacks and explosions targeting polling centres and government facilities throughout the country , " the statement said .
the taliban call on afghans to boycott the vote was " supplemented by an increasing number of attacks , resulting in civilian injuries and deaths . "

in hungary , presidential spokeswoman szilvia szotak told the local news agency mti that solyom would not enter slovak territory .
" he will make a statement on the hungarian side of the border , " she said .
august 21 is remembered here as the day in 1968 when what was then czechoslovakia was occupied by warsaw pact troops - including hungary 's - to crush the " prague spring " reform drive by the country 's communist leadership .
solyom was scheduled to attend the unveiling of a statue of stephen , a medieval king of hungary , in the southern slovak town of komarno .
the hungarian town of komarom lies on the southern bank of the river danube , which marks the two countries ' border .
hungarians make up 10 percent of slovakia 's population of 5.4 million people , mostly living along the frontier .
" komarno lies in slovakia 's territory , it 's not a hungarian town , " slovak prime minister robert fico told reporters earlier friday , adding that solyom would be welcome at any other time , but that coming on august 21 was " mere provocation " .
" he wants to spark a conflict , we want to avoid it , " fico insisted .
hungarian president barred fico had said that the slovak foreign ministry had handed a diplomatic note to the hungarian ambassador saying slovakia would not let solyom in .
" if he decides to ignore the note it would be a violation of international law and slovakia 's sovereignty , " fico warned .
" we wo n't prevent him from crossing the border by force .
we want to behave in a diplomatic way , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fico accused solyom of wanting to start a conflict on tuesday , fico , slovak president ivan gasparovic and parliamentary speaker pavol paska had issued a sharply-worded joint statement saying solyom would not be welcome in slovakia and described his planned trip as " insensitive and tactless " .
solyom was invited by komarno mayor tibor bastrnak , who is a member of slovakia 's opposition ethnic-hungarian smk party .
critics have noted that the mayor failed to invite slovak leaders , allegedly paving the way for the dispute - but in tuesday 's statement , the leaders had also blasted solyom for allegedly failing to show any interest in meeting with them .
the past is deeply sensitive for slovakia , which was ruled by hungary for centuries and has only been an independent state since czechoslovakia split in 1993 . but the spat also hinges on a present-day dispute .
hungary has protested to the united nations over slovakia 's new language law , which it dubs discriminatory to the hungarian minority - a move blasted by slovakia 's leaders .

a texas oil executive says his company was one of several that bought stolen mexican petroleum and sold the illicit products to large corporations including german chemical giant basf . basf spokesman daniel pepitone said the company has received a subpoena from the american justice department and is cooperating with authorities to clear up the case .
he confirmed that basf did business with trammo petroleum , but said , " we have no reason to believe that basf had any involvement in the alleged wrongdoing . " according to court documents released on friday , houston-based president of trammo petroleum donald schroeder testified that he was contacted by two fuel company representatives from continental fuels and murphy energy .
" they told me they had some mexican condensate that they would like to sell , " he told the federal court in may . schroeder admitted that he bought and re-sold the liquid hydrocarbon condensate , a substance that refiners can blend with crude oil to produce fuel and other products , knowing that it had been stolen . current investigations indicate that the condensate was tapped from pipelines belonging to the mexican oil company pemex and smuggled into the usa by road tankers .
the oil was then collected at a port in brownsville , texas , from where it was delivered to customers including basf .
pemex , which is the only legal owner and exporter of mexican oil to the us , has been struggling for years to stop an endless series of illegal taps on its pipelines . schroeder is the first to be convicted as a result of the two-year cross-border investigation into oil smuggling from mexico tied to organized crime .
he has already paid a fine of $ 2 million -lrb- 1.4 million euros -rrb- while he awaits his sentencing december . bk / ap / apa editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i regret that the board has not after all taken a decision , " karl-theodor zu guttenberg was quoted as saying by the online edition of the hamburger abendblatt newspaper on saturday , aug .
22 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's guttenberg is disappointed by the news coming from detroit the german government had " provided gm with all the necessary information , " the minister added . the 100-year-old company , once the world 's largest automaker , is feeling the heat from the german government which wants it to sell opel to magna international , a canadian auto parts manufacturer backed by state-owned russian bank sberbank . but gm 's newly-appointed board at a meeting on friday in detroit failed to support the magna sale , backed by its executives , because of a rival bid from belgian investor rhj international . " the gm board of directors met today to discuss options for opel , " gm spokeswoman karin kirchner said in a statement late on friday .
" no decision was taken . " an anonymous source familiar with the situation told the wall street journal that board chair edward whitacre had argued that the offer from rhj should be taken more seriously . according to the source , gm 's board opted to ask the german government for more information on state financing for a deal with rhj . gm itself emerged from bankruptcy in july after wiping out $ 47 billion -lrb- 33 billion euros -rrb- in debt in a restructuring that left it majority-owned by the us government . setback for german government 's plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magna 's stronach has already agreed a deal with opel the news is a setback to the german government and opel 's 25,000 german employees , who were expecting opel 's life-saving sale to magna to be confirmed at the gm board meeting .
economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg was quoted on thursday as expecting " a clear signal " on the future of opel to emerge at friday 's conference . magna 's bid for opel is backed by the german government , which has offered a financial incentive of $ 6.4 billion .
but germany set out tough financial requirements for gm , asking for help with dealing with opel 's possible deficit of $ 1.7 billion . chancellor angela merkel told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper on thursday that magna 's experience in the auto industry and its " better concept " for opel made it a superior buyer than rhj .
facing elections next month , merkel is convinced a deal with magna would be the best option to save jobs . complicated deal but it is precisely magna 's expertise that considerably complicates the deal for gm .
should gm approve a sale to magna , keeping only a minority stake of 35 percent , it would lose most of its influence on opel 's production and distribution in europe . on top of this , magna 's bid also includes a 27.5-percent stake for the russian state bank sberbank , with russian carmaker gaz as an industrial partner holding the option to buy sberbank 's stake .
gm 's board fears that a deal with magna would therefore create a serious competitor not only in the european automobile market , but the growing russian market .
a deal with magna would also rule out the option of opel 's eventual re-absorption into gm . the offer of financial investor rhj is much friendlier .
according to reports , rhj would allow gm to keep control of the technological side of opel , and to retain the possibility of re-acquiring its european subsidiary in a more secure future financial climate . " if you want to know why the board is agonizing over this decision , take a look at the competing spheres of interest , " summed up one commentator in news magazine der spiegel , " either gm surrenders its access to opel , or it loses the money from the german government .
the question : which is costlier ? " european branches watch opel saga with bated breath bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel workers fear for their jobs if a deal is not reached the sale of opel is being keenly watched , as billions of euros in government aid are riding on the outcome , as are the jobs of thousands of opel workers in europe . apart from its 25,000 german employees in four major plants , making everything from three-door corsa subcompacts to zafira vans , there are two key opel factories that produce cars under the vauxhall badge in the uk . opel has other facilities in belgium , poland and spain . no date has been set for another gm board meeting or a deadline for a decision .
the alternative to a sale of opel would be insolvency , analysts have said . bk / reuters / afp editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in hungary , presidential spokeswoman szilvia szotak told the local news agency mti that solyom would not enter slovak territory .
" he will make a statement on the hungarian side of the border , " she said .
august 21 is remembered here as the day in 1968 when what was then czechoslovakia was occupied by warsaw pact troops - including hungary 's - to crush the " prague spring " reform drive by the country 's communist leadership .
solyom was scheduled to attend the unveiling of a statue of stephen , a medieval king of hungary , in the southern slovak town of komarno .
the hungarian town of komarom lies on the southern bank of the river danube , which marks the two countries ' border .
hungarians make up 10 percent of slovakia 's population of 5.4 million people , mostly living along the frontier .
" komarno lies in slovakia 's territory , it 's not a hungarian town , " slovak prime minister robert fico told reporters earlier friday , adding that solyom would be welcome at any other time , but that coming on august 21 was " mere provocation " .
" he wants to spark a conflict , we want to avoid it , " fico insisted .
hungarian president barred fico had said that the slovak foreign ministry had handed a diplomatic note to the hungarian ambassador saying slovakia would not let solyom in .
" if he decides to ignore the note it would be a violation of international law and slovakia 's sovereignty , " fico warned .
" we wo n't prevent him from crossing the border by force .
we want to behave in a diplomatic way , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fico accused solyom of wanting to start a conflict on tuesday , fico , slovak president ivan gasparovic and parliamentary speaker pavol paska had issued a sharply-worded joint statement saying solyom would not be welcome in slovakia and described his planned trip as " insensitive and tactless " .
solyom was invited by komarno mayor tibor bastrnak , who is a member of slovakia 's opposition ethnic-hungarian smk party .
critics have noted that the mayor failed to invite slovak leaders , allegedly paving the way for the dispute - but in tuesday 's statement , the leaders had also blasted solyom for allegedly failing to show any interest in meeting with them .
the past is deeply sensitive for slovakia , which was ruled by hungary for centuries and has only been an independent state since czechoslovakia split in 1993 . but the spat also hinges on a present-day dispute .
hungary has protested to the united nations over slovakia 's new language law , which it dubs discriminatory to the hungarian minority - a move blasted by slovakia 's leaders .
the law slaps fines of up to 5,000 euros -lrb- $ 7,000 -rrb- on the use of minority languages in government and other public services .
ties between the two ex-soviet bloc neighbors , both of whom joined the european union in 2004 , have been tense since 2006 when the far-right sns party , known for its antipathy towards minorities , entered the government steered by fico 's left-wing populist smer party .
both hungary and slovakia are also members of europe 's schengen zone , where frontier controls have been dropped to smooth cross-border travel. nda / afp / ap editor : andy valvur send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in hungary , presidential spokeswoman szilvia szotak told the local news agency mti that solyom would not enter slovak territory .
" he will make a statement on the hungarian side of the border , " she said .
august 21 is remembered here as the day in 1968 when what was then czechoslovakia was occupied by warsaw pact troops - including hungary 's - to crush the " prague spring " reform drive by the country 's communist leadership .
solyom was scheduled to attend the unveiling of a statue of stephen , a medieval king of hungary , in the southern slovak town of komarno .
the hungarian town of komarom lies on the southern bank of the river danube , which marks the two countries ' border .
hungarians make up 10 percent of slovakia 's population of 5.4 million people , mostly living along the frontier .
" komarno lies in slovakia 's territory , it 's not a hungarian town , " slovak prime minister robert fico told reporters earlier friday , adding that solyom would be welcome at any other time , but that coming on august 21 was " mere provocation " .
" he wants to spark a conflict , we want to avoid it , " fico insisted .
hungarian president barred fico had said that the slovak foreign ministry had handed a diplomatic note to the hungarian ambassador saying slovakia would not let solyom in .
" if he decides to ignore the note it would be a violation of international law and slovakia 's sovereignty , " fico warned .
" we wo n't prevent him from crossing the border by force .
we want to behave in a diplomatic way , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fico accused solyom of wanting to start a conflict on tuesday , fico , slovak president ivan gasparovic and parliamentary speaker pavol paska had issued a sharply-worded joint statement saying solyom would not be welcome in slovakia and described his planned trip as " insensitive and tactless " .
solyom was invited by komarno mayor tibor bastrnak , who is a member of slovakia 's opposition ethnic-hungarian smk party .
critics have noted that the mayor failed to invite slovak leaders , allegedly paving the way for the dispute - but in tuesday 's statement , the leaders had also blasted solyom for allegedly failing to show any interest in meeting with them .
the past is deeply sensitive for slovakia , which was ruled by hungary for centuries and has only been an independent state since czechoslovakia split in 1993 . but the spat also hinges on a present-day dispute .
hungary has protested to the united nations over slovakia 's new language law , which it dubs discriminatory to the hungarian minority - a move blasted by slovakia 's leaders .
the law slaps fines of up to 5,000 euros -lrb- $ 7,000 -rrb- on the use of minority languages in government and other public services .
ties between the two ex-soviet bloc neighbors , both of whom joined the european union in 2004 , have been tense since 2006 when the far-right sns party , known for its antipathy towards minorities , entered the government steered by fico 's left-wing populist smer party .

" the gm board of directors met today to discuss options for opel , " gm spokeswoman karin kirchner said in a statement late on friday .
" no decision was taken . " an anonymous source familiar with the situation told the wall street journal that board chair edward whitacre had argued that the offer from rhj should be taken more seriously . according to the source , gm 's board opted to ask the german government for more information on state financing for a deal with rhj . gm itself emerged from bankruptcy in july after wiping out $ 47 billion -lrb- 33 billion euros -rrb- in debt in a restructuring that left it majority-owned by the us government . setback for german government 's plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magna 's stronach has already agreed a deal with opel the news is a setback to the german government and opel 's 25,000 german employees , who were expecting opel 's life-saving sale to magna to be confirmed at the gm board meeting .

facing elections next month , merkel is convinced a deal with magna would be the best option to save jobs . complicated deal but it is precisely magna 's expertise that considerably complicates the deal for gm .
should gm approve a sale to magna , keeping only a minority stake of 35 percent , it would lose most of its influence on opel 's production and distribution in europe . on top of this , magna 's bid also includes a 27.5-percent stake for the russian state bank sberbank , with russian carmaker gaz as an industrial partner holding the option to buy sberbank 's stake .
gm 's board fears that a deal with magna would therefore create a serious competitor not only in the european automobile market , but the growing russian market .
a deal with magna would also rule out the option of opel 's eventual re-absorption into gm . the offer of financial investor rhj is much friendlier .
according to reports , rhj would allow gm to keep control of the technological side of opel , and to retain the possibility of re-acquiring its european subsidiary in a more secure future financial climate . " if you want to know why the board is agonizing over this decision , take a look at the competing spheres of interest , " summed up one commentator in news magazine der spiegel , " either gm surrenders its access to opel , or it loses the money from the german government .

" i regret that the board has not after all taken a decision , " karl-theodor zu guttenberg was quoted as saying by the online edition of the hamburger abendblatt newspaper on saturday , aug .
22 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's guttenberg is disappointed by the news coming from detroit the german government had " provided gm with all the necessary information , " the minister added . the 100-year-old company , once the world 's largest automaker , is feeling the heat from the german government which wants it to sell opel to magna international , a canadian auto parts manufacturer backed by state-owned russian bank sberbank . but gm 's newly-appointed board at a meeting on friday in detroit failed to support the magna sale , backed by its executives , because of a rival bid from belgian investor rhj international . " the gm board of directors met today to discuss options for opel , " gm spokeswoman karin kirchner said in a statement late on friday .
" no decision was taken . " an anonymous source familiar with the situation told the wall street journal that board chair edward whitacre had argued that the offer from rhj should be taken more seriously . according to the source , gm 's board opted to ask the german government for more information on state financing for a deal with rhj . gm itself emerged from bankruptcy in july after wiping out $ 47 billion -lrb- 33 billion euros -rrb- in debt in a restructuring that left it majority-owned by the us government . setback for german government 's plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magna 's stronach has already agreed a deal with opel the news is a setback to the german government and opel 's 25,000 german employees , who were expecting opel 's life-saving sale to magna to be confirmed at the gm board meeting .
economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg was quoted on thursday as expecting " a clear signal " on the future of opel to emerge at friday 's conference . magna 's bid for opel is backed by the german government , which has offered a financial incentive of $ 6.4 billion .
but germany set out tough financial requirements for gm , asking for help with dealing with opel 's possible deficit of $ 1.7 billion . chancellor angela merkel told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper on thursday that magna 's experience in the auto industry and its " better concept " for opel made it a superior buyer than rhj .
facing elections next month , merkel is convinced a deal with magna would be the best option to save jobs . complicated deal but it is precisely magna 's expertise that considerably complicates the deal for gm .
should gm approve a sale to magna , keeping only a minority stake of 35 percent , it would lose most of its influence on opel 's production and distribution in europe . on top of this , magna 's bid also includes a 27.5-percent stake for the russian state bank sberbank , with russian carmaker gaz as an industrial partner holding the option to buy sberbank 's stake .
gm 's board fears that a deal with magna would therefore create a serious competitor not only in the european automobile market , but the growing russian market .
a deal with magna would also rule out the option of opel 's eventual re-absorption into gm . the offer of financial investor rhj is much friendlier .
according to reports , rhj would allow gm to keep control of the technological side of opel , and to retain the possibility of re-acquiring its european subsidiary in a more secure future financial climate . " if you want to know why the board is agonizing over this decision , take a look at the competing spheres of interest , " summed up one commentator in news magazine der spiegel , " either gm surrenders its access to opel , or it loses the money from the german government .

a texas oil executive says his company was one of several that bought stolen mexican petroleum and sold the illicit products to large corporations including german chemical giant basf . basf spokesman daniel pepitone said the company has received a subpoena from the american justice department and is cooperating with authorities to clear up the case .
he confirmed that basf did business with trammo petroleum , but said , " we have no reason to believe that basf had any involvement in the alleged wrongdoing . " according to court documents released on friday , houston-based president of trammo petroleum donald schroeder testified that he was contacted by two fuel company representatives from continental fuels and murphy energy .
" they told me they had some mexican condensate that they would like to sell , " he told the federal court in may . schroeder admitted that he bought and re-sold the liquid hydrocarbon condensate , a substance that refiners can blend with crude oil to produce fuel and other products , knowing that it had been stolen . current investigations indicate that the condensate was tapped from pipelines belonging to the mexican oil company pemex and smuggled into the usa by road tankers .
the oil was then collected at a port in brownsville , texas , from where it was delivered to customers including basf .
pemex , which is the only legal owner and exporter of mexican oil to the us , has been struggling for years to stop an endless series of illegal taps on its pipelines . schroeder is the first to be convicted as a result of the two-year cross-border investigation into oil smuggling from mexico tied to organized crime .

august 21 is remembered here as the day in 1968 when what was then czechoslovakia was occupied by warsaw pact troops - including hungary 's - to crush the " prague spring " reform drive by the country 's communist leadership .
solyom was scheduled to attend the unveiling of a statue of stephen , a medieval king of hungary , in the southern slovak town of komarno .
the hungarian town of komarom lies on the southern bank of the river danube , which marks the two countries ' border .
hungarians make up 10 percent of slovakia 's population of 5.4 million people , mostly living along the frontier .
" komarno lies in slovakia 's territory , it 's not a hungarian town , " slovak prime minister robert fico told reporters earlier friday , adding that solyom would be welcome at any other time , but that coming on august 21 was " mere provocation " .
" he wants to spark a conflict , we want to avoid it , " fico insisted .
hungarian president barred fico had said that the slovak foreign ministry had handed a diplomatic note to the hungarian ambassador saying slovakia would not let solyom in .
" if he decides to ignore the note it would be a violation of international law and slovakia 's sovereignty , " fico warned .
" we wo n't prevent him from crossing the border by force .
we want to behave in a diplomatic way , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fico accused solyom of wanting to start a conflict on tuesday , fico , slovak president ivan gasparovic and parliamentary speaker pavol paska had issued a sharply-worded joint statement saying solyom would not be welcome in slovakia and described his planned trip as " insensitive and tactless " .
solyom was invited by komarno mayor tibor bastrnak , who is a member of slovakia 's opposition ethnic-hungarian smk party .
critics have noted that the mayor failed to invite slovak leaders , allegedly paving the way for the dispute - but in tuesday 's statement , the leaders had also blasted solyom for allegedly failing to show any interest in meeting with them .
the past is deeply sensitive for slovakia , which was ruled by hungary for centuries and has only been an independent state since czechoslovakia split in 1993 . but the spat also hinges on a present-day dispute .
hungary has protested to the united nations over slovakia 's new language law , which it dubs discriminatory to the hungarian minority - a move blasted by slovakia 's leaders .
the law slaps fines of up to 5,000 euros -lrb- $ 7,000 -rrb- on the use of minority languages in government and other public services .
ties between the two ex-soviet bloc neighbors , both of whom joined the european union in 2004 , have been tense since 2006 when the far-right sns party , known for its antipathy towards minorities , entered the government steered by fico 's left-wing populist smer party .
both hungary and slovakia are also members of europe 's schengen zone , where frontier controls have been dropped to smooth cross-border travel. nda / afp / ap editor : andy valvur send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

twenty years later , the former " baltic tigers " are trying to show courage in the face of recession . their hands stretching across forests and fields , standing along highways and country roads , as many as 2 million estonians , latvians and lithuanians joined in a 671-kilometer -lrb- 417-mile -rrb- human chain 20 years ago , looking forward to a better future .
but this year 's celebration of the baltic way , which showed the world the baltic countries ' desire for autonomy apart from the soviet union , is looking backward in an attempt to recapture that hope in difficult economic times .
the commemorations include exhibits and academic conferences , but the most hailed event is heartbeats for the baltics , a relay run along the baltic way route .
about 13,500 people will run in one-kilometer stretches , but organizers say anyone can join the relay along the way for any length .
the first runners left the estonian capital , tallinn , for the latvian capital of riga on saturday morning .
a second group of runners was scheduled to leave the lithuanian capital of vilnius later in the day and head north to meet the first group at riga 's freedom monument on sunday .
bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousands joined hands for the baltic way in 1989 the end of communism the baltic way human chain on aug .
23 , 1989 coincided with the 50th anniversary of the molotov-ribbentrop pact , which had divided the baltic states into spheres of influence and led to the eventual annexation by the soviet union in 1940 .
the participation of 2 million people , in a region whose population is around 7 million , would have been a significant accomplishment even if it had n't occurred under the shadow of soviet control .
" people are always looking to break records , but what we did , it was not a record attempt , " said nomeda marcenaite , who was there in 1989 .
" it was a spiritual thing , perhaps a spiritual record . "
putting on the running shoes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators along the 1989 baltic way latvian president valdis zatlers will be joining in on the last leg of the commemorative run on sunday .
the relay was his pet project , and he said that he hoped it would inspire the generation of people too young to remember the original event .
" we gave a clear signal : we are organized , we have overcome the molotov-ribbentrop pact and we are ready to go forward and be dynamic in a challenging world , " zatlers said .
" that 's the way balts do things . "
sixten sild , who helped organize this year 's event as chairman of the estonian orienteering association board , will be running three kilometers early sunday morning near the latvian-estonian border .
" i want to run there because 20 years ago that was where i stood in the baltic chain with my parents , " sild said .
his two adult sons will be participating as well .
fresh courage needed estonia and the other baltic states have been hit hard by the global financial crisis .
the european union 's statistical office eurostat counted the three countries ' economic performance as the worst in the euro zone .
lithuania 's economy has contracted 12.3 percent over the same quarter last year , estonia lost 3.7 percent , and latvia 1.6 percent .
estonia has had to raise sales taxes and make serious budget cuts , tough decisions which ultimately led to the collapse of its coalition government in may .
in latvia , unemployment has also soared to 16.7 percent .
the world bank estimates that the number of lithuanian families living in poverty could increase by 49 percent this year .
" it is once again very important to stand together and to show that we can reduce the negative consequences of the recession , undertake greater responsibilities , and be more courageous in dealing with the challenges of our age , " said lithuanian president dalia grybauskaite. svs / reuters / dpa / afp editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we gave a clear signal : we are organized , we have overcome the molotov-ribbentrop pact and we are ready to go forward and be dynamic in a challenging world , " zatlers said .
" that 's the way balts do things . "
sixten sild , who helped organize this year 's event as chairman of the estonian orienteering association board , will be running three kilometers early sunday morning near the latvian-estonian border .
" i want to run there because 20 years ago that was where i stood in the baltic chain with my parents , " sild said .
his two adult sons will be participating as well .
fresh courage needed estonia and the other baltic states have been hit hard by the global financial crisis .
the european union 's statistical office eurostat counted the three countries ' economic performance as the worst in the euro zone .
lithuania 's economy has contracted 12.3 percent over the same quarter last year , estonia lost 3.7 percent , and latvia 1.6 percent .
estonia has had to raise sales taxes and make serious budget cuts , tough decisions which ultimately led to the collapse of its coalition government in may .
in latvia , unemployment has also soared to 16.7 percent .
the world bank estimates that the number of lithuanian families living in poverty could increase by 49 percent this year .
" it is once again very important to stand together and to show that we can reduce the negative consequences of the recession , undertake greater responsibilities , and be more courageous in dealing with the challenges of our age , " said lithuanian president dalia grybauskaite. svs / reuters / dpa / afp editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the history of flight and expulsion affects us all , " merkel told a crowd of several hundred members of an association for expellees .
" it is part of our national identity and shared cultural memory . "
merkel was speaking in berlin to members of the federation of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- on a day they recognize as the tag der heimat , or " day of the homeland . "
the bdv is moving forward with plans for a memorial and documentation center dedicated to the 12 to 14 million germans who were ejected or fled homes in eastern europe after the end of the war .
the center against expulsions , slated to occupy a floor of a berlin office building , will also incorporate the stories of other displaced groups throughout history .
it will cost around 30 million euros -lrb- $ 43 million -rrb- to build .
remembering with sensitivity merkel said those who left or were forced from homes in hungary , poland and then czechoslovakia should become " ambassadors of reconciliation , " having forsworn revenge and violence in the group 's charter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposed center against expulsions would also include information about other forced displacements in history .
however , merkel was careful to note that the suffering of those expelled was the direct result of germany 's own aggression and atrocities during world war ii .
she noted the need to be " sensitive in our arguments . "
" we will not forget : this was the undeniable result of a german war " and nazi tyranny , said merkel .
" we recognize our responsibility for the darkest chapter in german history . "
the league 's president , erika steinbach , is also a member of merkel 's christian democrats .
steinbach was dropped from a list of nominees for the memorial 's board in march due to strong objections from the polish government .
they have accused her of emphasizing expellees ' suffering over that of germany 's victims .

unesco now commemorates its hard-won struggle , but combatting the modern slavery prevalent in many societies today is equally challenging . " by institutionalizing memory , resisting the onset of oblivion , recalling the memory of a tragedy that for long years remained hidden or unrecognized , and by assigning it its proper place in the human conscience , we respond to our duty to remember , " unesco 's director-general said during the 2004 launch of the international year to commemorate the struggle to end the slave trade . slavery in the world today it has been over 200 years since the abolition of the trans-atlantic slave trade but , despite that , the practice still continues in various forms all over the world . in 2005 , the international labor organization estimated that just over 12 million people were working as forced laborers in the world . siddarth kara , in his book " sex trafficking : inside the business of modern slavery , " says that there were just over 28 million slaves worldwide in 2006 divided into three categories : bonded labor / debt bondage , forced labor and trafficking slaves .
according to kara , the profits generated worldwide by all forms of slavery in 2007 were just over $ 91 billion .
that is second only to drug trafficking in terms of global criminal activities .
" information on slavery is very inexact .
but we believe that the majority of slave victims - in the neighbourhood of 80 percent - are the female gender , and that around 50 percent are children .
we believe that the largest category of slavery is sex slavery .
this is not to minimize other large categories - domestic servitude slavery , forced labour in farms and factory slavery , child soldier slavery , " said john miller , director of the us state department ‘ s office for monitoring and combating trafficking in persons . bildunterschrift : young boys under forced labor working as fishermen in ghana having been sold by their impoverished parents " human trafficking is synonymous with slavery .
human trafficking relies on coercion and exploitation .
it thrives on converting hope to fear .
it 's maintained through violence .
the trade in people is a major source of revenue - in the billions -lsb- of dollars per year -rsb- - for organized crime , along with the drug trade and the arms trade .
let there be no misunderstanding , modern slavery plagues every country in the world - including the united states , " miller said . sex slavery endemic – an economic reality these days , human trafficking , otherwise known as sex slavery , is the fastest-growing form of organized crime in eastern europe .
sex trafficking has become a multi-billion dollar underground industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights watch is at the forefront of highlighting the evils of modern-day slavery tom porteous , the director of human rights watch in london , told deutsche welle that " the major factor contributing to sex slavery is supply and demand .

unesco now commemorates its hard-won struggle , but combatting the modern slavery prevalent in many societies today is equally challenging . " by institutionalizing memory , resisting the onset of oblivion , recalling the memory of a tragedy that for long years remained hidden or unrecognized , and by assigning it its proper place in the human conscience , we respond to our duty to remember , " unesco 's director-general said during the 2004 launch of the international year to commemorate the struggle to end the slave trade . slavery in the world today it has been over 200 years since the abolition of the trans-atlantic slave trade but , despite that , the practice still continues in various forms all over the world . in 2005 , the international labor organization estimated that just over 12 million people were working as forced laborers in the world . siddarth kara , in his book " sex trafficking : inside the business of modern slavery , " says that there were just over 28 million slaves worldwide in 2006 divided into three categories : bonded labor / debt bondage , forced labor and trafficking slaves .
according to kara , the profits generated worldwide by all forms of slavery in 2007 were just over $ 91 billion .
that is second only to drug trafficking in terms of global criminal activities .
" information on slavery is very inexact .
but we believe that the majority of slave victims - in the neighbourhood of 80 percent - are the female gender , and that around 50 percent are children .
we believe that the largest category of slavery is sex slavery .
this is not to minimize other large categories - domestic servitude slavery , forced labour in farms and factory slavery , child soldier slavery , " said john miller , director of the us state department ‘ s office for monitoring and combating trafficking in persons . bildunterschrift : young boys under forced labor working as fishermen in ghana having been sold by their impoverished parents " human trafficking is synonymous with slavery .
human trafficking relies on coercion and exploitation .
it thrives on converting hope to fear .
it 's maintained through violence .
the trade in people is a major source of revenue - in the billions -lsb- of dollars per year -rsb- - for organized crime , along with the drug trade and the arms trade .

unesco now commemorates its hard-won struggle , but combatting the modern slavery prevalent in many societies today is equally challenging . " by institutionalizing memory , resisting the onset of oblivion , recalling the memory of a tragedy that for long years remained hidden or unrecognized , and by assigning it its proper place in the human conscience , we respond to our duty to remember , " unesco 's director-general said during the 2004 launch of the international year to commemorate the struggle to end the slave trade . slavery in the world today it has been over 200 years since the abolition of the trans-atlantic slave trade but , despite that , the practice still continues in various forms all over the world . in 2005 , the international labor organization estimated that just over 12 million people were working as forced laborers in the world . siddarth kara , in his book " sex trafficking : inside the business of modern slavery , " says that there were just over 28 million slaves worldwide in 2006 divided into three categories : bonded labor / debt bondage , forced labor and trafficking slaves .
according to kara , the profits generated worldwide by all forms of slavery in 2007 were just over $ 91 billion .
that is second only to drug trafficking in terms of global criminal activities .
" information on slavery is very inexact .
but we believe that the majority of slave victims - in the neighbourhood of 80 percent - are the female gender , and that around 50 percent are children .
we believe that the largest category of slavery is sex slavery .
this is not to minimize other large categories - domestic servitude slavery , forced labour in farms and factory slavery , child soldier slavery , " said john miller , director of the us state department ‘ s office for monitoring and combating trafficking in persons . bildunterschrift : young boys under forced labor working as fishermen in ghana having been sold by their impoverished parents " human trafficking is synonymous with slavery .
human trafficking relies on coercion and exploitation .
it thrives on converting hope to fear .
it 's maintained through violence .
the trade in people is a major source of revenue - in the billions -lsb- of dollars per year -rsb- - for organized crime , along with the drug trade and the arms trade .
let there be no misunderstanding , modern slavery plagues every country in the world - including the united states , " miller said . sex slavery endemic – an economic reality these days , human trafficking , otherwise known as sex slavery , is the fastest-growing form of organized crime in eastern europe .
sex trafficking has become a multi-billion dollar underground industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights watch is at the forefront of highlighting the evils of modern-day slavery tom porteous , the director of human rights watch in london , told deutsche welle that " the major factor contributing to sex slavery is supply and demand .
there is a huge demand for prostitution and an equally huge supply of participants because of the economic situation in the world . " an estimated half a million women are trafficked annually for the purpose of sex slavery .
they are exported to over 50 countries including germany , britain , italy , japan , canada and the united states .
sex slaves are smuggled taking a route known as the " eastern route " from eastern european countries , through poland and subsequently into european union countries .
the cities of prague , amsterdam , and frankfurt are common final destinations for the slaves . " the susceptibility of victims despite the publicity focused on the issue is a question of economic reality and economic desperation .
the countries which provide the bulk of the victims in sex slavery are poor ; the victims are predominantly of the poorest countries , " said porteous . " enforcement of the law needs to be strengthened , along with the formation of international treaties that could properly deal with sex slavery . more information on the reality of the situation needs to be disseminated directly to the communities that provide the bulk of the supply in sex slavery i.e. the economically challenged , " he added . germany ’ s fight against sex slavery germany is known as a “ receiving country ” in the sex slavery industry ; a destination and transit country for the trade , with scores of victims coming in from eastern europe and also asia and africa .
berlin has in turn proven itself a leader in many aspects of the fight against modern slavery . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joerg ziercke , the president of germany 's criminal police office , says sex slavery remains a problem a spokesman for germany 's criminal police office told deutsche welle that , " since the strong rise in trafficking of sex slavery victims into germany in 2007 , the problem has steadied in the subsequent years .
sex slavery is still a problem and prosecution of those involved relies largely on identification by the victims . the victims of sex slavery these days are members of eu countries and are thus legally permitted to stay in germany if they so wish .
prosecution and curbing of this crime requires victims coming forward and identifying the criminals involved , achieving this would require efforts of both governmental and non-governmental organizations . " the basis of sex slavery , experts say , is economic .
the industry renders billions of dollars in revenue for its perpetrators and the reality of the victims , who are predominantly from economically-challenged countries accounts for their susceptibility to the trade . " there is anecdotal evidence suggesting that the economic crisis in the world has made the sex slavery problem even worse , " said tom porteous . author : faith thomas editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i regret that the board has not after all taken a decision , " karl-theodor zu guttenberg was quoted as saying by the online edition of the hamburger abendblatt newspaper on saturday , aug .
22 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's guttenberg is disappointed by the news coming from detroit the german government had " provided gm with all the necessary information , " the minister added . the 100-year-old company , once the world 's largest automaker , is feeling the heat from the german government which wants it to sell opel to magna international , a canadian auto parts manufacturer backed by state-owned russian bank sberbank . but gm 's newly-appointed board at a meeting on friday in detroit failed to support the magna sale , backed by its executives , because of a rival bid from belgian investor rhj international . " the gm board of directors met today to discuss options for opel , " gm spokeswoman karin kirchner said in a statement late on friday .
" no decision was taken . " an anonymous source familiar with the situation told the wall street journal that board chair edward whitacre had argued that the offer from rhj should be taken more seriously . according to the source , gm 's board opted to ask the german government for more information on state financing for a deal with rhj . gm itself emerged from bankruptcy in july after wiping out $ 47 billion -lrb- 33 billion euros -rrb- in debt in a restructuring that left it majority-owned by the us government . setback for german government 's plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magna 's stronach has already agreed a deal with opel the news is a setback to the german government and opel 's 25,000 german employees , who were expecting opel 's life-saving sale to magna to be confirmed at the gm board meeting .
economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg was quoted on thursday as expecting " a clear signal " on the future of opel to emerge at friday 's conference . magna 's bid for opel is backed by the german government , which has offered a financial incentive of $ 6.4 billion .
but germany set out tough financial requirements for gm , asking for help with dealing with opel 's possible deficit of $ 1.7 billion . chancellor angela merkel told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper on thursday that magna 's experience in the auto industry and its " better concept " for opel made it a superior buyer than rhj .
facing elections next month , merkel is convinced a deal with magna would be the best option to save jobs . complicated deal but it is precisely magna 's expertise that considerably complicates the deal for gm .
should gm approve a sale to magna , keeping only a minority stake of 35 percent , it would lose most of its influence on opel 's production and distribution in europe . on top of this , magna 's bid also includes a 27.5-percent stake for the russian state bank sberbank , with russian carmaker gaz as an industrial partner holding the option to buy sberbank 's stake .
gm 's board fears that a deal with magna would therefore create a serious competitor not only in the european automobile market , but the growing russian market .
a deal with magna would also rule out the option of opel 's eventual re-absorption into gm . the offer of financial investor rhj is much friendlier .
according to reports , rhj would allow gm to keep control of the technological side of opel , and to retain the possibility of re-acquiring its european subsidiary in a more secure future financial climate . " if you want to know why the board is agonizing over this decision , take a look at the competing spheres of interest , " summed up one commentator in news magazine der spiegel , " either gm surrenders its access to opel , or it loses the money from the german government .

22 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's guttenberg is disappointed by the news coming from detroit the german government had " provided gm with all the necessary information , " the minister added . the 100-year-old company , once the world 's largest automaker , is feeling the heat from the german government which wants it to sell opel to magna international , a canadian auto parts manufacturer backed by state-owned russian bank sberbank . but gm 's newly-appointed board at a meeting on friday in detroit failed to support the magna sale , backed by its executives , because of a rival bid from belgian investor rhj international . " the gm board of directors met today to discuss options for opel , " gm spokeswoman karin kirchner said in a statement late on friday .
" no decision was taken . " an anonymous source familiar with the situation told the wall street journal that board chair edward whitacre had argued that the offer from rhj should be taken more seriously . according to the source , gm 's board opted to ask the german government for more information on state financing for a deal with rhj . gm itself emerged from bankruptcy in july after wiping out $ 47 billion -lrb- 33 billion euros -rrb- in debt in a restructuring that left it majority-owned by the us government . setback for german government 's plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magna 's stronach has already agreed a deal with opel the news is a setback to the german government and opel 's 25,000 german employees , who were expecting opel 's life-saving sale to magna to be confirmed at the gm board meeting .
economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg was quoted on thursday as expecting " a clear signal " on the future of opel to emerge at friday 's conference . magna 's bid for opel is backed by the german government , which has offered a financial incentive of $ 6.4 billion .
but germany set out tough financial requirements for gm , asking for help with dealing with opel 's possible deficit of $ 1.7 billion . chancellor angela merkel told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper on thursday that magna 's experience in the auto industry and its " better concept " for opel made it a superior buyer than rhj .
facing elections next month , merkel is convinced a deal with magna would be the best option to save jobs . complicated deal but it is precisely magna 's expertise that considerably complicates the deal for gm .
should gm approve a sale to magna , keeping only a minority stake of 35 percent , it would lose most of its influence on opel 's production and distribution in europe . on top of this , magna 's bid also includes a 27.5-percent stake for the russian state bank sberbank , with russian carmaker gaz as an industrial partner holding the option to buy sberbank 's stake .
gm 's board fears that a deal with magna would therefore create a serious competitor not only in the european automobile market , but the growing russian market .
a deal with magna would also rule out the option of opel 's eventual re-absorption into gm . the offer of financial investor rhj is much friendlier .
according to reports , rhj would allow gm to keep control of the technological side of opel , and to retain the possibility of re-acquiring its european subsidiary in a more secure future financial climate . " if you want to know why the board is agonizing over this decision , take a look at the competing spheres of interest , " summed up one commentator in news magazine der spiegel , " either gm surrenders its access to opel , or it loses the money from the german government .

in hungary , presidential spokeswoman szilvia szotak told the local news agency mti that solyom would not enter slovak territory .
" he will make a statement on the hungarian side of the border , " she said .
august 21 is remembered here as the day in 1968 when what was then czechoslovakia was occupied by warsaw pact troops - including hungary 's - to crush the " prague spring " reform drive by the country 's communist leadership .
solyom was scheduled to attend the unveiling of a statue of stephen , a medieval king of hungary , in the southern slovak town of komarno .
the hungarian town of komarom lies on the southern bank of the river danube , which marks the two countries ' border .
hungarians make up 10 percent of slovakia 's population of 5.4 million people , mostly living along the frontier .
" komarno lies in slovakia 's territory , it 's not a hungarian town , " slovak prime minister robert fico told reporters earlier friday , adding that solyom would be welcome at any other time , but that coming on august 21 was " mere provocation " .
" he wants to spark a conflict , we want to avoid it , " fico insisted .
hungarian president barred fico had said that the slovak foreign ministry had handed a diplomatic note to the hungarian ambassador saying slovakia would not let solyom in .
" if he decides to ignore the note it would be a violation of international law and slovakia 's sovereignty , " fico warned .
" we wo n't prevent him from crossing the border by force .
we want to behave in a diplomatic way , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fico accused solyom of wanting to start a conflict on tuesday , fico , slovak president ivan gasparovic and parliamentary speaker pavol paska had issued a sharply-worded joint statement saying solyom would not be welcome in slovakia and described his planned trip as " insensitive and tactless " .
solyom was invited by komarno mayor tibor bastrnak , who is a member of slovakia 's opposition ethnic-hungarian smk party .
critics have noted that the mayor failed to invite slovak leaders , allegedly paving the way for the dispute - but in tuesday 's statement , the leaders had also blasted solyom for allegedly failing to show any interest in meeting with them .
the past is deeply sensitive for slovakia , which was ruled by hungary for centuries and has only been an independent state since czechoslovakia split in 1993 . but the spat also hinges on a present-day dispute .
hungary has protested to the united nations over slovakia 's new language law , which it dubs discriminatory to the hungarian minority - a move blasted by slovakia 's leaders .
the law slaps fines of up to 5,000 euros -lrb- $ 7,000 -rrb- on the use of minority languages in government and other public services .
ties between the two ex-soviet bloc neighbors , both of whom joined the european union in 2004 , have been tense since 2006 when the far-right sns party , known for its antipathy towards minorities , entered the government steered by fico 's left-wing populist smer party .

solyom was invited by komarno mayor tibor bastrnak , who is a member of slovakia 's opposition ethnic-hungarian smk party .
critics have noted that the mayor failed to invite slovak leaders , allegedly paving the way for the dispute - but in tuesday 's statement , the leaders had also blasted solyom for allegedly failing to show any interest in meeting with them .
the past is deeply sensitive for slovakia , which was ruled by hungary for centuries and has only been an independent state since czechoslovakia split in 1993 . but the spat also hinges on a present-day dispute .
hungary has protested to the united nations over slovakia 's new language law , which it dubs discriminatory to the hungarian minority - a move blasted by slovakia 's leaders .
the law slaps fines of up to 5,000 euros -lrb- $ 7,000 -rrb- on the use of minority languages in government and other public services .
ties between the two ex-soviet bloc neighbors , both of whom joined the european union in 2004 , have been tense since 2006 when the far-right sns party , known for its antipathy towards minorities , entered the government steered by fico 's left-wing populist smer party .
both hungary and slovakia are also members of europe 's schengen zone , where frontier controls have been dropped to smooth cross-border travel. nda / afp / ap editor : andy valvur send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in hungary , presidential spokeswoman szilvia szotak told the local news agency mti that solyom would not enter slovak territory .
" he will make a statement on the hungarian side of the border , " she said .
august 21 is remembered here as the day in 1968 when what was then czechoslovakia was occupied by warsaw pact troops - including hungary 's - to crush the " prague spring " reform drive by the country 's communist leadership .
solyom was scheduled to attend the unveiling of a statue of stephen , a medieval king of hungary , in the southern slovak town of komarno .
the hungarian town of komarom lies on the southern bank of the river danube , which marks the two countries ' border .
hungarians make up 10 percent of slovakia 's population of 5.4 million people , mostly living along the frontier .
" komarno lies in slovakia 's territory , it 's not a hungarian town , " slovak prime minister robert fico told reporters earlier friday , adding that solyom would be welcome at any other time , but that coming on august 21 was " mere provocation " .
" he wants to spark a conflict , we want to avoid it , " fico insisted .
hungarian president barred fico had said that the slovak foreign ministry had handed a diplomatic note to the hungarian ambassador saying slovakia would not let solyom in .
" if he decides to ignore the note it would be a violation of international law and slovakia 's sovereignty , " fico warned .
" we wo n't prevent him from crossing the border by force .
we want to behave in a diplomatic way , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fico accused solyom of wanting to start a conflict on tuesday , fico , slovak president ivan gasparovic and parliamentary speaker pavol paska had issued a sharply-worded joint statement saying solyom would not be welcome in slovakia and described his planned trip as " insensitive and tactless " .
solyom was invited by komarno mayor tibor bastrnak , who is a member of slovakia 's opposition ethnic-hungarian smk party .
critics have noted that the mayor failed to invite slovak leaders , allegedly paving the way for the dispute - but in tuesday 's statement , the leaders had also blasted solyom for allegedly failing to show any interest in meeting with them .
the past is deeply sensitive for slovakia , which was ruled by hungary for centuries and has only been an independent state since czechoslovakia split in 1993 . but the spat also hinges on a present-day dispute .
hungary has protested to the united nations over slovakia 's new language law , which it dubs discriminatory to the hungarian minority - a move blasted by slovakia 's leaders .
the law slaps fines of up to 5,000 euros -lrb- $ 7,000 -rrb- on the use of minority languages in government and other public services .
ties between the two ex-soviet bloc neighbors , both of whom joined the european union in 2004 , have been tense since 2006 when the far-right sns party , known for its antipathy towards minorities , entered the government steered by fico 's left-wing populist smer party .

a texas oil executive says his company was one of several that bought stolen mexican petroleum and sold the illicit products to large corporations including german chemical giant basf . basf spokesman daniel pepitone said the company has received a subpoena from the american justice department and is cooperating with authorities to clear up the case .
he confirmed that basf did business with trammo petroleum , but said , " we have no reason to believe that basf had any involvement in the alleged wrongdoing . " according to court documents released on friday , houston-based president of trammo petroleum donald schroeder testified that he was contacted by two fuel company representatives from continental fuels and murphy energy .
" they told me they had some mexican condensate that they would like to sell , " he told the federal court in may . schroeder admitted that he bought and re-sold the liquid hydrocarbon condensate , a substance that refiners can blend with crude oil to produce fuel and other products , knowing that it had been stolen . current investigations indicate that the condensate was tapped from pipelines belonging to the mexican oil company pemex and smuggled into the usa by road tankers .
the oil was then collected at a port in brownsville , texas , from where it was delivered to customers including basf .
pemex , which is the only legal owner and exporter of mexican oil to the us , has been struggling for years to stop an endless series of illegal taps on its pipelines . schroeder is the first to be convicted as a result of the two-year cross-border investigation into oil smuggling from mexico tied to organized crime .
he has already paid a fine of $ 2 million -lrb- 1.4 million euros -rrb- while he awaits his sentencing december . bk / ap / apa editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

unesco now commemorates its hard-won struggle , but combatting the modern slavery prevalent in many societies today is equally challenging . " by institutionalizing memory , resisting the onset of oblivion , recalling the memory of a tragedy that for long years remained hidden or unrecognized , and by assigning it its proper place in the human conscience , we respond to our duty to remember , " unesco 's director-general said during the 2004 launch of the international year to commemorate the struggle to end the slave trade . slavery in the world today it has been over 200 years since the abolition of the trans-atlantic slave trade but , despite that , the practice still continues in various forms all over the world . in 2005 , the international labor organization estimated that just over 12 million people were working as forced laborers in the world . siddarth kara , in his book " sex trafficking : inside the business of modern slavery , " says that there were just over 28 million slaves worldwide in 2006 divided into three categories : bonded labor / debt bondage , forced labor and trafficking slaves .
according to kara , the profits generated worldwide by all forms of slavery in 2007 were just over $ 91 billion .
that is second only to drug trafficking in terms of global criminal activities .
" information on slavery is very inexact .
but we believe that the majority of slave victims - in the neighbourhood of 80 percent - are the female gender , and that around 50 percent are children .
we believe that the largest category of slavery is sex slavery .
this is not to minimize other large categories - domestic servitude slavery , forced labour in farms and factory slavery , child soldier slavery , " said john miller , director of the us state department ‘ s office for monitoring and combating trafficking in persons . bildunterschrift : young boys under forced labor working as fishermen in ghana having been sold by their impoverished parents " human trafficking is synonymous with slavery .
human trafficking relies on coercion and exploitation .
it thrives on converting hope to fear .
it 's maintained through violence .
the trade in people is a major source of revenue - in the billions -lsb- of dollars per year -rsb- - for organized crime , along with the drug trade and the arms trade .
let there be no misunderstanding , modern slavery plagues every country in the world - including the united states , " miller said . sex slavery endemic – an economic reality these days , human trafficking , otherwise known as sex slavery , is the fastest-growing form of organized crime in eastern europe .
sex trafficking has become a multi-billion dollar underground industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights watch is at the forefront of highlighting the evils of modern-day slavery tom porteous , the director of human rights watch in london , told deutsche welle that " the major factor contributing to sex slavery is supply and demand .
there is a huge demand for prostitution and an equally huge supply of participants because of the economic situation in the world . " an estimated half a million women are trafficked annually for the purpose of sex slavery .
they are exported to over 50 countries including germany , britain , italy , japan , canada and the united states .
sex slaves are smuggled taking a route known as the " eastern route " from eastern european countries , through poland and subsequently into european union countries .
the cities of prague , amsterdam , and frankfurt are common final destinations for the slaves . " the susceptibility of victims despite the publicity focused on the issue is a question of economic reality and economic desperation .
the countries which provide the bulk of the victims in sex slavery are poor ; the victims are predominantly of the poorest countries , " said porteous . " enforcement of the law needs to be strengthened , along with the formation of international treaties that could properly deal with sex slavery . more information on the reality of the situation needs to be disseminated directly to the communities that provide the bulk of the supply in sex slavery i.e. the economically challenged , " he added . germany ’ s fight against sex slavery germany is known as a “ receiving country ” in the sex slavery industry ; a destination and transit country for the trade , with scores of victims coming in from eastern europe and also asia and africa .
berlin has in turn proven itself a leader in many aspects of the fight against modern slavery . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joerg ziercke , the president of germany 's criminal police office , says sex slavery remains a problem a spokesman for germany 's criminal police office told deutsche welle that , " since the strong rise in trafficking of sex slavery victims into germany in 2007 , the problem has steadied in the subsequent years .
sex slavery is still a problem and prosecution of those involved relies largely on identification by the victims . the victims of sex slavery these days are members of eu countries and are thus legally permitted to stay in germany if they so wish .
prosecution and curbing of this crime requires victims coming forward and identifying the criminals involved , achieving this would require efforts of both governmental and non-governmental organizations . " the basis of sex slavery , experts say , is economic .
the industry renders billions of dollars in revenue for its perpetrators and the reality of the victims , who are predominantly from economically-challenged countries accounts for their susceptibility to the trade . " there is anecdotal evidence suggesting that the economic crisis in the world has made the sex slavery problem even worse , " said tom porteous . author : faith thomas editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it was n't a world record , but when the jamaican relay team won the gold in 37.31 seconds at the championships in berlin on saturday , team member usain bolt reached another athletic milestone .
after winning the 100 meters and 200 meters earlier this week , both in world record times , bolt now has two big event title trebles .
at the beijing olympics just one year ago he won gold in all three races as well .
the jamaican team 's 37.31 seconds run on saturday was a championship record , but was not able to beat out their own world record from the olympics of 37.10 .
in the women 's 4x100 meters relay , the jamaicans also took gold , with 42.06 seconds .
both the men 's and women 's team effectively won by walkover , with their biggest rivals , the americans , missing from the competition .
the american men were disqualified after winning their heat on friday for a handover outside the exchange zone . while the women were favorites to make it into the final , alexandria anderson had an awkward handover to muna lee in the semi-final that left lee on the ground clutching her hamstring .
she was taken off the track in a stretcher , and the team did not finish the race .

twenty years later , the former " baltic tigers " are trying to show courage in the face of recession . their hands stretching across forests and fields , standing along highways and country roads , as many as 2 million estonians , latvians and lithuanians joined in a 671-kilometer -lrb- 417-mile -rrb- human chain 20 years ago , looking forward to a better future .
but this year 's celebration of the baltic way , which showed the world the baltic countries ' desire for autonomy apart from the soviet union , is looking backward in an attempt to recapture that hope in difficult economic times .
the commemorations include exhibits and academic conferences , but the most hailed event is heartbeats for the baltics , a relay run along the baltic way route .
about 13,500 people will run in one-kilometer stretches , but organizers say anyone can join the relay along the way for any length .
the first runners left the estonian capital , tallinn , for the latvian capital of riga on saturday morning .
a second group of runners was scheduled to leave the lithuanian capital of vilnius later in the day and head north to meet the first group at riga 's freedom monument on sunday .
bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousands joined hands for the baltic way in 1989 the end of communism the baltic way human chain on aug .
23 , 1989 coincided with the 50th anniversary of the molotov-ribbentrop pact , which had divided the baltic states into spheres of influence and led to the eventual annexation by the soviet union in 1940 .
the participation of 2 million people , in a region whose population is around 7 million , would have been a significant accomplishment even if it had n't occurred under the shadow of soviet control .

it was n't a world record , but when the jamaican relay team won the gold in 37.31 seconds at the championships in berlin on saturday , team member usain bolt reached another athletic milestone .
after winning the 100 meters and 200 meters earlier this week , both in world record times , bolt now has two big event title trebles .
at the beijing olympics just one year ago he won gold in all three races as well .
the jamaican team 's 37.31 seconds run on saturday was a championship record , but was not able to beat out their own world record from the olympics of 37.10 .
in the women 's 4x100 meters relay , the jamaicans also took gold , with 42.06 seconds .
both the men 's and women 's team effectively won by walkover , with their biggest rivals , the americans , missing from the competition .
the american men were disqualified after winning their heat on friday for a handover outside the exchange zone . while the women were favorites to make it into the final , alexandria anderson had an awkward handover to muna lee in the semi-final that left lee on the ground clutching her hamstring .
she was taken off the track in a stretcher , and the team did not finish the race .
the bahamas took silver with 42.29 while the full house cheered the german 's across the finish line at 42.87 for bronze . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wlodarczyk 's record hammer throw is the third world record of the championships so far the germans had more reason to cheer when defending champion and hometown girl betty heidler won silver in the women 's hammer throw .
her throw of 77.12 meters was a new german record , but could n't beat poland 's anita wlodarczyk 's 77.96 meters , a new world record .
it was the third world record of the championships so far , along with bolt 's 100m and 200m sprints . sunday is the ninth and last day of the competition with finals in the women 's long jump and 1500 meters , as well as in the men 's 5000 meters. hf / dpa / reuters editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it was n't a world record , but when the jamaican relay team won the gold in 37.31 seconds at the championships in berlin on saturday , team member usain bolt reached another athletic milestone .
after winning the 100 meters and 200 meters earlier this week , both in world record times , bolt now has two big event title trebles .
at the beijing olympics just one year ago he won gold in all three races as well .
the jamaican team 's 37.31 seconds run on saturday was a championship record , but was not able to beat out their own world record from the olympics of 37.10 .
in the women 's 4x100 meters relay , the jamaicans also took gold , with 42.06 seconds .
both the men 's and women 's team effectively won by walkover , with their biggest rivals , the americans , missing from the competition .
the american men were disqualified after winning their heat on friday for a handover outside the exchange zone . while the women were favorites to make it into the final , alexandria anderson had an awkward handover to muna lee in the semi-final that left lee on the ground clutching her hamstring .
she was taken off the track in a stretcher , and the team did not finish the race .
the bahamas took silver with 42.29 while the full house cheered the german 's across the finish line at 42.87 for bronze . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wlodarczyk 's record hammer throw is the third world record of the championships so far the germans had more reason to cheer when defending champion and hometown girl betty heidler won silver in the women 's hammer throw .

it was the third world record of the championships so far , along with bolt 's 100m and 200m sprints . sunday is the ninth and last day of the competition with finals in the women 's long jump and 1500 meters , as well as in the men 's 5000 meters. hf / dpa / reuters editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i regret that the board has not after all taken a decision , " karl-theodor zu guttenberg was quoted as saying by the online edition of the hamburger abendblatt newspaper on saturday , aug .
22 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's guttenberg is disappointed by the news coming from detroit the german government had " provided gm with all the necessary information , " the minister added . the 100-year-old company , once the world 's largest automaker , is feeling the heat from the german government which wants it to sell opel to magna international , a canadian auto parts manufacturer backed by state-owned russian bank sberbank . but gm 's newly-appointed board at a meeting on friday in detroit failed to support the magna sale , backed by its executives , because of a rival bid from belgian investor rhj international . " the gm board of directors met today to discuss options for opel , " gm spokeswoman karin kirchner said in a statement late on friday .
" no decision was taken . " an anonymous source familiar with the situation told the wall street journal that board chair edward whitacre had argued that the offer from rhj should be taken more seriously . according to the source , gm 's board opted to ask the german government for more information on state financing for a deal with rhj . gm itself emerged from bankruptcy in july after wiping out $ 47 billion -lrb- 33 billion euros -rrb- in debt in a restructuring that left it majority-owned by the us government . setback for german government 's plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magna 's stronach has already agreed a deal with opel the news is a setback to the german government and opel 's 25,000 german employees , who were expecting opel 's life-saving sale to magna to be confirmed at the gm board meeting .
economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg was quoted on thursday as expecting " a clear signal " on the future of opel to emerge at friday 's conference . magna 's bid for opel is backed by the german government , which has offered a financial incentive of $ 6.4 billion .
but germany set out tough financial requirements for gm , asking for help with dealing with opel 's possible deficit of $ 1.7 billion . chancellor angela merkel told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper on thursday that magna 's experience in the auto industry and its " better concept " for opel made it a superior buyer than rhj .
facing elections next month , merkel is convinced a deal with magna would be the best option to save jobs . complicated deal but it is precisely magna 's expertise that considerably complicates the deal for gm .
should gm approve a sale to magna , keeping only a minority stake of 35 percent , it would lose most of its influence on opel 's production and distribution in europe . on top of this , magna 's bid also includes a 27.5-percent stake for the russian state bank sberbank , with russian carmaker gaz as an industrial partner holding the option to buy sberbank 's stake .
gm 's board fears that a deal with magna would therefore create a serious competitor not only in the european automobile market , but the growing russian market .
a deal with magna would also rule out the option of opel 's eventual re-absorption into gm . the offer of financial investor rhj is much friendlier .
according to reports , rhj would allow gm to keep control of the technological side of opel , and to retain the possibility of re-acquiring its european subsidiary in a more secure future financial climate . " if you want to know why the board is agonizing over this decision , take a look at the competing spheres of interest , " summed up one commentator in news magazine der spiegel , " either gm surrenders its access to opel , or it loses the money from the german government .

a texas oil executive says his company was one of several that bought stolen mexican petroleum and sold the illicit products to large corporations including german chemical giant basf . basf spokesman daniel pepitone said the company has received a subpoena from the american justice department and is cooperating with authorities to clear up the case .
he confirmed that basf did business with trammo petroleum , but said , " we have no reason to believe that basf had any involvement in the alleged wrongdoing . " according to court documents released on friday , houston-based president of trammo petroleum donald schroeder testified that he was contacted by two fuel company representatives from continental fuels and murphy energy .
" they told me they had some mexican condensate that they would like to sell , " he told the federal court in may . schroeder admitted that he bought and re-sold the liquid hydrocarbon condensate , a substance that refiners can blend with crude oil to produce fuel and other products , knowing that it had been stolen . current investigations indicate that the condensate was tapped from pipelines belonging to the mexican oil company pemex and smuggled into the usa by road tankers .
the oil was then collected at a port in brownsville , texas , from where it was delivered to customers including basf .
pemex , which is the only legal owner and exporter of mexican oil to the us , has been struggling for years to stop an endless series of illegal taps on its pipelines . schroeder is the first to be convicted as a result of the two-year cross-border investigation into oil smuggling from mexico tied to organized crime .

twenty years later , the former " baltic tigers " are trying to show courage in the face of recession . their hands stretching across forests and fields , standing along highways and country roads , as many as 2 million estonians , latvians and lithuanians joined in a 671-kilometer -lrb- 417-mile -rrb- human chain 20 years ago , looking forward to a better future .
but this year 's celebration of the baltic way , which showed the world the baltic countries ' desire for autonomy apart from the soviet union , is looking backward in an attempt to recapture that hope in difficult economic times .
the commemorations include exhibits and academic conferences , but the most hailed event is heartbeats for the baltics , a relay run along the baltic way route .
about 13,500 people will run in one-kilometer stretches , but organizers say anyone can join the relay along the way for any length .
the first runners left the estonian capital , tallinn , for the latvian capital of riga on saturday morning .
a second group of runners was scheduled to leave the lithuanian capital of vilnius later in the day and head north to meet the first group at riga 's freedom monument on sunday .
bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousands joined hands for the baltic way in 1989 the end of communism the baltic way human chain on aug .
23 , 1989 coincided with the 50th anniversary of the molotov-ribbentrop pact , which had divided the baltic states into spheres of influence and led to the eventual annexation by the soviet union in 1940 .
the participation of 2 million people , in a region whose population is around 7 million , would have been a significant accomplishment even if it had n't occurred under the shadow of soviet control .
" people are always looking to break records , but what we did , it was not a record attempt , " said nomeda marcenaite , who was there in 1989 .
" it was a spiritual thing , perhaps a spiritual record . "
putting on the running shoes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators along the 1989 baltic way latvian president valdis zatlers will be joining in on the last leg of the commemorative run on sunday .
the relay was his pet project , and he said that he hoped it would inspire the generation of people too young to remember the original event .
" we gave a clear signal : we are organized , we have overcome the molotov-ribbentrop pact and we are ready to go forward and be dynamic in a challenging world , " zatlers said .
" that 's the way balts do things . "
sixten sild , who helped organize this year 's event as chairman of the estonian orienteering association board , will be running three kilometers early sunday morning near the latvian-estonian border .
" i want to run there because 20 years ago that was where i stood in the baltic chain with my parents , " sild said .
his two adult sons will be participating as well .
fresh courage needed estonia and the other baltic states have been hit hard by the global financial crisis .
the european union 's statistical office eurostat counted the three countries ' economic performance as the worst in the euro zone .
lithuania 's economy has contracted 12.3 percent over the same quarter last year , estonia lost 3.7 percent , and latvia 1.6 percent .
estonia has had to raise sales taxes and make serious budget cuts , tough decisions which ultimately led to the collapse of its coalition government in may .
in latvia , unemployment has also soared to 16.7 percent .
the world bank estimates that the number of lithuanian families living in poverty could increase by 49 percent this year .
" it is once again very important to stand together and to show that we can reduce the negative consequences of the recession , undertake greater responsibilities , and be more courageous in dealing with the challenges of our age , " said lithuanian president dalia grybauskaite. svs / reuters / dpa / afp editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

twenty years later , the former " baltic tigers " are trying to show courage in the face of recession . their hands stretching across forests and fields , standing along highways and country roads , as many as 2 million estonians , latvians and lithuanians joined in a 671-kilometer -lrb- 417-mile -rrb- human chain 20 years ago , looking forward to a better future .
but this year 's celebration of the baltic way , which showed the world the baltic countries ' desire for autonomy apart from the soviet union , is looking backward in an attempt to recapture that hope in difficult economic times .
the commemorations include exhibits and academic conferences , but the most hailed event is heartbeats for the baltics , a relay run along the baltic way route .
about 13,500 people will run in one-kilometer stretches , but organizers say anyone can join the relay along the way for any length .
the first runners left the estonian capital , tallinn , for the latvian capital of riga on saturday morning .
a second group of runners was scheduled to leave the lithuanian capital of vilnius later in the day and head north to meet the first group at riga 's freedom monument on sunday .

the participation of 2 million people , in a region whose population is around 7 million , would have been a significant accomplishment even if it had n't occurred under the shadow of soviet control .
" people are always looking to break records , but what we did , it was not a record attempt , " said nomeda marcenaite , who was there in 1989 .
" it was a spiritual thing , perhaps a spiritual record . "

the relay was his pet project , and he said that he hoped it would inspire the generation of people too young to remember the original event .
" we gave a clear signal : we are organized , we have overcome the molotov-ribbentrop pact and we are ready to go forward and be dynamic in a challenging world , " zatlers said .
" that 's the way balts do things . "
sixten sild , who helped organize this year 's event as chairman of the estonian orienteering association board , will be running three kilometers early sunday morning near the latvian-estonian border .

estonia has had to raise sales taxes and make serious budget cuts , tough decisions which ultimately led to the collapse of its coalition government in may .
in latvia , unemployment has also soared to 16.7 percent .
the world bank estimates that the number of lithuanian families living in poverty could increase by 49 percent this year .

unesco now commemorates its hard-won struggle , but combatting the modern slavery prevalent in many societies today is equally challenging . " by institutionalizing memory , resisting the onset of oblivion , recalling the memory of a tragedy that for long years remained hidden or unrecognized , and by assigning it its proper place in the human conscience , we respond to our duty to remember , " unesco 's director-general said during the 2004 launch of the international year to commemorate the struggle to end the slave trade . slavery in the world today it has been over 200 years since the abolition of the trans-atlantic slave trade but , despite that , the practice still continues in various forms all over the world . in 2005 , the international labor organization estimated that just over 12 million people were working as forced laborers in the world . siddarth kara , in his book " sex trafficking : inside the business of modern slavery , " says that there were just over 28 million slaves worldwide in 2006 divided into three categories : bonded labor / debt bondage , forced labor and trafficking slaves .
according to kara , the profits generated worldwide by all forms of slavery in 2007 were just over $ 91 billion .
that is second only to drug trafficking in terms of global criminal activities .
" information on slavery is very inexact .
but we believe that the majority of slave victims - in the neighbourhood of 80 percent - are the female gender , and that around 50 percent are children .
we believe that the largest category of slavery is sex slavery .
this is not to minimize other large categories - domestic servitude slavery , forced labour in farms and factory slavery , child soldier slavery , " said john miller , director of the us state department ‘ s office for monitoring and combating trafficking in persons . bildunterschrift : young boys under forced labor working as fishermen in ghana having been sold by their impoverished parents " human trafficking is synonymous with slavery .
human trafficking relies on coercion and exploitation .
it thrives on converting hope to fear .
it 's maintained through violence .
the trade in people is a major source of revenue - in the billions -lsb- of dollars per year -rsb- - for organized crime , along with the drug trade and the arms trade .
let there be no misunderstanding , modern slavery plagues every country in the world - including the united states , " miller said . sex slavery endemic – an economic reality these days , human trafficking , otherwise known as sex slavery , is the fastest-growing form of organized crime in eastern europe .
sex trafficking has become a multi-billion dollar underground industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights watch is at the forefront of highlighting the evils of modern-day slavery tom porteous , the director of human rights watch in london , told deutsche welle that " the major factor contributing to sex slavery is supply and demand .
there is a huge demand for prostitution and an equally huge supply of participants because of the economic situation in the world . " an estimated half a million women are trafficked annually for the purpose of sex slavery .
they are exported to over 50 countries including germany , britain , italy , japan , canada and the united states .
sex slaves are smuggled taking a route known as the " eastern route " from eastern european countries , through poland and subsequently into european union countries .
the cities of prague , amsterdam , and frankfurt are common final destinations for the slaves . " the susceptibility of victims despite the publicity focused on the issue is a question of economic reality and economic desperation .
the countries which provide the bulk of the victims in sex slavery are poor ; the victims are predominantly of the poorest countries , " said porteous . " enforcement of the law needs to be strengthened , along with the formation of international treaties that could properly deal with sex slavery . more information on the reality of the situation needs to be disseminated directly to the communities that provide the bulk of the supply in sex slavery i.e. the economically challenged , " he added . germany ’ s fight against sex slavery germany is known as a “ receiving country ” in the sex slavery industry ; a destination and transit country for the trade , with scores of victims coming in from eastern europe and also asia and africa .
berlin has in turn proven itself a leader in many aspects of the fight against modern slavery . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joerg ziercke , the president of germany 's criminal police office , says sex slavery remains a problem a spokesman for germany 's criminal police office told deutsche welle that , " since the strong rise in trafficking of sex slavery victims into germany in 2007 , the problem has steadied in the subsequent years .
sex slavery is still a problem and prosecution of those involved relies largely on identification by the victims . the victims of sex slavery these days are members of eu countries and are thus legally permitted to stay in germany if they so wish .
prosecution and curbing of this crime requires victims coming forward and identifying the criminals involved , achieving this would require efforts of both governmental and non-governmental organizations . " the basis of sex slavery , experts say , is economic .
the industry renders billions of dollars in revenue for its perpetrators and the reality of the victims , who are predominantly from economically-challenged countries accounts for their susceptibility to the trade . " there is anecdotal evidence suggesting that the economic crisis in the world has made the sex slavery problem even worse , " said tom porteous . author : faith thomas editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

pemex , which is the only legal owner and exporter of mexican oil to the us , has been struggling for years to stop an endless series of illegal taps on its pipelines . schroeder is the first to be convicted as a result of the two-year cross-border investigation into oil smuggling from mexico tied to organized crime .

" the history of flight and expulsion affects us all , " merkel told a crowd of several hundred members of an association for expellees .
" it is part of our national identity and shared cultural memory . "
merkel was speaking in berlin to members of the federation of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- on a day they recognize as the tag der heimat , or " day of the homeland . "
the bdv is moving forward with plans for a memorial and documentation center dedicated to the 12 to 14 million germans who were ejected or fled homes in eastern europe after the end of the war .
the center against expulsions , slated to occupy a floor of a berlin office building , will also incorporate the stories of other displaced groups throughout history .
it will cost around 30 million euros -lrb- $ 43 million -rrb- to build .
remembering with sensitivity merkel said those who left or were forced from homes in hungary , poland and then czechoslovakia should become " ambassadors of reconciliation , " having forsworn revenge and violence in the group 's charter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposed center against expulsions would also include information about other forced displacements in history .
however , merkel was careful to note that the suffering of those expelled was the direct result of germany 's own aggression and atrocities during world war ii .
she noted the need to be " sensitive in our arguments . "
" we will not forget : this was the undeniable result of a german war " and nazi tyranny , said merkel .
" we recognize our responsibility for the darkest chapter in german history . "
the league 's president , erika steinbach , is also a member of merkel 's christian democrats .
steinbach was dropped from a list of nominees for the memorial 's board in march due to strong objections from the polish government .

twenty years later , the former " baltic tigers " are trying to show courage in the face of recession . their hands stretching across forests and fields , standing along highways and country roads , as many as 2 million estonians , latvians and lithuanians joined in a 671-kilometer -lrb- 417-mile -rrb- human chain 20 years ago , looking forward to a better future .
but this year 's celebration of the baltic way , which showed the world the baltic countries ' desire for autonomy apart from the soviet union , is looking backward in an attempt to recapture that hope in difficult economic times .
the commemorations include exhibits and academic conferences , but the most hailed event is heartbeats for the baltics , a relay run along the baltic way route .
about 13,500 people will run in one-kilometer stretches , but organizers say anyone can join the relay along the way for any length .
the first runners left the estonian capital , tallinn , for the latvian capital of riga on saturday morning .
a second group of runners was scheduled to leave the lithuanian capital of vilnius later in the day and head north to meet the first group at riga 's freedom monument on sunday .

the participation of 2 million people , in a region whose population is around 7 million , would have been a significant accomplishment even if it had n't occurred under the shadow of soviet control .
" people are always looking to break records , but what we did , it was not a record attempt , " said nomeda marcenaite , who was there in 1989 .
" it was a spiritual thing , perhaps a spiritual record . "
putting on the running shoes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators along the 1989 baltic way latvian president valdis zatlers will be joining in on the last leg of the commemorative run on sunday .
the relay was his pet project , and he said that he hoped it would inspire the generation of people too young to remember the original event .
" we gave a clear signal : we are organized , we have overcome the molotov-ribbentrop pact and we are ready to go forward and be dynamic in a challenging world , " zatlers said .
" that 's the way balts do things . "
sixten sild , who helped organize this year 's event as chairman of the estonian orienteering association board , will be running three kilometers early sunday morning near the latvian-estonian border .
" i want to run there because 20 years ago that was where i stood in the baltic chain with my parents , " sild said .
his two adult sons will be participating as well .
fresh courage needed estonia and the other baltic states have been hit hard by the global financial crisis .
the european union 's statistical office eurostat counted the three countries ' economic performance as the worst in the euro zone .
lithuania 's economy has contracted 12.3 percent over the same quarter last year , estonia lost 3.7 percent , and latvia 1.6 percent .
estonia has had to raise sales taxes and make serious budget cuts , tough decisions which ultimately led to the collapse of its coalition government in may .
in latvia , unemployment has also soared to 16.7 percent .
the world bank estimates that the number of lithuanian families living in poverty could increase by 49 percent this year .
" it is once again very important to stand together and to show that we can reduce the negative consequences of the recession , undertake greater responsibilities , and be more courageous in dealing with the challenges of our age , " said lithuanian president dalia grybauskaite. svs / reuters / dpa / afp editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in hungary , presidential spokeswoman szilvia szotak told the local news agency mti that solyom would not enter slovak territory .
" he will make a statement on the hungarian side of the border , " she said .
august 21 is remembered here as the day in 1968 when what was then czechoslovakia was occupied by warsaw pact troops - including hungary 's - to crush the " prague spring " reform drive by the country 's communist leadership .
solyom was scheduled to attend the unveiling of a statue of stephen , a medieval king of hungary , in the southern slovak town of komarno .
the hungarian town of komarom lies on the southern bank of the river danube , which marks the two countries ' border .
hungarians make up 10 percent of slovakia 's population of 5.4 million people , mostly living along the frontier .
" komarno lies in slovakia 's territory , it 's not a hungarian town , " slovak prime minister robert fico told reporters earlier friday , adding that solyom would be welcome at any other time , but that coming on august 21 was " mere provocation " .
" he wants to spark a conflict , we want to avoid it , " fico insisted .
hungarian president barred fico had said that the slovak foreign ministry had handed a diplomatic note to the hungarian ambassador saying slovakia would not let solyom in .
" if he decides to ignore the note it would be a violation of international law and slovakia 's sovereignty , " fico warned .
" we wo n't prevent him from crossing the border by force .
we want to behave in a diplomatic way , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fico accused solyom of wanting to start a conflict on tuesday , fico , slovak president ivan gasparovic and parliamentary speaker pavol paska had issued a sharply-worded joint statement saying solyom would not be welcome in slovakia and described his planned trip as " insensitive and tactless " .
solyom was invited by komarno mayor tibor bastrnak , who is a member of slovakia 's opposition ethnic-hungarian smk party .
critics have noted that the mayor failed to invite slovak leaders , allegedly paving the way for the dispute - but in tuesday 's statement , the leaders had also blasted solyom for allegedly failing to show any interest in meeting with them .
the past is deeply sensitive for slovakia , which was ruled by hungary for centuries and has only been an independent state since czechoslovakia split in 1993 . but the spat also hinges on a present-day dispute .

" the history of flight and expulsion affects us all , " merkel told a crowd of several hundred members of an association for expellees .
" it is part of our national identity and shared cultural memory . "
merkel was speaking in berlin to members of the federation of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- on a day they recognize as the tag der heimat , or " day of the homeland . "
the bdv is moving forward with plans for a memorial and documentation center dedicated to the 12 to 14 million germans who were ejected or fled homes in eastern europe after the end of the war .
the center against expulsions , slated to occupy a floor of a berlin office building , will also incorporate the stories of other displaced groups throughout history .
it will cost around 30 million euros -lrb- $ 43 million -rrb- to build .
remembering with sensitivity merkel said those who left or were forced from homes in hungary , poland and then czechoslovakia should become " ambassadors of reconciliation , " having forsworn revenge and violence in the group 's charter .

however , merkel was careful to note that the suffering of those expelled was the direct result of germany 's own aggression and atrocities during world war ii .
she noted the need to be " sensitive in our arguments . "
" we will not forget : this was the undeniable result of a german war " and nazi tyranny , said merkel .
" we recognize our responsibility for the darkest chapter in german history . "
the league 's president , erika steinbach , is also a member of merkel 's christian democrats .
steinbach was dropped from a list of nominees for the memorial 's board in march due to strong objections from the polish government .

in hungary , presidential spokeswoman szilvia szotak told the local news agency mti that solyom would not enter slovak territory .
" he will make a statement on the hungarian side of the border , " she said .
august 21 is remembered here as the day in 1968 when what was then czechoslovakia was occupied by warsaw pact troops - including hungary 's - to crush the " prague spring " reform drive by the country 's communist leadership .
solyom was scheduled to attend the unveiling of a statue of stephen , a medieval king of hungary , in the southern slovak town of komarno .
the hungarian town of komarom lies on the southern bank of the river danube , which marks the two countries ' border .
hungarians make up 10 percent of slovakia 's population of 5.4 million people , mostly living along the frontier .
" komarno lies in slovakia 's territory , it 's not a hungarian town , " slovak prime minister robert fico told reporters earlier friday , adding that solyom would be welcome at any other time , but that coming on august 21 was " mere provocation " .
" he wants to spark a conflict , we want to avoid it , " fico insisted .
hungarian president barred fico had said that the slovak foreign ministry had handed a diplomatic note to the hungarian ambassador saying slovakia would not let solyom in .
" if he decides to ignore the note it would be a violation of international law and slovakia 's sovereignty , " fico warned .
" we wo n't prevent him from crossing the border by force .
we want to behave in a diplomatic way , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fico accused solyom of wanting to start a conflict on tuesday , fico , slovak president ivan gasparovic and parliamentary speaker pavol paska had issued a sharply-worded joint statement saying solyom would not be welcome in slovakia and described his planned trip as " insensitive and tactless " .
solyom was invited by komarno mayor tibor bastrnak , who is a member of slovakia 's opposition ethnic-hungarian smk party .
critics have noted that the mayor failed to invite slovak leaders , allegedly paving the way for the dispute - but in tuesday 's statement , the leaders had also blasted solyom for allegedly failing to show any interest in meeting with them .
the past is deeply sensitive for slovakia , which was ruled by hungary for centuries and has only been an independent state since czechoslovakia split in 1993 . but the spat also hinges on a present-day dispute .
hungary has protested to the united nations over slovakia 's new language law , which it dubs discriminatory to the hungarian minority - a move blasted by slovakia 's leaders .
the law slaps fines of up to 5,000 euros -lrb- $ 7,000 -rrb- on the use of minority languages in government and other public services .
ties between the two ex-soviet bloc neighbors , both of whom joined the european union in 2004 , have been tense since 2006 when the far-right sns party , known for its antipathy towards minorities , entered the government steered by fico 's left-wing populist smer party .
both hungary and slovakia are also members of europe 's schengen zone , where frontier controls have been dropped to smooth cross-border travel. nda / afp / ap editor : andy valvur send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" fair - generally what we have observed was considered by our observers with our methodology good and fair , " he added , stressing it was still early days in assessing the presidential and provincial council elections .
the election , which took place on thursday , has been widely hailed as a success by the international community , which has pumped billions into afghanistan and deployed 100,000 troops to contain a taliban insurgency .
" we can say it is a victory , a victory for the afghan people , " morillon told a news conference in kabul .

" election day was marred by a number of violent incidents , including rocket attacks and explosions targeting polling centres and government facilities throughout the country , " the statement said .
the taliban call on afghans to boycott the vote was " supplemented by an increasing number of attacks , resulting in civilian injuries and deaths . "
" despite these significant deterrents , afghan citizens came out to cast their votes , " it said , adding : " that the election took place at all is a notable achievement . "
president hamid karzai and his main rival , former foreign minister abdullah abdullah , have both cited figures from their own election observers across the country as showing them in the lead .

a texas oil executive says his company was one of several that bought stolen mexican petroleum and sold the illicit products to large corporations including german chemical giant basf . basf spokesman daniel pepitone said the company has received a subpoena from the american justice department and is cooperating with authorities to clear up the case .
he confirmed that basf did business with trammo petroleum , but said , " we have no reason to believe that basf had any involvement in the alleged wrongdoing . " according to court documents released on friday , houston-based president of trammo petroleum donald schroeder testified that he was contacted by two fuel company representatives from continental fuels and murphy energy .
" they told me they had some mexican condensate that they would like to sell , " he told the federal court in may . schroeder admitted that he bought and re-sold the liquid hydrocarbon condensate , a substance that refiners can blend with crude oil to produce fuel and other products , knowing that it had been stolen . current investigations indicate that the condensate was tapped from pipelines belonging to the mexican oil company pemex and smuggled into the usa by road tankers .
the oil was then collected at a port in brownsville , texas , from where it was delivered to customers including basf .
pemex , which is the only legal owner and exporter of mexican oil to the us , has been struggling for years to stop an endless series of illegal taps on its pipelines . schroeder is the first to be convicted as a result of the two-year cross-border investigation into oil smuggling from mexico tied to organized crime .

" i regret that the board has not after all taken a decision , " karl-theodor zu guttenberg was quoted as saying by the online edition of the hamburger abendblatt newspaper on saturday , aug .
22 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's guttenberg is disappointed by the news coming from detroit the german government had " provided gm with all the necessary information , " the minister added . the 100-year-old company , once the world 's largest automaker , is feeling the heat from the german government which wants it to sell opel to magna international , a canadian auto parts manufacturer backed by state-owned russian bank sberbank . but gm 's newly-appointed board at a meeting on friday in detroit failed to support the magna sale , backed by its executives , because of a rival bid from belgian investor rhj international . " the gm board of directors met today to discuss options for opel , " gm spokeswoman karin kirchner said in a statement late on friday .
" no decision was taken . " an anonymous source familiar with the situation told the wall street journal that board chair edward whitacre had argued that the offer from rhj should be taken more seriously . according to the source , gm 's board opted to ask the german government for more information on state financing for a deal with rhj . gm itself emerged from bankruptcy in july after wiping out $ 47 billion -lrb- 33 billion euros -rrb- in debt in a restructuring that left it majority-owned by the us government . setback for german government 's plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magna 's stronach has already agreed a deal with opel the news is a setback to the german government and opel 's 25,000 german employees , who were expecting opel 's life-saving sale to magna to be confirmed at the gm board meeting .
economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg was quoted on thursday as expecting " a clear signal " on the future of opel to emerge at friday 's conference . magna 's bid for opel is backed by the german government , which has offered a financial incentive of $ 6.4 billion .
but germany set out tough financial requirements for gm , asking for help with dealing with opel 's possible deficit of $ 1.7 billion . chancellor angela merkel told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper on thursday that magna 's experience in the auto industry and its " better concept " for opel made it a superior buyer than rhj .
facing elections next month , merkel is convinced a deal with magna would be the best option to save jobs . complicated deal but it is precisely magna 's expertise that considerably complicates the deal for gm .
should gm approve a sale to magna , keeping only a minority stake of 35 percent , it would lose most of its influence on opel 's production and distribution in europe . on top of this , magna 's bid also includes a 27.5-percent stake for the russian state bank sberbank , with russian carmaker gaz as an industrial partner holding the option to buy sberbank 's stake .
gm 's board fears that a deal with magna would therefore create a serious competitor not only in the european automobile market , but the growing russian market .
a deal with magna would also rule out the option of opel 's eventual re-absorption into gm . the offer of financial investor rhj is much friendlier .
according to reports , rhj would allow gm to keep control of the technological side of opel , and to retain the possibility of re-acquiring its european subsidiary in a more secure future financial climate . " if you want to know why the board is agonizing over this decision , take a look at the competing spheres of interest , " summed up one commentator in news magazine der spiegel , " either gm surrenders its access to opel , or it loses the money from the german government .

" i regret that the board has not after all taken a decision , " karl-theodor zu guttenberg was quoted as saying by the online edition of the hamburger abendblatt newspaper on saturday , aug .
22 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's guttenberg is disappointed by the news coming from detroit the german government had " provided gm with all the necessary information , " the minister added . the 100-year-old company , once the world 's largest automaker , is feeling the heat from the german government which wants it to sell opel to magna international , a canadian auto parts manufacturer backed by state-owned russian bank sberbank . but gm 's newly-appointed board at a meeting on friday in detroit failed to support the magna sale , backed by its executives , because of a rival bid from belgian investor rhj international . " the gm board of directors met today to discuss options for opel , " gm spokeswoman karin kirchner said in a statement late on friday .
" no decision was taken . " an anonymous source familiar with the situation told the wall street journal that board chair edward whitacre had argued that the offer from rhj should be taken more seriously . according to the source , gm 's board opted to ask the german government for more information on state financing for a deal with rhj . gm itself emerged from bankruptcy in july after wiping out $ 47 billion -lrb- 33 billion euros -rrb- in debt in a restructuring that left it majority-owned by the us government . setback for german government 's plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magna 's stronach has already agreed a deal with opel the news is a setback to the german government and opel 's 25,000 german employees , who were expecting opel 's life-saving sale to magna to be confirmed at the gm board meeting .
economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg was quoted on thursday as expecting " a clear signal " on the future of opel to emerge at friday 's conference . magna 's bid for opel is backed by the german government , which has offered a financial incentive of $ 6.4 billion .
but germany set out tough financial requirements for gm , asking for help with dealing with opel 's possible deficit of $ 1.7 billion . chancellor angela merkel told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper on thursday that magna 's experience in the auto industry and its " better concept " for opel made it a superior buyer than rhj .
facing elections next month , merkel is convinced a deal with magna would be the best option to save jobs . complicated deal but it is precisely magna 's expertise that considerably complicates the deal for gm .
should gm approve a sale to magna , keeping only a minority stake of 35 percent , it would lose most of its influence on opel 's production and distribution in europe . on top of this , magna 's bid also includes a 27.5-percent stake for the russian state bank sberbank , with russian carmaker gaz as an industrial partner holding the option to buy sberbank 's stake .
gm 's board fears that a deal with magna would therefore create a serious competitor not only in the european automobile market , but the growing russian market .
a deal with magna would also rule out the option of opel 's eventual re-absorption into gm . the offer of financial investor rhj is much friendlier .
according to reports , rhj would allow gm to keep control of the technological side of opel , and to retain the possibility of re-acquiring its european subsidiary in a more secure future financial climate . " if you want to know why the board is agonizing over this decision , take a look at the competing spheres of interest , " summed up one commentator in news magazine der spiegel , " either gm surrenders its access to opel , or it loses the money from the german government .
the question : which is costlier ? " european branches watch opel saga with bated breath bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel workers fear for their jobs if a deal is not reached the sale of opel is being keenly watched , as billions of euros in government aid are riding on the outcome , as are the jobs of thousands of opel workers in europe . apart from its 25,000 german employees in four major plants , making everything from three-door corsa subcompacts to zafira vans , there are two key opel factories that produce cars under the vauxhall badge in the uk . opel has other facilities in belgium , poland and spain . no date has been set for another gm board meeting or a deadline for a decision .
the alternative to a sale of opel would be insolvency , analysts have said . bk / reuters / afp editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in hungary , presidential spokeswoman szilvia szotak told the local news agency mti that solyom would not enter slovak territory .
" he will make a statement on the hungarian side of the border , " she said .
august 21 is remembered here as the day in 1968 when what was then czechoslovakia was occupied by warsaw pact troops - including hungary 's - to crush the " prague spring " reform drive by the country 's communist leadership .
solyom was scheduled to attend the unveiling of a statue of stephen , a medieval king of hungary , in the southern slovak town of komarno .
the hungarian town of komarom lies on the southern bank of the river danube , which marks the two countries ' border .
hungarians make up 10 percent of slovakia 's population of 5.4 million people , mostly living along the frontier .
" komarno lies in slovakia 's territory , it 's not a hungarian town , " slovak prime minister robert fico told reporters earlier friday , adding that solyom would be welcome at any other time , but that coming on august 21 was " mere provocation " .
" he wants to spark a conflict , we want to avoid it , " fico insisted .
hungarian president barred fico had said that the slovak foreign ministry had handed a diplomatic note to the hungarian ambassador saying slovakia would not let solyom in .
" if he decides to ignore the note it would be a violation of international law and slovakia 's sovereignty , " fico warned .
" we wo n't prevent him from crossing the border by force .
we want to behave in a diplomatic way , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fico accused solyom of wanting to start a conflict on tuesday , fico , slovak president ivan gasparovic and parliamentary speaker pavol paska had issued a sharply-worded joint statement saying solyom would not be welcome in slovakia and described his planned trip as " insensitive and tactless " .
solyom was invited by komarno mayor tibor bastrnak , who is a member of slovakia 's opposition ethnic-hungarian smk party .
critics have noted that the mayor failed to invite slovak leaders , allegedly paving the way for the dispute - but in tuesday 's statement , the leaders had also blasted solyom for allegedly failing to show any interest in meeting with them .
the past is deeply sensitive for slovakia , which was ruled by hungary for centuries and has only been an independent state since czechoslovakia split in 1993 . but the spat also hinges on a present-day dispute .
hungary has protested to the united nations over slovakia 's new language law , which it dubs discriminatory to the hungarian minority - a move blasted by slovakia 's leaders .
the law slaps fines of up to 5,000 euros -lrb- $ 7,000 -rrb- on the use of minority languages in government and other public services .
ties between the two ex-soviet bloc neighbors , both of whom joined the european union in 2004 , have been tense since 2006 when the far-right sns party , known for its antipathy towards minorities , entered the government steered by fico 's left-wing populist smer party .
both hungary and slovakia are also members of europe 's schengen zone , where frontier controls have been dropped to smooth cross-border travel. nda / afp / ap editor : andy valvur send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" no decision was taken . " an anonymous source familiar with the situation told the wall street journal that board chair edward whitacre had argued that the offer from rhj should be taken more seriously . according to the source , gm 's board opted to ask the german government for more information on state financing for a deal with rhj . gm itself emerged from bankruptcy in july after wiping out $ 47 billion -lrb- 33 billion euros -rrb- in debt in a restructuring that left it majority-owned by the us government . setback for german government 's plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magna 's stronach has already agreed a deal with opel the news is a setback to the german government and opel 's 25,000 german employees , who were expecting opel 's life-saving sale to magna to be confirmed at the gm board meeting .

should gm approve a sale to magna , keeping only a minority stake of 35 percent , it would lose most of its influence on opel 's production and distribution in europe . on top of this , magna 's bid also includes a 27.5-percent stake for the russian state bank sberbank , with russian carmaker gaz as an industrial partner holding the option to buy sberbank 's stake .

a texas oil executive says his company was one of several that bought stolen mexican petroleum and sold the illicit products to large corporations including german chemical giant basf . basf spokesman daniel pepitone said the company has received a subpoena from the american justice department and is cooperating with authorities to clear up the case .
he confirmed that basf did business with trammo petroleum , but said , " we have no reason to believe that basf had any involvement in the alleged wrongdoing . " according to court documents released on friday , houston-based president of trammo petroleum donald schroeder testified that he was contacted by two fuel company representatives from continental fuels and murphy energy .
" they told me they had some mexican condensate that they would like to sell , " he told the federal court in may . schroeder admitted that he bought and re-sold the liquid hydrocarbon condensate , a substance that refiners can blend with crude oil to produce fuel and other products , knowing that it had been stolen . current investigations indicate that the condensate was tapped from pipelines belonging to the mexican oil company pemex and smuggled into the usa by road tankers .
the oil was then collected at a port in brownsville , texas , from where it was delivered to customers including basf .
pemex , which is the only legal owner and exporter of mexican oil to the us , has been struggling for years to stop an endless series of illegal taps on its pipelines . schroeder is the first to be convicted as a result of the two-year cross-border investigation into oil smuggling from mexico tied to organized crime .

a texas oil executive says his company was one of several that bought stolen mexican petroleum and sold the illicit products to large corporations including german chemical giant basf . basf spokesman daniel pepitone said the company has received a subpoena from the american justice department and is cooperating with authorities to clear up the case .
he confirmed that basf did business with trammo petroleum , but said , " we have no reason to believe that basf had any involvement in the alleged wrongdoing . " according to court documents released on friday , houston-based president of trammo petroleum donald schroeder testified that he was contacted by two fuel company representatives from continental fuels and murphy energy .
" they told me they had some mexican condensate that they would like to sell , " he told the federal court in may . schroeder admitted that he bought and re-sold the liquid hydrocarbon condensate , a substance that refiners can blend with crude oil to produce fuel and other products , knowing that it had been stolen . current investigations indicate that the condensate was tapped from pipelines belonging to the mexican oil company pemex and smuggled into the usa by road tankers .
the oil was then collected at a port in brownsville , texas , from where it was delivered to customers including basf .
pemex , which is the only legal owner and exporter of mexican oil to the us , has been struggling for years to stop an endless series of illegal taps on its pipelines . schroeder is the first to be convicted as a result of the two-year cross-border investigation into oil smuggling from mexico tied to organized crime .
he has already paid a fine of $ 2 million -lrb- 1.4 million euros -rrb- while he awaits his sentencing december . bk / ap / apa editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel was speaking in berlin to members of the federation of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- on a day they recognize as the tag der heimat , or " day of the homeland . "
the bdv is moving forward with plans for a memorial and documentation center dedicated to the 12 to 14 million germans who were ejected or fled homes in eastern europe after the end of the war .
the center against expulsions , slated to occupy a floor of a berlin office building , will also incorporate the stories of other displaced groups throughout history .

unesco now commemorates its hard-won struggle , but combatting the modern slavery prevalent in many societies today is equally challenging . " by institutionalizing memory , resisting the onset of oblivion , recalling the memory of a tragedy that for long years remained hidden or unrecognized , and by assigning it its proper place in the human conscience , we respond to our duty to remember , " unesco 's director-general said during the 2004 launch of the international year to commemorate the struggle to end the slave trade . slavery in the world today it has been over 200 years since the abolition of the trans-atlantic slave trade but , despite that , the practice still continues in various forms all over the world . in 2005 , the international labor organization estimated that just over 12 million people were working as forced laborers in the world . siddarth kara , in his book " sex trafficking : inside the business of modern slavery , " says that there were just over 28 million slaves worldwide in 2006 divided into three categories : bonded labor / debt bondage , forced labor and trafficking slaves .
according to kara , the profits generated worldwide by all forms of slavery in 2007 were just over $ 91 billion .
that is second only to drug trafficking in terms of global criminal activities .
" information on slavery is very inexact .
but we believe that the majority of slave victims - in the neighbourhood of 80 percent - are the female gender , and that around 50 percent are children .
we believe that the largest category of slavery is sex slavery .
this is not to minimize other large categories - domestic servitude slavery , forced labour in farms and factory slavery , child soldier slavery , " said john miller , director of the us state department ‘ s office for monitoring and combating trafficking in persons . bildunterschrift : young boys under forced labor working as fishermen in ghana having been sold by their impoverished parents " human trafficking is synonymous with slavery .
human trafficking relies on coercion and exploitation .
it thrives on converting hope to fear .
it 's maintained through violence .
the trade in people is a major source of revenue - in the billions -lsb- of dollars per year -rsb- - for organized crime , along with the drug trade and the arms trade .
let there be no misunderstanding , modern slavery plagues every country in the world - including the united states , " miller said . sex slavery endemic – an economic reality these days , human trafficking , otherwise known as sex slavery , is the fastest-growing form of organized crime in eastern europe .
sex trafficking has become a multi-billion dollar underground industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights watch is at the forefront of highlighting the evils of modern-day slavery tom porteous , the director of human rights watch in london , told deutsche welle that " the major factor contributing to sex slavery is supply and demand .
there is a huge demand for prostitution and an equally huge supply of participants because of the economic situation in the world . " an estimated half a million women are trafficked annually for the purpose of sex slavery .
they are exported to over 50 countries including germany , britain , italy , japan , canada and the united states .
sex slaves are smuggled taking a route known as the " eastern route " from eastern european countries , through poland and subsequently into european union countries .
the cities of prague , amsterdam , and frankfurt are common final destinations for the slaves . " the susceptibility of victims despite the publicity focused on the issue is a question of economic reality and economic desperation .
the countries which provide the bulk of the victims in sex slavery are poor ; the victims are predominantly of the poorest countries , " said porteous . " enforcement of the law needs to be strengthened , along with the formation of international treaties that could properly deal with sex slavery . more information on the reality of the situation needs to be disseminated directly to the communities that provide the bulk of the supply in sex slavery i.e. the economically challenged , " he added . germany ’ s fight against sex slavery germany is known as a “ receiving country ” in the sex slavery industry ; a destination and transit country for the trade , with scores of victims coming in from eastern europe and also asia and africa .
berlin has in turn proven itself a leader in many aspects of the fight against modern slavery . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joerg ziercke , the president of germany 's criminal police office , says sex slavery remains a problem a spokesman for germany 's criminal police office told deutsche welle that , " since the strong rise in trafficking of sex slavery victims into germany in 2007 , the problem has steadied in the subsequent years .
sex slavery is still a problem and prosecution of those involved relies largely on identification by the victims . the victims of sex slavery these days are members of eu countries and are thus legally permitted to stay in germany if they so wish .
prosecution and curbing of this crime requires victims coming forward and identifying the criminals involved , achieving this would require efforts of both governmental and non-governmental organizations . " the basis of sex slavery , experts say , is economic .
the industry renders billions of dollars in revenue for its perpetrators and the reality of the victims , who are predominantly from economically-challenged countries accounts for their susceptibility to the trade . " there is anecdotal evidence suggesting that the economic crisis in the world has made the sex slavery problem even worse , " said tom porteous . author : faith thomas editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in hungary , presidential spokeswoman szilvia szotak told the local news agency mti that solyom would not enter slovak territory .
" he will make a statement on the hungarian side of the border , " she said .
august 21 is remembered here as the day in 1968 when what was then czechoslovakia was occupied by warsaw pact troops - including hungary 's - to crush the " prague spring " reform drive by the country 's communist leadership .
solyom was scheduled to attend the unveiling of a statue of stephen , a medieval king of hungary , in the southern slovak town of komarno .
the hungarian town of komarom lies on the southern bank of the river danube , which marks the two countries ' border .
hungarians make up 10 percent of slovakia 's population of 5.4 million people , mostly living along the frontier .
" komarno lies in slovakia 's territory , it 's not a hungarian town , " slovak prime minister robert fico told reporters earlier friday , adding that solyom would be welcome at any other time , but that coming on august 21 was " mere provocation " .
" he wants to spark a conflict , we want to avoid it , " fico insisted .
hungarian president barred fico had said that the slovak foreign ministry had handed a diplomatic note to the hungarian ambassador saying slovakia would not let solyom in .
" if he decides to ignore the note it would be a violation of international law and slovakia 's sovereignty , " fico warned .

in hungary , presidential spokeswoman szilvia szotak told the local news agency mti that solyom would not enter slovak territory .
" he will make a statement on the hungarian side of the border , " she said .
august 21 is remembered here as the day in 1968 when what was then czechoslovakia was occupied by warsaw pact troops - including hungary 's - to crush the " prague spring " reform drive by the country 's communist leadership .
solyom was scheduled to attend the unveiling of a statue of stephen , a medieval king of hungary , in the southern slovak town of komarno .
the hungarian town of komarom lies on the southern bank of the river danube , which marks the two countries ' border .
hungarians make up 10 percent of slovakia 's population of 5.4 million people , mostly living along the frontier .
" komarno lies in slovakia 's territory , it 's not a hungarian town , " slovak prime minister robert fico told reporters earlier friday , adding that solyom would be welcome at any other time , but that coming on august 21 was " mere provocation " .
" he wants to spark a conflict , we want to avoid it , " fico insisted .
hungarian president barred fico had said that the slovak foreign ministry had handed a diplomatic note to the hungarian ambassador saying slovakia would not let solyom in .
" if he decides to ignore the note it would be a violation of international law and slovakia 's sovereignty , " fico warned .

in hungary , presidential spokeswoman szilvia szotak told the local news agency mti that solyom would not enter slovak territory .
" he will make a statement on the hungarian side of the border , " she said .
august 21 is remembered here as the day in 1968 when what was then czechoslovakia was occupied by warsaw pact troops - including hungary 's - to crush the " prague spring " reform drive by the country 's communist leadership .
solyom was scheduled to attend the unveiling of a statue of stephen , a medieval king of hungary , in the southern slovak town of komarno .
the hungarian town of komarom lies on the southern bank of the river danube , which marks the two countries ' border .
hungarians make up 10 percent of slovakia 's population of 5.4 million people , mostly living along the frontier .
" komarno lies in slovakia 's territory , it 's not a hungarian town , " slovak prime minister robert fico told reporters earlier friday , adding that solyom would be welcome at any other time , but that coming on august 21 was " mere provocation " .
" he wants to spark a conflict , we want to avoid it , " fico insisted .
hungarian president barred fico had said that the slovak foreign ministry had handed a diplomatic note to the hungarian ambassador saying slovakia would not let solyom in .
" if he decides to ignore the note it would be a violation of international law and slovakia 's sovereignty , " fico warned .
" we wo n't prevent him from crossing the border by force .
we want to behave in a diplomatic way , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fico accused solyom of wanting to start a conflict on tuesday , fico , slovak president ivan gasparovic and parliamentary speaker pavol paska had issued a sharply-worded joint statement saying solyom would not be welcome in slovakia and described his planned trip as " insensitive and tactless " .
solyom was invited by komarno mayor tibor bastrnak , who is a member of slovakia 's opposition ethnic-hungarian smk party .
critics have noted that the mayor failed to invite slovak leaders , allegedly paving the way for the dispute - but in tuesday 's statement , the leaders had also blasted solyom for allegedly failing to show any interest in meeting with them .
the past is deeply sensitive for slovakia , which was ruled by hungary for centuries and has only been an independent state since czechoslovakia split in 1993 . but the spat also hinges on a present-day dispute .
hungary has protested to the united nations over slovakia 's new language law , which it dubs discriminatory to the hungarian minority - a move blasted by slovakia 's leaders .
the law slaps fines of up to 5,000 euros -lrb- $ 7,000 -rrb- on the use of minority languages in government and other public services .
ties between the two ex-soviet bloc neighbors , both of whom joined the european union in 2004 , have been tense since 2006 when the far-right sns party , known for its antipathy towards minorities , entered the government steered by fico 's left-wing populist smer party .

a texas oil executive says his company was one of several that bought stolen mexican petroleum and sold the illicit products to large corporations including german chemical giant basf . basf spokesman daniel pepitone said the company has received a subpoena from the american justice department and is cooperating with authorities to clear up the case .
he confirmed that basf did business with trammo petroleum , but said , " we have no reason to believe that basf had any involvement in the alleged wrongdoing . " according to court documents released on friday , houston-based president of trammo petroleum donald schroeder testified that he was contacted by two fuel company representatives from continental fuels and murphy energy .
" they told me they had some mexican condensate that they would like to sell , " he told the federal court in may . schroeder admitted that he bought and re-sold the liquid hydrocarbon condensate , a substance that refiners can blend with crude oil to produce fuel and other products , knowing that it had been stolen . current investigations indicate that the condensate was tapped from pipelines belonging to the mexican oil company pemex and smuggled into the usa by road tankers .
the oil was then collected at a port in brownsville , texas , from where it was delivered to customers including basf .
pemex , which is the only legal owner and exporter of mexican oil to the us , has been struggling for years to stop an endless series of illegal taps on its pipelines . schroeder is the first to be convicted as a result of the two-year cross-border investigation into oil smuggling from mexico tied to organized crime .

" i regret that the board has not after all taken a decision , " karl-theodor zu guttenberg was quoted as saying by the online edition of the hamburger abendblatt newspaper on saturday , aug .
22 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's guttenberg is disappointed by the news coming from detroit the german government had " provided gm with all the necessary information , " the minister added . the 100-year-old company , once the world 's largest automaker , is feeling the heat from the german government which wants it to sell opel to magna international , a canadian auto parts manufacturer backed by state-owned russian bank sberbank . but gm 's newly-appointed board at a meeting on friday in detroit failed to support the magna sale , backed by its executives , because of a rival bid from belgian investor rhj international . " the gm board of directors met today to discuss options for opel , " gm spokeswoman karin kirchner said in a statement late on friday .
" no decision was taken . " an anonymous source familiar with the situation told the wall street journal that board chair edward whitacre had argued that the offer from rhj should be taken more seriously . according to the source , gm 's board opted to ask the german government for more information on state financing for a deal with rhj . gm itself emerged from bankruptcy in july after wiping out $ 47 billion -lrb- 33 billion euros -rrb- in debt in a restructuring that left it majority-owned by the us government . setback for german government 's plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magna 's stronach has already agreed a deal with opel the news is a setback to the german government and opel 's 25,000 german employees , who were expecting opel 's life-saving sale to magna to be confirmed at the gm board meeting .
economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg was quoted on thursday as expecting " a clear signal " on the future of opel to emerge at friday 's conference . magna 's bid for opel is backed by the german government , which has offered a financial incentive of $ 6.4 billion .
but germany set out tough financial requirements for gm , asking for help with dealing with opel 's possible deficit of $ 1.7 billion . chancellor angela merkel told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper on thursday that magna 's experience in the auto industry and its " better concept " for opel made it a superior buyer than rhj .
facing elections next month , merkel is convinced a deal with magna would be the best option to save jobs . complicated deal but it is precisely magna 's expertise that considerably complicates the deal for gm .
should gm approve a sale to magna , keeping only a minority stake of 35 percent , it would lose most of its influence on opel 's production and distribution in europe . on top of this , magna 's bid also includes a 27.5-percent stake for the russian state bank sberbank , with russian carmaker gaz as an industrial partner holding the option to buy sberbank 's stake .
gm 's board fears that a deal with magna would therefore create a serious competitor not only in the european automobile market , but the growing russian market .
a deal with magna would also rule out the option of opel 's eventual re-absorption into gm . the offer of financial investor rhj is much friendlier .
according to reports , rhj would allow gm to keep control of the technological side of opel , and to retain the possibility of re-acquiring its european subsidiary in a more secure future financial climate . " if you want to know why the board is agonizing over this decision , take a look at the competing spheres of interest , " summed up one commentator in news magazine der spiegel , " either gm surrenders its access to opel , or it loses the money from the german government .

" i regret that the board has not after all taken a decision , " karl-theodor zu guttenberg was quoted as saying by the online edition of the hamburger abendblatt newspaper on saturday , aug .
22 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's guttenberg is disappointed by the news coming from detroit the german government had " provided gm with all the necessary information , " the minister added . the 100-year-old company , once the world 's largest automaker , is feeling the heat from the german government which wants it to sell opel to magna international , a canadian auto parts manufacturer backed by state-owned russian bank sberbank . but gm 's newly-appointed board at a meeting on friday in detroit failed to support the magna sale , backed by its executives , because of a rival bid from belgian investor rhj international . " the gm board of directors met today to discuss options for opel , " gm spokeswoman karin kirchner said in a statement late on friday .
" no decision was taken . " an anonymous source familiar with the situation told the wall street journal that board chair edward whitacre had argued that the offer from rhj should be taken more seriously . according to the source , gm 's board opted to ask the german government for more information on state financing for a deal with rhj . gm itself emerged from bankruptcy in july after wiping out $ 47 billion -lrb- 33 billion euros -rrb- in debt in a restructuring that left it majority-owned by the us government . setback for german government 's plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magna 's stronach has already agreed a deal with opel the news is a setback to the german government and opel 's 25,000 german employees , who were expecting opel 's life-saving sale to magna to be confirmed at the gm board meeting .
economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg was quoted on thursday as expecting " a clear signal " on the future of opel to emerge at friday 's conference . magna 's bid for opel is backed by the german government , which has offered a financial incentive of $ 6.4 billion .
but germany set out tough financial requirements for gm , asking for help with dealing with opel 's possible deficit of $ 1.7 billion . chancellor angela merkel told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper on thursday that magna 's experience in the auto industry and its " better concept " for opel made it a superior buyer than rhj .
facing elections next month , merkel is convinced a deal with magna would be the best option to save jobs . complicated deal but it is precisely magna 's expertise that considerably complicates the deal for gm .
should gm approve a sale to magna , keeping only a minority stake of 35 percent , it would lose most of its influence on opel 's production and distribution in europe . on top of this , magna 's bid also includes a 27.5-percent stake for the russian state bank sberbank , with russian carmaker gaz as an industrial partner holding the option to buy sberbank 's stake .
gm 's board fears that a deal with magna would therefore create a serious competitor not only in the european automobile market , but the growing russian market .
a deal with magna would also rule out the option of opel 's eventual re-absorption into gm . the offer of financial investor rhj is much friendlier .
according to reports , rhj would allow gm to keep control of the technological side of opel , and to retain the possibility of re-acquiring its european subsidiary in a more secure future financial climate . " if you want to know why the board is agonizing over this decision , take a look at the competing spheres of interest , " summed up one commentator in news magazine der spiegel , " either gm surrenders its access to opel , or it loses the money from the german government .

" the history of flight and expulsion affects us all , " merkel told a crowd of several hundred members of an association for expellees .
" it is part of our national identity and shared cultural memory . "
merkel was speaking in berlin to members of the federation of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- on a day they recognize as the tag der heimat , or " day of the homeland . "
the bdv is moving forward with plans for a memorial and documentation center dedicated to the 12 to 14 million germans who were ejected or fled homes in eastern europe after the end of the war .
the center against expulsions , slated to occupy a floor of a berlin office building , will also incorporate the stories of other displaced groups throughout history .
it will cost around 30 million euros -lrb- $ 43 million -rrb- to build .
remembering with sensitivity merkel said those who left or were forced from homes in hungary , poland and then czechoslovakia should become " ambassadors of reconciliation , " having forsworn revenge and violence in the group 's charter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposed center against expulsions would also include information about other forced displacements in history .
however , merkel was careful to note that the suffering of those expelled was the direct result of germany 's own aggression and atrocities during world war ii .
she noted the need to be " sensitive in our arguments . "
" we will not forget : this was the undeniable result of a german war " and nazi tyranny , said merkel .
" we recognize our responsibility for the darkest chapter in german history . "
the league 's president , erika steinbach , is also a member of merkel 's christian democrats .
steinbach was dropped from a list of nominees for the memorial 's board in march due to strong objections from the polish government .
they have accused her of emphasizing expellees ' suffering over that of germany 's victims .
millions of poles were killed or forced from their homes following the german invasion in 1939. svs / dpa / epd / ap / dw editor : holly fox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 22.08.2009 germany regrets gm 's indecision regarding opel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opel crisis hangs heavy over the german government germany 's economics minister said on saturday he regretted that general motors ' board had failed to take a decision on a deal covering its european operations , including ailing german unit opel . " i regret that the board has not after all taken a decision , " karl-theodor zu guttenberg was quoted as saying by the online edition of the hamburger abendblatt newspaper on saturday , aug .
22 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's guttenberg is disappointed by the news coming from detroit the german government had " provided gm with all the necessary information , " the minister added . the 100-year-old company , once the world 's largest automaker , is feeling the heat from the german government which wants it to sell opel to magna international , a canadian auto parts manufacturer backed by state-owned russian bank sberbank . but gm 's newly-appointed board at a meeting on friday in detroit failed to support the magna sale , backed by its executives , because of a rival bid from belgian investor rhj international . " the gm board of directors met today to discuss options for opel , " gm spokeswoman karin kirchner said in a statement late on friday .
" no decision was taken . " an anonymous source familiar with the situation told the wall street journal that board chair edward whitacre had argued that the offer from rhj should be taken more seriously . according to the source , gm 's board opted to ask the german government for more information on state financing for a deal with rhj . gm itself emerged from bankruptcy in july after wiping out $ 47 billion -lrb- 33 billion euros -rrb- in debt in a restructuring that left it majority-owned by the us government . setback for german government 's plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magna 's stronach has already agreed a deal with opel the news is a setback to the german government and opel 's 25,000 german employees , who were expecting opel 's life-saving sale to magna to be confirmed at the gm board meeting .
economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg was quoted on thursday as expecting " a clear signal " on the future of opel to emerge at friday 's conference . magna 's bid for opel is backed by the german government , which has offered a financial incentive of $ 6.4 billion .
but germany set out tough financial requirements for gm , asking for help with dealing with opel 's possible deficit of $ 1.7 billion . chancellor angela merkel told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper on thursday that magna 's experience in the auto industry and its " better concept " for opel made it a superior buyer than rhj .
facing elections next month , merkel is convinced a deal with magna would be the best option to save jobs . complicated deal but it is precisely magna 's expertise that considerably complicates the deal for gm .
should gm approve a sale to magna , keeping only a minority stake of 35 percent , it would lose most of its influence on opel 's production and distribution in europe . on top of this , magna 's bid also includes a 27.5-percent stake for the russian state bank sberbank , with russian carmaker gaz as an industrial partner holding the option to buy sberbank 's stake .
gm 's board fears that a deal with magna would therefore create a serious competitor not only in the european automobile market , but the growing russian market .
a deal with magna would also rule out the option of opel 's eventual re-absorption into gm . the offer of financial investor rhj is much friendlier .
according to reports , rhj would allow gm to keep control of the technological side of opel , and to retain the possibility of re-acquiring its european subsidiary in a more secure future financial climate .

" i regret that the board has not after all taken a decision , " karl-theodor zu guttenberg was quoted as saying by the online edition of the hamburger abendblatt newspaper on saturday , aug .
22 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's guttenberg is disappointed by the news coming from detroit the german government had " provided gm with all the necessary information , " the minister added . the 100-year-old company , once the world 's largest automaker , is feeling the heat from the german government which wants it to sell opel to magna international , a canadian auto parts manufacturer backed by state-owned russian bank sberbank . but gm 's newly-appointed board at a meeting on friday in detroit failed to support the magna sale , backed by its executives , because of a rival bid from belgian investor rhj international . " the gm board of directors met today to discuss options for opel , " gm spokeswoman karin kirchner said in a statement late on friday .
" no decision was taken . " an anonymous source familiar with the situation told the wall street journal that board chair edward whitacre had argued that the offer from rhj should be taken more seriously . according to the source , gm 's board opted to ask the german government for more information on state financing for a deal with rhj . gm itself emerged from bankruptcy in july after wiping out $ 47 billion -lrb- 33 billion euros -rrb- in debt in a restructuring that left it majority-owned by the us government . setback for german government 's plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magna 's stronach has already agreed a deal with opel the news is a setback to the german government and opel 's 25,000 german employees , who were expecting opel 's life-saving sale to magna to be confirmed at the gm board meeting .
economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg was quoted on thursday as expecting " a clear signal " on the future of opel to emerge at friday 's conference . magna 's bid for opel is backed by the german government , which has offered a financial incentive of $ 6.4 billion .
but germany set out tough financial requirements for gm , asking for help with dealing with opel 's possible deficit of $ 1.7 billion . chancellor angela merkel told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper on thursday that magna 's experience in the auto industry and its " better concept " for opel made it a superior buyer than rhj .
facing elections next month , merkel is convinced a deal with magna would be the best option to save jobs . complicated deal but it is precisely magna 's expertise that considerably complicates the deal for gm .
should gm approve a sale to magna , keeping only a minority stake of 35 percent , it would lose most of its influence on opel 's production and distribution in europe . on top of this , magna 's bid also includes a 27.5-percent stake for the russian state bank sberbank , with russian carmaker gaz as an industrial partner holding the option to buy sberbank 's stake .
gm 's board fears that a deal with magna would therefore create a serious competitor not only in the european automobile market , but the growing russian market .
a deal with magna would also rule out the option of opel 's eventual re-absorption into gm . the offer of financial investor rhj is much friendlier .
according to reports , rhj would allow gm to keep control of the technological side of opel , and to retain the possibility of re-acquiring its european subsidiary in a more secure future financial climate . " if you want to know why the board is agonizing over this decision , take a look at the competing spheres of interest , " summed up one commentator in news magazine der spiegel , " either gm surrenders its access to opel , or it loses the money from the german government .
the question : which is costlier ?

but this year 's celebration of the baltic way , which showed the world the baltic countries ' desire for autonomy apart from the soviet union , is looking backward in an attempt to recapture that hope in difficult economic times .
the commemorations include exhibits and academic conferences , but the most hailed event is heartbeats for the baltics , a relay run along the baltic way route .
about 13,500 people will run in one-kilometer stretches , but organizers say anyone can join the relay along the way for any length .
the first runners left the estonian capital , tallinn , for the latvian capital of riga on saturday morning .

in latvia , unemployment has also soared to 16.7 percent .
the world bank estimates that the number of lithuanian families living in poverty could increase by 49 percent this year .
" it is once again very important to stand together and to show that we can reduce the negative consequences of the recession , undertake greater responsibilities , and be more courageous in dealing with the challenges of our age , " said lithuanian president dalia grybauskaite. svs / reuters / dpa / afp editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

twenty years later , the former " baltic tigers " are trying to show courage in the face of recession . their hands stretching across forests and fields , standing along highways and country roads , as many as 2 million estonians , latvians and lithuanians joined in a 671-kilometer -lrb- 417-mile -rrb- human chain 20 years ago , looking forward to a better future .
but this year 's celebration of the baltic way , which showed the world the baltic countries ' desire for autonomy apart from the soviet union , is looking backward in an attempt to recapture that hope in difficult economic times .
the commemorations include exhibits and academic conferences , but the most hailed event is heartbeats for the baltics , a relay run along the baltic way route .
about 13,500 people will run in one-kilometer stretches , but organizers say anyone can join the relay along the way for any length .
the first runners left the estonian capital , tallinn , for the latvian capital of riga on saturday morning .
a second group of runners was scheduled to leave the lithuanian capital of vilnius later in the day and head north to meet the first group at riga 's freedom monument on sunday .

23 , 1989 coincided with the 50th anniversary of the molotov-ribbentrop pact , which had divided the baltic states into spheres of influence and led to the eventual annexation by the soviet union in 1940 .
the participation of 2 million people , in a region whose population is around 7 million , would have been a significant accomplishment even if it had n't occurred under the shadow of soviet control .
" people are always looking to break records , but what we did , it was not a record attempt , " said nomeda marcenaite , who was there in 1989 .

the relay was his pet project , and he said that he hoped it would inspire the generation of people too young to remember the original event .
" we gave a clear signal : we are organized , we have overcome the molotov-ribbentrop pact and we are ready to go forward and be dynamic in a challenging world , " zatlers said .
" that 's the way balts do things . "
sixten sild , who helped organize this year 's event as chairman of the estonian orienteering association board , will be running three kilometers early sunday morning near the latvian-estonian border .
" i want to run there because 20 years ago that was where i stood in the baltic chain with my parents , " sild said .

lithuania 's economy has contracted 12.3 percent over the same quarter last year , estonia lost 3.7 percent , and latvia 1.6 percent .

twenty years later , the former " baltic tigers " are trying to show courage in the face of recession . their hands stretching across forests and fields , standing along highways and country roads , as many as 2 million estonians , latvians and lithuanians joined in a 671-kilometer -lrb- 417-mile -rrb- human chain 20 years ago , looking forward to a better future .
but this year 's celebration of the baltic way , which showed the world the baltic countries ' desire for autonomy apart from the soviet union , is looking backward in an attempt to recapture that hope in difficult economic times .
the commemorations include exhibits and academic conferences , but the most hailed event is heartbeats for the baltics , a relay run along the baltic way route .
about 13,500 people will run in one-kilometer stretches , but organizers say anyone can join the relay along the way for any length .
the first runners left the estonian capital , tallinn , for the latvian capital of riga on saturday morning .

the participation of 2 million people , in a region whose population is around 7 million , would have been a significant accomplishment even if it had n't occurred under the shadow of soviet control .
" people are always looking to break records , but what we did , it was not a record attempt , " said nomeda marcenaite , who was there in 1989 .

in latvia , unemployment has also soared to 16.7 percent .
the world bank estimates that the number of lithuanian families living in poverty could increase by 49 percent this year .

he confirmed that basf did business with trammo petroleum , but said , " we have no reason to believe that basf had any involvement in the alleged wrongdoing .

the oil was then collected at a port in brownsville , texas , from where it was delivered to customers including basf .
pemex , which is the only legal owner and exporter of mexican oil to the us , has been struggling for years to stop an endless series of illegal taps on its pipelines . schroeder is the first to be convicted as a result of the two-year cross-border investigation into oil smuggling from mexico tied to organized crime .

a texas oil executive says his company was one of several that bought stolen mexican petroleum and sold the illicit products to large corporations including german chemical giant basf . basf spokesman daniel pepitone said the company has received a subpoena from the american justice department and is cooperating with authorities to clear up the case .
he confirmed that basf did business with trammo petroleum , but said , " we have no reason to believe that basf had any involvement in the alleged wrongdoing . " according to court documents released on friday , houston-based president of trammo petroleum donald schroeder testified that he was contacted by two fuel company representatives from continental fuels and murphy energy .
" they told me they had some mexican condensate that they would like to sell , " he told the federal court in may . schroeder admitted that he bought and re-sold the liquid hydrocarbon condensate , a substance that refiners can blend with crude oil to produce fuel and other products , knowing that it had been stolen . current investigations indicate that the condensate was tapped from pipelines belonging to the mexican oil company pemex and smuggled into the usa by road tankers .
the oil was then collected at a port in brownsville , texas , from where it was delivered to customers including basf .
pemex , which is the only legal owner and exporter of mexican oil to the us , has been struggling for years to stop an endless series of illegal taps on its pipelines . schroeder is the first to be convicted as a result of the two-year cross-border investigation into oil smuggling from mexico tied to organized crime .
he has already paid a fine of $ 2 million -lrb- 1.4 million euros -rrb- while he awaits his sentencing december . bk / ap / apa editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the history of flight and expulsion affects us all , " merkel told a crowd of several hundred members of an association for expellees .
" it is part of our national identity and shared cultural memory . "
merkel was speaking in berlin to members of the federation of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- on a day they recognize as the tag der heimat , or " day of the homeland . "
the bdv is moving forward with plans for a memorial and documentation center dedicated to the 12 to 14 million germans who were ejected or fled homes in eastern europe after the end of the war .

she noted the need to be " sensitive in our arguments . "

" the history of flight and expulsion affects us all , " merkel told a crowd of several hundred members of an association for expellees .
" it is part of our national identity and shared cultural memory . "
merkel was speaking in berlin to members of the federation of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- on a day they recognize as the tag der heimat , or " day of the homeland . "
the bdv is moving forward with plans for a memorial and documentation center dedicated to the 12 to 14 million germans who were ejected or fled homes in eastern europe after the end of the war .
the center against expulsions , slated to occupy a floor of a berlin office building , will also incorporate the stories of other displaced groups throughout history .
it will cost around 30 million euros -lrb- $ 43 million -rrb- to build .
remembering with sensitivity merkel said those who left or were forced from homes in hungary , poland and then czechoslovakia should become " ambassadors of reconciliation , " having forsworn revenge and violence in the group 's charter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposed center against expulsions would also include information about other forced displacements in history .
however , merkel was careful to note that the suffering of those expelled was the direct result of germany 's own aggression and atrocities during world war ii .
she noted the need to be " sensitive in our arguments . "
" we will not forget : this was the undeniable result of a german war " and nazi tyranny , said merkel .
" we recognize our responsibility for the darkest chapter in german history . "
the league 's president , erika steinbach , is also a member of merkel 's christian democrats .
steinbach was dropped from a list of nominees for the memorial 's board in march due to strong objections from the polish government .
they have accused her of emphasizing expellees ' suffering over that of germany 's victims .

in the women 's 4x100 meters relay , the jamaicans also took gold , with 42.06 seconds .
both the men 's and women 's team effectively won by walkover , with their biggest rivals , the americans , missing from the competition .

" i regret that the board has not after all taken a decision , " karl-theodor zu guttenberg was quoted as saying by the online edition of the hamburger abendblatt newspaper on saturday , aug .
22 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's guttenberg is disappointed by the news coming from detroit the german government had " provided gm with all the necessary information , " the minister added . the 100-year-old company , once the world 's largest automaker , is feeling the heat from the german government which wants it to sell opel to magna international , a canadian auto parts manufacturer backed by state-owned russian bank sberbank . but gm 's newly-appointed board at a meeting on friday in detroit failed to support the magna sale , backed by its executives , because of a rival bid from belgian investor rhj international . " the gm board of directors met today to discuss options for opel , " gm spokeswoman karin kirchner said in a statement late on friday .
" no decision was taken . " an anonymous source familiar with the situation told the wall street journal that board chair edward whitacre had argued that the offer from rhj should be taken more seriously . according to the source , gm 's board opted to ask the german government for more information on state financing for a deal with rhj . gm itself emerged from bankruptcy in july after wiping out $ 47 billion -lrb- 33 billion euros -rrb- in debt in a restructuring that left it majority-owned by the us government . setback for german government 's plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magna 's stronach has already agreed a deal with opel the news is a setback to the german government and opel 's 25,000 german employees , who were expecting opel 's life-saving sale to magna to be confirmed at the gm board meeting .
economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg was quoted on thursday as expecting " a clear signal " on the future of opel to emerge at friday 's conference . magna 's bid for opel is backed by the german government , which has offered a financial incentive of $ 6.4 billion .
but germany set out tough financial requirements for gm , asking for help with dealing with opel 's possible deficit of $ 1.7 billion . chancellor angela merkel told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper on thursday that magna 's experience in the auto industry and its " better concept " for opel made it a superior buyer than rhj .
facing elections next month , merkel is convinced a deal with magna would be the best option to save jobs . complicated deal but it is precisely magna 's expertise that considerably complicates the deal for gm .
should gm approve a sale to magna , keeping only a minority stake of 35 percent , it would lose most of its influence on opel 's production and distribution in europe . on top of this , magna 's bid also includes a 27.5-percent stake for the russian state bank sberbank , with russian carmaker gaz as an industrial partner holding the option to buy sberbank 's stake .
gm 's board fears that a deal with magna would therefore create a serious competitor not only in the european automobile market , but the growing russian market .
a deal with magna would also rule out the option of opel 's eventual re-absorption into gm . the offer of financial investor rhj is much friendlier .
according to reports , rhj would allow gm to keep control of the technological side of opel , and to retain the possibility of re-acquiring its european subsidiary in a more secure future financial climate . " if you want to know why the board is agonizing over this decision , take a look at the competing spheres of interest , " summed up one commentator in news magazine der spiegel , " either gm surrenders its access to opel , or it loses the money from the german government .

" i regret that the board has not after all taken a decision , " karl-theodor zu guttenberg was quoted as saying by the online edition of the hamburger abendblatt newspaper on saturday , aug .
22 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's guttenberg is disappointed by the news coming from detroit the german government had " provided gm with all the necessary information , " the minister added . the 100-year-old company , once the world 's largest automaker , is feeling the heat from the german government which wants it to sell opel to magna international , a canadian auto parts manufacturer backed by state-owned russian bank sberbank . but gm 's newly-appointed board at a meeting on friday in detroit failed to support the magna sale , backed by its executives , because of a rival bid from belgian investor rhj international . " the gm board of directors met today to discuss options for opel , " gm spokeswoman karin kirchner said in a statement late on friday .
" no decision was taken . " an anonymous source familiar with the situation told the wall street journal that board chair edward whitacre had argued that the offer from rhj should be taken more seriously . according to the source , gm 's board opted to ask the german government for more information on state financing for a deal with rhj . gm itself emerged from bankruptcy in july after wiping out $ 47 billion -lrb- 33 billion euros -rrb- in debt in a restructuring that left it majority-owned by the us government . setback for german government 's plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magna 's stronach has already agreed a deal with opel the news is a setback to the german government and opel 's 25,000 german employees , who were expecting opel 's life-saving sale to magna to be confirmed at the gm board meeting .
economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg was quoted on thursday as expecting " a clear signal " on the future of opel to emerge at friday 's conference . magna 's bid for opel is backed by the german government , which has offered a financial incentive of $ 6.4 billion .
but germany set out tough financial requirements for gm , asking for help with dealing with opel 's possible deficit of $ 1.7 billion . chancellor angela merkel told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper on thursday that magna 's experience in the auto industry and its " better concept " for opel made it a superior buyer than rhj .
facing elections next month , merkel is convinced a deal with magna would be the best option to save jobs . complicated deal but it is precisely magna 's expertise that considerably complicates the deal for gm .
should gm approve a sale to magna , keeping only a minority stake of 35 percent , it would lose most of its influence on opel 's production and distribution in europe . on top of this , magna 's bid also includes a 27.5-percent stake for the russian state bank sberbank , with russian carmaker gaz as an industrial partner holding the option to buy sberbank 's stake .
gm 's board fears that a deal with magna would therefore create a serious competitor not only in the european automobile market , but the growing russian market .
a deal with magna would also rule out the option of opel 's eventual re-absorption into gm . the offer of financial investor rhj is much friendlier .
according to reports , rhj would allow gm to keep control of the technological side of opel , and to retain the possibility of re-acquiring its european subsidiary in a more secure future financial climate . " if you want to know why the board is agonizing over this decision , take a look at the competing spheres of interest , " summed up one commentator in news magazine der spiegel , " either gm surrenders its access to opel , or it loses the money from the german government .
the question : which is costlier ? " european branches watch opel saga with bated breath bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel workers fear for their jobs if a deal is not reached the sale of opel is being keenly watched , as billions of euros in government aid are riding on the outcome , as are the jobs of thousands of opel workers in europe . apart from its 25,000 german employees in four major plants , making everything from three-door corsa subcompacts to zafira vans , there are two key opel factories that produce cars under the vauxhall badge in the uk . opel has other facilities in belgium , poland and spain . no date has been set for another gm board meeting or a deadline for a decision .

twenty years later , the former " baltic tigers " are trying to show courage in the face of recession . their hands stretching across forests and fields , standing along highways and country roads , as many as 2 million estonians , latvians and lithuanians joined in a 671-kilometer -lrb- 417-mile -rrb- human chain 20 years ago , looking forward to a better future .
but this year 's celebration of the baltic way , which showed the world the baltic countries ' desire for autonomy apart from the soviet union , is looking backward in an attempt to recapture that hope in difficult economic times .
the commemorations include exhibits and academic conferences , but the most hailed event is heartbeats for the baltics , a relay run along the baltic way route .
about 13,500 people will run in one-kilometer stretches , but organizers say anyone can join the relay along the way for any length .
the first runners left the estonian capital , tallinn , for the latvian capital of riga on saturday morning .
a second group of runners was scheduled to leave the lithuanian capital of vilnius later in the day and head north to meet the first group at riga 's freedom monument on sunday .

23 , 1989 coincided with the 50th anniversary of the molotov-ribbentrop pact , which had divided the baltic states into spheres of influence and led to the eventual annexation by the soviet union in 1940 .
the participation of 2 million people , in a region whose population is around 7 million , would have been a significant accomplishment even if it had n't occurred under the shadow of soviet control .
" people are always looking to break records , but what we did , it was not a record attempt , " said nomeda marcenaite , who was there in 1989 .
" it was a spiritual thing , perhaps a spiritual record . "

" we gave a clear signal : we are organized , we have overcome the molotov-ribbentrop pact and we are ready to go forward and be dynamic in a challenging world , " zatlers said .
" that 's the way balts do things . "
sixten sild , who helped organize this year 's event as chairman of the estonian orienteering association board , will be running three kilometers early sunday morning near the latvian-estonian border .
" i want to run there because 20 years ago that was where i stood in the baltic chain with my parents , " sild said .
his two adult sons will be participating as well .
fresh courage needed estonia and the other baltic states have been hit hard by the global financial crisis .
the european union 's statistical office eurostat counted the three countries ' economic performance as the worst in the euro zone .
lithuania 's economy has contracted 12.3 percent over the same quarter last year , estonia lost 3.7 percent , and latvia 1.6 percent .
estonia has had to raise sales taxes and make serious budget cuts , tough decisions which ultimately led to the collapse of its coalition government in may .
in latvia , unemployment has also soared to 16.7 percent .
the world bank estimates that the number of lithuanian families living in poverty could increase by 49 percent this year .
" it is once again very important to stand together and to show that we can reduce the negative consequences of the recession , undertake greater responsibilities , and be more courageous in dealing with the challenges of our age , " said lithuanian president dalia grybauskaite. svs / reuters / dpa / afp editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in hungary , presidential spokeswoman szilvia szotak told the local news agency mti that solyom would not enter slovak territory .
" he will make a statement on the hungarian side of the border , " she said .
august 21 is remembered here as the day in 1968 when what was then czechoslovakia was occupied by warsaw pact troops - including hungary 's - to crush the " prague spring " reform drive by the country 's communist leadership .
solyom was scheduled to attend the unveiling of a statue of stephen , a medieval king of hungary , in the southern slovak town of komarno .
the hungarian town of komarom lies on the southern bank of the river danube , which marks the two countries ' border .
hungarians make up 10 percent of slovakia 's population of 5.4 million people , mostly living along the frontier .
" komarno lies in slovakia 's territory , it 's not a hungarian town , " slovak prime minister robert fico told reporters earlier friday , adding that solyom would be welcome at any other time , but that coming on august 21 was " mere provocation " .
" he wants to spark a conflict , we want to avoid it , " fico insisted .
hungarian president barred fico had said that the slovak foreign ministry had handed a diplomatic note to the hungarian ambassador saying slovakia would not let solyom in .
" if he decides to ignore the note it would be a violation of international law and slovakia 's sovereignty , " fico warned .

we want to behave in a diplomatic way , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fico accused solyom of wanting to start a conflict on tuesday , fico , slovak president ivan gasparovic and parliamentary speaker pavol paska had issued a sharply-worded joint statement saying solyom would not be welcome in slovakia and described his planned trip as " insensitive and tactless " .
solyom was invited by komarno mayor tibor bastrnak , who is a member of slovakia 's opposition ethnic-hungarian smk party .
critics have noted that the mayor failed to invite slovak leaders , allegedly paving the way for the dispute - but in tuesday 's statement , the leaders had also blasted solyom for allegedly failing to show any interest in meeting with them .
the past is deeply sensitive for slovakia , which was ruled by hungary for centuries and has only been an independent state since czechoslovakia split in 1993 . but the spat also hinges on a present-day dispute .
hungary has protested to the united nations over slovakia 's new language law , which it dubs discriminatory to the hungarian minority - a move blasted by slovakia 's leaders .
the law slaps fines of up to 5,000 euros -lrb- $ 7,000 -rrb- on the use of minority languages in government and other public services .
ties between the two ex-soviet bloc neighbors , both of whom joined the european union in 2004 , have been tense since 2006 when the far-right sns party , known for its antipathy towards minorities , entered the government steered by fico 's left-wing populist smer party .
both hungary and slovakia are also members of europe 's schengen zone , where frontier controls have been dropped to smooth cross-border travel. nda / afp / ap editor : andy valvur send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 22.08.2009 germany regrets gm 's indecision regarding opel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opel crisis hangs heavy over the german government germany 's economics minister said on saturday he regretted that general motors ' board had failed to take a decision on a deal covering its european operations , including ailing german unit opel . " i regret that the board has not after all taken a decision , " karl-theodor zu guttenberg was quoted as saying by the online edition of the hamburger abendblatt newspaper on saturday , aug .
22 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's guttenberg is disappointed by the news coming from detroit the german government had " provided gm with all the necessary information , " the minister added . the 100-year-old company , once the world 's largest automaker , is feeling the heat from the german government which wants it to sell opel to magna international , a canadian auto parts manufacturer backed by state-owned russian bank sberbank . but gm 's newly-appointed board at a meeting on friday in detroit failed to support the magna sale , backed by its executives , because of a rival bid from belgian investor rhj international . " the gm board of directors met today to discuss options for opel , " gm spokeswoman karin kirchner said in a statement late on friday .
" no decision was taken . " an anonymous source familiar with the situation told the wall street journal that board chair edward whitacre had argued that the offer from rhj should be taken more seriously . according to the source , gm 's board opted to ask the german government for more information on state financing for a deal with rhj . gm itself emerged from bankruptcy in july after wiping out $ 47 billion -lrb- 33 billion euros -rrb- in debt in a restructuring that left it majority-owned by the us government . setback for german government 's plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magna 's stronach has already agreed a deal with opel the news is a setback to the german government and opel 's 25,000 german employees , who were expecting opel 's life-saving sale to magna to be confirmed at the gm board meeting .
economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg was quoted on thursday as expecting " a clear signal " on the future of opel to emerge at friday 's conference . magna 's bid for opel is backed by the german government , which has offered a financial incentive of $ 6.4 billion .
but germany set out tough financial requirements for gm , asking for help with dealing with opel 's possible deficit of $ 1.7 billion . chancellor angela merkel told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper on thursday that magna 's experience in the auto industry and its " better concept " for opel made it a superior buyer than rhj .
facing elections next month , merkel is convinced a deal with magna would be the best option to save jobs . complicated deal but it is precisely magna 's expertise that considerably complicates the deal for gm .
should gm approve a sale to magna , keeping only a minority stake of 35 percent , it would lose most of its influence on opel 's production and distribution in europe . on top of this , magna 's bid also includes a 27.5-percent stake for the russian state bank sberbank , with russian carmaker gaz as an industrial partner holding the option to buy sberbank 's stake .
gm 's board fears that a deal with magna would therefore create a serious competitor not only in the european automobile market , but the growing russian market .
a deal with magna would also rule out the option of opel 's eventual re-absorption into gm . the offer of financial investor rhj is much friendlier .
according to reports , rhj would allow gm to keep control of the technological side of opel , and to retain the possibility of re-acquiring its european subsidiary in a more secure future financial climate . " if you want to know why the board is agonizing over this decision , take a look at the competing spheres of interest , " summed up one commentator in news magazine der spiegel , " either gm surrenders its access to opel , or it loses the money from the german government .
the question : which is costlier ? " european branches watch opel saga with bated breath bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel workers fear for their jobs if a deal is not reached the sale of opel is being keenly watched , as billions of euros in government aid are riding on the outcome , as are the jobs of thousands of opel workers in europe . apart from its 25,000 german employees in four major plants , making everything from three-door corsa subcompacts to zafira vans , there are two key opel factories that produce cars under the vauxhall badge in the uk . opel has other facilities in belgium , poland and spain . no date has been set for another gm board meeting or a deadline for a decision .
the alternative to a sale of opel would be insolvency , analysts have said . bk / reuters / afp editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

22 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's guttenberg is disappointed by the news coming from detroit the german government had " provided gm with all the necessary information , " the minister added . the 100-year-old company , once the world 's largest automaker , is feeling the heat from the german government which wants it to sell opel to magna international , a canadian auto parts manufacturer backed by state-owned russian bank sberbank . but gm 's newly-appointed board at a meeting on friday in detroit failed to support the magna sale , backed by its executives , because of a rival bid from belgian investor rhj international . " the gm board of directors met today to discuss options for opel , " gm spokeswoman karin kirchner said in a statement late on friday .
" no decision was taken . " an anonymous source familiar with the situation told the wall street journal that board chair edward whitacre had argued that the offer from rhj should be taken more seriously . according to the source , gm 's board opted to ask the german government for more information on state financing for a deal with rhj . gm itself emerged from bankruptcy in july after wiping out $ 47 billion -lrb- 33 billion euros -rrb- in debt in a restructuring that left it majority-owned by the us government . setback for german government 's plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magna 's stronach has already agreed a deal with opel the news is a setback to the german government and opel 's 25,000 german employees , who were expecting opel 's life-saving sale to magna to be confirmed at the gm board meeting .
economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg was quoted on thursday as expecting " a clear signal " on the future of opel to emerge at friday 's conference . magna 's bid for opel is backed by the german government , which has offered a financial incentive of $ 6.4 billion .
but germany set out tough financial requirements for gm , asking for help with dealing with opel 's possible deficit of $ 1.7 billion . chancellor angela merkel told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper on thursday that magna 's experience in the auto industry and its " better concept " for opel made it a superior buyer than rhj .
facing elections next month , merkel is convinced a deal with magna would be the best option to save jobs . complicated deal but it is precisely magna 's expertise that considerably complicates the deal for gm .
should gm approve a sale to magna , keeping only a minority stake of 35 percent , it would lose most of its influence on opel 's production and distribution in europe . on top of this , magna 's bid also includes a 27.5-percent stake for the russian state bank sberbank , with russian carmaker gaz as an industrial partner holding the option to buy sberbank 's stake .
gm 's board fears that a deal with magna would therefore create a serious competitor not only in the european automobile market , but the growing russian market .
a deal with magna would also rule out the option of opel 's eventual re-absorption into gm . the offer of financial investor rhj is much friendlier .
according to reports , rhj would allow gm to keep control of the technological side of opel , and to retain the possibility of re-acquiring its european subsidiary in a more secure future financial climate . " if you want to know why the board is agonizing over this decision , take a look at the competing spheres of interest , " summed up one commentator in news magazine der spiegel , " either gm surrenders its access to opel , or it loses the money from the german government .
the question : which is costlier ? " european branches watch opel saga with bated breath bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel workers fear for their jobs if a deal is not reached the sale of opel is being keenly watched , as billions of euros in government aid are riding on the outcome , as are the jobs of thousands of opel workers in europe . apart from its 25,000 german employees in four major plants , making everything from three-door corsa subcompacts to zafira vans , there are two key opel factories that produce cars under the vauxhall badge in the uk . opel has other facilities in belgium , poland and spain . no date has been set for another gm board meeting or a deadline for a decision .
the alternative to a sale of opel would be insolvency , analysts have said . bk / reuters / afp editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in hungary , presidential spokeswoman szilvia szotak told the local news agency mti that solyom would not enter slovak territory .
" he will make a statement on the hungarian side of the border , " she said .
august 21 is remembered here as the day in 1968 when what was then czechoslovakia was occupied by warsaw pact troops - including hungary 's - to crush the " prague spring " reform drive by the country 's communist leadership .
solyom was scheduled to attend the unveiling of a statue of stephen , a medieval king of hungary , in the southern slovak town of komarno .
the hungarian town of komarom lies on the southern bank of the river danube , which marks the two countries ' border .
hungarians make up 10 percent of slovakia 's population of 5.4 million people , mostly living along the frontier .
" komarno lies in slovakia 's territory , it 's not a hungarian town , " slovak prime minister robert fico told reporters earlier friday , adding that solyom would be welcome at any other time , but that coming on august 21 was " mere provocation " .
" he wants to spark a conflict , we want to avoid it , " fico insisted .
hungarian president barred fico had said that the slovak foreign ministry had handed a diplomatic note to the hungarian ambassador saying slovakia would not let solyom in .
" if he decides to ignore the note it would be a violation of international law and slovakia 's sovereignty , " fico warned .
" we wo n't prevent him from crossing the border by force .
we want to behave in a diplomatic way , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fico accused solyom of wanting to start a conflict on tuesday , fico , slovak president ivan gasparovic and parliamentary speaker pavol paska had issued a sharply-worded joint statement saying solyom would not be welcome in slovakia and described his planned trip as " insensitive and tactless " .
solyom was invited by komarno mayor tibor bastrnak , who is a member of slovakia 's opposition ethnic-hungarian smk party .
critics have noted that the mayor failed to invite slovak leaders , allegedly paving the way for the dispute - but in tuesday 's statement , the leaders had also blasted solyom for allegedly failing to show any interest in meeting with them .
the past is deeply sensitive for slovakia , which was ruled by hungary for centuries and has only been an independent state since czechoslovakia split in 1993 . but the spat also hinges on a present-day dispute .
hungary has protested to the united nations over slovakia 's new language law , which it dubs discriminatory to the hungarian minority - a move blasted by slovakia 's leaders .

in hungary , presidential spokeswoman szilvia szotak told the local news agency mti that solyom would not enter slovak territory .
" he will make a statement on the hungarian side of the border , " she said .
august 21 is remembered here as the day in 1968 when what was then czechoslovakia was occupied by warsaw pact troops - including hungary 's - to crush the " prague spring " reform drive by the country 's communist leadership .
solyom was scheduled to attend the unveiling of a statue of stephen , a medieval king of hungary , in the southern slovak town of komarno .
the hungarian town of komarom lies on the southern bank of the river danube , which marks the two countries ' border .
hungarians make up 10 percent of slovakia 's population of 5.4 million people , mostly living along the frontier .
" komarno lies in slovakia 's territory , it 's not a hungarian town , " slovak prime minister robert fico told reporters earlier friday , adding that solyom would be welcome at any other time , but that coming on august 21 was " mere provocation " .
" he wants to spark a conflict , we want to avoid it , " fico insisted .
hungarian president barred fico had said that the slovak foreign ministry had handed a diplomatic note to the hungarian ambassador saying slovakia would not let solyom in .
" if he decides to ignore the note it would be a violation of international law and slovakia 's sovereignty , " fico warned .
" we wo n't prevent him from crossing the border by force .
we want to behave in a diplomatic way , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fico accused solyom of wanting to start a conflict on tuesday , fico , slovak president ivan gasparovic and parliamentary speaker pavol paska had issued a sharply-worded joint statement saying solyom would not be welcome in slovakia and described his planned trip as " insensitive and tactless " .
solyom was invited by komarno mayor tibor bastrnak , who is a member of slovakia 's opposition ethnic-hungarian smk party .
critics have noted that the mayor failed to invite slovak leaders , allegedly paving the way for the dispute - but in tuesday 's statement , the leaders had also blasted solyom for allegedly failing to show any interest in meeting with them .
the past is deeply sensitive for slovakia , which was ruled by hungary for centuries and has only been an independent state since czechoslovakia split in 1993 . but the spat also hinges on a present-day dispute .
hungary has protested to the united nations over slovakia 's new language law , which it dubs discriminatory to the hungarian minority - a move blasted by slovakia 's leaders .
the law slaps fines of up to 5,000 euros -lrb- $ 7,000 -rrb- on the use of minority languages in government and other public services .
ties between the two ex-soviet bloc neighbors , both of whom joined the european union in 2004 , have been tense since 2006 when the far-right sns party , known for its antipathy towards minorities , entered the government steered by fico 's left-wing populist smer party .
both hungary and slovakia are also members of europe 's schengen zone , where frontier controls have been dropped to smooth cross-border travel. nda / afp / ap editor : andy valvur send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

sex trafficking has become a multi-billion dollar underground industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights watch is at the forefront of highlighting the evils of modern-day slavery tom porteous , the director of human rights watch in london , told deutsche welle that " the major factor contributing to sex slavery is supply and demand .
there is a huge demand for prostitution and an equally huge supply of participants because of the economic situation in the world . " an estimated half a million women are trafficked annually for the purpose of sex slavery .
they are exported to over 50 countries including germany , britain , italy , japan , canada and the united states .
sex slaves are smuggled taking a route known as the " eastern route " from eastern european countries , through poland and subsequently into european union countries .
the cities of prague , amsterdam , and frankfurt are common final destinations for the slaves . " the susceptibility of victims despite the publicity focused on the issue is a question of economic reality and economic desperation .
the countries which provide the bulk of the victims in sex slavery are poor ; the victims are predominantly of the poorest countries , " said porteous . " enforcement of the law needs to be strengthened , along with the formation of international treaties that could properly deal with sex slavery . more information on the reality of the situation needs to be disseminated directly to the communities that provide the bulk of the supply in sex slavery i.e. the economically challenged , " he added . germany ’ s fight against sex slavery germany is known as a “ receiving country ” in the sex slavery industry ; a destination and transit country for the trade , with scores of victims coming in from eastern europe and also asia and africa .
berlin has in turn proven itself a leader in many aspects of the fight against modern slavery . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joerg ziercke , the president of germany 's criminal police office , says sex slavery remains a problem a spokesman for germany 's criminal police office told deutsche welle that , " since the strong rise in trafficking of sex slavery victims into germany in 2007 , the problem has steadied in the subsequent years .
sex slavery is still a problem and prosecution of those involved relies largely on identification by the victims . the victims of sex slavery these days are members of eu countries and are thus legally permitted to stay in germany if they so wish .
prosecution and curbing of this crime requires victims coming forward and identifying the criminals involved , achieving this would require efforts of both governmental and non-governmental organizations . " the basis of sex slavery , experts say , is economic .
the industry renders billions of dollars in revenue for its perpetrators and the reality of the victims , who are predominantly from economically-challenged countries accounts for their susceptibility to the trade . " there is anecdotal evidence suggesting that the economic crisis in the world has made the sex slavery problem even worse , " said tom porteous . author : faith thomas editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

twenty years later , the former " baltic tigers " are trying to show courage in the face of recession . their hands stretching across forests and fields , standing along highways and country roads , as many as 2 million estonians , latvians and lithuanians joined in a 671-kilometer -lrb- 417-mile -rrb- human chain 20 years ago , looking forward to a better future .
but this year 's celebration of the baltic way , which showed the world the baltic countries ' desire for autonomy apart from the soviet union , is looking backward in an attempt to recapture that hope in difficult economic times .
the commemorations include exhibits and academic conferences , but the most hailed event is heartbeats for the baltics , a relay run along the baltic way route .
about 13,500 people will run in one-kilometer stretches , but organizers say anyone can join the relay along the way for any length .
the first runners left the estonian capital , tallinn , for the latvian capital of riga on saturday morning .
a second group of runners was scheduled to leave the lithuanian capital of vilnius later in the day and head north to meet the first group at riga 's freedom monument on sunday .
bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousands joined hands for the baltic way in 1989 the end of communism the baltic way human chain on aug .
23 , 1989 coincided with the 50th anniversary of the molotov-ribbentrop pact , which had divided the baltic states into spheres of influence and led to the eventual annexation by the soviet union in 1940 .
the participation of 2 million people , in a region whose population is around 7 million , would have been a significant accomplishment even if it had n't occurred under the shadow of soviet control .
" people are always looking to break records , but what we did , it was not a record attempt , " said nomeda marcenaite , who was there in 1989 .
" it was a spiritual thing , perhaps a spiritual record . "
putting on the running shoes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators along the 1989 baltic way latvian president valdis zatlers will be joining in on the last leg of the commemorative run on sunday .
the relay was his pet project , and he said that he hoped it would inspire the generation of people too young to remember the original event .
" we gave a clear signal : we are organized , we have overcome the molotov-ribbentrop pact and we are ready to go forward and be dynamic in a challenging world , " zatlers said .
" that 's the way balts do things . "
sixten sild , who helped organize this year 's event as chairman of the estonian orienteering association board , will be running three kilometers early sunday morning near the latvian-estonian border .
" i want to run there because 20 years ago that was where i stood in the baltic chain with my parents , " sild said .
his two adult sons will be participating as well .
fresh courage needed estonia and the other baltic states have been hit hard by the global financial crisis .

" i regret that the board has not after all taken a decision , " karl-theodor zu guttenberg was quoted as saying by the online edition of the hamburger abendblatt newspaper on saturday , aug .
22 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's guttenberg is disappointed by the news coming from detroit the german government had " provided gm with all the necessary information , " the minister added . the 100-year-old company , once the world 's largest automaker , is feeling the heat from the german government which wants it to sell opel to magna international , a canadian auto parts manufacturer backed by state-owned russian bank sberbank . but gm 's newly-appointed board at a meeting on friday in detroit failed to support the magna sale , backed by its executives , because of a rival bid from belgian investor rhj international . " the gm board of directors met today to discuss options for opel , " gm spokeswoman karin kirchner said in a statement late on friday .
" no decision was taken . " an anonymous source familiar with the situation told the wall street journal that board chair edward whitacre had argued that the offer from rhj should be taken more seriously . according to the source , gm 's board opted to ask the german government for more information on state financing for a deal with rhj . gm itself emerged from bankruptcy in july after wiping out $ 47 billion -lrb- 33 billion euros -rrb- in debt in a restructuring that left it majority-owned by the us government . setback for german government 's plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magna 's stronach has already agreed a deal with opel the news is a setback to the german government and opel 's 25,000 german employees , who were expecting opel 's life-saving sale to magna to be confirmed at the gm board meeting .
economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg was quoted on thursday as expecting " a clear signal " on the future of opel to emerge at friday 's conference . magna 's bid for opel is backed by the german government , which has offered a financial incentive of $ 6.4 billion .
but germany set out tough financial requirements for gm , asking for help with dealing with opel 's possible deficit of $ 1.7 billion . chancellor angela merkel told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper on thursday that magna 's experience in the auto industry and its " better concept " for opel made it a superior buyer than rhj .
facing elections next month , merkel is convinced a deal with magna would be the best option to save jobs . complicated deal but it is precisely magna 's expertise that considerably complicates the deal for gm .
should gm approve a sale to magna , keeping only a minority stake of 35 percent , it would lose most of its influence on opel 's production and distribution in europe . on top of this , magna 's bid also includes a 27.5-percent stake for the russian state bank sberbank , with russian carmaker gaz as an industrial partner holding the option to buy sberbank 's stake .
gm 's board fears that a deal with magna would therefore create a serious competitor not only in the european automobile market , but the growing russian market .
a deal with magna would also rule out the option of opel 's eventual re-absorption into gm . the offer of financial investor rhj is much friendlier .
according to reports , rhj would allow gm to keep control of the technological side of opel , and to retain the possibility of re-acquiring its european subsidiary in a more secure future financial climate . " if you want to know why the board is agonizing over this decision , take a look at the competing spheres of interest , " summed up one commentator in news magazine der spiegel , " either gm surrenders its access to opel , or it loses the money from the german government .
the question : which is costlier ? " european branches watch opel saga with bated breath bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel workers fear for their jobs if a deal is not reached the sale of opel is being keenly watched , as billions of euros in government aid are riding on the outcome , as are the jobs of thousands of opel workers in europe . apart from its 25,000 german employees in four major plants , making everything from three-door corsa subcompacts to zafira vans , there are two key opel factories that produce cars under the vauxhall badge in the uk . opel has other facilities in belgium , poland and spain . no date has been set for another gm board meeting or a deadline for a decision .
the alternative to a sale of opel would be insolvency , analysts have said . bk / reuters / afp editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that is second only to drug trafficking in terms of global criminal activities .
" information on slavery is very inexact .
but we believe that the majority of slave victims - in the neighbourhood of 80 percent - are the female gender , and that around 50 percent are children .

unesco now commemorates its hard-won struggle , but combatting the modern slavery prevalent in many societies today is equally challenging . " by institutionalizing memory , resisting the onset of oblivion , recalling the memory of a tragedy that for long years remained hidden or unrecognized , and by assigning it its proper place in the human conscience , we respond to our duty to remember , " unesco 's director-general said during the 2004 launch of the international year to commemorate the struggle to end the slave trade . slavery in the world today it has been over 200 years since the abolition of the trans-atlantic slave trade but , despite that , the practice still continues in various forms all over the world . in 2005 , the international labor organization estimated that just over 12 million people were working as forced laborers in the world . siddarth kara , in his book " sex trafficking : inside the business of modern slavery , " says that there were just over 28 million slaves worldwide in 2006 divided into three categories : bonded labor / debt bondage , forced labor and trafficking slaves .

" information on slavery is very inexact .
but we believe that the majority of slave victims - in the neighbourhood of 80 percent - are the female gender , and that around 50 percent are children .

authorities in france and italy are not just targeting those who produce and sell fakes but also those who buy them .
in france , the maximum fine is 300,000 euro -lrb- £ 260,000 -rrb- or three years in jail .
the uk government has decided against criminalising consumers .
instead it has launched an information campaign aimed at people using markets and boot sales .
seizures of counterfeit goods on the continent more than doubled in 2008 , with customs authorities seizing 178 million fake items - mostly imported from china .
the european commission is concerned about the growing involvement of organised international criminal gangs . "
these are not cheeky chappies making an honest living on a sunday morning , these are hardened criminals " susie winter alliance against intellectual property theft it says : " without doubt , one of the principal methods of dispersing counterfeits is the ' ant-like ' traffic of tourists returning home from holiday , bringing back souvenirs . "
this has prompted some member states to take a harder line .
intellectual property lawyer simon tracey said anyone tempted to bring back items such as fake designer sunglasses , a football top or handbag from their holidays should beware .
he said lots of people have already been fined thousands of euros for owning a fake , and france seemed " a little bit harsher " than italy .
dangerous fakes but he said it was hard to persuade people that owning a fake was " a bad thing " .
" the problem is , it is an intellectual theft , so therefore it 's much harder to explain to people that it is wrong , but in reality - as a matter of social responsibility - it is just as bad as stealing .
" we all tend to debate the fake bag , we tend not to think about the products that can cause serious harm or kill like fake pharmaceuticals , " he added .
have your say " if you own an original product the differences actually stand out a mile , particularly on watches . "
conan hayes , london send us your comments john tuchier , from the trading standards institute , said holidaymakers can easily be caught out by things that " look like a bargain " , and shoppers should consider the " safety and quality of a product " .
" some of these counterfeit goods are so good that you might not be aware that the product is counterfeit until an expert actually looks at it and brings it to your attention , " he said .
the uk government says legitimate businesses lose an estimated £ 10bn a year to counterfeiters , with £ 9bn ending up the hands of gangs .
it also warns that fake alcohol can cause blindness or death , copied toiletries can be harmful and that counterfeit toys or medicines will not have passed safety tests .
susie winter , director general of the alliance against intellectual property theft - a grouping of creative industry associations , said the uk 's counterfeit trade centred around markets .
" we would urge people to think about where their money is going , " she said .
