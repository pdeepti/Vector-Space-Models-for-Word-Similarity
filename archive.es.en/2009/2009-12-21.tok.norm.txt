this move has cast doubt on a crucial international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and eu-led 7.5 billion euro bailout for the recession-hit state .
the pension cuts have been in force since july , and constitutional court chief gunars kutris says they take away anywhere between 10 and 70 percent of old-age pensions depending on an individual 's status .
kurtis said the measures were illegal and that parliament must have measures in place to refund the cuts by march 2010 .
" violation " of social security and rule of law in its judgement , the court stated that " the decision to cut pensions violated the individual 's right to social security and the principle of the rule of law . "
it added that agreements with international lenders in and of themselves can not be used as an argument to limit basic rights .
the court 's ruling in the case is final and can not be appealed .
the case was brought to the court by 9,000 individual pensioners .
it has been ruled that the money itself must be paid back in full no later than 2015 .
the sum is estimated around 100 million lats -lrb- 140 million euros -rrb- .
currently , latvia is in the middle of one of the deepest recessions in the european union , with its economy expected to shrink by up to 18 percent this year .
over the past year , its government has been raising taxes and reducing public spending as it attempts to stick to the terms of the imf / eu bailout .
under the deal , latvia pledged to cut 500 million lats -lrb- 702 million euros -rrb- every year until 2012. mk / afp / reuters editor : ranty islam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some found a silver lining , however . the newspaper de volkskrant from holland acknowledged that copenhagen delivered a disappointing result but focused on the positive : the fact that at least the problem is being addressed .
" climate change is now an international problem par excellence .
it seems inevitable that all countries will be brought into negotiations sooner or later .
at the same time , it is nearly impossible to get 192 states of varying size and with diverse interests to reach a unified stance . "
" but there is a glimmer of hope .
all of the participants in the climate conference know that the talks will continue .
and possibly , those actors will be watched by the public and by activists and ngos with a more critical eye than they have been up to now .
because one thing was attained for certain : the climate will never disappear from the political agenda . "
likewise , britain 's guardian newspaper saw positives alongside negatives in the outcome of the conference .
on the bad side : " a considered reading of the accord , which was its only tangible output , reveals that it is not just inadequate but in fact utterly empty . "
on the plus side , however , is " the novel manner in which this ultimate failure was reached . "
" as the sight of the daily chaos -lrb- of copenhagen -rrb- drops out of view , it becomes easier to appreciate that the rich world was forced to haggle with the bigger emerging economies on more equal terms than ever before . "
in other words , " while the copenhagen product is every inch the sham that campaigners say it is , the copenhagen process has set important precedents , " the guardian wrote .
" most obviously … the sheer fact that it took place – and at such a high political level – means it will probably do so again . "
taking a harsher line , left-leaning french newspaper la libération oozed disappointment in the " large countries which , in a delirium of diplomatic ineptitude and the blindness of superiority , torpedoed the binding worldwide accord " they had hoped for . the paper pitched for the eu to take immediate , unilateral action : " eco-reformers need to focus on the us and china , " it wrote ; " after that come the nations that are a bit more environmentally aware , particularly in europe .
but these can not wait until there is an international agreement .
it is much more important for them to become instructive with their actions .
if the eu took the necessary actions from its side , it would jump to the head of the movement .
then the fiasco of copenhagen could be overcome step by step . " in switzerland , zurich 's tages-anzeiger also focused on results ; those who come up with solutions will ultimately benefit in the end , the paper wrote .
at the conference , " concrete solutions were presented on how to reach a climate-friendly future and at the same time remain economically profitable .
numerous companies seemed to have little patience for the political lethargy … the biggest climate-change effect will be felt by those companies and countries that start preparing now .
they will be the ultimate winners , " the paper said .
german editorialists were less inclined to focus on positive signals from the conference .
the sueddeutsche zeitung called the copenhagen summit an " insult to the world community , " noting that " never were expectations for a climate conference higher , and never before were so many heads of state and government officials in one place , meeting to solve one single problem .
but they did n't solve it - they made it worse . "
" as if they were replaying an old , bad film , the heads of the most powerful nations came up with aid funds to silence the developing nations .
they bought their way out .
instead of mutually promising a much-needed rejection of the destructive path of economic development , they agreed on a vague and distant goal .
it is like agreeing on a place to meet , but not a time . "
meanwhile , advocating a just-do-it approach in the wake of the talks , the frankfurter rundschau sent a strong warning to voters and the politicians they elect : " there is no point in allowing the un climate conference circus to continue its performances .
the only chance that remains is for the big heat-producers of the planet to lead by example - without any stipulations about taking others along for the ride , if need be .
fifteen countries on earth are responsible for 80 percent of c02 emissions around the world ; in copenhagen they all said how important climate protection is to them .
now , the politicians of these countries need to make the necessary changes .
and if they do n't the voters have to deal with it - and vote them out of office ... "
finally , the stuttgarter zeitung expressed the disappointment felt by many in europe when they compared us president barack obama 's focus on china and other developing countries with his relative lack of interest in the european negotatiors .
in the wake of the conference , " we need to keep up the ambition of climate protection , and keep the expectations in a realistic framework , " the paper wrote .
" but one prerequisite for this is the recognition that it will be really hard for europe to effectively influence the usa .
the trans-atlantic relationship is coming up on hard times .
barack obama showed one thing for certain in copenhagen : his focus will be on the trans-pacific axis with china .

however , wolfgang schaeuble has not yet explained how . the german finance minister says he will come up with a plan to start reducing germany 's national debt in the course of 2010 .
wolfgang schaeuble told the mass-circulation tabloid bild that germany must reduce its deficit considerably , even if it 's a challenge . " we must reduce the structural deficit , starting in 2011 , by around 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 14 billion -rrb- per year , " he said .
" that will be tough , but we have to do it . " schaeuble promised to draw up a plan to achieve his goal for six consecutive years by july of next year ; however , last week he admitted that he was n't sure where to begin making the cuts . germany 's national debt is currently 1,725 billion euros -lrb- $ 2,470 billion -rrb- , and it 's rising by 4,439 euros per second .
that total figure equates to just over 21,000 euros of debt for every german citizen . to make matters worse , ongoing government spending in a bid to fend off the recent recession means germany is set to dig deeper than ever before in 2010 .
last week , chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet gave the green light to a 2010 budget proposal that foresees borrowing a record 85.8 billion euros over the course of the year . balancing the books bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german national debt is no secret , and it 's still rising meanwhile , chancellor merkel 's new centre-right coalition last week succeeded in delivering one of its key election promises , a heavily disputed 8.5 billion euro tax relief package , which would take effect in 2011 . many prominent members of merkel 's christian democrat party have already voiced their doubts about the sustainability of these tax breaks at a time of record national borrowing . " anybody who 's crying out for a tax reform package in 2011 needs to also explain how we can finance it , " michael meister , deputy leader of the christian democrat 's parliamentary group , told the handelsblatt business daily . " further tax relief packages , which will cost the state 10 billion euros , are hardly conducive to our current need to save money . " germany is one of a slew of eu economies under pressure from brussels to bring their annual borrowing back in line with the eu 's prescribed limit of three per cent of gross domestic product .
now , finance minister wolfgang schaeuble and his team must find a way to make it happen . msh / afp / ap editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" a worldwide symbol of the cynicism of hitler 's executioners and the martyrdom of their victims has been stolen , " polish president lech kaczynski said after the theft . auschwitz , visited by one million people last year , was one of a network of camps set up to kill some 6 million jews , along with members of other ethnic , religious , political , or social groups that hitler 's regime wanted to eliminate . msh / afp / ap / reuters editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in 2009 , the spotlight fell on one of the female stars from this summer 's world athletics championships in berlin , the only man to beat michael phelps in a major swimming competition since 2005 , and the women 's national soccer team for their clear dominance over their european competitors .
steffi nerius throws for gold after the opening weekend of the world athletics championships in august , the biggest star to emerge from berlin 's olympic stadium was usain bolt , whose record-breaking 100-meter dash on the competition 's second day captivated germans and out-of-town visitors alike .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nerius 's first throw was good enough for gold two days later , bolt had competition for the newspaper headlines , and it was from a member of the home team .
when steffi nerius stepped to the line of the finals in the javelin competition , germany had yet to produce a single gold medal winner .
tournament organizers had staggered the events so there was a german gold medal hopeful on each of the nine days of competition , but on the fourth day , they were still waiting for the first german champion .
nerius 's first throw of the finals sailed 67.30 meters , which held as the best mark throughout the entire competition .
when eventual czech silver medalist barbora spotakova 's final throw of the event failed to beat nerius ' mark , nerius raised her arms in the air and celebrated germany 's first gold of the competition , with a stadium full of loud supporters cheering her on .
it was the first world championship gold medal of the 37-year-old 's career .
before the world championships began , there had been fears that germany would repeat its performance from the beijing olympics and come up short in the medals column .

wearing a full-body polyurethane suit , biedermann bested legendary australian swimmer ian thorpe 's world record in the 400 meter freestyle , a mark that many in the sport thought would be safe for many years .
biedermann 's next record was even more impressive , especially because of the man he handily beat in the race .
in the 200 ´ -meter freestyle , biedermann shattered american michael phelps 's world record time by over a second , and handed phelps his only silver medal in world or olympic competition since 2005 .
phelps did n't wear one of the all-polyurethane suits against biedermann , but still praised the 23-year-old german 's performance .
" paul swam a great race .
i did not have anything in the last 50 meters , " phelps said after the swim .
" in the race i was beaten by the swimmer , not the suit . "

steffi nerius throws for gold after the opening weekend of the world athletics championships in august , the biggest star to emerge from berlin 's olympic stadium was usain bolt , whose record-breaking 100-meter dash on the competition 's second day captivated germans and out-of-town visitors alike .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nerius 's first throw was good enough for gold two days later , bolt had competition for the newspaper headlines , and it was from a member of the home team .
when steffi nerius stepped to the line of the finals in the javelin competition , germany had yet to produce a single gold medal winner .
tournament organizers had staggered the events so there was a german gold medal hopeful on each of the nine days of competition , but on the fourth day , they were still waiting for the first german champion .
nerius 's first throw of the finals sailed 67.30 meters , which held as the best mark throughout the entire competition .
when eventual czech silver medalist barbora spotakova 's final throw of the event failed to beat nerius ' mark , nerius raised her arms in the air and celebrated germany 's first gold of the competition , with a stadium full of loud supporters cheering her on .
it was the first world championship gold medal of the 37-year-old 's career .
before the world championships began , there had been fears that germany would repeat its performance from the beijing olympics and come up short in the medals column .
but after nerius set the precedent , german athletes went on to take home a total of two gold , three silver , and four bronze medals , which represented a successful competition for the host nation .
paul biedermann upsets michael phelps new world records were practically a drop in the deep end at the world swimming championships in rome last july .
controversial new swimsuits , made partially or entirely out of polyurethane , seemed to be giving swimmers who wore them a slight edge , and as a result , 43 world records fell at the meet in rome .
bildunterschrift : biedermann bested the world record - and michael phelps - in the 200m freestyle paul biedermann grabbed two of those records , and they happened to be two of the most impressive of the entire competition .
wearing a full-body polyurethane suit , biedermann bested legendary australian swimmer ian thorpe 's world record in the 400 meter freestyle , a mark that many in the sport thought would be safe for many years .
biedermann 's next record was even more impressive , especially because of the man he handily beat in the race .
in the 200 ´ -meter freestyle , biedermann shattered american michael phelps 's world record time by over a second , and handed phelps his only silver medal in world or olympic competition since 2005 .
phelps did n't wear one of the all-polyurethane suits against biedermann , but still praised the 23-year-old german 's performance .
" paul swam a great race .
i did not have anything in the last 50 meters , " phelps said after the swim .
" in the race i was beaten by the swimmer , not the suit . "
starting in 2010 , swimming 's governing body fina will implement a ban on all-polyurethane suits , but eight-time beijing gold medallist michael phelps has a new top rival for next season : germany 's paul biedermann .

winning yet another title continued an impressive streak for the german women .
in european championship competition , the team remains unbeaten since 1995 .
that 's a total of 26 matches , and five titles in a row .
in fact , since the first women 's european championship took place in 1984 , only two other countries - sweden once and norway twice - have won the title other than germany .

in the six matches played by the german side in finland , they scored 21 goals against their opponents ' 5 goals combined .
six of those goals came from striker inka grings , and the rest came from a team effort of nine other goal scorers .
2009 marks the second time the women 's national team has been elected team of the year by german sports journalists .

this is part of a larger effort by egypt to reclaim its ancient treasures . egypt 's chief antiquities official zahi hawass says he will make a formal request for the return of the bust of queen nefertiti from berlin 's neues museum .
in a statement released sunday , hawass said he was presented with documents by the head of the berlin neues museum , where the bust is currently on display , which supported his claim that the statue is in germany illegally . german archeologist acted “ unethically ” according to hawass , the documents confirmed that the german archeologist ludwig borchardt produced fraudulent papers to secure the 3,300 year old bust for berlin in 1913 .
borchardt , who discovered the bust , tried to pass off the artefact as a less significant find in order to take it out of egypt .
“ these materials confirm egypt 's contention that borchardt did act unethically , with intent to deceive , ” the statement said .
“ the limestone head of the queen is listed on the protocol as a painted plaster bust of a princess . ”
the statement went on to say that friederike seyfried , a museum director who oversees the section where the bust is on display , would assist in negotiations between hawass and german officials .
however , in a statement released december 18 by the museum 's operators , the prussian cultural heritage foundation , it was said that , while seyfried would meet with hawass in cairo soon , she would not discuss nefertiti 's return , since the documents showed the prussian state acquired the bust lawfully and egypt had no legal claim for its return .
new campaign for return of artefacts despite the claims of the foundation , hawass says he is optimistic about the bust 's return .
“ i always ask for artefacts to come and it always happens ” he told reuters .
the push for nefertiti 's return is part of a larger effort for egypt to reclaim its ancient artefacts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bust has attracted millions of visitors since it was sent to germany in 1913 hawass previously retrieved wall fragments of a 3,200 year old tomb from the french louvre , and is also currently working on having the rosetta stone returned from the british museum . the bust of nefertiti was discovered in egypt in 1912 at tell el-amarna , the short-lived capital of the kingdom under nefertiti 's husband , pharaoh akhenaten .

this move has cast doubt on a crucial international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and eu-led 7.5 billion euro bailout for the recession-hit state .
the pension cuts have been in force since july , and constitutional court chief gunars kutris says they take away anywhere between 10 and 70 percent of old-age pensions depending on an individual 's status .
kurtis said the measures were illegal and that parliament must have measures in place to refund the cuts by march 2010 .
" violation " of social security and rule of law in its judgement , the court stated that " the decision to cut pensions violated the individual 's right to social security and the principle of the rule of law . "
it added that agreements with international lenders in and of themselves can not be used as an argument to limit basic rights .
the court 's ruling in the case is final and can not be appealed .
the case was brought to the court by 9,000 individual pensioners .
it has been ruled that the money itself must be paid back in full no later than 2015 .
the sum is estimated around 100 million lats -lrb- 140 million euros -rrb- .
currently , latvia is in the middle of one of the deepest recessions in the european union , with its economy expected to shrink by up to 18 percent this year .
over the past year , its government has been raising taxes and reducing public spending as it attempts to stick to the terms of the imf / eu bailout .

this move has cast doubt on a crucial international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and eu-led 7.5 billion euro bailout for the recession-hit state .
the pension cuts have been in force since july , and constitutional court chief gunars kutris says they take away anywhere between 10 and 70 percent of old-age pensions depending on an individual 's status .
kurtis said the measures were illegal and that parliament must have measures in place to refund the cuts by march 2010 .
" violation " of social security and rule of law in its judgement , the court stated that " the decision to cut pensions violated the individual 's right to social security and the principle of the rule of law . "
it added that agreements with international lenders in and of themselves can not be used as an argument to limit basic rights .
the court 's ruling in the case is final and can not be appealed .
the case was brought to the court by 9,000 individual pensioners .
it has been ruled that the money itself must be paid back in full no later than 2015 .
the sum is estimated around 100 million lats -lrb- 140 million euros -rrb- .
currently , latvia is in the middle of one of the deepest recessions in the european union , with its economy expected to shrink by up to 18 percent this year .
over the past year , its government has been raising taxes and reducing public spending as it attempts to stick to the terms of the imf / eu bailout .

the thieves had cut the sign into three pieces . police in krakow , southern poland , told reporters on monday it was too early to tell what the motive behind the theft of the auschwitz sign really was .
however , the five suspects arrested when the sign was recovered are not members of a neo-nazi group .
the men do have criminal records for either violence or theft . " we can say that none of the five are members of a neo-nazi group , " andrzej rokita , district police chief in the city of krakow , told a news conference .
" their intent was undoubtedly robbery related .
we will be able to decide later whether the crime was ordered or whether they acted on their own initiative . " the five men , aged 20 to 39 , are believed to have stolen the infamous " arbeit macht frei " sign , which hung over the entrance to the nazi death camp auschwitz , at dawn on friday .
police recovered the sign , cut into three pieces , near the home of one of the suspects . " the sign had been cut into three pieces at the site of the theft , to make it easier to transport .
it had been hidden in a wood near the home of one of the thieves , " rokita said . when intact , the sign was five meters long .

three companies now face huge fines for price fixing , with more investigations underway . bosses from coffee companies tchibo , melitta and dallmayr worked together to keep their prices artificially high , a competition watchdog has ruled . germany 's cartel office has imposed fines amounting to almost 159.5 million euros against the coffee producers .
the fine is against the three coffee roasters and six employees who were deemed to be responsible .
there were several price fixes from the beginning of 2000 until the company was investigated in july 2008 .

" the spyker leadership has submitted a renewed offer in the hopes of securing a future for saab , its employees and the brand - despite the announcement that the winding down of saab would begin , " the company said in a statement . spyker said it hoped " the renewed offer would remove each of the obstacles that were standing in the way of a swift transaction . "
the company 's chief executive , victor muller , said its revised bid included an 11-point proposal addressing issues that arose during the due diligence process . " we have made every effort to resolve the issues that were preventing the conclusion of this matter and we have asked gm and all other involved parties to seriously consider this offer , " said muller .
he added that the new offer eliminates the need for loan approval by the european investment bank -lrb- eib -rrb- prior to year end , which would allow the deal to be concluded within gm 's original december 31 deadline . while muller did not reveal any details about the financing of the new offer , he said spyker 's bid would remain valid until 11pm central european time -lrb- 5pm eastern time -rrb- on monday . several suitors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so far only small carmakers have shown real interest in acquiring saab on its website , general motors said it had received inquiries from several potential bidders since friday 's announcement that it would start the orderly closure of saab . " we will evaluate each inquiry .
we will not comment further until these evaluations have been completed , " gm said in a statement .
the head of sweden 's influential if metall union urged gm to seriously consider the renewed bid for saab , which employs about 3,400 people in sweden . " i understand the frustration felt by everyone who is dependent on saab : to be thrown between hope and despair is terrible .
gm must now respond with a serious examination of the new bid , " union chairman stefan loefven said . swedish media report that the closure of saab could lead to more than 8,000 job losses , including subcontractors and others dependent on the carmaker .
the company 's global distribution network is comprised of 1,100 dealerships . gm has been trying to sell the unit since the start of the year .
swedish luxury carmaker koenigsegg , which builds around 18 high-end sports cars a year , pulled out of a deal to buy saab last month , citing costly delays . like koenigsegg , spyker is also a premium niche manufacturer .
in 2008 , it sold just 37 cars worldwide with prices starting at 200,000 euros -lrb- $ 290,000 -rrb- . saab sold just over 93,000 cars last year .
the company 's history as an automaker dates back to the 1940s , when the first cars were produced by the swedish aircraft maker svenska aeroplan aktiebolaget or saab .

"
the company 's chief executive , victor muller , said its revised bid included an 11-point proposal addressing issues that arose during the due diligence process . " we have made every effort to resolve the issues that were preventing the conclusion of this matter and we have asked gm and all other involved parties to seriously consider this offer , " said muller .
he added that the new offer eliminates the need for loan approval by the european investment bank -lrb- eib -rrb- prior to year end , which would allow the deal to be concluded within gm 's original december 31 deadline . while muller did not reveal any details about the financing of the new offer , he said spyker 's bid would remain valid until 11pm central european time -lrb- 5pm eastern time -rrb- on monday . several suitors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so far only small carmakers have shown real interest in acquiring saab on its website , general motors said it had received inquiries from several potential bidders since friday 's announcement that it would start the orderly closure of saab .

three companies now face huge fines for price fixing , with more investigations underway . bosses from coffee companies tchibo , melitta and dallmayr worked together to keep their prices artificially high , a competition watchdog has ruled . germany 's cartel office has imposed fines amounting to almost 159.5 million euros against the coffee producers .
the fine is against the three coffee roasters and six employees who were deemed to be responsible .
there were several price fixes from the beginning of 2000 until the company was investigated in july 2008 .
the bonn-based cartel office said that a circle of company leaders and sales bosses had met to fix prices on products that included coffee beans , espresso coffee and ordinary filter coffee .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : espresso coffee was one of the products that were made more expensive dates and periods as well as the scope and level of the price rises were agreed upon .
five price hikes were set up between 2003 and 2008 .
the effect of just two of these increases - in winter 2004 and spring 2005 - led to an average price increase of a euro on a 500g pack of coffee .
melitta coffee spokeswoman anette kahre said the firm would appeal against the fine and that it had cooperated fully with authorities in the investigation .
the company also regretted what had happened , kahre added , and it had " made arrangements for such a thing not to happen again . "
" fine is completely excessive " dallmayr said the fine was " completely excessive " and that taking into account tax , german coffee was the best value in europe .
there was no comment from tchibo , although it did confirm the amount of the fine .
the cartel office said that the fines were still not legally binding and that the companies had an opportunity to put forward objections .
it added that further investigations were also taking place into numerous coffee producers , including cappuccino producers , and are expected to be completed in the first half of 2010. rc / afp / dpa editor : ranty islam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the spyker leadership has submitted a renewed offer in the hopes of securing a future for saab , its employees and the brand - despite the announcement that the winding down of saab would begin , " the company said in a statement . spyker said it hoped " the renewed offer would remove each of the obstacles that were standing in the way of a swift transaction . "
the company 's chief executive , victor muller , said its revised bid included an 11-point proposal addressing issues that arose during the due diligence process . " we have made every effort to resolve the issues that were preventing the conclusion of this matter and we have asked gm and all other involved parties to seriously consider this offer , " said muller .
he added that the new offer eliminates the need for loan approval by the european investment bank -lrb- eib -rrb- prior to year end , which would allow the deal to be concluded within gm 's original december 31 deadline . while muller did not reveal any details about the financing of the new offer , he said spyker 's bid would remain valid until 11pm central european time -lrb- 5pm eastern time -rrb- on monday . several suitors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so far only small carmakers have shown real interest in acquiring saab on its website , general motors said it had received inquiries from several potential bidders since friday 's announcement that it would start the orderly closure of saab .

gm must now respond with a serious examination of the new bid , " union chairman stefan loefven said . swedish media report that the closure of saab could lead to more than 8,000 job losses , including subcontractors and others dependent on the carmaker .
the company 's global distribution network is comprised of 1,100 dealerships . gm has been trying to sell the unit since the start of the year .
swedish luxury carmaker koenigsegg , which builds around 18 high-end sports cars a year , pulled out of a deal to buy saab last month , citing costly delays . like koenigsegg , spyker is also a premium niche manufacturer .
in 2008 , it sold just 37 cars worldwide with prices starting at 200,000 euros -lrb- $ 290,000 -rrb- . saab sold just over 93,000 cars last year .

wolfgang schaeuble told the mass-circulation tabloid bild that germany must reduce its deficit considerably , even if it 's a challenge . " we must reduce the structural deficit , starting in 2011 , by around 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 14 billion -rrb- per year , " he said .
" that will be tough , but we have to do it . " schaeuble promised to draw up a plan to achieve his goal for six consecutive years by july of next year ; however , last week he admitted that he was n't sure where to begin making the cuts . germany 's national debt is currently 1,725 billion euros -lrb- $ 2,470 billion -rrb- , and it 's rising by 4,439 euros per second .
that total figure equates to just over 21,000 euros of debt for every german citizen . to make matters worse , ongoing government spending in a bid to fend off the recent recession means germany is set to dig deeper than ever before in 2010 .
last week , chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet gave the green light to a 2010 budget proposal that foresees borrowing a record 85.8 billion euros over the course of the year . balancing the books bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german national debt is no secret , and it 's still rising meanwhile , chancellor merkel 's new centre-right coalition last week succeeded in delivering one of its key election promises , a heavily disputed 8.5 billion euro tax relief package , which would take effect in 2011 . many prominent members of merkel 's christian democrat party have already voiced their doubts about the sustainability of these tax breaks at a time of record national borrowing . " anybody who 's crying out for a tax reform package in 2011 needs to also explain how we can finance it , " michael meister , deputy leader of the christian democrat 's parliamentary group , told the handelsblatt business daily . " further tax relief packages , which will cost the state 10 billion euros , are hardly conducive to our current need to save money . " germany is one of a slew of eu economies under pressure from brussels to bring their annual borrowing back in line with the eu 's prescribed limit of three per cent of gross domestic product .
now , finance minister wolfgang schaeuble and his team must find a way to make it happen . msh / afp / ap editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 21.12.2009 demjanjuk presents german law with an almost impossible problem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demjanjuk worked in the sobibor concentration camp the demjanjuk trial , which resumed monday , has offered up some awkward moral questions for the german justice system .
but compared with other nazi trials , demjanjuk represents a completely new legal challenge . the trial of john demjanjuk , a ukrainian former prisoner-of-war turned concentration camp guard , has once again lifted the lid on questions about how the german justice system has dealt with the murderers of the holocaust .
not least among these questions is : ' why now ? '
even by the glacial time-scale dictated by the law , the demjanjuk trial has been a long time coming .
the file of evidence against him has not changed since his identity was established in 1993 , when an israeli court cleared him of being a notorious treblinka guard called ivan the terrible .
a single identity card is the main piece of evidence : it shows that demjanjuk was indeed a guard at sobibor , probably between march and september 1943 , and therefore must have helped murder at least 27,900 people thought to have died there in that period .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demjanjuk 's id is the main piece of evidence but the rest of the evidence against demjanjuk is either circumstantial or mitigating .
most of the 35 plaintiffs are simply relatives of those killed at sobibor , and the four actual survivors of the camp are too old to have a reliable memory of him or his immediate actions .
the defense lawyer ulrich busch has repeatedly argued that demjanjuk is also a victim of the nazi regime : as a ukrainian prisoner of war , demjanjuk became a trawniki - one of the many local non-germans trained as guards in the easternmost concentration camps - to avoid starvation .
why now ?
busch also asked the question ' why now ? ' in court in the first days of the trial in early december .
demjanjuk has only been legally pursued for these crimes since 2001 .
busch pointed to the trials of demjanjuk 's superiors that had resulted in acquittals - particularly that of karl streibel , a trawniki recruiter , tried in germany in 1976 and scandalously acquitted after his attorneys successfully argued that he did not know what the guards he trained would be used for .
" how can those that give the orders be innocent , when those that receive them are guilty ? "
busch asked the court .
angelika benz , a phd history student writing a thesis on the concentration camps in eastern poland , visited the first days of the demjanjuk trial and described the central difficulty in blunt terms .
" even though we know what happened at sobibor , the problem is that this crime - the holocaust - simply ca n't be dealt with by our judicial system , " benz told deutsche welle , " this becomes clear when we 're dealing with someone like demjanjuk - someone about whom we know very little . "
with so many facts missing about demjanjuk 's actions and motivations , his judges are forced to redefine the law according to the general and abstract definition of the holocaust itself .
the judges ' answer to busch 's question of how demjanjuk could be considered guilty when the man who may have trained him had been acquitted was simple - the past mistakes of the german judiciary need not be repeated .
this signal that past judgements in nazi trials are irrelevant , even flawed , is apparently necessary if any judgement can be passed on demjanjuk at all .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only the decision-makers were originally put on trial the precedents are useless the historian joerg friedrich became famous when he published two provocative books on the nazi trials in the early 1980 's - " freispruch fuer die nazi-justiz " -lrb- " acquittal for the nazi-judiciary " -rrb- and " die kalte amnestie " -lrb- " the cold amnesty " -rrb- - in which he argued that the german judiciary had failed to bring the nazi perpetrators to justice .
now he believes that the judiciary has come round to his point of view , and is attempting to correct its mistake by going after the last remaining perpetrators with new vigor .
the trial of 88- year-old heinrich boere , a dutch member of the ss , is also currently under way in aachen after decades of legal prevarication and a tireless campaign to bring him to justice .
friedrich believes that the demjanjuk trial illustrates two important developments in the german judiciary 's attitude to the holocaust .
firstly , that it is rethinking , or being forced to rethink , its definition of a holocaust perpetrator .
secondly , that it is prepared to lower the bar of required evidence in order to convict holocaust perpetrators .
but boere 's crime is much easier to define than demjanjuk 's - he is accused of , and has admitted to , three specific acts of murder .
by current german law , this is the crime that demjanjuk will have to be found guilty of if he is to be convicted - of all the crimes that demjanjuk may or may not have committed , murder is the only one that has not exceeded its time-bar limit .
germany lifted that limit on murder in the 1960 's .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinrich boere 's trial is also under way in aachen " this is a problem that judges in the 50 's , 60 's , 70 's and 80 's ignored , " friedrich told deutsche welle , " the majority of holocaust-perpetrators were seen as abetters , those that helped the murderers .
the actual murderers were always defined as hitler , himmler , eichmann - those that made the decision to instigate the holocaust - or those that showed a personal motivation in the act .
murder is not simply killing someone - you must prove intent and motivation to ensure a conviction .
the abetters were those that helped hitler , but had no motives of their own - they simply carried out their tasks . "
this narrow definition of the murderers of the holocaust appears in almost all nazi trial judgements from previous trials .
simply working in a concentration camp never convicted anyone .
but this is all that can be established beyond doubt about demjanjuk .
in order to convict him , the judges will essentially have to redefine murder for the extreme and abstract circumstances of the holocaust .
a long chain " in previous nazi trials , those that were convicted were the so-called ' concentration camp monsters ' - people who had been seen tormenting , abusing , or beating jews before their execution , " friedrich explains , " such actions were considered ' personal contributions ' , and people were convicted not of being abetters to the crime but of being co-perpetrators . "
this goes some way to explaining why so few people were convicted of holocaust crimes in germany .
according to an article in news magazine der spiegel on the legacy of german guilt , of over 100,000 investigations that were carried out in postwar germany into nazi crimes , only around 6,500 people were convicted .
thirteen death sentences were passed , 167 life sentences , and the rest received shorter prison sentences or fines .
only a fifth of those convictions were for murder .
" for the german judiciary , the holocaust only ever existed within the camp gates , " friedrich points out , " but in fact the holocaust was a long chain .
the whole of society played dumb and those that did the bloody work appeared in court . "

but compared with other nazi trials , demjanjuk represents a completely new legal challenge . the trial of john demjanjuk , a ukrainian former prisoner-of-war turned concentration camp guard , has once again lifted the lid on questions about how the german justice system has dealt with the murderers of the holocaust .
not least among these questions is : ' why now ? '
even by the glacial time-scale dictated by the law , the demjanjuk trial has been a long time coming .
the file of evidence against him has not changed since his identity was established in 1993 , when an israeli court cleared him of being a notorious treblinka guard called ivan the terrible .
a single identity card is the main piece of evidence : it shows that demjanjuk was indeed a guard at sobibor , probably between march and september 1943 , and therefore must have helped murder at least 27,900 people thought to have died there in that period .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demjanjuk 's id is the main piece of evidence but the rest of the evidence against demjanjuk is either circumstantial or mitigating .
most of the 35 plaintiffs are simply relatives of those killed at sobibor , and the four actual survivors of the camp are too old to have a reliable memory of him or his immediate actions .
the defense lawyer ulrich busch has repeatedly argued that demjanjuk is also a victim of the nazi regime : as a ukrainian prisoner of war , demjanjuk became a trawniki - one of the many local non-germans trained as guards in the easternmost concentration camps - to avoid starvation .
why now ?
busch also asked the question ' why now ? ' in court in the first days of the trial in early december .
demjanjuk has only been legally pursued for these crimes since 2001 .
busch pointed to the trials of demjanjuk 's superiors that had resulted in acquittals - particularly that of karl streibel , a trawniki recruiter , tried in germany in 1976 and scandalously acquitted after his attorneys successfully argued that he did not know what the guards he trained would be used for .
" how can those that give the orders be innocent , when those that receive them are guilty ? "
busch asked the court .
angelika benz , a phd history student writing a thesis on the concentration camps in eastern poland , visited the first days of the demjanjuk trial and described the central difficulty in blunt terms .
" even though we know what happened at sobibor , the problem is that this crime - the holocaust - simply ca n't be dealt with by our judicial system , " benz told deutsche welle , " this becomes clear when we 're dealing with someone like demjanjuk - someone about whom we know very little . "
with so many facts missing about demjanjuk 's actions and motivations , his judges are forced to redefine the law according to the general and abstract definition of the holocaust itself .
the judges ' answer to busch 's question of how demjanjuk could be considered guilty when the man who may have trained him had been acquitted was simple - the past mistakes of the german judiciary need not be repeated .
this signal that past judgements in nazi trials are irrelevant , even flawed , is apparently necessary if any judgement can be passed on demjanjuk at all .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only the decision-makers were originally put on trial the precedents are useless the historian joerg friedrich became famous when he published two provocative books on the nazi trials in the early 1980 's - " freispruch fuer die nazi-justiz " -lrb- " acquittal for the nazi-judiciary " -rrb- and " die kalte amnestie " -lrb- " the cold amnesty " -rrb- - in which he argued that the german judiciary had failed to bring the nazi perpetrators to justice .
now he believes that the judiciary has come round to his point of view , and is attempting to correct its mistake by going after the last remaining perpetrators with new vigor .
the trial of 88- year-old heinrich boere , a dutch member of the ss , is also currently under way in aachen after decades of legal prevarication and a tireless campaign to bring him to justice .
friedrich believes that the demjanjuk trial illustrates two important developments in the german judiciary 's attitude to the holocaust .
firstly , that it is rethinking , or being forced to rethink , its definition of a holocaust perpetrator .
secondly , that it is prepared to lower the bar of required evidence in order to convict holocaust perpetrators .
but boere 's crime is much easier to define than demjanjuk 's - he is accused of , and has admitted to , three specific acts of murder .
by current german law , this is the crime that demjanjuk will have to be found guilty of if he is to be convicted - of all the crimes that demjanjuk may or may not have committed , murder is the only one that has not exceeded its time-bar limit .
germany lifted that limit on murder in the 1960 's .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinrich boere 's trial is also under way in aachen " this is a problem that judges in the 50 's , 60 's , 70 's and 80 's ignored , " friedrich told deutsche welle , " the majority of holocaust-perpetrators were seen as abetters , those that helped the murderers .
the actual murderers were always defined as hitler , himmler , eichmann - those that made the decision to instigate the holocaust - or those that showed a personal motivation in the act .
murder is not simply killing someone - you must prove intent and motivation to ensure a conviction .
the abetters were those that helped hitler , but had no motives of their own - they simply carried out their tasks . "
this narrow definition of the murderers of the holocaust appears in almost all nazi trial judgements from previous trials .
simply working in a concentration camp never convicted anyone .
but this is all that can be established beyond doubt about demjanjuk .
in order to convict him , the judges will essentially have to redefine murder for the extreme and abstract circumstances of the holocaust .
a long chain " in previous nazi trials , those that were convicted were the so-called ' concentration camp monsters ' - people who had been seen tormenting , abusing , or beating jews before their execution , " friedrich explains , " such actions were considered ' personal contributions ' , and people were convicted not of being abetters to the crime but of being co-perpetrators . "
this goes some way to explaining why so few people were convicted of holocaust crimes in germany .
according to an article in news magazine der spiegel on the legacy of german guilt , of over 100,000 investigations that were carried out in postwar germany into nazi crimes , only around 6,500 people were convicted .
thirteen death sentences were passed , 167 life sentences , and the rest received shorter prison sentences or fines .
only a fifth of those convictions were for murder .
" for the german judiciary , the holocaust only ever existed within the camp gates , " friedrich points out , " but in fact the holocaust was a long chain .
the whole of society played dumb and those that did the bloody work appeared in court . "

but compared with other nazi trials , demjanjuk represents a completely new legal challenge . the trial of john demjanjuk , a ukrainian former prisoner-of-war turned concentration camp guard , has once again lifted the lid on questions about how the german justice system has dealt with the murderers of the holocaust .
not least among these questions is : ' why now ? '
even by the glacial time-scale dictated by the law , the demjanjuk trial has been a long time coming .
the file of evidence against him has not changed since his identity was established in 1993 , when an israeli court cleared him of being a notorious treblinka guard called ivan the terrible .
a single identity card is the main piece of evidence : it shows that demjanjuk was indeed a guard at sobibor , probably between march and september 1943 , and therefore must have helped murder at least 27,900 people thought to have died there in that period .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demjanjuk 's id is the main piece of evidence but the rest of the evidence against demjanjuk is either circumstantial or mitigating .
most of the 35 plaintiffs are simply relatives of those killed at sobibor , and the four actual survivors of the camp are too old to have a reliable memory of him or his immediate actions .
the defense lawyer ulrich busch has repeatedly argued that demjanjuk is also a victim of the nazi regime : as a ukrainian prisoner of war , demjanjuk became a trawniki - one of the many local non-germans trained as guards in the easternmost concentration camps - to avoid starvation .
why now ?
busch also asked the question ' why now ? ' in court in the first days of the trial in early december .
demjanjuk has only been legally pursued for these crimes since 2001 .
busch pointed to the trials of demjanjuk 's superiors that had resulted in acquittals - particularly that of karl streibel , a trawniki recruiter , tried in germany in 1976 and scandalously acquitted after his attorneys successfully argued that he did not know what the guards he trained would be used for .
" how can those that give the orders be innocent , when those that receive them are guilty ? "
busch asked the court .
angelika benz , a phd history student writing a thesis on the concentration camps in eastern poland , visited the first days of the demjanjuk trial and described the central difficulty in blunt terms .
" even though we know what happened at sobibor , the problem is that this crime - the holocaust - simply ca n't be dealt with by our judicial system , " benz told deutsche welle , " this becomes clear when we 're dealing with someone like demjanjuk - someone about whom we know very little . "
with so many facts missing about demjanjuk 's actions and motivations , his judges are forced to redefine the law according to the general and abstract definition of the holocaust itself .
the judges ' answer to busch 's question of how demjanjuk could be considered guilty when the man who may have trained him had been acquitted was simple - the past mistakes of the german judiciary need not be repeated .
this signal that past judgements in nazi trials are irrelevant , even flawed , is apparently necessary if any judgement can be passed on demjanjuk at all .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only the decision-makers were originally put on trial the precedents are useless the historian joerg friedrich became famous when he published two provocative books on the nazi trials in the early 1980 's - " freispruch fuer die nazi-justiz " -lrb- " acquittal for the nazi-judiciary " -rrb- and " die kalte amnestie " -lrb- " the cold amnesty " -rrb- - in which he argued that the german judiciary had failed to bring the nazi perpetrators to justice .
now he believes that the judiciary has come round to his point of view , and is attempting to correct its mistake by going after the last remaining perpetrators with new vigor .
the trial of 88- year-old heinrich boere , a dutch member of the ss , is also currently under way in aachen after decades of legal prevarication and a tireless campaign to bring him to justice .
friedrich believes that the demjanjuk trial illustrates two important developments in the german judiciary 's attitude to the holocaust .
firstly , that it is rethinking , or being forced to rethink , its definition of a holocaust perpetrator .
secondly , that it is prepared to lower the bar of required evidence in order to convict holocaust perpetrators .
but boere 's crime is much easier to define than demjanjuk 's - he is accused of , and has admitted to , three specific acts of murder .
by current german law , this is the crime that demjanjuk will have to be found guilty of if he is to be convicted - of all the crimes that demjanjuk may or may not have committed , murder is the only one that has not exceeded its time-bar limit .
germany lifted that limit on murder in the 1960 's .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinrich boere 's trial is also under way in aachen " this is a problem that judges in the 50 's , 60 's , 70 's and 80 's ignored , " friedrich told deutsche welle , " the majority of holocaust-perpetrators were seen as abetters , those that helped the murderers .
the actual murderers were always defined as hitler , himmler , eichmann - those that made the decision to instigate the holocaust - or those that showed a personal motivation in the act .
murder is not simply killing someone - you must prove intent and motivation to ensure a conviction .
the abetters were those that helped hitler , but had no motives of their own - they simply carried out their tasks . "
this narrow definition of the murderers of the holocaust appears in almost all nazi trial judgements from previous trials .
simply working in a concentration camp never convicted anyone .
but this is all that can be established beyond doubt about demjanjuk .
in order to convict him , the judges will essentially have to redefine murder for the extreme and abstract circumstances of the holocaust .
a long chain " in previous nazi trials , those that were convicted were the so-called ' concentration camp monsters ' - people who had been seen tormenting , abusing , or beating jews before their execution , " friedrich explains , " such actions were considered ' personal contributions ' , and people were convicted not of being abetters to the crime but of being co-perpetrators . "
this goes some way to explaining why so few people were convicted of holocaust crimes in germany .
according to an article in news magazine der spiegel on the legacy of german guilt , of over 100,000 investigations that were carried out in postwar germany into nazi crimes , only around 6,500 people were convicted .
thirteen death sentences were passed , 167 life sentences , and the rest received shorter prison sentences or fines .
only a fifth of those convictions were for murder .
" for the german judiciary , the holocaust only ever existed within the camp gates , " friedrich points out , " but in fact the holocaust was a long chain .
the whole of society played dumb and those that did the bloody work appeared in court . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de awards -pipe- 21.12.2009 sports journalists name athletes of the year in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul biedermann and steffi nerius show off their awards in a tradition that dates back to 1947 , german sports journalists have voted on the man , woman , and team who impacted the world of german sports the most over the past twelve months . all told , around 1400 journalists cast their ballots for the german sports awards , which were presented at a ceremony sunday night in baden baden .
in 2009 , the spotlight fell on one of the female stars from this summer 's world athletics championships in berlin , the only man to beat michael phelps in a major swimming competition since 2005 , and the women 's national soccer team for their clear dominance over their european competitors .
steffi nerius throws for gold after the opening weekend of the world athletics championships in august , the biggest star to emerge from berlin 's olympic stadium was usain bolt , whose record-breaking 100-meter dash on the competition 's second day captivated germans and out-of-town visitors alike .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nerius 's first throw was good enough for gold two days later , bolt had competition for the newspaper headlines , and it was from a member of the home team .
when steffi nerius stepped to the line of the finals in the javelin competition , germany had yet to produce a single gold medal winner .
tournament organizers had staggered the events so there was a german gold medal hopeful on each of the nine days of competition , but on the fourth day , they were still waiting for the first german champion .
nerius 's first throw of the finals sailed 67.30 meters , which held as the best mark throughout the entire competition .
when eventual czech silver medalist barbora spotakova 's final throw of the event failed to beat nerius ' mark , nerius raised her arms in the air and celebrated germany 's first gold of the competition , with a stadium full of loud supporters cheering her on .
it was the first world championship gold medal of the 37-year-old 's career .
before the world championships began , there had been fears that germany would repeat its performance from the beijing olympics and come up short in the medals column .
but after nerius set the precedent , german athletes went on to take home a total of two gold , three silver , and four bronze medals , which represented a successful competition for the host nation .
paul biedermann upsets michael phelps new world records were practically a drop in the deep end at the world swimming championships in rome last july .
controversial new swimsuits , made partially or entirely out of polyurethane , seemed to be giving swimmers who wore them a slight edge , and as a result , 43 world records fell at the meet in rome .
bildunterschrift : biedermann bested the world record - and michael phelps - in the 200m freestyle paul biedermann grabbed two of those records , and they happened to be two of the most impressive of the entire competition .
wearing a full-body polyurethane suit , biedermann bested legendary australian swimmer ian thorpe 's world record in the 400 meter freestyle , a mark that many in the sport thought would be safe for many years .
biedermann 's next record was even more impressive , especially because of the man he handily beat in the race .
in the 200 ´ -meter freestyle , biedermann shattered american michael phelps 's world record time by over a second , and handed phelps his only silver medal in world or olympic competition since 2005 .
phelps did n't wear one of the all-polyurethane suits against biedermann , but still praised the 23-year-old german 's performance .
" paul swam a great race .
i did not have anything in the last 50 meters , " phelps said after the swim .
" in the race i was beaten by the swimmer , not the suit . "
starting in 2010 , swimming 's governing body fina will implement a ban on all-polyurethane suits , but eight-time beijing gold medallist michael phelps has a new top rival for next season : germany 's paul biedermann .
women 's national team wins european championships german soccer fans remember well the impressive march by bundesliga squad vfl wolfsburg to the german championship at the end of the 2008/2009 bundesliga season .
it was the first title in the team 's history .
but to be considered germany 's best team of the year , one title just is n't enough .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inka grings had six goals to celebrate at this year 's european championship seven is more appropriate - the number of titles the german women 's national soccer team has after winning the 2009 european championship in finland by convincingly beating england 6-2 in the final .
winning yet another title continued an impressive streak for the german women .
in european championship competition , the team remains unbeaten since 1995 .
that 's a total of 26 matches , and five titles in a row .
in fact , since the first women 's european championship took place in 1984 , only two other countries - sweden once and norway twice - have won the title other than germany .
like squads in the past , the 2009 european champions simply overpowered their opponents .
in the six matches played by the german side in finland , they scored 21 goals against their opponents ' 5 goals combined .
six of those goals came from striker inka grings , and the rest came from a team effort of nine other goal scorers .
2009 marks the second time the women 's national team has been elected team of the year by german sports journalists .
the first was in 2003 , after the team won its first women 's world cup .
they followed it up with another title in 2007 , and have a shot at their third straight world cup in 2011 as the host country. mz / dpa / sid editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this move has cast doubt on a crucial international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and eu-led 7.5 billion euro bailout for the recession-hit state .
the pension cuts have been in force since july , and constitutional court chief gunars kutris says they take away anywhere between 10 and 70 percent of old-age pensions depending on an individual 's status .
kurtis said the measures were illegal and that parliament must have measures in place to refund the cuts by march 2010 .
" violation " of social security and rule of law in its judgement , the court stated that " the decision to cut pensions violated the individual 's right to social security and the principle of the rule of law . "
it added that agreements with international lenders in and of themselves can not be used as an argument to limit basic rights .
the court 's ruling in the case is final and can not be appealed .
the case was brought to the court by 9,000 individual pensioners .
it has been ruled that the money itself must be paid back in full no later than 2015 .
the sum is estimated around 100 million lats -lrb- 140 million euros -rrb- .
currently , latvia is in the middle of one of the deepest recessions in the european union , with its economy expected to shrink by up to 18 percent this year .
over the past year , its government has been raising taxes and reducing public spending as it attempts to stick to the terms of the imf / eu bailout .
under the deal , latvia pledged to cut 500 million lats -lrb- 702 million euros -rrb- every year until 2012. mk / afp / reuters editor : ranty islam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this move has cast doubt on a crucial international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and eu-led 7.5 billion euro bailout for the recession-hit state .
the pension cuts have been in force since july , and constitutional court chief gunars kutris says they take away anywhere between 10 and 70 percent of old-age pensions depending on an individual 's status .
kurtis said the measures were illegal and that parliament must have measures in place to refund the cuts by march 2010 .
" violation " of social security and rule of law in its judgement , the court stated that " the decision to cut pensions violated the individual 's right to social security and the principle of the rule of law . "
it added that agreements with international lenders in and of themselves can not be used as an argument to limit basic rights .
the court 's ruling in the case is final and can not be appealed .
the case was brought to the court by 9,000 individual pensioners .
it has been ruled that the money itself must be paid back in full no later than 2015 .
the sum is estimated around 100 million lats -lrb- 140 million euros -rrb- .
currently , latvia is in the middle of one of the deepest recessions in the european union , with its economy expected to shrink by up to 18 percent this year .
over the past year , its government has been raising taxes and reducing public spending as it attempts to stick to the terms of the imf / eu bailout .
under the deal , latvia pledged to cut 500 million lats -lrb- 702 million euros -rrb- every year until 2012. mk / afp / reuters editor : ranty islam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

steffi nerius throws for gold after the opening weekend of the world athletics championships in august , the biggest star to emerge from berlin 's olympic stadium was usain bolt , whose record-breaking 100-meter dash on the competition 's second day captivated germans and out-of-town visitors alike .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nerius 's first throw was good enough for gold two days later , bolt had competition for the newspaper headlines , and it was from a member of the home team .
when steffi nerius stepped to the line of the finals in the javelin competition , germany had yet to produce a single gold medal winner .
tournament organizers had staggered the events so there was a german gold medal hopeful on each of the nine days of competition , but on the fourth day , they were still waiting for the first german champion .
nerius 's first throw of the finals sailed 67.30 meters , which held as the best mark throughout the entire competition .
when eventual czech silver medalist barbora spotakova 's final throw of the event failed to beat nerius ' mark , nerius raised her arms in the air and celebrated germany 's first gold of the competition , with a stadium full of loud supporters cheering her on .
it was the first world championship gold medal of the 37-year-old 's career .
before the world championships began , there had been fears that germany would repeat its performance from the beijing olympics and come up short in the medals column .
but after nerius set the precedent , german athletes went on to take home a total of two gold , three silver , and four bronze medals , which represented a successful competition for the host nation .
paul biedermann upsets michael phelps new world records were practically a drop in the deep end at the world swimming championships in rome last july .
controversial new swimsuits , made partially or entirely out of polyurethane , seemed to be giving swimmers who wore them a slight edge , and as a result , 43 world records fell at the meet in rome .
bildunterschrift : biedermann bested the world record - and michael phelps - in the 200m freestyle paul biedermann grabbed two of those records , and they happened to be two of the most impressive of the entire competition .
wearing a full-body polyurethane suit , biedermann bested legendary australian swimmer ian thorpe 's world record in the 400 meter freestyle , a mark that many in the sport thought would be safe for many years .
biedermann 's next record was even more impressive , especially because of the man he handily beat in the race .
in the 200 ´ -meter freestyle , biedermann shattered american michael phelps 's world record time by over a second , and handed phelps his only silver medal in world or olympic competition since 2005 .
phelps did n't wear one of the all-polyurethane suits against biedermann , but still praised the 23-year-old german 's performance .
" paul swam a great race .
i did not have anything in the last 50 meters , " phelps said after the swim .
" in the race i was beaten by the swimmer , not the suit . "
starting in 2010 , swimming 's governing body fina will implement a ban on all-polyurethane suits , but eight-time beijing gold medallist michael phelps has a new top rival for next season : germany 's paul biedermann .
women 's national team wins european championships german soccer fans remember well the impressive march by bundesliga squad vfl wolfsburg to the german championship at the end of the 2008/2009 bundesliga season .
it was the first title in the team 's history .
but to be considered germany 's best team of the year , one title just is n't enough .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inka grings had six goals to celebrate at this year 's european championship seven is more appropriate - the number of titles the german women 's national soccer team has after winning the 2009 european championship in finland by convincingly beating england 6-2 in the final .
winning yet another title continued an impressive streak for the german women .
in european championship competition , the team remains unbeaten since 1995 .
that 's a total of 26 matches , and five titles in a row .
in fact , since the first women 's european championship took place in 1984 , only two other countries - sweden once and norway twice - have won the title other than germany .
like squads in the past , the 2009 european champions simply overpowered their opponents .
in the six matches played by the german side in finland , they scored 21 goals against their opponents ' 5 goals combined .
six of those goals came from striker inka grings , and the rest came from a team effort of nine other goal scorers .
2009 marks the second time the women 's national team has been elected team of the year by german sports journalists .
the first was in 2003 , after the team won its first women 's world cup .
they followed it up with another title in 2007 , and have a shot at their third straight world cup in 2011 as the host country. mz / dpa / sid editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , wolfgang schaeuble has not yet explained how . the german finance minister says he will come up with a plan to start reducing germany 's national debt in the course of 2010 .
wolfgang schaeuble told the mass-circulation tabloid bild that germany must reduce its deficit considerably , even if it 's a challenge . " we must reduce the structural deficit , starting in 2011 , by around 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 14 billion -rrb- per year , " he said .
" that will be tough , but we have to do it . " schaeuble promised to draw up a plan to achieve his goal for six consecutive years by july of next year ; however , last week he admitted that he was n't sure where to begin making the cuts . germany 's national debt is currently 1,725 billion euros -lrb- $ 2,470 billion -rrb- , and it 's rising by 4,439 euros per second .
that total figure equates to just over 21,000 euros of debt for every german citizen . to make matters worse , ongoing government spending in a bid to fend off the recent recession means germany is set to dig deeper than ever before in 2010 .
last week , chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet gave the green light to a 2010 budget proposal that foresees borrowing a record 85.8 billion euros over the course of the year . balancing the books bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german national debt is no secret , and it 's still rising meanwhile , chancellor merkel 's new centre-right coalition last week succeeded in delivering one of its key election promises , a heavily disputed 8.5 billion euro tax relief package , which would take effect in 2011 . many prominent members of merkel 's christian democrat party have already voiced their doubts about the sustainability of these tax breaks at a time of record national borrowing . " anybody who 's crying out for a tax reform package in 2011 needs to also explain how we can finance it , " michael meister , deputy leader of the christian democrat 's parliamentary group , told the handelsblatt business daily . " further tax relief packages , which will cost the state 10 billion euros , are hardly conducive to our current need to save money . " germany is one of a slew of eu economies under pressure from brussels to bring their annual borrowing back in line with the eu 's prescribed limit of three per cent of gross domestic product .
now , finance minister wolfgang schaeuble and his team must find a way to make it happen . msh / afp / ap editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this move has cast doubt on a crucial international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and eu-led 7.5 billion euro bailout for the recession-hit state .
the pension cuts have been in force since july , and constitutional court chief gunars kutris says they take away anywhere between 10 and 70 percent of old-age pensions depending on an individual 's status .
kurtis said the measures were illegal and that parliament must have measures in place to refund the cuts by march 2010 .
" violation " of social security and rule of law in its judgement , the court stated that " the decision to cut pensions violated the individual 's right to social security and the principle of the rule of law . "
it added that agreements with international lenders in and of themselves can not be used as an argument to limit basic rights .
the court 's ruling in the case is final and can not be appealed .
the case was brought to the court by 9,000 individual pensioners .
it has been ruled that the money itself must be paid back in full no later than 2015 .
the sum is estimated around 100 million lats -lrb- 140 million euros -rrb- .
currently , latvia is in the middle of one of the deepest recessions in the european union , with its economy expected to shrink by up to 18 percent this year .
over the past year , its government has been raising taxes and reducing public spending as it attempts to stick to the terms of the imf / eu bailout .
under the deal , latvia pledged to cut 500 million lats -lrb- 702 million euros -rrb- every year until 2012. mk / afp / reuters editor : ranty islam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

three companies now face huge fines for price fixing , with more investigations underway . bosses from coffee companies tchibo , melitta and dallmayr worked together to keep their prices artificially high , a competition watchdog has ruled . germany 's cartel office has imposed fines amounting to almost 159.5 million euros against the coffee producers .
the fine is against the three coffee roasters and six employees who were deemed to be responsible .
there were several price fixes from the beginning of 2000 until the company was investigated in july 2008 .
the bonn-based cartel office said that a circle of company leaders and sales bosses had met to fix prices on products that included coffee beans , espresso coffee and ordinary filter coffee .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : espresso coffee was one of the products that were made more expensive dates and periods as well as the scope and level of the price rises were agreed upon .
five price hikes were set up between 2003 and 2008 .
the effect of just two of these increases - in winter 2004 and spring 2005 - led to an average price increase of a euro on a 500g pack of coffee .
melitta coffee spokeswoman anette kahre said the firm would appeal against the fine and that it had cooperated fully with authorities in the investigation .
the company also regretted what had happened , kahre added , and it had " made arrangements for such a thing not to happen again . "
" fine is completely excessive " dallmayr said the fine was " completely excessive " and that taking into account tax , german coffee was the best value in europe .
there was no comment from tchibo , although it did confirm the amount of the fine .
the cartel office said that the fines were still not legally binding and that the companies had an opportunity to put forward objections .

three companies now face huge fines for price fixing , with more investigations underway . bosses from coffee companies tchibo , melitta and dallmayr worked together to keep their prices artificially high , a competition watchdog has ruled . germany 's cartel office has imposed fines amounting to almost 159.5 million euros against the coffee producers .
the fine is against the three coffee roasters and six employees who were deemed to be responsible .
there were several price fixes from the beginning of 2000 until the company was investigated in july 2008 .
the bonn-based cartel office said that a circle of company leaders and sales bosses had met to fix prices on products that included coffee beans , espresso coffee and ordinary filter coffee .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : espresso coffee was one of the products that were made more expensive dates and periods as well as the scope and level of the price rises were agreed upon .
five price hikes were set up between 2003 and 2008 .
the effect of just two of these increases - in winter 2004 and spring 2005 - led to an average price increase of a euro on a 500g pack of coffee .
melitta coffee spokeswoman anette kahre said the firm would appeal against the fine and that it had cooperated fully with authorities in the investigation .
the company also regretted what had happened , kahre added , and it had " made arrangements for such a thing not to happen again . "
" fine is completely excessive " dallmayr said the fine was " completely excessive " and that taking into account tax , german coffee was the best value in europe .
there was no comment from tchibo , although it did confirm the amount of the fine .
the cartel office said that the fines were still not legally binding and that the companies had an opportunity to put forward objections .
it added that further investigations were also taking place into numerous coffee producers , including cappuccino producers , and are expected to be completed in the first half of 2010. rc / afp / dpa editor : ranty islam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de awards -pipe- 21.12.2009 sports journalists name athletes of the year in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul biedermann and steffi nerius show off their awards in a tradition that dates back to 1947 , german sports journalists have voted on the man , woman , and team who impacted the world of german sports the most over the past twelve months . all told , around 1400 journalists cast their ballots for the german sports awards , which were presented at a ceremony sunday night in baden baden .
in 2009 , the spotlight fell on one of the female stars from this summer 's world athletics championships in berlin , the only man to beat michael phelps in a major swimming competition since 2005 , and the women 's national soccer team for their clear dominance over their european competitors .
steffi nerius throws for gold after the opening weekend of the world athletics championships in august , the biggest star to emerge from berlin 's olympic stadium was usain bolt , whose record-breaking 100-meter dash on the competition 's second day captivated germans and out-of-town visitors alike .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nerius 's first throw was good enough for gold two days later , bolt had competition for the newspaper headlines , and it was from a member of the home team .
when steffi nerius stepped to the line of the finals in the javelin competition , germany had yet to produce a single gold medal winner .
tournament organizers had staggered the events so there was a german gold medal hopeful on each of the nine days of competition , but on the fourth day , they were still waiting for the first german champion .
nerius 's first throw of the finals sailed 67.30 meters , which held as the best mark throughout the entire competition .
when eventual czech silver medalist barbora spotakova 's final throw of the event failed to beat nerius ' mark , nerius raised her arms in the air and celebrated germany 's first gold of the competition , with a stadium full of loud supporters cheering her on .
it was the first world championship gold medal of the 37-year-old 's career .
before the world championships began , there had been fears that germany would repeat its performance from the beijing olympics and come up short in the medals column .
but after nerius set the precedent , german athletes went on to take home a total of two gold , three silver , and four bronze medals , which represented a successful competition for the host nation .
paul biedermann upsets michael phelps new world records were practically a drop in the deep end at the world swimming championships in rome last july .
controversial new swimsuits , made partially or entirely out of polyurethane , seemed to be giving swimmers who wore them a slight edge , and as a result , 43 world records fell at the meet in rome .
bildunterschrift : biedermann bested the world record - and michael phelps - in the 200m freestyle paul biedermann grabbed two of those records , and they happened to be two of the most impressive of the entire competition .
wearing a full-body polyurethane suit , biedermann bested legendary australian swimmer ian thorpe 's world record in the 400 meter freestyle , a mark that many in the sport thought would be safe for many years .
biedermann 's next record was even more impressive , especially because of the man he handily beat in the race .
in the 200 ´ -meter freestyle , biedermann shattered american michael phelps 's world record time by over a second , and handed phelps his only silver medal in world or olympic competition since 2005 .
phelps did n't wear one of the all-polyurethane suits against biedermann , but still praised the 23-year-old german 's performance .
" paul swam a great race .
i did not have anything in the last 50 meters , " phelps said after the swim .
" in the race i was beaten by the swimmer , not the suit . "
starting in 2010 , swimming 's governing body fina will implement a ban on all-polyurethane suits , but eight-time beijing gold medallist michael phelps has a new top rival for next season : germany 's paul biedermann .
women 's national team wins european championships german soccer fans remember well the impressive march by bundesliga squad vfl wolfsburg to the german championship at the end of the 2008/2009 bundesliga season .
it was the first title in the team 's history .
but to be considered germany 's best team of the year , one title just is n't enough .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inka grings had six goals to celebrate at this year 's european championship seven is more appropriate - the number of titles the german women 's national soccer team has after winning the 2009 european championship in finland by convincingly beating england 6-2 in the final .
winning yet another title continued an impressive streak for the german women .
in european championship competition , the team remains unbeaten since 1995 .
that 's a total of 26 matches , and five titles in a row .
in fact , since the first women 's european championship took place in 1984 , only two other countries - sweden once and norway twice - have won the title other than germany .
like squads in the past , the 2009 european champions simply overpowered their opponents .
in the six matches played by the german side in finland , they scored 21 goals against their opponents ' 5 goals combined .
six of those goals came from striker inka grings , and the rest came from a team effort of nine other goal scorers .
2009 marks the second time the women 's national team has been elected team of the year by german sports journalists .
the first was in 2003 , after the team won its first women 's world cup .
they followed it up with another title in 2007 , and have a shot at their third straight world cup in 2011 as the host country. mz / dpa / sid editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

china has been investing heavily in the african market and is keen to stress the benefits to local businesses .
is that involvement an opportunity or a risk to africa ’ s development and is europe being left behind ? on the copperbelt in zambia , investment in luanshya mine by china 's non-ferrous meter mining group corporation -lrb- nfca -rrb- has been welcomed by locals .
a veteran of the mining industry who wanted to remain anonymous told deutsche welle that " -lsb- s -rsb- o far -lsb- the chinese investors -rsb- are good guys because they are putting -lsb- in -rsb- a lot of money before production starts . "
for a small town whose future appeared bleak when mining production was shut down , the creation of an estimated 3,000 jobs is good news .
the warm welcome of chinese investment in luanshya is in stark contrast to the anti-chinese sentiment in a town less than an hour away .
the memory of a mine explosion that left 46 dead still lingers in chambeshi .
for many , graves located close to the mine are a daily reminder of the deaths of a colleague or loved one .
more than four years after the incident , the community remains ambivalent about the reopening of the plant where the explosion occurred even if it will bring many jobs to the area .
some still feel that their chinese employers are to blame for the incident .
mukuka chilufya , a safety officer who participated in rescue operations following the explosion , told deutsche welle that " maybe they could have received a bulk order and they were running out of time .
so the night shift that were involved in the male dyke collided with the day shift that were involved in the female dyke .
in fact , what is going to confirm that is that the chinese who were knowledgeable of the consequences all were not in the factory when the explosion took place because they knew that something like that could happen . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is investing heavily in africa 's mining industry most of the criticism surrounding china 's involvement in africa debate has been on the working conditions of the miners who are subjected to low wages and questionable safety procedures .
the incident at chambishi mine in zambia in april 2005 drew attention to this .
but as professor helmut asche , director of the institute for african studies at the university of leipzig , notes these conditions are no different from those that miners in northern china are subjected to .
since beijing is unable to control the working conditions of its citizens , african governments are responsible for exerting effective control over chinese investors so that they implement fair wages and adequate safety procedures .
benefits , implications of chinese investment china 's african policy states that it intends to be africa 's equal -lrb- economic -rrb- partner .
experts like he wenping , director of the institute of west-asian and african studies at the chinese academy of social science in beijing , say that china 's goals in africa are more political than economic .
according to asche , a change in china 's africa foreign policy began after the tiananmen square massacre when china needed more foreign allies .
china 's current african partners , who are in the group of 77 , provide it with more influence in the united nations .
asche feels that the import of cheap goods from china can have very different effects as is the case with the south african textile industry and the ethiopian footwear industry .
the protection of local industry in south africa meant that the manufacturers did not modernize their techniques in order to be able to compete successfully with the chinese imports .
on the other hand , in ethiopia where the local footwear manufacturing industry was not protected , production became more competitive and now ethiopia is exporting footwear to china .
zambians often say that " you thank the person who guides you at night when it is dawn . "
the relationship between china and africa is still in its infancy , but as asche told deutsche welle " it is crystal clear -lsb- … -rsb- in scientific research that the chinese investment in all its facets is positive for africa . "
he goes onto say that current investment is doing more to strengthen economies than democracy and good governance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is helping africa develop its infrastructure .
the chinese news agency xinhua estimates that there are currently one million chinese immigrants in africa .
their growing presence is more often than not unwelcome as is shown by attacks on immigrants in nigeria and angola .
most zambians complain that the chinese community isolates itself .
chinese immigrants have not been as successful as indians or other immigrants in integrating in africa , however asche says that both locals and immigrants are responsible for the integration of the chinese migrants .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is investing heavily in africa 's mining industry most of the criticism surrounding china 's involvement in africa debate has been on the working conditions of the miners who are subjected to low wages and questionable safety procedures .
the incident at chambishi mine in zambia in april 2005 drew attention to this .
but as professor helmut asche , director of the institute for african studies at the university of leipzig , notes these conditions are no different from those that miners in northern china are subjected to .
since beijing is unable to control the working conditions of its citizens , african governments are responsible for exerting effective control over chinese investors so that they implement fair wages and adequate safety procedures .
benefits , implications of chinese investment china 's african policy states that it intends to be africa 's equal -lrb- economic -rrb- partner .
experts like he wenping , director of the institute of west-asian and african studies at the chinese academy of social science in beijing , say that china 's goals in africa are more political than economic .
according to asche , a change in china 's africa foreign policy began after the tiananmen square massacre when china needed more foreign allies .
china 's current african partners , who are in the group of 77 , provide it with more influence in the united nations .
asche feels that the import of cheap goods from china can have very different effects as is the case with the south african textile industry and the ethiopian footwear industry .
the protection of local industry in south africa meant that the manufacturers did not modernize their techniques in order to be able to compete successfully with the chinese imports .
on the other hand , in ethiopia where the local footwear manufacturing industry was not protected , production became more competitive and now ethiopia is exporting footwear to china .
zambians often say that " you thank the person who guides you at night when it is dawn . "
the relationship between china and africa is still in its infancy , but as asche told deutsche welle " it is crystal clear -lsb- … -rsb- in scientific research that the chinese investment in all its facets is positive for africa . "
he goes onto say that current investment is doing more to strengthen economies than democracy and good governance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is helping africa develop its infrastructure .
the chinese news agency xinhua estimates that there are currently one million chinese immigrants in africa .
their growing presence is more often than not unwelcome as is shown by attacks on immigrants in nigeria and angola .
most zambians complain that the chinese community isolates itself .
chinese immigrants have not been as successful as indians or other immigrants in integrating in africa , however asche says that both locals and immigrants are responsible for the integration of the chinese migrants .
the role of germany and europe asche feels that germany should do more to get involved in africa : " … the german investors should -lsb- … -rsb- be encouraged to become as courageous as the chinese are .

according to asche , a change in china 's africa foreign policy began after the tiananmen square massacre when china needed more foreign allies .
china 's current african partners , who are in the group of 77 , provide it with more influence in the united nations .
asche feels that the import of cheap goods from china can have very different effects as is the case with the south african textile industry and the ethiopian footwear industry .
the protection of local industry in south africa meant that the manufacturers did not modernize their techniques in order to be able to compete successfully with the chinese imports .
on the other hand , in ethiopia where the local footwear manufacturing industry was not protected , production became more competitive and now ethiopia is exporting footwear to china .
zambians often say that " you thank the person who guides you at night when it is dawn . "
the relationship between china and africa is still in its infancy , but as asche told deutsche welle " it is crystal clear -lsb- … -rsb- in scientific research that the chinese investment in all its facets is positive for africa . "
he goes onto say that current investment is doing more to strengthen economies than democracy and good governance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is helping africa develop its infrastructure .
the chinese news agency xinhua estimates that there are currently one million chinese immigrants in africa .
their growing presence is more often than not unwelcome as is shown by attacks on immigrants in nigeria and angola .
most zambians complain that the chinese community isolates itself .
chinese immigrants have not been as successful as indians or other immigrants in integrating in africa , however asche says that both locals and immigrants are responsible for the integration of the chinese migrants .
the role of germany and europe asche feels that germany should do more to get involved in africa : " … the german investors should -lsb- … -rsb- be encouraged to become as courageous as the chinese are .
it is a crystal clear fact that china and its investors and not only the state-owned companies but also private investors see the african market a lot more positive than do quite a number of investors from european countries , and the germans are certainly not among the most courageous . "
in addition to those fears , asche attributes the lack of increased trade between the two continents to the european union 's trade policy , which does not treat africa as an equal partner as china does : “ -lsb- eu trade policy -rsb- is a good example of how not to deal with partner countries and by way of comparison china all of a sudden stands out as , trade policy-wise , a fair partner to africa in comparison with the eu . "
asche says that the growing trade between china and africa is " an irreversible expression of the new multi-polar world , and european powers -lsb- … -rsb- simply have to learn to live in this multi-polar environment in which there is no longer an exclusive relationship between the eu , the us and africa .

china has been investing heavily in the african market and is keen to stress the benefits to local businesses .
is that involvement an opportunity or a risk to africa ’ s development and is europe being left behind ? on the copperbelt in zambia , investment in luanshya mine by china 's non-ferrous meter mining group corporation -lrb- nfca -rrb- has been welcomed by locals .
a veteran of the mining industry who wanted to remain anonymous told deutsche welle that " -lsb- s -rsb- o far -lsb- the chinese investors -rsb- are good guys because they are putting -lsb- in -rsb- a lot of money before production starts . "
for a small town whose future appeared bleak when mining production was shut down , the creation of an estimated 3,000 jobs is good news .
the warm welcome of chinese investment in luanshya is in stark contrast to the anti-chinese sentiment in a town less than an hour away .
the memory of a mine explosion that left 46 dead still lingers in chambeshi .
for many , graves located close to the mine are a daily reminder of the deaths of a colleague or loved one .
more than four years after the incident , the community remains ambivalent about the reopening of the plant where the explosion occurred even if it will bring many jobs to the area .
some still feel that their chinese employers are to blame for the incident .
mukuka chilufya , a safety officer who participated in rescue operations following the explosion , told deutsche welle that " maybe they could have received a bulk order and they were running out of time .
so the night shift that were involved in the male dyke collided with the day shift that were involved in the female dyke .
in fact , what is going to confirm that is that the chinese who were knowledgeable of the consequences all were not in the factory when the explosion took place because they knew that something like that could happen . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is investing heavily in africa 's mining industry most of the criticism surrounding china 's involvement in africa debate has been on the working conditions of the miners who are subjected to low wages and questionable safety procedures .
the incident at chambishi mine in zambia in april 2005 drew attention to this .
but as professor helmut asche , director of the institute for african studies at the university of leipzig , notes these conditions are no different from those that miners in northern china are subjected to .
since beijing is unable to control the working conditions of its citizens , african governments are responsible for exerting effective control over chinese investors so that they implement fair wages and adequate safety procedures .

the 35-year-old german citizen of turkish descent , identified as sinan b. , was alledgedly a leader in the turkish far-left wing organization dhkp-c in the 1990s .

some found a silver lining , however . the newspaper de volkskrant from holland acknowledged that copenhagen delivered a disappointing result but focused on the positive : the fact that at least the problem is being addressed .
" climate change is now an international problem par excellence .
it seems inevitable that all countries will be brought into negotiations sooner or later .
at the same time , it is nearly impossible to get 192 states of varying size and with diverse interests to reach a unified stance . "
" but there is a glimmer of hope .
all of the participants in the climate conference know that the talks will continue .
and possibly , those actors will be watched by the public and by activists and ngos with a more critical eye than they have been up to now .
because one thing was attained for certain : the climate will never disappear from the political agenda . "
likewise , britain 's guardian newspaper saw positives alongside negatives in the outcome of the conference .
on the bad side : " a considered reading of the accord , which was its only tangible output , reveals that it is not just inadequate but in fact utterly empty . "
on the plus side , however , is " the novel manner in which this ultimate failure was reached . "
" as the sight of the daily chaos -lrb- of copenhagen -rrb- drops out of view , it becomes easier to appreciate that the rich world was forced to haggle with the bigger emerging economies on more equal terms than ever before . "
in other words , " while the copenhagen product is every inch the sham that campaigners say it is , the copenhagen process has set important precedents , " the guardian wrote .
" most obviously … the sheer fact that it took place – and at such a high political level – means it will probably do so again . "
taking a harsher line , left-leaning french newspaper la libération oozed disappointment in the " large countries which , in a delirium of diplomatic ineptitude and the blindness of superiority , torpedoed the binding worldwide accord " they had hoped for . the paper pitched for the eu to take immediate , unilateral action : " eco-reformers need to focus on the us and china , " it wrote ; " after that come the nations that are a bit more environmentally aware , particularly in europe .
but these can not wait until there is an international agreement .
it is much more important for them to become instructive with their actions .
if the eu took the necessary actions from its side , it would jump to the head of the movement .
then the fiasco of copenhagen could be overcome step by step . " in switzerland , zurich 's tages-anzeiger also focused on results ; those who come up with solutions will ultimately benefit in the end , the paper wrote .
at the conference , " concrete solutions were presented on how to reach a climate-friendly future and at the same time remain economically profitable .
numerous companies seemed to have little patience for the political lethargy … the biggest climate-change effect will be felt by those companies and countries that start preparing now .
they will be the ultimate winners , " the paper said .
german editorialists were less inclined to focus on positive signals from the conference .
the sueddeutsche zeitung called the copenhagen summit an " insult to the world community , " noting that " never were expectations for a climate conference higher , and never before were so many heads of state and government officials in one place , meeting to solve one single problem .
but they did n't solve it - they made it worse . "
" as if they were replaying an old , bad film , the heads of the most powerful nations came up with aid funds to silence the developing nations .
they bought their way out .
instead of mutually promising a much-needed rejection of the destructive path of economic development , they agreed on a vague and distant goal .
it is like agreeing on a place to meet , but not a time . "
meanwhile , advocating a just-do-it approach in the wake of the talks , the frankfurter rundschau sent a strong warning to voters and the politicians they elect : " there is no point in allowing the un climate conference circus to continue its performances .
the only chance that remains is for the big heat-producers of the planet to lead by example - without any stipulations about taking others along for the ride , if need be .
fifteen countries on earth are responsible for 80 percent of c02 emissions around the world ; in copenhagen they all said how important climate protection is to them .
now , the politicians of these countries need to make the necessary changes .
and if they do n't the voters have to deal with it - and vote them out of office ... "
finally , the stuttgarter zeitung expressed the disappointment felt by many in europe when they compared us president barack obama 's focus on china and other developing countries with his relative lack of interest in the european negotatiors .
in the wake of the conference , " we need to keep up the ambition of climate protection , and keep the expectations in a realistic framework , " the paper wrote .
" but one prerequisite for this is the recognition that it will be really hard for europe to effectively influence the usa .
the trans-atlantic relationship is coming up on hard times .
barack obama showed one thing for certain in copenhagen : his focus will be on the trans-pacific axis with china .

this is part of a larger effort by egypt to reclaim its ancient treasures . egypt 's chief antiquities official zahi hawass says he will make a formal request for the return of the bust of queen nefertiti from berlin 's neues museum .
in a statement released sunday , hawass said he was presented with documents by the head of the berlin neues museum , where the bust is currently on display , which supported his claim that the statue is in germany illegally . german archeologist acted “ unethically ” according to hawass , the documents confirmed that the german archeologist ludwig borchardt produced fraudulent papers to secure the 3,300 year old bust for berlin in 1913 .
borchardt , who discovered the bust , tried to pass off the artefact as a less significant find in order to take it out of egypt .
“ these materials confirm egypt 's contention that borchardt did act unethically , with intent to deceive , ” the statement said .
“ the limestone head of the queen is listed on the protocol as a painted plaster bust of a princess . ”
the statement went on to say that friederike seyfried , a museum director who oversees the section where the bust is on display , would assist in negotiations between hawass and german officials .
however , in a statement released december 18 by the museum 's operators , the prussian cultural heritage foundation , it was said that , while seyfried would meet with hawass in cairo soon , she would not discuss nefertiti 's return , since the documents showed the prussian state acquired the bust lawfully and egypt had no legal claim for its return .
new campaign for return of artefacts despite the claims of the foundation , hawass says he is optimistic about the bust 's return .
“ i always ask for artefacts to come and it always happens ” he told reuters .
the push for nefertiti 's return is part of a larger effort for egypt to reclaim its ancient artefacts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bust has attracted millions of visitors since it was sent to germany in 1913 hawass previously retrieved wall fragments of a 3,200 year old tomb from the french louvre , and is also currently working on having the rosetta stone returned from the british museum . the bust of nefertiti was discovered in egypt in 1912 at tell el-amarna , the short-lived capital of the kingdom under nefertiti 's husband , pharaoh akhenaten .
it was shipped to germany the following year , and has since attracted millions of visitors from around the world. mk / ap / reuters editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

three companies now face huge fines for price fixing , with more investigations underway . bosses from coffee companies tchibo , melitta and dallmayr worked together to keep their prices artificially high , a competition watchdog has ruled . germany 's cartel office has imposed fines amounting to almost 159.5 million euros against the coffee producers .
the fine is against the three coffee roasters and six employees who were deemed to be responsible .
there were several price fixes from the beginning of 2000 until the company was investigated in july 2008 .
the bonn-based cartel office said that a circle of company leaders and sales bosses had met to fix prices on products that included coffee beans , espresso coffee and ordinary filter coffee .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : espresso coffee was one of the products that were made more expensive dates and periods as well as the scope and level of the price rises were agreed upon .
five price hikes were set up between 2003 and 2008 .
the effect of just two of these increases - in winter 2004 and spring 2005 - led to an average price increase of a euro on a 500g pack of coffee .
melitta coffee spokeswoman anette kahre said the firm would appeal against the fine and that it had cooperated fully with authorities in the investigation .
the company also regretted what had happened , kahre added , and it had " made arrangements for such a thing not to happen again . "
" fine is completely excessive " dallmayr said the fine was " completely excessive " and that taking into account tax , german coffee was the best value in europe .
there was no comment from tchibo , although it did confirm the amount of the fine .
the cartel office said that the fines were still not legally binding and that the companies had an opportunity to put forward objections .
it added that further investigations were also taking place into numerous coffee producers , including cappuccino producers , and are expected to be completed in the first half of 2010. rc / afp / dpa editor : ranty islam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

three companies now face huge fines for price fixing , with more investigations underway . bosses from coffee companies tchibo , melitta and dallmayr worked together to keep their prices artificially high , a competition watchdog has ruled . germany 's cartel office has imposed fines amounting to almost 159.5 million euros against the coffee producers .
the fine is against the three coffee roasters and six employees who were deemed to be responsible .
there were several price fixes from the beginning of 2000 until the company was investigated in july 2008 .
the bonn-based cartel office said that a circle of company leaders and sales bosses had met to fix prices on products that included coffee beans , espresso coffee and ordinary filter coffee .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : espresso coffee was one of the products that were made more expensive dates and periods as well as the scope and level of the price rises were agreed upon .
five price hikes were set up between 2003 and 2008 .
the effect of just two of these increases - in winter 2004 and spring 2005 - led to an average price increase of a euro on a 500g pack of coffee .
melitta coffee spokeswoman anette kahre said the firm would appeal against the fine and that it had cooperated fully with authorities in the investigation .
the company also regretted what had happened , kahre added , and it had " made arrangements for such a thing not to happen again . "
" fine is completely excessive " dallmayr said the fine was " completely excessive " and that taking into account tax , german coffee was the best value in europe .
there was no comment from tchibo , although it did confirm the amount of the fine .
the cartel office said that the fines were still not legally binding and that the companies had an opportunity to put forward objections .
it added that further investigations were also taking place into numerous coffee producers , including cappuccino producers , and are expected to be completed in the first half of 2010. rc / afp / dpa editor : ranty islam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

three companies now face huge fines for price fixing , with more investigations underway . bosses from coffee companies tchibo , melitta and dallmayr worked together to keep their prices artificially high , a competition watchdog has ruled . germany 's cartel office has imposed fines amounting to almost 159.5 million euros against the coffee producers .
the fine is against the three coffee roasters and six employees who were deemed to be responsible .
there were several price fixes from the beginning of 2000 until the company was investigated in july 2008 .
the bonn-based cartel office said that a circle of company leaders and sales bosses had met to fix prices on products that included coffee beans , espresso coffee and ordinary filter coffee .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : espresso coffee was one of the products that were made more expensive dates and periods as well as the scope and level of the price rises were agreed upon .
five price hikes were set up between 2003 and 2008 .
the effect of just two of these increases - in winter 2004 and spring 2005 - led to an average price increase of a euro on a 500g pack of coffee .
melitta coffee spokeswoman anette kahre said the firm would appeal against the fine and that it had cooperated fully with authorities in the investigation .
the company also regretted what had happened , kahre added , and it had " made arrangements for such a thing not to happen again . "
" fine is completely excessive " dallmayr said the fine was " completely excessive " and that taking into account tax , german coffee was the best value in europe .
there was no comment from tchibo , although it did confirm the amount of the fine .
the cartel office said that the fines were still not legally binding and that the companies had an opportunity to put forward objections .
it added that further investigations were also taking place into numerous coffee producers , including cappuccino producers , and are expected to be completed in the first half of 2010. rc / afp / dpa editor : ranty islam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some found a silver lining , however . the newspaper de volkskrant from holland acknowledged that copenhagen delivered a disappointing result but focused on the positive : the fact that at least the problem is being addressed .
" climate change is now an international problem par excellence .
it seems inevitable that all countries will be brought into negotiations sooner or later .
at the same time , it is nearly impossible to get 192 states of varying size and with diverse interests to reach a unified stance . "
" but there is a glimmer of hope .
all of the participants in the climate conference know that the talks will continue .
and possibly , those actors will be watched by the public and by activists and ngos with a more critical eye than they have been up to now .
because one thing was attained for certain : the climate will never disappear from the political agenda . "
likewise , britain 's guardian newspaper saw positives alongside negatives in the outcome of the conference .
on the bad side : " a considered reading of the accord , which was its only tangible output , reveals that it is not just inadequate but in fact utterly empty . "
on the plus side , however , is " the novel manner in which this ultimate failure was reached . "
" as the sight of the daily chaos -lrb- of copenhagen -rrb- drops out of view , it becomes easier to appreciate that the rich world was forced to haggle with the bigger emerging economies on more equal terms than ever before . "
in other words , " while the copenhagen product is every inch the sham that campaigners say it is , the copenhagen process has set important precedents , " the guardian wrote .
" most obviously … the sheer fact that it took place – and at such a high political level – means it will probably do so again . "

but these can not wait until there is an international agreement .
it is much more important for them to become instructive with their actions .
if the eu took the necessary actions from its side , it would jump to the head of the movement .
then the fiasco of copenhagen could be overcome step by step . " in switzerland , zurich 's tages-anzeiger also focused on results ; those who come up with solutions will ultimately benefit in the end , the paper wrote .
at the conference , " concrete solutions were presented on how to reach a climate-friendly future and at the same time remain economically profitable .
numerous companies seemed to have little patience for the political lethargy … the biggest climate-change effect will be felt by those companies and countries that start preparing now .
they will be the ultimate winners , " the paper said .
german editorialists were less inclined to focus on positive signals from the conference .
the sueddeutsche zeitung called the copenhagen summit an " insult to the world community , " noting that " never were expectations for a climate conference higher , and never before were so many heads of state and government officials in one place , meeting to solve one single problem .
but they did n't solve it - they made it worse . "
" as if they were replaying an old , bad film , the heads of the most powerful nations came up with aid funds to silence the developing nations .
they bought their way out .
instead of mutually promising a much-needed rejection of the destructive path of economic development , they agreed on a vague and distant goal .
it is like agreeing on a place to meet , but not a time . "
meanwhile , advocating a just-do-it approach in the wake of the talks , the frankfurter rundschau sent a strong warning to voters and the politicians they elect : " there is no point in allowing the un climate conference circus to continue its performances .
the only chance that remains is for the big heat-producers of the planet to lead by example - without any stipulations about taking others along for the ride , if need be .

now , the politicians of these countries need to make the necessary changes .
and if they do n't the voters have to deal with it - and vote them out of office ... "
finally , the stuttgarter zeitung expressed the disappointment felt by many in europe when they compared us president barack obama 's focus on china and other developing countries with his relative lack of interest in the european negotatiors .
in the wake of the conference , " we need to keep up the ambition of climate protection , and keep the expectations in a realistic framework , " the paper wrote .
" but one prerequisite for this is the recognition that it will be really hard for europe to effectively influence the usa .
the trans-atlantic relationship is coming up on hard times .

the thieves had cut the sign into three pieces . police in krakow , southern poland , told reporters on monday it was too early to tell what the motive behind the theft of the auschwitz sign really was .
however , the five suspects arrested when the sign was recovered are not members of a neo-nazi group .
the men do have criminal records for either violence or theft . " we can say that none of the five are members of a neo-nazi group , " andrzej rokita , district police chief in the city of krakow , told a news conference .
" their intent was undoubtedly robbery related .
we will be able to decide later whether the crime was ordered or whether they acted on their own initiative . " the five men , aged 20 to 39 , are believed to have stolen the infamous " arbeit macht frei " sign , which hung over the entrance to the nazi death camp auschwitz , at dawn on friday .
police recovered the sign , cut into three pieces , near the home of one of the suspects . " the sign had been cut into three pieces at the site of the theft , to make it easier to transport .
it had been hidden in a wood near the home of one of the thieves , " rokita said . when intact , the sign was five meters long .
its cynical message " work sets you free " became a symbol of the efforts of the nazis to deceive their victims .
over a million people , mostly jews , perished in the nazi death camp in southern poland during world war two - most of the site became a museum and memorial after the war ended . intensive search the five alleged thieves were captured after poland stepped up border security , set up roadblocks , deployed a team of around 40 forensic experts and sought the help of international policing bodies interpol and europol in a bid to recover the sign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the museum soon put this image right , hanging a replica sign on the gates as an interim solution the auschwitz museum offered a 100,000-zloty reward -lrb- 24,000 euros or $ 34,000 -rrb- for information which would help to recapture the sign , and polish police offered a further 5,000 zlotys . friday 's theft sparked condemnation from world leaders , jewish groups and holocaust survivors . " a worldwide symbol of the cynicism of hitler 's executioners and the martyrdom of their victims has been stolen , " polish president lech kaczynski said after the theft . auschwitz , visited by one million people last year , was one of a network of camps set up to kill some 6 million jews , along with members of other ethnic , religious , political , or social groups that hitler 's regime wanted to eliminate . msh / afp / ap / reuters editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this move has cast doubt on a crucial international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and eu-led 7.5 billion euro bailout for the recession-hit state .
the pension cuts have been in force since july , and constitutional court chief gunars kutris says they take away anywhere between 10 and 70 percent of old-age pensions depending on an individual 's status .
kurtis said the measures were illegal and that parliament must have measures in place to refund the cuts by march 2010 .
" violation " of social security and rule of law in its judgement , the court stated that " the decision to cut pensions violated the individual 's right to social security and the principle of the rule of law . "
it added that agreements with international lenders in and of themselves can not be used as an argument to limit basic rights .
the court 's ruling in the case is final and can not be appealed .
the case was brought to the court by 9,000 individual pensioners .
it has been ruled that the money itself must be paid back in full no later than 2015 .
the sum is estimated around 100 million lats -lrb- 140 million euros -rrb- .
currently , latvia is in the middle of one of the deepest recessions in the european union , with its economy expected to shrink by up to 18 percent this year .
over the past year , its government has been raising taxes and reducing public spending as it attempts to stick to the terms of the imf / eu bailout .

" the spyker leadership has submitted a renewed offer in the hopes of securing a future for saab , its employees and the brand - despite the announcement that the winding down of saab would begin , " the company said in a statement . spyker said it hoped " the renewed offer would remove each of the obstacles that were standing in the way of a swift transaction . "
the company 's chief executive , victor muller , said its revised bid included an 11-point proposal addressing issues that arose during the due diligence process . " we have made every effort to resolve the issues that were preventing the conclusion of this matter and we have asked gm and all other involved parties to seriously consider this offer , " said muller .
he added that the new offer eliminates the need for loan approval by the european investment bank -lrb- eib -rrb- prior to year end , which would allow the deal to be concluded within gm 's original december 31 deadline . while muller did not reveal any details about the financing of the new offer , he said spyker 's bid would remain valid until 11pm central european time -lrb- 5pm eastern time -rrb- on monday . several suitors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so far only small carmakers have shown real interest in acquiring saab on its website , general motors said it had received inquiries from several potential bidders since friday 's announcement that it would start the orderly closure of saab .

this move has cast doubt on a crucial international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and eu-led 7.5 billion euro bailout for the recession-hit state .
the pension cuts have been in force since july , and constitutional court chief gunars kutris says they take away anywhere between 10 and 70 percent of old-age pensions depending on an individual 's status .
kurtis said the measures were illegal and that parliament must have measures in place to refund the cuts by march 2010 .
" violation " of social security and rule of law in its judgement , the court stated that " the decision to cut pensions violated the individual 's right to social security and the principle of the rule of law . "
it added that agreements with international lenders in and of themselves can not be used as an argument to limit basic rights .
the court 's ruling in the case is final and can not be appealed .
the case was brought to the court by 9,000 individual pensioners .
it has been ruled that the money itself must be paid back in full no later than 2015 .
the sum is estimated around 100 million lats -lrb- 140 million euros -rrb- .
currently , latvia is in the middle of one of the deepest recessions in the european union , with its economy expected to shrink by up to 18 percent this year .
over the past year , its government has been raising taxes and reducing public spending as it attempts to stick to the terms of the imf / eu bailout .
under the deal , latvia pledged to cut 500 million lats -lrb- 702 million euros -rrb- every year until 2012. mk / afp / reuters editor : ranty islam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some found a silver lining , however . the newspaper de volkskrant from holland acknowledged that copenhagen delivered a disappointing result but focused on the positive : the fact that at least the problem is being addressed .
" climate change is now an international problem par excellence .
it seems inevitable that all countries will be brought into negotiations sooner or later .
at the same time , it is nearly impossible to get 192 states of varying size and with diverse interests to reach a unified stance . "
" but there is a glimmer of hope .
all of the participants in the climate conference know that the talks will continue .
and possibly , those actors will be watched by the public and by activists and ngos with a more critical eye than they have been up to now .
because one thing was attained for certain : the climate will never disappear from the political agenda . "
likewise , britain 's guardian newspaper saw positives alongside negatives in the outcome of the conference .
on the bad side : " a considered reading of the accord , which was its only tangible output , reveals that it is not just inadequate but in fact utterly empty . "
on the plus side , however , is " the novel manner in which this ultimate failure was reached . "
" as the sight of the daily chaos -lrb- of copenhagen -rrb- drops out of view , it becomes easier to appreciate that the rich world was forced to haggle with the bigger emerging economies on more equal terms than ever before . "
in other words , " while the copenhagen product is every inch the sham that campaigners say it is , the copenhagen process has set important precedents , " the guardian wrote .
" most obviously … the sheer fact that it took place – and at such a high political level – means it will probably do so again . "
taking a harsher line , left-leaning french newspaper la libération oozed disappointment in the " large countries which , in a delirium of diplomatic ineptitude and the blindness of superiority , torpedoed the binding worldwide accord " they had hoped for . the paper pitched for the eu to take immediate , unilateral action : " eco-reformers need to focus on the us and china , " it wrote ; " after that come the nations that are a bit more environmentally aware , particularly in europe .
but these can not wait until there is an international agreement .
it is much more important for them to become instructive with their actions .
if the eu took the necessary actions from its side , it would jump to the head of the movement .
then the fiasco of copenhagen could be overcome step by step . " in switzerland , zurich 's tages-anzeiger also focused on results ; those who come up with solutions will ultimately benefit in the end , the paper wrote .
at the conference , " concrete solutions were presented on how to reach a climate-friendly future and at the same time remain economically profitable .
numerous companies seemed to have little patience for the political lethargy … the biggest climate-change effect will be felt by those companies and countries that start preparing now .
they will be the ultimate winners , " the paper said .
german editorialists were less inclined to focus on positive signals from the conference .
the sueddeutsche zeitung called the copenhagen summit an " insult to the world community , " noting that " never were expectations for a climate conference higher , and never before were so many heads of state and government officials in one place , meeting to solve one single problem .
but they did n't solve it - they made it worse . "
" as if they were replaying an old , bad film , the heads of the most powerful nations came up with aid funds to silence the developing nations .
they bought their way out .
instead of mutually promising a much-needed rejection of the destructive path of economic development , they agreed on a vague and distant goal .
it is like agreeing on a place to meet , but not a time . "
meanwhile , advocating a just-do-it approach in the wake of the talks , the frankfurter rundschau sent a strong warning to voters and the politicians they elect : " there is no point in allowing the un climate conference circus to continue its performances .
the only chance that remains is for the big heat-producers of the planet to lead by example - without any stipulations about taking others along for the ride , if need be .
fifteen countries on earth are responsible for 80 percent of c02 emissions around the world ; in copenhagen they all said how important climate protection is to them .
now , the politicians of these countries need to make the necessary changes .
and if they do n't the voters have to deal with it - and vote them out of office ... "
finally , the stuttgarter zeitung expressed the disappointment felt by many in europe when they compared us president barack obama 's focus on china and other developing countries with his relative lack of interest in the european negotatiors .
in the wake of the conference , " we need to keep up the ambition of climate protection , and keep the expectations in a realistic framework , " the paper wrote .
" but one prerequisite for this is the recognition that it will be really hard for europe to effectively influence the usa .
the trans-atlantic relationship is coming up on hard times .
barack obama showed one thing for certain in copenhagen : his focus will be on the trans-pacific axis with china .

in 2009 , the spotlight fell on one of the female stars from this summer 's world athletics championships in berlin , the only man to beat michael phelps in a major swimming competition since 2005 , and the women 's national soccer team for their clear dominance over their european competitors .
steffi nerius throws for gold after the opening weekend of the world athletics championships in august , the biggest star to emerge from berlin 's olympic stadium was usain bolt , whose record-breaking 100-meter dash on the competition 's second day captivated germans and out-of-town visitors alike .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nerius 's first throw was good enough for gold two days later , bolt had competition for the newspaper headlines , and it was from a member of the home team .
when steffi nerius stepped to the line of the finals in the javelin competition , germany had yet to produce a single gold medal winner .
tournament organizers had staggered the events so there was a german gold medal hopeful on each of the nine days of competition , but on the fourth day , they were still waiting for the first german champion .
nerius 's first throw of the finals sailed 67.30 meters , which held as the best mark throughout the entire competition .
when eventual czech silver medalist barbora spotakova 's final throw of the event failed to beat nerius ' mark , nerius raised her arms in the air and celebrated germany 's first gold of the competition , with a stadium full of loud supporters cheering her on .
it was the first world championship gold medal of the 37-year-old 's career .
before the world championships began , there had been fears that germany would repeat its performance from the beijing olympics and come up short in the medals column .
but after nerius set the precedent , german athletes went on to take home a total of two gold , three silver , and four bronze medals , which represented a successful competition for the host nation .
paul biedermann upsets michael phelps new world records were practically a drop in the deep end at the world swimming championships in rome last july .
controversial new swimsuits , made partially or entirely out of polyurethane , seemed to be giving swimmers who wore them a slight edge , and as a result , 43 world records fell at the meet in rome .
bildunterschrift : biedermann bested the world record - and michael phelps - in the 200m freestyle paul biedermann grabbed two of those records , and they happened to be two of the most impressive of the entire competition .
wearing a full-body polyurethane suit , biedermann bested legendary australian swimmer ian thorpe 's world record in the 400 meter freestyle , a mark that many in the sport thought would be safe for many years .
biedermann 's next record was even more impressive , especially because of the man he handily beat in the race .
in the 200 ´ -meter freestyle , biedermann shattered american michael phelps 's world record time by over a second , and handed phelps his only silver medal in world or olympic competition since 2005 .
phelps did n't wear one of the all-polyurethane suits against biedermann , but still praised the 23-year-old german 's performance .
" paul swam a great race .
i did not have anything in the last 50 meters , " phelps said after the swim .
" in the race i was beaten by the swimmer , not the suit . "
starting in 2010 , swimming 's governing body fina will implement a ban on all-polyurethane suits , but eight-time beijing gold medallist michael phelps has a new top rival for next season : germany 's paul biedermann .

in european championship competition , the team remains unbeaten since 1995 .
that 's a total of 26 matches , and five titles in a row .

six of those goals came from striker inka grings , and the rest came from a team effort of nine other goal scorers .

in 2009 , the spotlight fell on one of the female stars from this summer 's world athletics championships in berlin , the only man to beat michael phelps in a major swimming competition since 2005 , and the women 's national soccer team for their clear dominance over their european competitors .
steffi nerius throws for gold after the opening weekend of the world athletics championships in august , the biggest star to emerge from berlin 's olympic stadium was usain bolt , whose record-breaking 100-meter dash on the competition 's second day captivated germans and out-of-town visitors alike .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nerius 's first throw was good enough for gold two days later , bolt had competition for the newspaper headlines , and it was from a member of the home team .
when steffi nerius stepped to the line of the finals in the javelin competition , germany had yet to produce a single gold medal winner .
tournament organizers had staggered the events so there was a german gold medal hopeful on each of the nine days of competition , but on the fourth day , they were still waiting for the first german champion .
nerius 's first throw of the finals sailed 67.30 meters , which held as the best mark throughout the entire competition .
when eventual czech silver medalist barbora spotakova 's final throw of the event failed to beat nerius ' mark , nerius raised her arms in the air and celebrated germany 's first gold of the competition , with a stadium full of loud supporters cheering her on .
it was the first world championship gold medal of the 37-year-old 's career .
before the world championships began , there had been fears that germany would repeat its performance from the beijing olympics and come up short in the medals column .
but after nerius set the precedent , german athletes went on to take home a total of two gold , three silver , and four bronze medals , which represented a successful competition for the host nation .
paul biedermann upsets michael phelps new world records were practically a drop in the deep end at the world swimming championships in rome last july .
controversial new swimsuits , made partially or entirely out of polyurethane , seemed to be giving swimmers who wore them a slight edge , and as a result , 43 world records fell at the meet in rome .
bildunterschrift : biedermann bested the world record - and michael phelps - in the 200m freestyle paul biedermann grabbed two of those records , and they happened to be two of the most impressive of the entire competition .
wearing a full-body polyurethane suit , biedermann bested legendary australian swimmer ian thorpe 's world record in the 400 meter freestyle , a mark that many in the sport thought would be safe for many years .
biedermann 's next record was even more impressive , especially because of the man he handily beat in the race .

this move has cast doubt on a crucial international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and eu-led 7.5 billion euro bailout for the recession-hit state .
the pension cuts have been in force since july , and constitutional court chief gunars kutris says they take away anywhere between 10 and 70 percent of old-age pensions depending on an individual 's status .
kurtis said the measures were illegal and that parliament must have measures in place to refund the cuts by march 2010 .
" violation " of social security and rule of law in its judgement , the court stated that " the decision to cut pensions violated the individual 's right to social security and the principle of the rule of law . "
it added that agreements with international lenders in and of themselves can not be used as an argument to limit basic rights .
the court 's ruling in the case is final and can not be appealed .
the case was brought to the court by 9,000 individual pensioners .
it has been ruled that the money itself must be paid back in full no later than 2015 .
the sum is estimated around 100 million lats -lrb- 140 million euros -rrb- .
currently , latvia is in the middle of one of the deepest recessions in the european union , with its economy expected to shrink by up to 18 percent this year .
over the past year , its government has been raising taxes and reducing public spending as it attempts to stick to the terms of the imf / eu bailout .
under the deal , latvia pledged to cut 500 million lats -lrb- 702 million euros -rrb- every year until 2012. mk / afp / reuters editor : ranty islam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 21.12.2009 tens of thousands flee orakzai agency großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban chief hakimullah mehsud has a strong base in orakzai pakistan 's army has claimed that it has taken complete control of the south waziristan tribal agency and driven out the taliban .
but where will the army turn its attention now ?
many militants who left south waziristan during the military onslaught are believed to be hiding in other tribal agencies , including north waziristan and orakzai .
and as the prime minister has said that orakzai will be the next target , thousands of refugees have already begun to flee the area . the prime minister of pakistan , syed yusuf raza gillani recently hinted that the army might shift its focus to orakzai , southwest of peshawar , after having successfully completed the previous anti-taliban operations in swat and , most recently , south waziristan .
a large number of people have already been shifted from orakzai to the neighbouring districts of hangu and kohat , although there has been no official announcement of the military operation .
up to 80,000 refugees expected manuel bessler , head of the un office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs in islamabad , said , " we have about 40,000 individuals that were displaced during the recent upsurge of the fighting in the orakzai agency .
we expect up to 80,000 displaced people .
it depends very much on the course of the military operations , how extensive they are , how long they continue . "
so far , no formal registration has taken place but discussions are currently going on to start formal registration for the internally displaced persons from orakzai agency in the coming days .
work for the united nations and other humanitarian agencies in orakzai will not be easy .
" the challenges are several and quite difficult ones " , manuel bessler said .
" first of all it is access to go to the area .
it 's not impossible but it 's more difficult .
we have to be in close contact with the local authorities .
we have to constantly monitor the security situation , so access is the first challenge .
secondly , we have to have appropriate sites where we can host displaced people .
this is a challenge in terms of logistics and has , of course , to be closely coordinated with the district authorities . "
preparations under way the united nations already had to assist a large number of displaced people in pakistan earlier this year .
mr bessler said this makes its task easier in certain ways : " the humanitarian community consisting of un , un agencies but also quite importantly of international and national non-governmental organizations -lrb- ngos -rrb- has worked in the country for quite a while , and had to cope with the huge displacement crisis in summer of this year from the malakand division , where we had -lrb- around end of may - june -rrb- 2.7 million displaced people .
we are quite well prepared .
there are stocks available of relief item : tents , mattresses , kitchen sets , quilts . "
as the government of pakistan is heading to a new war front to eradicate militancy , observers say the relief and rehabilition of idps must not be ignored .
otherwise , many might easily be recruited by militants .

but where will the army turn its attention now ?
many militants who left south waziristan during the military onslaught are believed to be hiding in other tribal agencies , including north waziristan and orakzai .
and as the prime minister has said that orakzai will be the next target , thousands of refugees have already begun to flee the area . the prime minister of pakistan , syed yusuf raza gillani recently hinted that the army might shift its focus to orakzai , southwest of peshawar , after having successfully completed the previous anti-taliban operations in swat and , most recently , south waziristan .
a large number of people have already been shifted from orakzai to the neighbouring districts of hangu and kohat , although there has been no official announcement of the military operation .
up to 80,000 refugees expected manuel bessler , head of the un office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs in islamabad , said , " we have about 40,000 individuals that were displaced during the recent upsurge of the fighting in the orakzai agency .
we expect up to 80,000 displaced people .
it depends very much on the course of the military operations , how extensive they are , how long they continue . "
so far , no formal registration has taken place but discussions are currently going on to start formal registration for the internally displaced persons from orakzai agency in the coming days .
work for the united nations and other humanitarian agencies in orakzai will not be easy .

" first of all it is access to go to the area .
it 's not impossible but it 's more difficult .
we have to be in close contact with the local authorities .
we have to constantly monitor the security situation , so access is the first challenge .
secondly , we have to have appropriate sites where we can host displaced people .
this is a challenge in terms of logistics and has , of course , to be closely coordinated with the district authorities . "
preparations under way the united nations already had to assist a large number of displaced people in pakistan earlier this year .
mr bessler said this makes its task easier in certain ways : " the humanitarian community consisting of un , un agencies but also quite importantly of international and national non-governmental organizations -lrb- ngos -rrb- has worked in the country for quite a while , and had to cope with the huge displacement crisis in summer of this year from the malakand division , where we had -lrb- around end of may - june -rrb- 2.7 million displaced people .
we are quite well prepared .
there are stocks available of relief item : tents , mattresses , kitchen sets , quilts . "

but where will the army turn its attention now ?
many militants who left south waziristan during the military onslaught are believed to be hiding in other tribal agencies , including north waziristan and orakzai .
and as the prime minister has said that orakzai will be the next target , thousands of refugees have already begun to flee the area . the prime minister of pakistan , syed yusuf raza gillani recently hinted that the army might shift its focus to orakzai , southwest of peshawar , after having successfully completed the previous anti-taliban operations in swat and , most recently , south waziristan .
a large number of people have already been shifted from orakzai to the neighbouring districts of hangu and kohat , although there has been no official announcement of the military operation .
up to 80,000 refugees expected manuel bessler , head of the un office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs in islamabad , said , " we have about 40,000 individuals that were displaced during the recent upsurge of the fighting in the orakzai agency .
we expect up to 80,000 displaced people .
it depends very much on the course of the military operations , how extensive they are , how long they continue . "
so far , no formal registration has taken place but discussions are currently going on to start formal registration for the internally displaced persons from orakzai agency in the coming days .
work for the united nations and other humanitarian agencies in orakzai will not be easy .
" the challenges are several and quite difficult ones " , manuel bessler said .
" first of all it is access to go to the area .
it 's not impossible but it 's more difficult .
we have to be in close contact with the local authorities .
we have to constantly monitor the security situation , so access is the first challenge .
secondly , we have to have appropriate sites where we can host displaced people .
this is a challenge in terms of logistics and has , of course , to be closely coordinated with the district authorities . "
preparations under way the united nations already had to assist a large number of displaced people in pakistan earlier this year .
mr bessler said this makes its task easier in certain ways : " the humanitarian community consisting of un , un agencies but also quite importantly of international and national non-governmental organizations -lrb- ngos -rrb- has worked in the country for quite a while , and had to cope with the huge displacement crisis in summer of this year from the malakand division , where we had -lrb- around end of may - june -rrb- 2.7 million displaced people .
we are quite well prepared .
there are stocks available of relief item : tents , mattresses , kitchen sets , quilts . "
as the government of pakistan is heading to a new war front to eradicate militancy , observers say the relief and rehabilition of idps must not be ignored .

this move has cast doubt on a crucial international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and eu-led 7.5 billion euro bailout for the recession-hit state .
the pension cuts have been in force since july , and constitutional court chief gunars kutris says they take away anywhere between 10 and 70 percent of old-age pensions depending on an individual 's status .
kurtis said the measures were illegal and that parliament must have measures in place to refund the cuts by march 2010 .
" violation " of social security and rule of law in its judgement , the court stated that " the decision to cut pensions violated the individual 's right to social security and the principle of the rule of law . "
it added that agreements with international lenders in and of themselves can not be used as an argument to limit basic rights .
the court 's ruling in the case is final and can not be appealed .
the case was brought to the court by 9,000 individual pensioners .
it has been ruled that the money itself must be paid back in full no later than 2015 .
the sum is estimated around 100 million lats -lrb- 140 million euros -rrb- .
currently , latvia is in the middle of one of the deepest recessions in the european union , with its economy expected to shrink by up to 18 percent this year .
over the past year , its government has been raising taxes and reducing public spending as it attempts to stick to the terms of the imf / eu bailout .
under the deal , latvia pledged to cut 500 million lats -lrb- 702 million euros -rrb- every year until 2012. mk / afp / reuters editor : ranty islam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

three companies now face huge fines for price fixing , with more investigations underway . bosses from coffee companies tchibo , melitta and dallmayr worked together to keep their prices artificially high , a competition watchdog has ruled . germany 's cartel office has imposed fines amounting to almost 159.5 million euros against the coffee producers .
the fine is against the three coffee roasters and six employees who were deemed to be responsible .
there were several price fixes from the beginning of 2000 until the company was investigated in july 2008 .
the bonn-based cartel office said that a circle of company leaders and sales bosses had met to fix prices on products that included coffee beans , espresso coffee and ordinary filter coffee .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : espresso coffee was one of the products that were made more expensive dates and periods as well as the scope and level of the price rises were agreed upon .
five price hikes were set up between 2003 and 2008 .
the effect of just two of these increases - in winter 2004 and spring 2005 - led to an average price increase of a euro on a 500g pack of coffee .
melitta coffee spokeswoman anette kahre said the firm would appeal against the fine and that it had cooperated fully with authorities in the investigation .
the company also regretted what had happened , kahre added , and it had " made arrangements for such a thing not to happen again . "
" fine is completely excessive " dallmayr said the fine was " completely excessive " and that taking into account tax , german coffee was the best value in europe .
there was no comment from tchibo , although it did confirm the amount of the fine .
the cartel office said that the fines were still not legally binding and that the companies had an opportunity to put forward objections .
it added that further investigations were also taking place into numerous coffee producers , including cappuccino producers , and are expected to be completed in the first half of 2010. rc / afp / dpa editor : ranty islam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

china has been investing heavily in the african market and is keen to stress the benefits to local businesses .
is that involvement an opportunity or a risk to africa ’ s development and is europe being left behind ? on the copperbelt in zambia , investment in luanshya mine by china 's non-ferrous meter mining group corporation -lrb- nfca -rrb- has been welcomed by locals .
a veteran of the mining industry who wanted to remain anonymous told deutsche welle that " -lsb- s -rsb- o far -lsb- the chinese investors -rsb- are good guys because they are putting -lsb- in -rsb- a lot of money before production starts . "
for a small town whose future appeared bleak when mining production was shut down , the creation of an estimated 3,000 jobs is good news .
the warm welcome of chinese investment in luanshya is in stark contrast to the anti-chinese sentiment in a town less than an hour away .
the memory of a mine explosion that left 46 dead still lingers in chambeshi .
for many , graves located close to the mine are a daily reminder of the deaths of a colleague or loved one .
more than four years after the incident , the community remains ambivalent about the reopening of the plant where the explosion occurred even if it will bring many jobs to the area .
some still feel that their chinese employers are to blame for the incident .
mukuka chilufya , a safety officer who participated in rescue operations following the explosion , told deutsche welle that " maybe they could have received a bulk order and they were running out of time .
so the night shift that were involved in the male dyke collided with the day shift that were involved in the female dyke .
in fact , what is going to confirm that is that the chinese who were knowledgeable of the consequences all were not in the factory when the explosion took place because they knew that something like that could happen . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is investing heavily in africa 's mining industry most of the criticism surrounding china 's involvement in africa debate has been on the working conditions of the miners who are subjected to low wages and questionable safety procedures .
the incident at chambishi mine in zambia in april 2005 drew attention to this .
but as professor helmut asche , director of the institute for african studies at the university of leipzig , notes these conditions are no different from those that miners in northern china are subjected to .
since beijing is unable to control the working conditions of its citizens , african governments are responsible for exerting effective control over chinese investors so that they implement fair wages and adequate safety procedures .
benefits , implications of chinese investment china 's african policy states that it intends to be africa 's equal -lrb- economic -rrb- partner .
experts like he wenping , director of the institute of west-asian and african studies at the chinese academy of social science in beijing , say that china 's goals in africa are more political than economic .
according to asche , a change in china 's africa foreign policy began after the tiananmen square massacre when china needed more foreign allies .
china 's current african partners , who are in the group of 77 , provide it with more influence in the united nations .
asche feels that the import of cheap goods from china can have very different effects as is the case with the south african textile industry and the ethiopian footwear industry .
the protection of local industry in south africa meant that the manufacturers did not modernize their techniques in order to be able to compete successfully with the chinese imports .
on the other hand , in ethiopia where the local footwear manufacturing industry was not protected , production became more competitive and now ethiopia is exporting footwear to china .
zambians often say that " you thank the person who guides you at night when it is dawn . "
the relationship between china and africa is still in its infancy , but as asche told deutsche welle " it is crystal clear -lsb- … -rsb- in scientific research that the chinese investment in all its facets is positive for africa . "
he goes onto say that current investment is doing more to strengthen economies than democracy and good governance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is helping africa develop its infrastructure .
the chinese news agency xinhua estimates that there are currently one million chinese immigrants in africa .
their growing presence is more often than not unwelcome as is shown by attacks on immigrants in nigeria and angola .
most zambians complain that the chinese community isolates itself .
chinese immigrants have not been as successful as indians or other immigrants in integrating in africa , however asche says that both locals and immigrants are responsible for the integration of the chinese migrants .
the role of germany and europe asche feels that germany should do more to get involved in africa : " … the german investors should -lsb- … -rsb- be encouraged to become as courageous as the chinese are .
it is a crystal clear fact that china and its investors and not only the state-owned companies but also private investors see the african market a lot more positive than do quite a number of investors from european countries , and the germans are certainly not among the most courageous . "
in addition to those fears , asche attributes the lack of increased trade between the two continents to the european union 's trade policy , which does not treat africa as an equal partner as china does : “ -lsb- eu trade policy -rsb- is a good example of how not to deal with partner countries and by way of comparison china all of a sudden stands out as , trade policy-wise , a fair partner to africa in comparison with the eu . "
asche says that the growing trade between china and africa is " an irreversible expression of the new multi-polar world , and european powers -lsb- … -rsb- simply have to learn to live in this multi-polar environment in which there is no longer an exclusive relationship between the eu , the us and africa . "

this move has cast doubt on a crucial international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and eu-led 7.5 billion euro bailout for the recession-hit state .
the pension cuts have been in force since july , and constitutional court chief gunars kutris says they take away anywhere between 10 and 70 percent of old-age pensions depending on an individual 's status .
kurtis said the measures were illegal and that parliament must have measures in place to refund the cuts by march 2010 .
" violation " of social security and rule of law in its judgement , the court stated that " the decision to cut pensions violated the individual 's right to social security and the principle of the rule of law . "
it added that agreements with international lenders in and of themselves can not be used as an argument to limit basic rights .
the court 's ruling in the case is final and can not be appealed .
the case was brought to the court by 9,000 individual pensioners .
it has been ruled that the money itself must be paid back in full no later than 2015 .
the sum is estimated around 100 million lats -lrb- 140 million euros -rrb- .
currently , latvia is in the middle of one of the deepest recessions in the european union , with its economy expected to shrink by up to 18 percent this year .
over the past year , its government has been raising taxes and reducing public spending as it attempts to stick to the terms of the imf / eu bailout .

china has been investing heavily in the african market and is keen to stress the benefits to local businesses .
is that involvement an opportunity or a risk to africa ’ s development and is europe being left behind ? on the copperbelt in zambia , investment in luanshya mine by china 's non-ferrous meter mining group corporation -lrb- nfca -rrb- has been welcomed by locals .
a veteran of the mining industry who wanted to remain anonymous told deutsche welle that " -lsb- s -rsb- o far -lsb- the chinese investors -rsb- are good guys because they are putting -lsb- in -rsb- a lot of money before production starts . "
for a small town whose future appeared bleak when mining production was shut down , the creation of an estimated 3,000 jobs is good news .
the warm welcome of chinese investment in luanshya is in stark contrast to the anti-chinese sentiment in a town less than an hour away .
the memory of a mine explosion that left 46 dead still lingers in chambeshi .
for many , graves located close to the mine are a daily reminder of the deaths of a colleague or loved one .
more than four years after the incident , the community remains ambivalent about the reopening of the plant where the explosion occurred even if it will bring many jobs to the area .
some still feel that their chinese employers are to blame for the incident .
mukuka chilufya , a safety officer who participated in rescue operations following the explosion , told deutsche welle that " maybe they could have received a bulk order and they were running out of time .
so the night shift that were involved in the male dyke collided with the day shift that were involved in the female dyke .
in fact , what is going to confirm that is that the chinese who were knowledgeable of the consequences all were not in the factory when the explosion took place because they knew that something like that could happen . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is investing heavily in africa 's mining industry most of the criticism surrounding china 's involvement in africa debate has been on the working conditions of the miners who are subjected to low wages and questionable safety procedures .
the incident at chambishi mine in zambia in april 2005 drew attention to this .
but as professor helmut asche , director of the institute for african studies at the university of leipzig , notes these conditions are no different from those that miners in northern china are subjected to .
since beijing is unable to control the working conditions of its citizens , african governments are responsible for exerting effective control over chinese investors so that they implement fair wages and adequate safety procedures .
benefits , implications of chinese investment china 's african policy states that it intends to be africa 's equal -lrb- economic -rrb- partner .
experts like he wenping , director of the institute of west-asian and african studies at the chinese academy of social science in beijing , say that china 's goals in africa are more political than economic .
according to asche , a change in china 's africa foreign policy began after the tiananmen square massacre when china needed more foreign allies .
china 's current african partners , who are in the group of 77 , provide it with more influence in the united nations .
asche feels that the import of cheap goods from china can have very different effects as is the case with the south african textile industry and the ethiopian footwear industry .
the protection of local industry in south africa meant that the manufacturers did not modernize their techniques in order to be able to compete successfully with the chinese imports .
on the other hand , in ethiopia where the local footwear manufacturing industry was not protected , production became more competitive and now ethiopia is exporting footwear to china .
zambians often say that " you thank the person who guides you at night when it is dawn . "
the relationship between china and africa is still in its infancy , but as asche told deutsche welle " it is crystal clear -lsb- … -rsb- in scientific research that the chinese investment in all its facets is positive for africa . "
he goes onto say that current investment is doing more to strengthen economies than democracy and good governance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is helping africa develop its infrastructure .
the chinese news agency xinhua estimates that there are currently one million chinese immigrants in africa .
their growing presence is more often than not unwelcome as is shown by attacks on immigrants in nigeria and angola .
most zambians complain that the chinese community isolates itself .
chinese immigrants have not been as successful as indians or other immigrants in integrating in africa , however asche says that both locals and immigrants are responsible for the integration of the chinese migrants .
the role of germany and europe asche feels that germany should do more to get involved in africa : " … the german investors should -lsb- … -rsb- be encouraged to become as courageous as the chinese are .
it is a crystal clear fact that china and its investors and not only the state-owned companies but also private investors see the african market a lot more positive than do quite a number of investors from european countries , and the germans are certainly not among the most courageous . "
in addition to those fears , asche attributes the lack of increased trade between the two continents to the european union 's trade policy , which does not treat africa as an equal partner as china does : “ -lsb- eu trade policy -rsb- is a good example of how not to deal with partner countries and by way of comparison china all of a sudden stands out as , trade policy-wise , a fair partner to africa in comparison with the eu . "
asche says that the growing trade between china and africa is " an irreversible expression of the new multi-polar world , and european powers -lsb- … -rsb- simply have to learn to live in this multi-polar environment in which there is no longer an exclusive relationship between the eu , the us and africa .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press review -pipe- 21.12.2009 copenhagen 's legacy : bitter disappointment , with a glimmer of hope großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : editorialists acknowledged that copenhagen was a disappointment after the widely disappointing un climate conference in copenhagen - aka ' flopenhagen ' - european editorialists let the bitter comments flow .
some found a silver lining , however . the newspaper de volkskrant from holland acknowledged that copenhagen delivered a disappointing result but focused on the positive : the fact that at least the problem is being addressed .
" climate change is now an international problem par excellence .
it seems inevitable that all countries will be brought into negotiations sooner or later .
at the same time , it is nearly impossible to get 192 states of varying size and with diverse interests to reach a unified stance . "
" but there is a glimmer of hope .
all of the participants in the climate conference know that the talks will continue .
and possibly , those actors will be watched by the public and by activists and ngos with a more critical eye than they have been up to now .
because one thing was attained for certain : the climate will never disappear from the political agenda . "
likewise , britain 's guardian newspaper saw positives alongside negatives in the outcome of the conference .
on the bad side : " a considered reading of the accord , which was its only tangible output , reveals that it is not just inadequate but in fact utterly empty . "
on the plus side , however , is " the novel manner in which this ultimate failure was reached . "
" as the sight of the daily chaos -lrb- of copenhagen -rrb- drops out of view , it becomes easier to appreciate that the rich world was forced to haggle with the bigger emerging economies on more equal terms than ever before . "
in other words , " while the copenhagen product is every inch the sham that campaigners say it is , the copenhagen process has set important precedents , " the guardian wrote .
" most obviously … the sheer fact that it took place – and at such a high political level – means it will probably do so again . "
taking a harsher line , left-leaning french newspaper la libération oozed disappointment in the " large countries which , in a delirium of diplomatic ineptitude and the blindness of superiority , torpedoed the binding worldwide accord " they had hoped for . the paper pitched for the eu to take immediate , unilateral action : " eco-reformers need to focus on the us and china , " it wrote ; " after that come the nations that are a bit more environmentally aware , particularly in europe .
but these can not wait until there is an international agreement .
it is much more important for them to become instructive with their actions .
if the eu took the necessary actions from its side , it would jump to the head of the movement .
then the fiasco of copenhagen could be overcome step by step . " in switzerland , zurich 's tages-anzeiger also focused on results ; those who come up with solutions will ultimately benefit in the end , the paper wrote .
at the conference , " concrete solutions were presented on how to reach a climate-friendly future and at the same time remain economically profitable .
numerous companies seemed to have little patience for the political lethargy … the biggest climate-change effect will be felt by those companies and countries that start preparing now .
they will be the ultimate winners , " the paper said .
german editorialists were less inclined to focus on positive signals from the conference .
the sueddeutsche zeitung called the copenhagen summit an " insult to the world community , " noting that " never were expectations for a climate conference higher , and never before were so many heads of state and government officials in one place , meeting to solve one single problem .
but they did n't solve it - they made it worse . "
" as if they were replaying an old , bad film , the heads of the most powerful nations came up with aid funds to silence the developing nations .
they bought their way out .
instead of mutually promising a much-needed rejection of the destructive path of economic development , they agreed on a vague and distant goal .
it is like agreeing on a place to meet , but not a time . "
meanwhile , advocating a just-do-it approach in the wake of the talks , the frankfurter rundschau sent a strong warning to voters and the politicians they elect : " there is no point in allowing the un climate conference circus to continue its performances .
the only chance that remains is for the big heat-producers of the planet to lead by example - without any stipulations about taking others along for the ride , if need be .
fifteen countries on earth are responsible for 80 percent of c02 emissions around the world ; in copenhagen they all said how important climate protection is to them .
now , the politicians of these countries need to make the necessary changes .
and if they do n't the voters have to deal with it - and vote them out of office ... "
finally , the stuttgarter zeitung expressed the disappointment felt by many in europe when they compared us president barack obama 's focus on china and other developing countries with his relative lack of interest in the european negotatiors .
in the wake of the conference , " we need to keep up the ambition of climate protection , and keep the expectations in a realistic framework , " the paper wrote .
" but one prerequisite for this is the recognition that it will be really hard for europe to effectively influence the usa .
the trans-atlantic relationship is coming up on hard times .
barack obama showed one thing for certain in copenhagen : his focus will be on the trans-pacific axis with china .

the thieves had cut the sign into three pieces . police in krakow , southern poland , told reporters on monday it was too early to tell what the motive behind the theft of the auschwitz sign really was .
however , the five suspects arrested when the sign was recovered are not members of a neo-nazi group .
the men do have criminal records for either violence or theft . " we can say that none of the five are members of a neo-nazi group , " andrzej rokita , district police chief in the city of krakow , told a news conference .
" their intent was undoubtedly robbery related .
we will be able to decide later whether the crime was ordered or whether they acted on their own initiative . " the five men , aged 20 to 39 , are believed to have stolen the infamous " arbeit macht frei " sign , which hung over the entrance to the nazi death camp auschwitz , at dawn on friday .
police recovered the sign , cut into three pieces , near the home of one of the suspects . " the sign had been cut into three pieces at the site of the theft , to make it easier to transport .
it had been hidden in a wood near the home of one of the thieves , " rokita said . when intact , the sign was five meters long .
its cynical message " work sets you free " became a symbol of the efforts of the nazis to deceive their victims .
over a million people , mostly jews , perished in the nazi death camp in southern poland during world war two - most of the site became a museum and memorial after the war ended . intensive search the five alleged thieves were captured after poland stepped up border security , set up roadblocks , deployed a team of around 40 forensic experts and sought the help of international policing bodies interpol and europol in a bid to recover the sign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the museum soon put this image right , hanging a replica sign on the gates as an interim solution the auschwitz museum offered a 100,000-zloty reward -lrb- 24,000 euros or $ 34,000 -rrb- for information which would help to recapture the sign , and polish police offered a further 5,000 zlotys . friday 's theft sparked condemnation from world leaders , jewish groups and holocaust survivors . " a worldwide symbol of the cynicism of hitler 's executioners and the martyrdom of their victims has been stolen , " polish president lech kaczynski said after the theft . auschwitz , visited by one million people last year , was one of a network of camps set up to kill some 6 million jews , along with members of other ethnic , religious , political , or social groups that hitler 's regime wanted to eliminate . msh / afp / ap / reuters editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de awards -pipe- 21.12.2009 sports journalists name athletes of the year in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul biedermann and steffi nerius show off their awards in a tradition that dates back to 1947 , german sports journalists have voted on the man , woman , and team who impacted the world of german sports the most over the past twelve months . all told , around 1400 journalists cast their ballots for the german sports awards , which were presented at a ceremony sunday night in baden baden .
in 2009 , the spotlight fell on one of the female stars from this summer 's world athletics championships in berlin , the only man to beat michael phelps in a major swimming competition since 2005 , and the women 's national soccer team for their clear dominance over their european competitors .
steffi nerius throws for gold after the opening weekend of the world athletics championships in august , the biggest star to emerge from berlin 's olympic stadium was usain bolt , whose record-breaking 100-meter dash on the competition 's second day captivated germans and out-of-town visitors alike .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nerius 's first throw was good enough for gold two days later , bolt had competition for the newspaper headlines , and it was from a member of the home team .
when steffi nerius stepped to the line of the finals in the javelin competition , germany had yet to produce a single gold medal winner .
tournament organizers had staggered the events so there was a german gold medal hopeful on each of the nine days of competition , but on the fourth day , they were still waiting for the first german champion .
nerius 's first throw of the finals sailed 67.30 meters , which held as the best mark throughout the entire competition .
when eventual czech silver medalist barbora spotakova 's final throw of the event failed to beat nerius ' mark , nerius raised her arms in the air and celebrated germany 's first gold of the competition , with a stadium full of loud supporters cheering her on .
it was the first world championship gold medal of the 37-year-old 's career .
before the world championships began , there had been fears that germany would repeat its performance from the beijing olympics and come up short in the medals column .
but after nerius set the precedent , german athletes went on to take home a total of two gold , three silver , and four bronze medals , which represented a successful competition for the host nation .
paul biedermann upsets michael phelps new world records were practically a drop in the deep end at the world swimming championships in rome last july .
controversial new swimsuits , made partially or entirely out of polyurethane , seemed to be giving swimmers who wore them a slight edge , and as a result , 43 world records fell at the meet in rome .
bildunterschrift : biedermann bested the world record - and michael phelps - in the 200m freestyle paul biedermann grabbed two of those records , and they happened to be two of the most impressive of the entire competition .
wearing a full-body polyurethane suit , biedermann bested legendary australian swimmer ian thorpe 's world record in the 400 meter freestyle , a mark that many in the sport thought would be safe for many years .
biedermann 's next record was even more impressive , especially because of the man he handily beat in the race .
in the 200 ´ -meter freestyle , biedermann shattered american michael phelps 's world record time by over a second , and handed phelps his only silver medal in world or olympic competition since 2005 .
phelps did n't wear one of the all-polyurethane suits against biedermann , but still praised the 23-year-old german 's performance .
" paul swam a great race .
i did not have anything in the last 50 meters , " phelps said after the swim .
" in the race i was beaten by the swimmer , not the suit . "
starting in 2010 , swimming 's governing body fina will implement a ban on all-polyurethane suits , but eight-time beijing gold medallist michael phelps has a new top rival for next season : germany 's paul biedermann .
women 's national team wins european championships german soccer fans remember well the impressive march by bundesliga squad vfl wolfsburg to the german championship at the end of the 2008/2009 bundesliga season .
it was the first title in the team 's history .
but to be considered germany 's best team of the year , one title just is n't enough .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inka grings had six goals to celebrate at this year 's european championship seven is more appropriate - the number of titles the german women 's national soccer team has after winning the 2009 european championship in finland by convincingly beating england 6-2 in the final .
winning yet another title continued an impressive streak for the german women .
in european championship competition , the team remains unbeaten since 1995 .
that 's a total of 26 matches , and five titles in a row .
in fact , since the first women 's european championship took place in 1984 , only two other countries - sweden once and norway twice - have won the title other than germany .
like squads in the past , the 2009 european champions simply overpowered their opponents .
in the six matches played by the german side in finland , they scored 21 goals against their opponents ' 5 goals combined .
six of those goals came from striker inka grings , and the rest came from a team effort of nine other goal scorers .
2009 marks the second time the women 's national team has been elected team of the year by german sports journalists .
the first was in 2003 , after the team won its first women 's world cup .
they followed it up with another title in 2007 , and have a shot at their third straight world cup in 2011 as the host country. mz / dpa / sid editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in 2009 , the spotlight fell on one of the female stars from this summer 's world athletics championships in berlin , the only man to beat michael phelps in a major swimming competition since 2005 , and the women 's national soccer team for their clear dominance over their european competitors .
steffi nerius throws for gold after the opening weekend of the world athletics championships in august , the biggest star to emerge from berlin 's olympic stadium was usain bolt , whose record-breaking 100-meter dash on the competition 's second day captivated germans and out-of-town visitors alike .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nerius 's first throw was good enough for gold two days later , bolt had competition for the newspaper headlines , and it was from a member of the home team .
when steffi nerius stepped to the line of the finals in the javelin competition , germany had yet to produce a single gold medal winner .
tournament organizers had staggered the events so there was a german gold medal hopeful on each of the nine days of competition , but on the fourth day , they were still waiting for the first german champion .
nerius 's first throw of the finals sailed 67.30 meters , which held as the best mark throughout the entire competition .
when eventual czech silver medalist barbora spotakova 's final throw of the event failed to beat nerius ' mark , nerius raised her arms in the air and celebrated germany 's first gold of the competition , with a stadium full of loud supporters cheering her on .
it was the first world championship gold medal of the 37-year-old 's career .
before the world championships began , there had been fears that germany would repeat its performance from the beijing olympics and come up short in the medals column .
but after nerius set the precedent , german athletes went on to take home a total of two gold , three silver , and four bronze medals , which represented a successful competition for the host nation .
paul biedermann upsets michael phelps new world records were practically a drop in the deep end at the world swimming championships in rome last july .
controversial new swimsuits , made partially or entirely out of polyurethane , seemed to be giving swimmers who wore them a slight edge , and as a result , 43 world records fell at the meet in rome .
bildunterschrift : biedermann bested the world record - and michael phelps - in the 200m freestyle paul biedermann grabbed two of those records , and they happened to be two of the most impressive of the entire competition .
wearing a full-body polyurethane suit , biedermann bested legendary australian swimmer ian thorpe 's world record in the 400 meter freestyle , a mark that many in the sport thought would be safe for many years .
biedermann 's next record was even more impressive , especially because of the man he handily beat in the race .
in the 200 ´ -meter freestyle , biedermann shattered american michael phelps 's world record time by over a second , and handed phelps his only silver medal in world or olympic competition since 2005 .
phelps did n't wear one of the all-polyurethane suits against biedermann , but still praised the 23-year-old german 's performance .
" paul swam a great race .
i did not have anything in the last 50 meters , " phelps said after the swim .
" in the race i was beaten by the swimmer , not the suit . "
starting in 2010 , swimming 's governing body fina will implement a ban on all-polyurethane suits , but eight-time beijing gold medallist michael phelps has a new top rival for next season : germany 's paul biedermann .
women 's national team wins european championships german soccer fans remember well the impressive march by bundesliga squad vfl wolfsburg to the german championship at the end of the 2008/2009 bundesliga season .
it was the first title in the team 's history .
but to be considered germany 's best team of the year , one title just is n't enough .

winning yet another title continued an impressive streak for the german women .
in european championship competition , the team remains unbeaten since 1995 .
that 's a total of 26 matches , and five titles in a row .
in fact , since the first women 's european championship took place in 1984 , only two other countries - sweden once and norway twice - have won the title other than germany .
like squads in the past , the 2009 european champions simply overpowered their opponents .
in the six matches played by the german side in finland , they scored 21 goals against their opponents ' 5 goals combined .
six of those goals came from striker inka grings , and the rest came from a team effort of nine other goal scorers .
2009 marks the second time the women 's national team has been elected team of the year by german sports journalists .
the first was in 2003 , after the team won its first women 's world cup .
they followed it up with another title in 2007 , and have a shot at their third straight world cup in 2011 as the host country. mz / dpa / sid editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this is part of a larger effort by egypt to reclaim its ancient treasures . egypt 's chief antiquities official zahi hawass says he will make a formal request for the return of the bust of queen nefertiti from berlin 's neues museum .
in a statement released sunday , hawass said he was presented with documents by the head of the berlin neues museum , where the bust is currently on display , which supported his claim that the statue is in germany illegally . german archeologist acted “ unethically ” according to hawass , the documents confirmed that the german archeologist ludwig borchardt produced fraudulent papers to secure the 3,300 year old bust for berlin in 1913 .
borchardt , who discovered the bust , tried to pass off the artefact as a less significant find in order to take it out of egypt .
“ these materials confirm egypt 's contention that borchardt did act unethically , with intent to deceive , ” the statement said .
“ the limestone head of the queen is listed on the protocol as a painted plaster bust of a princess . ”
the statement went on to say that friederike seyfried , a museum director who oversees the section where the bust is on display , would assist in negotiations between hawass and german officials .
however , in a statement released december 18 by the museum 's operators , the prussian cultural heritage foundation , it was said that , while seyfried would meet with hawass in cairo soon , she would not discuss nefertiti 's return , since the documents showed the prussian state acquired the bust lawfully and egypt had no legal claim for its return .
new campaign for return of artefacts despite the claims of the foundation , hawass says he is optimistic about the bust 's return .
“ i always ask for artefacts to come and it always happens ” he told reuters .
the push for nefertiti 's return is part of a larger effort for egypt to reclaim its ancient artefacts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bust has attracted millions of visitors since it was sent to germany in 1913 hawass previously retrieved wall fragments of a 3,200 year old tomb from the french louvre , and is also currently working on having the rosetta stone returned from the british museum . the bust of nefertiti was discovered in egypt in 1912 at tell el-amarna , the short-lived capital of the kingdom under nefertiti 's husband , pharaoh akhenaten .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 21.12.2009 demjanjuk presents german law with an almost impossible problem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demjanjuk worked in the sobibor concentration camp the demjanjuk trial , which resumed monday , has offered up some awkward moral questions for the german justice system .
but compared with other nazi trials , demjanjuk represents a completely new legal challenge . the trial of john demjanjuk , a ukrainian former prisoner-of-war turned concentration camp guard , has once again lifted the lid on questions about how the german justice system has dealt with the murderers of the holocaust .
not least among these questions is : ' why now ? '
even by the glacial time-scale dictated by the law , the demjanjuk trial has been a long time coming .
the file of evidence against him has not changed since his identity was established in 1993 , when an israeli court cleared him of being a notorious treblinka guard called ivan the terrible .
a single identity card is the main piece of evidence : it shows that demjanjuk was indeed a guard at sobibor , probably between march and september 1943 , and therefore must have helped murder at least 27,900 people thought to have died there in that period .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demjanjuk 's id is the main piece of evidence but the rest of the evidence against demjanjuk is either circumstantial or mitigating .
most of the 35 plaintiffs are simply relatives of those killed at sobibor , and the four actual survivors of the camp are too old to have a reliable memory of him or his immediate actions .
the defense lawyer ulrich busch has repeatedly argued that demjanjuk is also a victim of the nazi regime : as a ukrainian prisoner of war , demjanjuk became a trawniki - one of the many local non-germans trained as guards in the easternmost concentration camps - to avoid starvation .
why now ?
busch also asked the question ' why now ? ' in court in the first days of the trial in early december .
demjanjuk has only been legally pursued for these crimes since 2001 .
busch pointed to the trials of demjanjuk 's superiors that had resulted in acquittals - particularly that of karl streibel , a trawniki recruiter , tried in germany in 1976 and scandalously acquitted after his attorneys successfully argued that he did not know what the guards he trained would be used for .
" how can those that give the orders be innocent , when those that receive them are guilty ? "
busch asked the court .
angelika benz , a phd history student writing a thesis on the concentration camps in eastern poland , visited the first days of the demjanjuk trial and described the central difficulty in blunt terms .
" even though we know what happened at sobibor , the problem is that this crime - the holocaust - simply ca n't be dealt with by our judicial system , " benz told deutsche welle , " this becomes clear when we 're dealing with someone like demjanjuk - someone about whom we know very little . "
with so many facts missing about demjanjuk 's actions and motivations , his judges are forced to redefine the law according to the general and abstract definition of the holocaust itself .
the judges ' answer to busch 's question of how demjanjuk could be considered guilty when the man who may have trained him had been acquitted was simple - the past mistakes of the german judiciary need not be repeated .
this signal that past judgements in nazi trials are irrelevant , even flawed , is apparently necessary if any judgement can be passed on demjanjuk at all .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only the decision-makers were originally put on trial the precedents are useless the historian joerg friedrich became famous when he published two provocative books on the nazi trials in the early 1980 's - " freispruch fuer die nazi-justiz " -lrb- " acquittal for the nazi-judiciary " -rrb- and " die kalte amnestie " -lrb- " the cold amnesty " -rrb- - in which he argued that the german judiciary had failed to bring the nazi perpetrators to justice .
now he believes that the judiciary has come round to his point of view , and is attempting to correct its mistake by going after the last remaining perpetrators with new vigor .
the trial of 88- year-old heinrich boere , a dutch member of the ss , is also currently under way in aachen after decades of legal prevarication and a tireless campaign to bring him to justice .
friedrich believes that the demjanjuk trial illustrates two important developments in the german judiciary 's attitude to the holocaust .
firstly , that it is rethinking , or being forced to rethink , its definition of a holocaust perpetrator .
secondly , that it is prepared to lower the bar of required evidence in order to convict holocaust perpetrators .
but boere 's crime is much easier to define than demjanjuk 's - he is accused of , and has admitted to , three specific acts of murder .
by current german law , this is the crime that demjanjuk will have to be found guilty of if he is to be convicted - of all the crimes that demjanjuk may or may not have committed , murder is the only one that has not exceeded its time-bar limit .
germany lifted that limit on murder in the 1960 's .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinrich boere 's trial is also under way in aachen " this is a problem that judges in the 50 's , 60 's , 70 's and 80 's ignored , " friedrich told deutsche welle , " the majority of holocaust-perpetrators were seen as abetters , those that helped the murderers .
the actual murderers were always defined as hitler , himmler , eichmann - those that made the decision to instigate the holocaust - or those that showed a personal motivation in the act .
murder is not simply killing someone - you must prove intent and motivation to ensure a conviction .
the abetters were those that helped hitler , but had no motives of their own - they simply carried out their tasks . "
this narrow definition of the murderers of the holocaust appears in almost all nazi trial judgements from previous trials .
simply working in a concentration camp never convicted anyone .
but this is all that can be established beyond doubt about demjanjuk .
in order to convict him , the judges will essentially have to redefine murder for the extreme and abstract circumstances of the holocaust .
a long chain " in previous nazi trials , those that were convicted were the so-called ' concentration camp monsters ' - people who had been seen tormenting , abusing , or beating jews before their execution , " friedrich explains , " such actions were considered ' personal contributions ' , and people were convicted not of being abetters to the crime but of being co-perpetrators . "
this goes some way to explaining why so few people were convicted of holocaust crimes in germany .
according to an article in news magazine der spiegel on the legacy of german guilt , of over 100,000 investigations that were carried out in postwar germany into nazi crimes , only around 6,500 people were convicted .
thirteen death sentences were passed , 167 life sentences , and the rest received shorter prison sentences or fines .
only a fifth of those convictions were for murder .
" for the german judiciary , the holocaust only ever existed within the camp gates , " friedrich points out , " but in fact the holocaust was a long chain .
the whole of society played dumb and those that did the bloody work appeared in court . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 21.12.2009 demjanjuk presents german law with an almost impossible problem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demjanjuk worked in the sobibor concentration camp the demjanjuk trial , which resumed monday , has offered up some awkward moral questions for the german justice system .
but compared with other nazi trials , demjanjuk represents a completely new legal challenge . the trial of john demjanjuk , a ukrainian former prisoner-of-war turned concentration camp guard , has once again lifted the lid on questions about how the german justice system has dealt with the murderers of the holocaust .
not least among these questions is : ' why now ? '
even by the glacial time-scale dictated by the law , the demjanjuk trial has been a long time coming .
the file of evidence against him has not changed since his identity was established in 1993 , when an israeli court cleared him of being a notorious treblinka guard called ivan the terrible .
a single identity card is the main piece of evidence : it shows that demjanjuk was indeed a guard at sobibor , probably between march and september 1943 , and therefore must have helped murder at least 27,900 people thought to have died there in that period .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demjanjuk 's id is the main piece of evidence but the rest of the evidence against demjanjuk is either circumstantial or mitigating .
most of the 35 plaintiffs are simply relatives of those killed at sobibor , and the four actual survivors of the camp are too old to have a reliable memory of him or his immediate actions .
the defense lawyer ulrich busch has repeatedly argued that demjanjuk is also a victim of the nazi regime : as a ukrainian prisoner of war , demjanjuk became a trawniki - one of the many local non-germans trained as guards in the easternmost concentration camps - to avoid starvation .
why now ?
busch also asked the question ' why now ? ' in court in the first days of the trial in early december .
demjanjuk has only been legally pursued for these crimes since 2001 .
busch pointed to the trials of demjanjuk 's superiors that had resulted in acquittals - particularly that of karl streibel , a trawniki recruiter , tried in germany in 1976 and scandalously acquitted after his attorneys successfully argued that he did not know what the guards he trained would be used for .
" how can those that give the orders be innocent , when those that receive them are guilty ? "
busch asked the court .
angelika benz , a phd history student writing a thesis on the concentration camps in eastern poland , visited the first days of the demjanjuk trial and described the central difficulty in blunt terms .
" even though we know what happened at sobibor , the problem is that this crime - the holocaust - simply ca n't be dealt with by our judicial system , " benz told deutsche welle , " this becomes clear when we 're dealing with someone like demjanjuk - someone about whom we know very little . "
with so many facts missing about demjanjuk 's actions and motivations , his judges are forced to redefine the law according to the general and abstract definition of the holocaust itself .
the judges ' answer to busch 's question of how demjanjuk could be considered guilty when the man who may have trained him had been acquitted was simple - the past mistakes of the german judiciary need not be repeated .
this signal that past judgements in nazi trials are irrelevant , even flawed , is apparently necessary if any judgement can be passed on demjanjuk at all .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only the decision-makers were originally put on trial the precedents are useless the historian joerg friedrich became famous when he published two provocative books on the nazi trials in the early 1980 's - " freispruch fuer die nazi-justiz " -lrb- " acquittal for the nazi-judiciary " -rrb- and " die kalte amnestie " -lrb- " the cold amnesty " -rrb- - in which he argued that the german judiciary had failed to bring the nazi perpetrators to justice .
now he believes that the judiciary has come round to his point of view , and is attempting to correct its mistake by going after the last remaining perpetrators with new vigor .
the trial of 88- year-old heinrich boere , a dutch member of the ss , is also currently under way in aachen after decades of legal prevarication and a tireless campaign to bring him to justice .
friedrich believes that the demjanjuk trial illustrates two important developments in the german judiciary 's attitude to the holocaust .
firstly , that it is rethinking , or being forced to rethink , its definition of a holocaust perpetrator .
secondly , that it is prepared to lower the bar of required evidence in order to convict holocaust perpetrators .
but boere 's crime is much easier to define than demjanjuk 's - he is accused of , and has admitted to , three specific acts of murder .
by current german law , this is the crime that demjanjuk will have to be found guilty of if he is to be convicted - of all the crimes that demjanjuk may or may not have committed , murder is the only one that has not exceeded its time-bar limit .
germany lifted that limit on murder in the 1960 's .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinrich boere 's trial is also under way in aachen " this is a problem that judges in the 50 's , 60 's , 70 's and 80 's ignored , " friedrich told deutsche welle , " the majority of holocaust-perpetrators were seen as abetters , those that helped the murderers .
the actual murderers were always defined as hitler , himmler , eichmann - those that made the decision to instigate the holocaust - or those that showed a personal motivation in the act .
murder is not simply killing someone - you must prove intent and motivation to ensure a conviction .
the abetters were those that helped hitler , but had no motives of their own - they simply carried out their tasks . "
this narrow definition of the murderers of the holocaust appears in almost all nazi trial judgements from previous trials .
simply working in a concentration camp never convicted anyone .
but this is all that can be established beyond doubt about demjanjuk .
in order to convict him , the judges will essentially have to redefine murder for the extreme and abstract circumstances of the holocaust .
a long chain " in previous nazi trials , those that were convicted were the so-called ' concentration camp monsters ' - people who had been seen tormenting , abusing , or beating jews before their execution , " friedrich explains , " such actions were considered ' personal contributions ' , and people were convicted not of being abetters to the crime but of being co-perpetrators . "
this goes some way to explaining why so few people were convicted of holocaust crimes in germany .
according to an article in news magazine der spiegel on the legacy of german guilt , of over 100,000 investigations that were carried out in postwar germany into nazi crimes , only around 6,500 people were convicted .
thirteen death sentences were passed , 167 life sentences , and the rest received shorter prison sentences or fines .
only a fifth of those convictions were for murder .
" for the german judiciary , the holocaust only ever existed within the camp gates , " friedrich points out , " but in fact the holocaust was a long chain .
the whole of society played dumb and those that did the bloody work appeared in court . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 21.12.2009 demjanjuk presents german law with an almost impossible problem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demjanjuk worked in the sobibor concentration camp the demjanjuk trial , which resumed monday , has offered up some awkward moral questions for the german justice system .
but compared with other nazi trials , demjanjuk represents a completely new legal challenge . the trial of john demjanjuk , a ukrainian former prisoner-of-war turned concentration camp guard , has once again lifted the lid on questions about how the german justice system has dealt with the murderers of the holocaust .
not least among these questions is : ' why now ? '
even by the glacial time-scale dictated by the law , the demjanjuk trial has been a long time coming .
the file of evidence against him has not changed since his identity was established in 1993 , when an israeli court cleared him of being a notorious treblinka guard called ivan the terrible .
a single identity card is the main piece of evidence : it shows that demjanjuk was indeed a guard at sobibor , probably between march and september 1943 , and therefore must have helped murder at least 27,900 people thought to have died there in that period .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demjanjuk 's id is the main piece of evidence but the rest of the evidence against demjanjuk is either circumstantial or mitigating .
most of the 35 plaintiffs are simply relatives of those killed at sobibor , and the four actual survivors of the camp are too old to have a reliable memory of him or his immediate actions .
the defense lawyer ulrich busch has repeatedly argued that demjanjuk is also a victim of the nazi regime : as a ukrainian prisoner of war , demjanjuk became a trawniki - one of the many local non-germans trained as guards in the easternmost concentration camps - to avoid starvation .
why now ?
busch also asked the question ' why now ? ' in court in the first days of the trial in early december .
demjanjuk has only been legally pursued for these crimes since 2001 .
busch pointed to the trials of demjanjuk 's superiors that had resulted in acquittals - particularly that of karl streibel , a trawniki recruiter , tried in germany in 1976 and scandalously acquitted after his attorneys successfully argued that he did not know what the guards he trained would be used for .
" how can those that give the orders be innocent , when those that receive them are guilty ? "
busch asked the court .
angelika benz , a phd history student writing a thesis on the concentration camps in eastern poland , visited the first days of the demjanjuk trial and described the central difficulty in blunt terms .
" even though we know what happened at sobibor , the problem is that this crime - the holocaust - simply ca n't be dealt with by our judicial system , " benz told deutsche welle , " this becomes clear when we 're dealing with someone like demjanjuk - someone about whom we know very little . "
with so many facts missing about demjanjuk 's actions and motivations , his judges are forced to redefine the law according to the general and abstract definition of the holocaust itself .
the judges ' answer to busch 's question of how demjanjuk could be considered guilty when the man who may have trained him had been acquitted was simple - the past mistakes of the german judiciary need not be repeated .
this signal that past judgements in nazi trials are irrelevant , even flawed , is apparently necessary if any judgement can be passed on demjanjuk at all .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only the decision-makers were originally put on trial the precedents are useless the historian joerg friedrich became famous when he published two provocative books on the nazi trials in the early 1980 's - " freispruch fuer die nazi-justiz " -lrb- " acquittal for the nazi-judiciary " -rrb- and " die kalte amnestie " -lrb- " the cold amnesty " -rrb- - in which he argued that the german judiciary had failed to bring the nazi perpetrators to justice .
now he believes that the judiciary has come round to his point of view , and is attempting to correct its mistake by going after the last remaining perpetrators with new vigor .
the trial of 88- year-old heinrich boere , a dutch member of the ss , is also currently under way in aachen after decades of legal prevarication and a tireless campaign to bring him to justice .
friedrich believes that the demjanjuk trial illustrates two important developments in the german judiciary 's attitude to the holocaust .
firstly , that it is rethinking , or being forced to rethink , its definition of a holocaust perpetrator .
secondly , that it is prepared to lower the bar of required evidence in order to convict holocaust perpetrators .
but boere 's crime is much easier to define than demjanjuk 's - he is accused of , and has admitted to , three specific acts of murder .
by current german law , this is the crime that demjanjuk will have to be found guilty of if he is to be convicted - of all the crimes that demjanjuk may or may not have committed , murder is the only one that has not exceeded its time-bar limit .
germany lifted that limit on murder in the 1960 's .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinrich boere 's trial is also under way in aachen " this is a problem that judges in the 50 's , 60 's , 70 's and 80 's ignored , " friedrich told deutsche welle , " the majority of holocaust-perpetrators were seen as abetters , those that helped the murderers .
the actual murderers were always defined as hitler , himmler , eichmann - those that made the decision to instigate the holocaust - or those that showed a personal motivation in the act .
murder is not simply killing someone - you must prove intent and motivation to ensure a conviction .
the abetters were those that helped hitler , but had no motives of their own - they simply carried out their tasks . "
this narrow definition of the murderers of the holocaust appears in almost all nazi trial judgements from previous trials .
simply working in a concentration camp never convicted anyone .
but this is all that can be established beyond doubt about demjanjuk .
in order to convict him , the judges will essentially have to redefine murder for the extreme and abstract circumstances of the holocaust .
a long chain " in previous nazi trials , those that were convicted were the so-called ' concentration camp monsters ' - people who had been seen tormenting , abusing , or beating jews before their execution , " friedrich explains , " such actions were considered ' personal contributions ' , and people were convicted not of being abetters to the crime but of being co-perpetrators . "
this goes some way to explaining why so few people were convicted of holocaust crimes in germany .
according to an article in news magazine der spiegel on the legacy of german guilt , of over 100,000 investigations that were carried out in postwar germany into nazi crimes , only around 6,500 people were convicted .
thirteen death sentences were passed , 167 life sentences , and the rest received shorter prison sentences or fines .
only a fifth of those convictions were for murder .
" for the german judiciary , the holocaust only ever existed within the camp gates , " friedrich points out , " but in fact the holocaust was a long chain .
the whole of society played dumb and those that did the bloody work appeared in court . "

but compared with other nazi trials , demjanjuk represents a completely new legal challenge . the trial of john demjanjuk , a ukrainian former prisoner-of-war turned concentration camp guard , has once again lifted the lid on questions about how the german justice system has dealt with the murderers of the holocaust .
not least among these questions is : ' why now ? '
even by the glacial time-scale dictated by the law , the demjanjuk trial has been a long time coming .
the file of evidence against him has not changed since his identity was established in 1993 , when an israeli court cleared him of being a notorious treblinka guard called ivan the terrible .
a single identity card is the main piece of evidence : it shows that demjanjuk was indeed a guard at sobibor , probably between march and september 1943 , and therefore must have helped murder at least 27,900 people thought to have died there in that period .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demjanjuk 's id is the main piece of evidence but the rest of the evidence against demjanjuk is either circumstantial or mitigating .
most of the 35 plaintiffs are simply relatives of those killed at sobibor , and the four actual survivors of the camp are too old to have a reliable memory of him or his immediate actions .
the defense lawyer ulrich busch has repeatedly argued that demjanjuk is also a victim of the nazi regime : as a ukrainian prisoner of war , demjanjuk became a trawniki - one of the many local non-germans trained as guards in the easternmost concentration camps - to avoid starvation .
why now ?
busch also asked the question ' why now ? ' in court in the first days of the trial in early december .
demjanjuk has only been legally pursued for these crimes since 2001 .
busch pointed to the trials of demjanjuk 's superiors that had resulted in acquittals - particularly that of karl streibel , a trawniki recruiter , tried in germany in 1976 and scandalously acquitted after his attorneys successfully argued that he did not know what the guards he trained would be used for .
" how can those that give the orders be innocent , when those that receive them are guilty ? "
busch asked the court .
angelika benz , a phd history student writing a thesis on the concentration camps in eastern poland , visited the first days of the demjanjuk trial and described the central difficulty in blunt terms .
" even though we know what happened at sobibor , the problem is that this crime - the holocaust - simply ca n't be dealt with by our judicial system , " benz told deutsche welle , " this becomes clear when we 're dealing with someone like demjanjuk - someone about whom we know very little . "
with so many facts missing about demjanjuk 's actions and motivations , his judges are forced to redefine the law according to the general and abstract definition of the holocaust itself .
the judges ' answer to busch 's question of how demjanjuk could be considered guilty when the man who may have trained him had been acquitted was simple - the past mistakes of the german judiciary need not be repeated .
this signal that past judgements in nazi trials are irrelevant , even flawed , is apparently necessary if any judgement can be passed on demjanjuk at all .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only the decision-makers were originally put on trial the precedents are useless the historian joerg friedrich became famous when he published two provocative books on the nazi trials in the early 1980 's - " freispruch fuer die nazi-justiz " -lrb- " acquittal for the nazi-judiciary " -rrb- and " die kalte amnestie " -lrb- " the cold amnesty " -rrb- - in which he argued that the german judiciary had failed to bring the nazi perpetrators to justice .
now he believes that the judiciary has come round to his point of view , and is attempting to correct its mistake by going after the last remaining perpetrators with new vigor .
the trial of 88- year-old heinrich boere , a dutch member of the ss , is also currently under way in aachen after decades of legal prevarication and a tireless campaign to bring him to justice .
friedrich believes that the demjanjuk trial illustrates two important developments in the german judiciary 's attitude to the holocaust .
firstly , that it is rethinking , or being forced to rethink , its definition of a holocaust perpetrator .
secondly , that it is prepared to lower the bar of required evidence in order to convict holocaust perpetrators .
but boere 's crime is much easier to define than demjanjuk 's - he is accused of , and has admitted to , three specific acts of murder .
by current german law , this is the crime that demjanjuk will have to be found guilty of if he is to be convicted - of all the crimes that demjanjuk may or may not have committed , murder is the only one that has not exceeded its time-bar limit .
germany lifted that limit on murder in the 1960 's .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinrich boere 's trial is also under way in aachen " this is a problem that judges in the 50 's , 60 's , 70 's and 80 's ignored , " friedrich told deutsche welle , " the majority of holocaust-perpetrators were seen as abetters , those that helped the murderers .
the actual murderers were always defined as hitler , himmler , eichmann - those that made the decision to instigate the holocaust - or those that showed a personal motivation in the act .
murder is not simply killing someone - you must prove intent and motivation to ensure a conviction .
the abetters were those that helped hitler , but had no motives of their own - they simply carried out their tasks . "
this narrow definition of the murderers of the holocaust appears in almost all nazi trial judgements from previous trials .
simply working in a concentration camp never convicted anyone .
but this is all that can be established beyond doubt about demjanjuk .
in order to convict him , the judges will essentially have to redefine murder for the extreme and abstract circumstances of the holocaust .
a long chain " in previous nazi trials , those that were convicted were the so-called ' concentration camp monsters ' - people who had been seen tormenting , abusing , or beating jews before their execution , " friedrich explains , " such actions were considered ' personal contributions ' , and people were convicted not of being abetters to the crime but of being co-perpetrators . "
this goes some way to explaining why so few people were convicted of holocaust crimes in germany .
according to an article in news magazine der spiegel on the legacy of german guilt , of over 100,000 investigations that were carried out in postwar germany into nazi crimes , only around 6,500 people were convicted .
thirteen death sentences were passed , 167 life sentences , and the rest received shorter prison sentences or fines .
only a fifth of those convictions were for murder .
" for the german judiciary , the holocaust only ever existed within the camp gates , " friedrich points out , " but in fact the holocaust was a long chain .
the whole of society played dumb and those that did the bloody work appeared in court . "

the defense lawyer ulrich busch has repeatedly argued that demjanjuk is also a victim of the nazi regime : as a ukrainian prisoner of war , demjanjuk became a trawniki - one of the many local non-germans trained as guards in the easternmost concentration camps - to avoid starvation .
why now ?
busch also asked the question ' why now ? ' in court in the first days of the trial in early december .
demjanjuk has only been legally pursued for these crimes since 2001 .
busch pointed to the trials of demjanjuk 's superiors that had resulted in acquittals - particularly that of karl streibel , a trawniki recruiter , tried in germany in 1976 and scandalously acquitted after his attorneys successfully argued that he did not know what the guards he trained would be used for .
" how can those that give the orders be innocent , when those that receive them are guilty ? "
busch asked the court .
angelika benz , a phd history student writing a thesis on the concentration camps in eastern poland , visited the first days of the demjanjuk trial and described the central difficulty in blunt terms .
" even though we know what happened at sobibor , the problem is that this crime - the holocaust - simply ca n't be dealt with by our judicial system , " benz told deutsche welle , " this becomes clear when we 're dealing with someone like demjanjuk - someone about whom we know very little . "
with so many facts missing about demjanjuk 's actions and motivations , his judges are forced to redefine the law according to the general and abstract definition of the holocaust itself .
the judges ' answer to busch 's question of how demjanjuk could be considered guilty when the man who may have trained him had been acquitted was simple - the past mistakes of the german judiciary need not be repeated .
this signal that past judgements in nazi trials are irrelevant , even flawed , is apparently necessary if any judgement can be passed on demjanjuk at all .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only the decision-makers were originally put on trial the precedents are useless the historian joerg friedrich became famous when he published two provocative books on the nazi trials in the early 1980 's - " freispruch fuer die nazi-justiz " -lrb- " acquittal for the nazi-judiciary " -rrb- and " die kalte amnestie " -lrb- " the cold amnesty " -rrb- - in which he argued that the german judiciary had failed to bring the nazi perpetrators to justice .
now he believes that the judiciary has come round to his point of view , and is attempting to correct its mistake by going after the last remaining perpetrators with new vigor .
the trial of 88- year-old heinrich boere , a dutch member of the ss , is also currently under way in aachen after decades of legal prevarication and a tireless campaign to bring him to justice .
friedrich believes that the demjanjuk trial illustrates two important developments in the german judiciary 's attitude to the holocaust .
firstly , that it is rethinking , or being forced to rethink , its definition of a holocaust perpetrator .
secondly , that it is prepared to lower the bar of required evidence in order to convict holocaust perpetrators .
but boere 's crime is much easier to define than demjanjuk 's - he is accused of , and has admitted to , three specific acts of murder .
by current german law , this is the crime that demjanjuk will have to be found guilty of if he is to be convicted - of all the crimes that demjanjuk may or may not have committed , murder is the only one that has not exceeded its time-bar limit .
germany lifted that limit on murder in the 1960 's .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinrich boere 's trial is also under way in aachen " this is a problem that judges in the 50 's , 60 's , 70 's and 80 's ignored , " friedrich told deutsche welle , " the majority of holocaust-perpetrators were seen as abetters , those that helped the murderers .
the actual murderers were always defined as hitler , himmler , eichmann - those that made the decision to instigate the holocaust - or those that showed a personal motivation in the act .
murder is not simply killing someone - you must prove intent and motivation to ensure a conviction .
the abetters were those that helped hitler , but had no motives of their own - they simply carried out their tasks . "
this narrow definition of the murderers of the holocaust appears in almost all nazi trial judgements from previous trials .
simply working in a concentration camp never convicted anyone .
but this is all that can be established beyond doubt about demjanjuk .
in order to convict him , the judges will essentially have to redefine murder for the extreme and abstract circumstances of the holocaust .
a long chain " in previous nazi trials , those that were convicted were the so-called ' concentration camp monsters ' - people who had been seen tormenting , abusing , or beating jews before their execution , " friedrich explains , " such actions were considered ' personal contributions ' , and people were convicted not of being abetters to the crime but of being co-perpetrators . "
this goes some way to explaining why so few people were convicted of holocaust crimes in germany .
according to an article in news magazine der spiegel on the legacy of german guilt , of over 100,000 investigations that were carried out in postwar germany into nazi crimes , only around 6,500 people were convicted .
thirteen death sentences were passed , 167 life sentences , and the rest received shorter prison sentences or fines .
only a fifth of those convictions were for murder .
" for the german judiciary , the holocaust only ever existed within the camp gates , " friedrich points out , " but in fact the holocaust was a long chain .
the whole of society played dumb and those that did the bloody work appeared in court . "

but compared with other nazi trials , demjanjuk represents a completely new legal challenge . the trial of john demjanjuk , a ukrainian former prisoner-of-war turned concentration camp guard , has once again lifted the lid on questions about how the german justice system has dealt with the murderers of the holocaust .
not least among these questions is : ' why now ? '
even by the glacial time-scale dictated by the law , the demjanjuk trial has been a long time coming .
the file of evidence against him has not changed since his identity was established in 1993 , when an israeli court cleared him of being a notorious treblinka guard called ivan the terrible .
a single identity card is the main piece of evidence : it shows that demjanjuk was indeed a guard at sobibor , probably between march and september 1943 , and therefore must have helped murder at least 27,900 people thought to have died there in that period .

but compared with other nazi trials , demjanjuk represents a completely new legal challenge . the trial of john demjanjuk , a ukrainian former prisoner-of-war turned concentration camp guard , has once again lifted the lid on questions about how the german justice system has dealt with the murderers of the holocaust .
not least among these questions is : ' why now ? '
even by the glacial time-scale dictated by the law , the demjanjuk trial has been a long time coming .
the file of evidence against him has not changed since his identity was established in 1993 , when an israeli court cleared him of being a notorious treblinka guard called ivan the terrible .
a single identity card is the main piece of evidence : it shows that demjanjuk was indeed a guard at sobibor , probably between march and september 1943 , and therefore must have helped murder at least 27,900 people thought to have died there in that period .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demjanjuk 's id is the main piece of evidence but the rest of the evidence against demjanjuk is either circumstantial or mitigating .
most of the 35 plaintiffs are simply relatives of those killed at sobibor , and the four actual survivors of the camp are too old to have a reliable memory of him or his immediate actions .
the defense lawyer ulrich busch has repeatedly argued that demjanjuk is also a victim of the nazi regime : as a ukrainian prisoner of war , demjanjuk became a trawniki - one of the many local non-germans trained as guards in the easternmost concentration camps - to avoid starvation .
why now ?
busch also asked the question ' why now ? ' in court in the first days of the trial in early december .
demjanjuk has only been legally pursued for these crimes since 2001 .
busch pointed to the trials of demjanjuk 's superiors that had resulted in acquittals - particularly that of karl streibel , a trawniki recruiter , tried in germany in 1976 and scandalously acquitted after his attorneys successfully argued that he did not know what the guards he trained would be used for .
" how can those that give the orders be innocent , when those that receive them are guilty ? "
busch asked the court .
angelika benz , a phd history student writing a thesis on the concentration camps in eastern poland , visited the first days of the demjanjuk trial and described the central difficulty in blunt terms .
" even though we know what happened at sobibor , the problem is that this crime - the holocaust - simply ca n't be dealt with by our judicial system , " benz told deutsche welle , " this becomes clear when we 're dealing with someone like demjanjuk - someone about whom we know very little . "
with so many facts missing about demjanjuk 's actions and motivations , his judges are forced to redefine the law according to the general and abstract definition of the holocaust itself .
the judges ' answer to busch 's question of how demjanjuk could be considered guilty when the man who may have trained him had been acquitted was simple - the past mistakes of the german judiciary need not be repeated .
this signal that past judgements in nazi trials are irrelevant , even flawed , is apparently necessary if any judgement can be passed on demjanjuk at all .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only the decision-makers were originally put on trial the precedents are useless the historian joerg friedrich became famous when he published two provocative books on the nazi trials in the early 1980 's - " freispruch fuer die nazi-justiz " -lrb- " acquittal for the nazi-judiciary " -rrb- and " die kalte amnestie " -lrb- " the cold amnesty " -rrb- - in which he argued that the german judiciary had failed to bring the nazi perpetrators to justice .
now he believes that the judiciary has come round to his point of view , and is attempting to correct its mistake by going after the last remaining perpetrators with new vigor .
the trial of 88- year-old heinrich boere , a dutch member of the ss , is also currently under way in aachen after decades of legal prevarication and a tireless campaign to bring him to justice .
friedrich believes that the demjanjuk trial illustrates two important developments in the german judiciary 's attitude to the holocaust .
firstly , that it is rethinking , or being forced to rethink , its definition of a holocaust perpetrator .
secondly , that it is prepared to lower the bar of required evidence in order to convict holocaust perpetrators .
but boere 's crime is much easier to define than demjanjuk 's - he is accused of , and has admitted to , three specific acts of murder .
by current german law , this is the crime that demjanjuk will have to be found guilty of if he is to be convicted - of all the crimes that demjanjuk may or may not have committed , murder is the only one that has not exceeded its time-bar limit .
germany lifted that limit on murder in the 1960 's .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinrich boere 's trial is also under way in aachen " this is a problem that judges in the 50 's , 60 's , 70 's and 80 's ignored , " friedrich told deutsche welle , " the majority of holocaust-perpetrators were seen as abetters , those that helped the murderers .
the actual murderers were always defined as hitler , himmler , eichmann - those that made the decision to instigate the holocaust - or those that showed a personal motivation in the act .
murder is not simply killing someone - you must prove intent and motivation to ensure a conviction .
the abetters were those that helped hitler , but had no motives of their own - they simply carried out their tasks . "
this narrow definition of the murderers of the holocaust appears in almost all nazi trial judgements from previous trials .
simply working in a concentration camp never convicted anyone .
but this is all that can be established beyond doubt about demjanjuk .
in order to convict him , the judges will essentially have to redefine murder for the extreme and abstract circumstances of the holocaust .
a long chain " in previous nazi trials , those that were convicted were the so-called ' concentration camp monsters ' - people who had been seen tormenting , abusing , or beating jews before their execution , " friedrich explains , " such actions were considered ' personal contributions ' , and people were convicted not of being abetters to the crime but of being co-perpetrators . "
this goes some way to explaining why so few people were convicted of holocaust crimes in germany .
according to an article in news magazine der spiegel on the legacy of german guilt , of over 100,000 investigations that were carried out in postwar germany into nazi crimes , only around 6,500 people were convicted .
thirteen death sentences were passed , 167 life sentences , and the rest received shorter prison sentences or fines .
only a fifth of those convictions were for murder .
" for the german judiciary , the holocaust only ever existed within the camp gates , " friedrich points out , " but in fact the holocaust was a long chain .
the whole of society played dumb and those that did the bloody work appeared in court . "

the defense lawyer ulrich busch has repeatedly argued that demjanjuk is also a victim of the nazi regime : as a ukrainian prisoner of war , demjanjuk became a trawniki - one of the many local non-germans trained as guards in the easternmost concentration camps - to avoid starvation .
why now ?
busch also asked the question ' why now ? ' in court in the first days of the trial in early december .
demjanjuk has only been legally pursued for these crimes since 2001 .
busch pointed to the trials of demjanjuk 's superiors that had resulted in acquittals - particularly that of karl streibel , a trawniki recruiter , tried in germany in 1976 and scandalously acquitted after his attorneys successfully argued that he did not know what the guards he trained would be used for .
" how can those that give the orders be innocent , when those that receive them are guilty ? "
busch asked the court .
angelika benz , a phd history student writing a thesis on the concentration camps in eastern poland , visited the first days of the demjanjuk trial and described the central difficulty in blunt terms .
" even though we know what happened at sobibor , the problem is that this crime - the holocaust - simply ca n't be dealt with by our judicial system , " benz told deutsche welle , " this becomes clear when we 're dealing with someone like demjanjuk - someone about whom we know very little . "
with so many facts missing about demjanjuk 's actions and motivations , his judges are forced to redefine the law according to the general and abstract definition of the holocaust itself .
the judges ' answer to busch 's question of how demjanjuk could be considered guilty when the man who may have trained him had been acquitted was simple - the past mistakes of the german judiciary need not be repeated .
this signal that past judgements in nazi trials are irrelevant , even flawed , is apparently necessary if any judgement can be passed on demjanjuk at all .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only the decision-makers were originally put on trial the precedents are useless the historian joerg friedrich became famous when he published two provocative books on the nazi trials in the early 1980 's - " freispruch fuer die nazi-justiz " -lrb- " acquittal for the nazi-judiciary " -rrb- and " die kalte amnestie " -lrb- " the cold amnesty " -rrb- - in which he argued that the german judiciary had failed to bring the nazi perpetrators to justice .
now he believes that the judiciary has come round to his point of view , and is attempting to correct its mistake by going after the last remaining perpetrators with new vigor .
the trial of 88- year-old heinrich boere , a dutch member of the ss , is also currently under way in aachen after decades of legal prevarication and a tireless campaign to bring him to justice .
friedrich believes that the demjanjuk trial illustrates two important developments in the german judiciary 's attitude to the holocaust .
firstly , that it is rethinking , or being forced to rethink , its definition of a holocaust perpetrator .
secondly , that it is prepared to lower the bar of required evidence in order to convict holocaust perpetrators .
but boere 's crime is much easier to define than demjanjuk 's - he is accused of , and has admitted to , three specific acts of murder .
by current german law , this is the crime that demjanjuk will have to be found guilty of if he is to be convicted - of all the crimes that demjanjuk may or may not have committed , murder is the only one that has not exceeded its time-bar limit .
germany lifted that limit on murder in the 1960 's .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinrich boere 's trial is also under way in aachen " this is a problem that judges in the 50 's , 60 's , 70 's and 80 's ignored , " friedrich told deutsche welle , " the majority of holocaust-perpetrators were seen as abetters , those that helped the murderers .
the actual murderers were always defined as hitler , himmler , eichmann - those that made the decision to instigate the holocaust - or those that showed a personal motivation in the act .
murder is not simply killing someone - you must prove intent and motivation to ensure a conviction .
the abetters were those that helped hitler , but had no motives of their own - they simply carried out their tasks . "
this narrow definition of the murderers of the holocaust appears in almost all nazi trial judgements from previous trials .
simply working in a concentration camp never convicted anyone .
but this is all that can be established beyond doubt about demjanjuk .
in order to convict him , the judges will essentially have to redefine murder for the extreme and abstract circumstances of the holocaust .
a long chain " in previous nazi trials , those that were convicted were the so-called ' concentration camp monsters ' - people who had been seen tormenting , abusing , or beating jews before their execution , " friedrich explains , " such actions were considered ' personal contributions ' , and people were convicted not of being abetters to the crime but of being co-perpetrators . "
this goes some way to explaining why so few people were convicted of holocaust crimes in germany .
according to an article in news magazine der spiegel on the legacy of german guilt , of over 100,000 investigations that were carried out in postwar germany into nazi crimes , only around 6,500 people were convicted .
thirteen death sentences were passed , 167 life sentences , and the rest received shorter prison sentences or fines .
only a fifth of those convictions were for murder .
" for the german judiciary , the holocaust only ever existed within the camp gates , " friedrich points out , " but in fact the holocaust was a long chain .
the whole of society played dumb and those that did the bloody work appeared in court . "

but compared with other nazi trials , demjanjuk represents a completely new legal challenge . the trial of john demjanjuk , a ukrainian former prisoner-of-war turned concentration camp guard , has once again lifted the lid on questions about how the german justice system has dealt with the murderers of the holocaust .
not least among these questions is : ' why now ? '
even by the glacial time-scale dictated by the law , the demjanjuk trial has been a long time coming .
the file of evidence against him has not changed since his identity was established in 1993 , when an israeli court cleared him of being a notorious treblinka guard called ivan the terrible .
a single identity card is the main piece of evidence : it shows that demjanjuk was indeed a guard at sobibor , probably between march and september 1943 , and therefore must have helped murder at least 27,900 people thought to have died there in that period .

the judges ' answer to busch 's question of how demjanjuk could be considered guilty when the man who may have trained him had been acquitted was simple - the past mistakes of the german judiciary need not be repeated .
this signal that past judgements in nazi trials are irrelevant , even flawed , is apparently necessary if any judgement can be passed on demjanjuk at all .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only the decision-makers were originally put on trial the precedents are useless the historian joerg friedrich became famous when he published two provocative books on the nazi trials in the early 1980 's - " freispruch fuer die nazi-justiz " -lrb- " acquittal for the nazi-judiciary " -rrb- and " die kalte amnestie " -lrb- " the cold amnesty " -rrb- - in which he argued that the german judiciary had failed to bring the nazi perpetrators to justice .
now he believes that the judiciary has come round to his point of view , and is attempting to correct its mistake by going after the last remaining perpetrators with new vigor .
the trial of 88- year-old heinrich boere , a dutch member of the ss , is also currently under way in aachen after decades of legal prevarication and a tireless campaign to bring him to justice .
friedrich believes that the demjanjuk trial illustrates two important developments in the german judiciary 's attitude to the holocaust .
firstly , that it is rethinking , or being forced to rethink , its definition of a holocaust perpetrator .
secondly , that it is prepared to lower the bar of required evidence in order to convict holocaust perpetrators .
but boere 's crime is much easier to define than demjanjuk 's - he is accused of , and has admitted to , three specific acts of murder .
by current german law , this is the crime that demjanjuk will have to be found guilty of if he is to be convicted - of all the crimes that demjanjuk may or may not have committed , murder is the only one that has not exceeded its time-bar limit .
germany lifted that limit on murder in the 1960 's .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinrich boere 's trial is also under way in aachen " this is a problem that judges in the 50 's , 60 's , 70 's and 80 's ignored , " friedrich told deutsche welle , " the majority of holocaust-perpetrators were seen as abetters , those that helped the murderers .
the actual murderers were always defined as hitler , himmler , eichmann - those that made the decision to instigate the holocaust - or those that showed a personal motivation in the act .
murder is not simply killing someone - you must prove intent and motivation to ensure a conviction .
the abetters were those that helped hitler , but had no motives of their own - they simply carried out their tasks . "
this narrow definition of the murderers of the holocaust appears in almost all nazi trial judgements from previous trials .
simply working in a concentration camp never convicted anyone .
but this is all that can be established beyond doubt about demjanjuk .
in order to convict him , the judges will essentially have to redefine murder for the extreme and abstract circumstances of the holocaust .
a long chain " in previous nazi trials , those that were convicted were the so-called ' concentration camp monsters ' - people who had been seen tormenting , abusing , or beating jews before their execution , " friedrich explains , " such actions were considered ' personal contributions ' , and people were convicted not of being abetters to the crime but of being co-perpetrators . "
this goes some way to explaining why so few people were convicted of holocaust crimes in germany .
according to an article in news magazine der spiegel on the legacy of german guilt , of over 100,000 investigations that were carried out in postwar germany into nazi crimes , only around 6,500 people were convicted .
thirteen death sentences were passed , 167 life sentences , and the rest received shorter prison sentences or fines .
only a fifth of those convictions were for murder .
" for the german judiciary , the holocaust only ever existed within the camp gates , " friedrich points out , " but in fact the holocaust was a long chain .
the whole of society played dumb and those that did the bloody work appeared in court . "

but compared with other nazi trials , demjanjuk represents a completely new legal challenge . the trial of john demjanjuk , a ukrainian former prisoner-of-war turned concentration camp guard , has once again lifted the lid on questions about how the german justice system has dealt with the murderers of the holocaust .
not least among these questions is : ' why now ? '
even by the glacial time-scale dictated by the law , the demjanjuk trial has been a long time coming .
the file of evidence against him has not changed since his identity was established in 1993 , when an israeli court cleared him of being a notorious treblinka guard called ivan the terrible .
a single identity card is the main piece of evidence : it shows that demjanjuk was indeed a guard at sobibor , probably between march and september 1943 , and therefore must have helped murder at least 27,900 people thought to have died there in that period .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demjanjuk 's id is the main piece of evidence but the rest of the evidence against demjanjuk is either circumstantial or mitigating .
most of the 35 plaintiffs are simply relatives of those killed at sobibor , and the four actual survivors of the camp are too old to have a reliable memory of him or his immediate actions .
the defense lawyer ulrich busch has repeatedly argued that demjanjuk is also a victim of the nazi regime : as a ukrainian prisoner of war , demjanjuk became a trawniki - one of the many local non-germans trained as guards in the easternmost concentration camps - to avoid starvation .
why now ?
busch also asked the question ' why now ? ' in court in the first days of the trial in early december .
demjanjuk has only been legally pursued for these crimes since 2001 .
busch pointed to the trials of demjanjuk 's superiors that had resulted in acquittals - particularly that of karl streibel , a trawniki recruiter , tried in germany in 1976 and scandalously acquitted after his attorneys successfully argued that he did not know what the guards he trained would be used for .
" how can those that give the orders be innocent , when those that receive them are guilty ? "
busch asked the court .
angelika benz , a phd history student writing a thesis on the concentration camps in eastern poland , visited the first days of the demjanjuk trial and described the central difficulty in blunt terms .
" even though we know what happened at sobibor , the problem is that this crime - the holocaust - simply ca n't be dealt with by our judicial system , " benz told deutsche welle , " this becomes clear when we 're dealing with someone like demjanjuk - someone about whom we know very little . "

but boere 's crime is much easier to define than demjanjuk 's - he is accused of , and has admitted to , three specific acts of murder .
by current german law , this is the crime that demjanjuk will have to be found guilty of if he is to be convicted - of all the crimes that demjanjuk may or may not have committed , murder is the only one that has not exceeded its time-bar limit .
germany lifted that limit on murder in the 1960 's .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinrich boere 's trial is also under way in aachen " this is a problem that judges in the 50 's , 60 's , 70 's and 80 's ignored , " friedrich told deutsche welle , " the majority of holocaust-perpetrators were seen as abetters , those that helped the murderers .
the actual murderers were always defined as hitler , himmler , eichmann - those that made the decision to instigate the holocaust - or those that showed a personal motivation in the act .
murder is not simply killing someone - you must prove intent and motivation to ensure a conviction .
the abetters were those that helped hitler , but had no motives of their own - they simply carried out their tasks . "
this narrow definition of the murderers of the holocaust appears in almost all nazi trial judgements from previous trials .
simply working in a concentration camp never convicted anyone .
but this is all that can be established beyond doubt about demjanjuk .
in order to convict him , the judges will essentially have to redefine murder for the extreme and abstract circumstances of the holocaust .
a long chain " in previous nazi trials , those that were convicted were the so-called ' concentration camp monsters ' - people who had been seen tormenting , abusing , or beating jews before their execution , " friedrich explains , " such actions were considered ' personal contributions ' , and people were convicted not of being abetters to the crime but of being co-perpetrators . "
this goes some way to explaining why so few people were convicted of holocaust crimes in germany .
according to an article in news magazine der spiegel on the legacy of german guilt , of over 100,000 investigations that were carried out in postwar germany into nazi crimes , only around 6,500 people were convicted .
thirteen death sentences were passed , 167 life sentences , and the rest received shorter prison sentences or fines .
only a fifth of those convictions were for murder .
" for the german judiciary , the holocaust only ever existed within the camp gates , " friedrich points out , " but in fact the holocaust was a long chain .
the whole of society played dumb and those that did the bloody work appeared in court . "

but compared with other nazi trials , demjanjuk represents a completely new legal challenge . the trial of john demjanjuk , a ukrainian former prisoner-of-war turned concentration camp guard , has once again lifted the lid on questions about how the german justice system has dealt with the murderers of the holocaust .
not least among these questions is : ' why now ? '
even by the glacial time-scale dictated by the law , the demjanjuk trial has been a long time coming .
the file of evidence against him has not changed since his identity was established in 1993 , when an israeli court cleared him of being a notorious treblinka guard called ivan the terrible .
a single identity card is the main piece of evidence : it shows that demjanjuk was indeed a guard at sobibor , probably between march and september 1943 , and therefore must have helped murder at least 27,900 people thought to have died there in that period .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demjanjuk 's id is the main piece of evidence but the rest of the evidence against demjanjuk is either circumstantial or mitigating .
most of the 35 plaintiffs are simply relatives of those killed at sobibor , and the four actual survivors of the camp are too old to have a reliable memory of him or his immediate actions .
the defense lawyer ulrich busch has repeatedly argued that demjanjuk is also a victim of the nazi regime : as a ukrainian prisoner of war , demjanjuk became a trawniki - one of the many local non-germans trained as guards in the easternmost concentration camps - to avoid starvation .
why now ?
busch also asked the question ' why now ? ' in court in the first days of the trial in early december .
demjanjuk has only been legally pursued for these crimes since 2001 .
busch pointed to the trials of demjanjuk 's superiors that had resulted in acquittals - particularly that of karl streibel , a trawniki recruiter , tried in germany in 1976 and scandalously acquitted after his attorneys successfully argued that he did not know what the guards he trained would be used for .
" how can those that give the orders be innocent , when those that receive them are guilty ? "
busch asked the court .
angelika benz , a phd history student writing a thesis on the concentration camps in eastern poland , visited the first days of the demjanjuk trial and described the central difficulty in blunt terms .
" even though we know what happened at sobibor , the problem is that this crime - the holocaust - simply ca n't be dealt with by our judicial system , " benz told deutsche welle , " this becomes clear when we 're dealing with someone like demjanjuk - someone about whom we know very little . "
with so many facts missing about demjanjuk 's actions and motivations , his judges are forced to redefine the law according to the general and abstract definition of the holocaust itself .
the judges ' answer to busch 's question of how demjanjuk could be considered guilty when the man who may have trained him had been acquitted was simple - the past mistakes of the german judiciary need not be repeated .
this signal that past judgements in nazi trials are irrelevant , even flawed , is apparently necessary if any judgement can be passed on demjanjuk at all .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only the decision-makers were originally put on trial the precedents are useless the historian joerg friedrich became famous when he published two provocative books on the nazi trials in the early 1980 's - " freispruch fuer die nazi-justiz " -lrb- " acquittal for the nazi-judiciary " -rrb- and " die kalte amnestie " -lrb- " the cold amnesty " -rrb- - in which he argued that the german judiciary had failed to bring the nazi perpetrators to justice .
now he believes that the judiciary has come round to his point of view , and is attempting to correct its mistake by going after the last remaining perpetrators with new vigor .
the trial of 88- year-old heinrich boere , a dutch member of the ss , is also currently under way in aachen after decades of legal prevarication and a tireless campaign to bring him to justice .
friedrich believes that the demjanjuk trial illustrates two important developments in the german judiciary 's attitude to the holocaust .
firstly , that it is rethinking , or being forced to rethink , its definition of a holocaust perpetrator .
secondly , that it is prepared to lower the bar of required evidence in order to convict holocaust perpetrators .

this goes some way to explaining why so few people were convicted of holocaust crimes in germany .
according to an article in news magazine der spiegel on the legacy of german guilt , of over 100,000 investigations that were carried out in postwar germany into nazi crimes , only around 6,500 people were convicted .
thirteen death sentences were passed , 167 life sentences , and the rest received shorter prison sentences or fines .
only a fifth of those convictions were for murder .
" for the german judiciary , the holocaust only ever existed within the camp gates , " friedrich points out , " but in fact the holocaust was a long chain .
the whole of society played dumb and those that did the bloody work appeared in court . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 21.12.2009 demjanjuk presents german law with an almost impossible problem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demjanjuk worked in the sobibor concentration camp the demjanjuk trial , which resumed monday , has offered up some awkward moral questions for the german justice system .
but compared with other nazi trials , demjanjuk represents a completely new legal challenge . the trial of john demjanjuk , a ukrainian former prisoner-of-war turned concentration camp guard , has once again lifted the lid on questions about how the german justice system has dealt with the murderers of the holocaust .
not least among these questions is : ' why now ? '
even by the glacial time-scale dictated by the law , the demjanjuk trial has been a long time coming .
the file of evidence against him has not changed since his identity was established in 1993 , when an israeli court cleared him of being a notorious treblinka guard called ivan the terrible .
a single identity card is the main piece of evidence : it shows that demjanjuk was indeed a guard at sobibor , probably between march and september 1943 , and therefore must have helped murder at least 27,900 people thought to have died there in that period .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demjanjuk 's id is the main piece of evidence but the rest of the evidence against demjanjuk is either circumstantial or mitigating .
most of the 35 plaintiffs are simply relatives of those killed at sobibor , and the four actual survivors of the camp are too old to have a reliable memory of him or his immediate actions .
the defense lawyer ulrich busch has repeatedly argued that demjanjuk is also a victim of the nazi regime : as a ukrainian prisoner of war , demjanjuk became a trawniki - one of the many local non-germans trained as guards in the easternmost concentration camps - to avoid starvation .
why now ?
busch also asked the question ' why now ? ' in court in the first days of the trial in early december .
demjanjuk has only been legally pursued for these crimes since 2001 .
busch pointed to the trials of demjanjuk 's superiors that had resulted in acquittals - particularly that of karl streibel , a trawniki recruiter , tried in germany in 1976 and scandalously acquitted after his attorneys successfully argued that he did not know what the guards he trained would be used for .
" how can those that give the orders be innocent , when those that receive them are guilty ? "
busch asked the court .
angelika benz , a phd history student writing a thesis on the concentration camps in eastern poland , visited the first days of the demjanjuk trial and described the central difficulty in blunt terms .
" even though we know what happened at sobibor , the problem is that this crime - the holocaust - simply ca n't be dealt with by our judicial system , " benz told deutsche welle , " this becomes clear when we 're dealing with someone like demjanjuk - someone about whom we know very little . "
with so many facts missing about demjanjuk 's actions and motivations , his judges are forced to redefine the law according to the general and abstract definition of the holocaust itself .
the judges ' answer to busch 's question of how demjanjuk could be considered guilty when the man who may have trained him had been acquitted was simple - the past mistakes of the german judiciary need not be repeated .
this signal that past judgements in nazi trials are irrelevant , even flawed , is apparently necessary if any judgement can be passed on demjanjuk at all .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only the decision-makers were originally put on trial the precedents are useless the historian joerg friedrich became famous when he published two provocative books on the nazi trials in the early 1980 's - " freispruch fuer die nazi-justiz " -lrb- " acquittal for the nazi-judiciary " -rrb- and " die kalte amnestie " -lrb- " the cold amnesty " -rrb- - in which he argued that the german judiciary had failed to bring the nazi perpetrators to justice .
now he believes that the judiciary has come round to his point of view , and is attempting to correct its mistake by going after the last remaining perpetrators with new vigor .
the trial of 88- year-old heinrich boere , a dutch member of the ss , is also currently under way in aachen after decades of legal prevarication and a tireless campaign to bring him to justice .
friedrich believes that the demjanjuk trial illustrates two important developments in the german judiciary 's attitude to the holocaust .
firstly , that it is rethinking , or being forced to rethink , its definition of a holocaust perpetrator .
secondly , that it is prepared to lower the bar of required evidence in order to convict holocaust perpetrators .
but boere 's crime is much easier to define than demjanjuk 's - he is accused of , and has admitted to , three specific acts of murder .
by current german law , this is the crime that demjanjuk will have to be found guilty of if he is to be convicted - of all the crimes that demjanjuk may or may not have committed , murder is the only one that has not exceeded its time-bar limit .
germany lifted that limit on murder in the 1960 's .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinrich boere 's trial is also under way in aachen " this is a problem that judges in the 50 's , 60 's , 70 's and 80 's ignored , " friedrich told deutsche welle , " the majority of holocaust-perpetrators were seen as abetters , those that helped the murderers .
the actual murderers were always defined as hitler , himmler , eichmann - those that made the decision to instigate the holocaust - or those that showed a personal motivation in the act .
murder is not simply killing someone - you must prove intent and motivation to ensure a conviction .
the abetters were those that helped hitler , but had no motives of their own - they simply carried out their tasks . "
this narrow definition of the murderers of the holocaust appears in almost all nazi trial judgements from previous trials .
simply working in a concentration camp never convicted anyone .
but this is all that can be established beyond doubt about demjanjuk .
in order to convict him , the judges will essentially have to redefine murder for the extreme and abstract circumstances of the holocaust .
a long chain " in previous nazi trials , those that were convicted were the so-called ' concentration camp monsters ' - people who had been seen tormenting , abusing , or beating jews before their execution , " friedrich explains , " such actions were considered ' personal contributions ' , and people were convicted not of being abetters to the crime but of being co-perpetrators .

three companies now face huge fines for price fixing , with more investigations underway . bosses from coffee companies tchibo , melitta and dallmayr worked together to keep their prices artificially high , a competition watchdog has ruled . germany 's cartel office has imposed fines amounting to almost 159.5 million euros against the coffee producers .
the fine is against the three coffee roasters and six employees who were deemed to be responsible .
there were several price fixes from the beginning of 2000 until the company was investigated in july 2008 .
the bonn-based cartel office said that a circle of company leaders and sales bosses had met to fix prices on products that included coffee beans , espresso coffee and ordinary filter coffee .

three companies now face huge fines for price fixing , with more investigations underway . bosses from coffee companies tchibo , melitta and dallmayr worked together to keep their prices artificially high , a competition watchdog has ruled . germany 's cartel office has imposed fines amounting to almost 159.5 million euros against the coffee producers .
the fine is against the three coffee roasters and six employees who were deemed to be responsible .
there were several price fixes from the beginning of 2000 until the company was investigated in july 2008 .
the bonn-based cartel office said that a circle of company leaders and sales bosses had met to fix prices on products that included coffee beans , espresso coffee and ordinary filter coffee .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : espresso coffee was one of the products that were made more expensive dates and periods as well as the scope and level of the price rises were agreed upon .
five price hikes were set up between 2003 and 2008 .
the effect of just two of these increases - in winter 2004 and spring 2005 - led to an average price increase of a euro on a 500g pack of coffee .
melitta coffee spokeswoman anette kahre said the firm would appeal against the fine and that it had cooperated fully with authorities in the investigation .
the company also regretted what had happened , kahre added , and it had " made arrangements for such a thing not to happen again . "
" fine is completely excessive " dallmayr said the fine was " completely excessive " and that taking into account tax , german coffee was the best value in europe .
there was no comment from tchibo , although it did confirm the amount of the fine .
the cartel office said that the fines were still not legally binding and that the companies had an opportunity to put forward objections .
it added that further investigations were also taking place into numerous coffee producers , including cappuccino producers , and are expected to be completed in the first half of 2010. rc / afp / dpa editor : ranty islam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is investing heavily in africa 's mining industry most of the criticism surrounding china 's involvement in africa debate has been on the working conditions of the miners who are subjected to low wages and questionable safety procedures .
the incident at chambishi mine in zambia in april 2005 drew attention to this .
but as professor helmut asche , director of the institute for african studies at the university of leipzig , notes these conditions are no different from those that miners in northern china are subjected to .
since beijing is unable to control the working conditions of its citizens , african governments are responsible for exerting effective control over chinese investors so that they implement fair wages and adequate safety procedures .
benefits , implications of chinese investment china 's african policy states that it intends to be africa 's equal -lrb- economic -rrb- partner .
experts like he wenping , director of the institute of west-asian and african studies at the chinese academy of social science in beijing , say that china 's goals in africa are more political than economic .
according to asche , a change in china 's africa foreign policy began after the tiananmen square massacre when china needed more foreign allies .
china 's current african partners , who are in the group of 77 , provide it with more influence in the united nations .
asche feels that the import of cheap goods from china can have very different effects as is the case with the south african textile industry and the ethiopian footwear industry .
the protection of local industry in south africa meant that the manufacturers did not modernize their techniques in order to be able to compete successfully with the chinese imports .
on the other hand , in ethiopia where the local footwear manufacturing industry was not protected , production became more competitive and now ethiopia is exporting footwear to china .
zambians often say that " you thank the person who guides you at night when it is dawn . "
the relationship between china and africa is still in its infancy , but as asche told deutsche welle " it is crystal clear -lsb- … -rsb- in scientific research that the chinese investment in all its facets is positive for africa . "
he goes onto say that current investment is doing more to strengthen economies than democracy and good governance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is helping africa develop its infrastructure .
the chinese news agency xinhua estimates that there are currently one million chinese immigrants in africa .
their growing presence is more often than not unwelcome as is shown by attacks on immigrants in nigeria and angola .
most zambians complain that the chinese community isolates itself .
chinese immigrants have not been as successful as indians or other immigrants in integrating in africa , however asche says that both locals and immigrants are responsible for the integration of the chinese migrants .
the role of germany and europe asche feels that germany should do more to get involved in africa : " … the german investors should -lsb- … -rsb- be encouraged to become as courageous as the chinese are .
it is a crystal clear fact that china and its investors and not only the state-owned companies but also private investors see the african market a lot more positive than do quite a number of investors from european countries , and the germans are certainly not among the most courageous . "
in addition to those fears , asche attributes the lack of increased trade between the two continents to the european union 's trade policy , which does not treat africa as an equal partner as china does : “ -lsb- eu trade policy -rsb- is a good example of how not to deal with partner countries and by way of comparison china all of a sudden stands out as , trade policy-wise , a fair partner to africa in comparison with the eu . "
asche says that the growing trade between china and africa is " an irreversible expression of the new multi-polar world , and european powers -lsb- … -rsb- simply have to learn to live in this multi-polar environment in which there is no longer an exclusive relationship between the eu , the us and africa . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 21.12.2009 demjanjuk presents german law with an almost impossible problem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demjanjuk worked in the sobibor concentration camp the demjanjuk trial , which resumed monday , has offered up some awkward moral questions for the german justice system .
but compared with other nazi trials , demjanjuk represents a completely new legal challenge . the trial of john demjanjuk , a ukrainian former prisoner-of-war turned concentration camp guard , has once again lifted the lid on questions about how the german justice system has dealt with the murderers of the holocaust .
not least among these questions is : ' why now ? '
even by the glacial time-scale dictated by the law , the demjanjuk trial has been a long time coming .
the file of evidence against him has not changed since his identity was established in 1993 , when an israeli court cleared him of being a notorious treblinka guard called ivan the terrible .
a single identity card is the main piece of evidence : it shows that demjanjuk was indeed a guard at sobibor , probably between march and september 1943 , and therefore must have helped murder at least 27,900 people thought to have died there in that period .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demjanjuk 's id is the main piece of evidence but the rest of the evidence against demjanjuk is either circumstantial or mitigating .
most of the 35 plaintiffs are simply relatives of those killed at sobibor , and the four actual survivors of the camp are too old to have a reliable memory of him or his immediate actions .
the defense lawyer ulrich busch has repeatedly argued that demjanjuk is also a victim of the nazi regime : as a ukrainian prisoner of war , demjanjuk became a trawniki - one of the many local non-germans trained as guards in the easternmost concentration camps - to avoid starvation .
why now ?
busch also asked the question ' why now ? ' in court in the first days of the trial in early december .
demjanjuk has only been legally pursued for these crimes since 2001 .
busch pointed to the trials of demjanjuk 's superiors that had resulted in acquittals - particularly that of karl streibel , a trawniki recruiter , tried in germany in 1976 and scandalously acquitted after his attorneys successfully argued that he did not know what the guards he trained would be used for .
" how can those that give the orders be innocent , when those that receive them are guilty ? "
busch asked the court .
angelika benz , a phd history student writing a thesis on the concentration camps in eastern poland , visited the first days of the demjanjuk trial and described the central difficulty in blunt terms .
" even though we know what happened at sobibor , the problem is that this crime - the holocaust - simply ca n't be dealt with by our judicial system , " benz told deutsche welle , " this becomes clear when we 're dealing with someone like demjanjuk - someone about whom we know very little . "
with so many facts missing about demjanjuk 's actions and motivations , his judges are forced to redefine the law according to the general and abstract definition of the holocaust itself .
the judges ' answer to busch 's question of how demjanjuk could be considered guilty when the man who may have trained him had been acquitted was simple - the past mistakes of the german judiciary need not be repeated .
this signal that past judgements in nazi trials are irrelevant , even flawed , is apparently necessary if any judgement can be passed on demjanjuk at all .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only the decision-makers were originally put on trial the precedents are useless the historian joerg friedrich became famous when he published two provocative books on the nazi trials in the early 1980 's - " freispruch fuer die nazi-justiz " -lrb- " acquittal for the nazi-judiciary " -rrb- and " die kalte amnestie " -lrb- " the cold amnesty " -rrb- - in which he argued that the german judiciary had failed to bring the nazi perpetrators to justice .
now he believes that the judiciary has come round to his point of view , and is attempting to correct its mistake by going after the last remaining perpetrators with new vigor .
the trial of 88- year-old heinrich boere , a dutch member of the ss , is also currently under way in aachen after decades of legal prevarication and a tireless campaign to bring him to justice .
friedrich believes that the demjanjuk trial illustrates two important developments in the german judiciary 's attitude to the holocaust .
firstly , that it is rethinking , or being forced to rethink , its definition of a holocaust perpetrator .
secondly , that it is prepared to lower the bar of required evidence in order to convict holocaust perpetrators .
but boere 's crime is much easier to define than demjanjuk 's - he is accused of , and has admitted to , three specific acts of murder .
by current german law , this is the crime that demjanjuk will have to be found guilty of if he is to be convicted - of all the crimes that demjanjuk may or may not have committed , murder is the only one that has not exceeded its time-bar limit .
germany lifted that limit on murder in the 1960 's .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinrich boere 's trial is also under way in aachen " this is a problem that judges in the 50 's , 60 's , 70 's and 80 's ignored , " friedrich told deutsche welle , " the majority of holocaust-perpetrators were seen as abetters , those that helped the murderers .
the actual murderers were always defined as hitler , himmler , eichmann - those that made the decision to instigate the holocaust - or those that showed a personal motivation in the act .
murder is not simply killing someone - you must prove intent and motivation to ensure a conviction .
the abetters were those that helped hitler , but had no motives of their own - they simply carried out their tasks . "
this narrow definition of the murderers of the holocaust appears in almost all nazi trial judgements from previous trials .
simply working in a concentration camp never convicted anyone .
but this is all that can be established beyond doubt about demjanjuk .
in order to convict him , the judges will essentially have to redefine murder for the extreme and abstract circumstances of the holocaust .
a long chain " in previous nazi trials , those that were convicted were the so-called ' concentration camp monsters ' - people who had been seen tormenting , abusing , or beating jews before their execution , " friedrich explains , " such actions were considered ' personal contributions ' , and people were convicted not of being abetters to the crime but of being co-perpetrators . "
this goes some way to explaining why so few people were convicted of holocaust crimes in germany .
according to an article in news magazine der spiegel on the legacy of german guilt , of over 100,000 investigations that were carried out in postwar germany into nazi crimes , only around 6,500 people were convicted .
thirteen death sentences were passed , 167 life sentences , and the rest received shorter prison sentences or fines .
only a fifth of those convictions were for murder .
" for the german judiciary , the holocaust only ever existed within the camp gates , " friedrich points out , " but in fact the holocaust was a long chain .
the whole of society played dumb and those that did the bloody work appeared in court . "

" even though we know what happened at sobibor , the problem is that this crime - the holocaust - simply ca n't be dealt with by our judicial system , " benz told deutsche welle , " this becomes clear when we 're dealing with someone like demjanjuk - someone about whom we know very little . "
with so many facts missing about demjanjuk 's actions and motivations , his judges are forced to redefine the law according to the general and abstract definition of the holocaust itself .
the judges ' answer to busch 's question of how demjanjuk could be considered guilty when the man who may have trained him had been acquitted was simple - the past mistakes of the german judiciary need not be repeated .
this signal that past judgements in nazi trials are irrelevant , even flawed , is apparently necessary if any judgement can be passed on demjanjuk at all .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only the decision-makers were originally put on trial the precedents are useless the historian joerg friedrich became famous when he published two provocative books on the nazi trials in the early 1980 's - " freispruch fuer die nazi-justiz " -lrb- " acquittal for the nazi-judiciary " -rrb- and " die kalte amnestie " -lrb- " the cold amnesty " -rrb- - in which he argued that the german judiciary had failed to bring the nazi perpetrators to justice .
now he believes that the judiciary has come round to his point of view , and is attempting to correct its mistake by going after the last remaining perpetrators with new vigor .
the trial of 88- year-old heinrich boere , a dutch member of the ss , is also currently under way in aachen after decades of legal prevarication and a tireless campaign to bring him to justice .
friedrich believes that the demjanjuk trial illustrates two important developments in the german judiciary 's attitude to the holocaust .
firstly , that it is rethinking , or being forced to rethink , its definition of a holocaust perpetrator .
secondly , that it is prepared to lower the bar of required evidence in order to convict holocaust perpetrators .
but boere 's crime is much easier to define than demjanjuk 's - he is accused of , and has admitted to , three specific acts of murder .
by current german law , this is the crime that demjanjuk will have to be found guilty of if he is to be convicted - of all the crimes that demjanjuk may or may not have committed , murder is the only one that has not exceeded its time-bar limit .
germany lifted that limit on murder in the 1960 's .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinrich boere 's trial is also under way in aachen " this is a problem that judges in the 50 's , 60 's , 70 's and 80 's ignored , " friedrich told deutsche welle , " the majority of holocaust-perpetrators were seen as abetters , those that helped the murderers .
the actual murderers were always defined as hitler , himmler , eichmann - those that made the decision to instigate the holocaust - or those that showed a personal motivation in the act .
murder is not simply killing someone - you must prove intent and motivation to ensure a conviction .
the abetters were those that helped hitler , but had no motives of their own - they simply carried out their tasks . "
this narrow definition of the murderers of the holocaust appears in almost all nazi trial judgements from previous trials .
simply working in a concentration camp never convicted anyone .
but this is all that can be established beyond doubt about demjanjuk .
in order to convict him , the judges will essentially have to redefine murder for the extreme and abstract circumstances of the holocaust .
a long chain " in previous nazi trials , those that were convicted were the so-called ' concentration camp monsters ' - people who had been seen tormenting , abusing , or beating jews before their execution , " friedrich explains , " such actions were considered ' personal contributions ' , and people were convicted not of being abetters to the crime but of being co-perpetrators . "
this goes some way to explaining why so few people were convicted of holocaust crimes in germany .
according to an article in news magazine der spiegel on the legacy of german guilt , of over 100,000 investigations that were carried out in postwar germany into nazi crimes , only around 6,500 people were convicted .
thirteen death sentences were passed , 167 life sentences , and the rest received shorter prison sentences or fines .
only a fifth of those convictions were for murder .
" for the german judiciary , the holocaust only ever existed within the camp gates , " friedrich points out , " but in fact the holocaust was a long chain .
the whole of society played dumb and those that did the bloody work appeared in court . "

china has been investing heavily in the african market and is keen to stress the benefits to local businesses .
is that involvement an opportunity or a risk to africa ’ s development and is europe being left behind ? on the copperbelt in zambia , investment in luanshya mine by china 's non-ferrous meter mining group corporation -lrb- nfca -rrb- has been welcomed by locals .
a veteran of the mining industry who wanted to remain anonymous told deutsche welle that " -lsb- s -rsb- o far -lsb- the chinese investors -rsb- are good guys because they are putting -lsb- in -rsb- a lot of money before production starts . "
for a small town whose future appeared bleak when mining production was shut down , the creation of an estimated 3,000 jobs is good news .
the warm welcome of chinese investment in luanshya is in stark contrast to the anti-chinese sentiment in a town less than an hour away .
the memory of a mine explosion that left 46 dead still lingers in chambeshi .
for many , graves located close to the mine are a daily reminder of the deaths of a colleague or loved one .
more than four years after the incident , the community remains ambivalent about the reopening of the plant where the explosion occurred even if it will bring many jobs to the area .
some still feel that their chinese employers are to blame for the incident .
mukuka chilufya , a safety officer who participated in rescue operations following the explosion , told deutsche welle that " maybe they could have received a bulk order and they were running out of time .
so the night shift that were involved in the male dyke collided with the day shift that were involved in the female dyke .
in fact , what is going to confirm that is that the chinese who were knowledgeable of the consequences all were not in the factory when the explosion took place because they knew that something like that could happen . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is investing heavily in africa 's mining industry most of the criticism surrounding china 's involvement in africa debate has been on the working conditions of the miners who are subjected to low wages and questionable safety procedures .
the incident at chambishi mine in zambia in april 2005 drew attention to this .
but as professor helmut asche , director of the institute for african studies at the university of leipzig , notes these conditions are no different from those that miners in northern china are subjected to .
since beijing is unable to control the working conditions of its citizens , african governments are responsible for exerting effective control over chinese investors so that they implement fair wages and adequate safety procedures .
benefits , implications of chinese investment china 's african policy states that it intends to be africa 's equal -lrb- economic -rrb- partner .
experts like he wenping , director of the institute of west-asian and african studies at the chinese academy of social science in beijing , say that china 's goals in africa are more political than economic .
according to asche , a change in china 's africa foreign policy began after the tiananmen square massacre when china needed more foreign allies .
china 's current african partners , who are in the group of 77 , provide it with more influence in the united nations .
asche feels that the import of cheap goods from china can have very different effects as is the case with the south african textile industry and the ethiopian footwear industry .
the protection of local industry in south africa meant that the manufacturers did not modernize their techniques in order to be able to compete successfully with the chinese imports .
on the other hand , in ethiopia where the local footwear manufacturing industry was not protected , production became more competitive and now ethiopia is exporting footwear to china .
zambians often say that " you thank the person who guides you at night when it is dawn . "
the relationship between china and africa is still in its infancy , but as asche told deutsche welle " it is crystal clear -lsb- … -rsb- in scientific research that the chinese investment in all its facets is positive for africa . "
he goes onto say that current investment is doing more to strengthen economies than democracy and good governance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is helping africa develop its infrastructure .
the chinese news agency xinhua estimates that there are currently one million chinese immigrants in africa .
their growing presence is more often than not unwelcome as is shown by attacks on immigrants in nigeria and angola .
most zambians complain that the chinese community isolates itself .
chinese immigrants have not been as successful as indians or other immigrants in integrating in africa , however asche says that both locals and immigrants are responsible for the integration of the chinese migrants .
the role of germany and europe asche feels that germany should do more to get involved in africa : " … the german investors should -lsb- … -rsb- be encouraged to become as courageous as the chinese are .
it is a crystal clear fact that china and its investors and not only the state-owned companies but also private investors see the african market a lot more positive than do quite a number of investors from european countries , and the germans are certainly not among the most courageous . "
in addition to those fears , asche attributes the lack of increased trade between the two continents to the european union 's trade policy , which does not treat africa as an equal partner as china does : “ -lsb- eu trade policy -rsb- is a good example of how not to deal with partner countries and by way of comparison china all of a sudden stands out as , trade policy-wise , a fair partner to africa in comparison with the eu . "
asche says that the growing trade between china and africa is " an irreversible expression of the new multi-polar world , and european powers -lsb- … -rsb- simply have to learn to live in this multi-polar environment in which there is no longer an exclusive relationship between the eu , the us and africa . "

the thieves had cut the sign into three pieces . police in krakow , southern poland , told reporters on monday it was too early to tell what the motive behind the theft of the auschwitz sign really was .
however , the five suspects arrested when the sign was recovered are not members of a neo-nazi group .
the men do have criminal records for either violence or theft . " we can say that none of the five are members of a neo-nazi group , " andrzej rokita , district police chief in the city of krakow , told a news conference .
" their intent was undoubtedly robbery related .
we will be able to decide later whether the crime was ordered or whether they acted on their own initiative . " the five men , aged 20 to 39 , are believed to have stolen the infamous " arbeit macht frei " sign , which hung over the entrance to the nazi death camp auschwitz , at dawn on friday .
police recovered the sign , cut into three pieces , near the home of one of the suspects . " the sign had been cut into three pieces at the site of the theft , to make it easier to transport .
it had been hidden in a wood near the home of one of the thieves , " rokita said . when intact , the sign was five meters long .
its cynical message " work sets you free " became a symbol of the efforts of the nazis to deceive their victims .
over a million people , mostly jews , perished in the nazi death camp in southern poland during world war two - most of the site became a museum and memorial after the war ended . intensive search the five alleged thieves were captured after poland stepped up border security , set up roadblocks , deployed a team of around 40 forensic experts and sought the help of international policing bodies interpol and europol in a bid to recover the sign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the museum soon put this image right , hanging a replica sign on the gates as an interim solution the auschwitz museum offered a 100,000-zloty reward -lrb- 24,000 euros or $ 34,000 -rrb- for information which would help to recapture the sign , and polish police offered a further 5,000 zlotys . friday 's theft sparked condemnation from world leaders , jewish groups and holocaust survivors . " a worldwide symbol of the cynicism of hitler 's executioners and the martyrdom of their victims has been stolen , " polish president lech kaczynski said after the theft . auschwitz , visited by one million people last year , was one of a network of camps set up to kill some 6 million jews , along with members of other ethnic , religious , political , or social groups that hitler 's regime wanted to eliminate . msh / afp / ap / reuters editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the spyker leadership has submitted a renewed offer in the hopes of securing a future for saab , its employees and the brand - despite the announcement that the winding down of saab would begin , " the company said in a statement . spyker said it hoped " the renewed offer would remove each of the obstacles that were standing in the way of a swift transaction . "
the company 's chief executive , victor muller , said its revised bid included an 11-point proposal addressing issues that arose during the due diligence process . " we have made every effort to resolve the issues that were preventing the conclusion of this matter and we have asked gm and all other involved parties to seriously consider this offer , " said muller .
he added that the new offer eliminates the need for loan approval by the european investment bank -lrb- eib -rrb- prior to year end , which would allow the deal to be concluded within gm 's original december 31 deadline . while muller did not reveal any details about the financing of the new offer , he said spyker 's bid would remain valid until 11pm central european time -lrb- 5pm eastern time -rrb- on monday . several suitors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so far only small carmakers have shown real interest in acquiring saab on its website , general motors said it had received inquiries from several potential bidders since friday 's announcement that it would start the orderly closure of saab . " we will evaluate each inquiry .
we will not comment further until these evaluations have been completed , " gm said in a statement .
the head of sweden 's influential if metall union urged gm to seriously consider the renewed bid for saab , which employs about 3,400 people in sweden . " i understand the frustration felt by everyone who is dependent on saab : to be thrown between hope and despair is terrible .
gm must now respond with a serious examination of the new bid , " union chairman stefan loefven said . swedish media report that the closure of saab could lead to more than 8,000 job losses , including subcontractors and others dependent on the carmaker .
the company 's global distribution network is comprised of 1,100 dealerships . gm has been trying to sell the unit since the start of the year .
swedish luxury carmaker koenigsegg , which builds around 18 high-end sports cars a year , pulled out of a deal to buy saab last month , citing costly delays . like koenigsegg , spyker is also a premium niche manufacturer .
in 2008 , it sold just 37 cars worldwide with prices starting at 200,000 euros -lrb- $ 290,000 -rrb- . saab sold just over 93,000 cars last year .

the thieves had cut the sign into three pieces . police in krakow , southern poland , told reporters on monday it was too early to tell what the motive behind the theft of the auschwitz sign really was .
however , the five suspects arrested when the sign was recovered are not members of a neo-nazi group .
the men do have criminal records for either violence or theft . " we can say that none of the five are members of a neo-nazi group , " andrzej rokita , district police chief in the city of krakow , told a news conference .
" their intent was undoubtedly robbery related .
we will be able to decide later whether the crime was ordered or whether they acted on their own initiative . " the five men , aged 20 to 39 , are believed to have stolen the infamous " arbeit macht frei " sign , which hung over the entrance to the nazi death camp auschwitz , at dawn on friday .
police recovered the sign , cut into three pieces , near the home of one of the suspects . " the sign had been cut into three pieces at the site of the theft , to make it easier to transport .
it had been hidden in a wood near the home of one of the thieves , " rokita said . when intact , the sign was five meters long .
its cynical message " work sets you free " became a symbol of the efforts of the nazis to deceive their victims .
over a million people , mostly jews , perished in the nazi death camp in southern poland during world war two - most of the site became a museum and memorial after the war ended . intensive search the five alleged thieves were captured after poland stepped up border security , set up roadblocks , deployed a team of around 40 forensic experts and sought the help of international policing bodies interpol and europol in a bid to recover the sign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the museum soon put this image right , hanging a replica sign on the gates as an interim solution the auschwitz museum offered a 100,000-zloty reward -lrb- 24,000 euros or $ 34,000 -rrb- for information which would help to recapture the sign , and polish police offered a further 5,000 zlotys . friday 's theft sparked condemnation from world leaders , jewish groups and holocaust survivors .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 21.12.2009 demjanjuk presents german law with an almost impossible problem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demjanjuk worked in the sobibor concentration camp the demjanjuk trial , which resumed monday , has offered up some awkward moral questions for the german justice system .
but compared with other nazi trials , demjanjuk represents a completely new legal challenge . the trial of john demjanjuk , a ukrainian former prisoner-of-war turned concentration camp guard , has once again lifted the lid on questions about how the german justice system has dealt with the murderers of the holocaust .
not least among these questions is : ' why now ? '
even by the glacial time-scale dictated by the law , the demjanjuk trial has been a long time coming .
the file of evidence against him has not changed since his identity was established in 1993 , when an israeli court cleared him of being a notorious treblinka guard called ivan the terrible .
a single identity card is the main piece of evidence : it shows that demjanjuk was indeed a guard at sobibor , probably between march and september 1943 , and therefore must have helped murder at least 27,900 people thought to have died there in that period .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demjanjuk 's id is the main piece of evidence but the rest of the evidence against demjanjuk is either circumstantial or mitigating .
most of the 35 plaintiffs are simply relatives of those killed at sobibor , and the four actual survivors of the camp are too old to have a reliable memory of him or his immediate actions .
the defense lawyer ulrich busch has repeatedly argued that demjanjuk is also a victim of the nazi regime : as a ukrainian prisoner of war , demjanjuk became a trawniki - one of the many local non-germans trained as guards in the easternmost concentration camps - to avoid starvation .
why now ?
busch also asked the question ' why now ? ' in court in the first days of the trial in early december .
demjanjuk has only been legally pursued for these crimes since 2001 .
busch pointed to the trials of demjanjuk 's superiors that had resulted in acquittals - particularly that of karl streibel , a trawniki recruiter , tried in germany in 1976 and scandalously acquitted after his attorneys successfully argued that he did not know what the guards he trained would be used for .
" how can those that give the orders be innocent , when those that receive them are guilty ? "
busch asked the court .
angelika benz , a phd history student writing a thesis on the concentration camps in eastern poland , visited the first days of the demjanjuk trial and described the central difficulty in blunt terms .
" even though we know what happened at sobibor , the problem is that this crime - the holocaust - simply ca n't be dealt with by our judicial system , " benz told deutsche welle , " this becomes clear when we 're dealing with someone like demjanjuk - someone about whom we know very little . "
with so many facts missing about demjanjuk 's actions and motivations , his judges are forced to redefine the law according to the general and abstract definition of the holocaust itself .
the judges ' answer to busch 's question of how demjanjuk could be considered guilty when the man who may have trained him had been acquitted was simple - the past mistakes of the german judiciary need not be repeated .
this signal that past judgements in nazi trials are irrelevant , even flawed , is apparently necessary if any judgement can be passed on demjanjuk at all .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only the decision-makers were originally put on trial the precedents are useless the historian joerg friedrich became famous when he published two provocative books on the nazi trials in the early 1980 's - " freispruch fuer die nazi-justiz " -lrb- " acquittal for the nazi-judiciary " -rrb- and " die kalte amnestie " -lrb- " the cold amnesty " -rrb- - in which he argued that the german judiciary had failed to bring the nazi perpetrators to justice .
now he believes that the judiciary has come round to his point of view , and is attempting to correct its mistake by going after the last remaining perpetrators with new vigor .
the trial of 88- year-old heinrich boere , a dutch member of the ss , is also currently under way in aachen after decades of legal prevarication and a tireless campaign to bring him to justice .
friedrich believes that the demjanjuk trial illustrates two important developments in the german judiciary 's attitude to the holocaust .
firstly , that it is rethinking , or being forced to rethink , its definition of a holocaust perpetrator .
secondly , that it is prepared to lower the bar of required evidence in order to convict holocaust perpetrators .
but boere 's crime is much easier to define than demjanjuk 's - he is accused of , and has admitted to , three specific acts of murder .
by current german law , this is the crime that demjanjuk will have to be found guilty of if he is to be convicted - of all the crimes that demjanjuk may or may not have committed , murder is the only one that has not exceeded its time-bar limit .
germany lifted that limit on murder in the 1960 's .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinrich boere 's trial is also under way in aachen " this is a problem that judges in the 50 's , 60 's , 70 's and 80 's ignored , " friedrich told deutsche welle , " the majority of holocaust-perpetrators were seen as abetters , those that helped the murderers .
the actual murderers were always defined as hitler , himmler , eichmann - those that made the decision to instigate the holocaust - or those that showed a personal motivation in the act .
murder is not simply killing someone - you must prove intent and motivation to ensure a conviction .
the abetters were those that helped hitler , but had no motives of their own - they simply carried out their tasks . "
this narrow definition of the murderers of the holocaust appears in almost all nazi trial judgements from previous trials .
simply working in a concentration camp never convicted anyone .
but this is all that can be established beyond doubt about demjanjuk .
in order to convict him , the judges will essentially have to redefine murder for the extreme and abstract circumstances of the holocaust .
a long chain " in previous nazi trials , those that were convicted were the so-called ' concentration camp monsters ' - people who had been seen tormenting , abusing , or beating jews before their execution , " friedrich explains , " such actions were considered ' personal contributions ' , and people were convicted not of being abetters to the crime but of being co-perpetrators . "
this goes some way to explaining why so few people were convicted of holocaust crimes in germany .
according to an article in news magazine der spiegel on the legacy of german guilt , of over 100,000 investigations that were carried out in postwar germany into nazi crimes , only around 6,500 people were convicted .
thirteen death sentences were passed , 167 life sentences , and the rest received shorter prison sentences or fines .
only a fifth of those convictions were for murder .
" for the german judiciary , the holocaust only ever existed within the camp gates , " friedrich points out , " but in fact the holocaust was a long chain .
the whole of society played dumb and those that did the bloody work appeared in court . "

but where will the army turn its attention now ?
many militants who left south waziristan during the military onslaught are believed to be hiding in other tribal agencies , including north waziristan and orakzai .
and as the prime minister has said that orakzai will be the next target , thousands of refugees have already begun to flee the area . the prime minister of pakistan , syed yusuf raza gillani recently hinted that the army might shift its focus to orakzai , southwest of peshawar , after having successfully completed the previous anti-taliban operations in swat and , most recently , south waziristan .
a large number of people have already been shifted from orakzai to the neighbouring districts of hangu and kohat , although there has been no official announcement of the military operation .
up to 80,000 refugees expected manuel bessler , head of the un office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs in islamabad , said , " we have about 40,000 individuals that were displaced during the recent upsurge of the fighting in the orakzai agency .
we expect up to 80,000 displaced people .
it depends very much on the course of the military operations , how extensive they are , how long they continue . "
so far , no formal registration has taken place but discussions are currently going on to start formal registration for the internally displaced persons from orakzai agency in the coming days .
work for the united nations and other humanitarian agencies in orakzai will not be easy .
" the challenges are several and quite difficult ones " , manuel bessler said .
" first of all it is access to go to the area .
it 's not impossible but it 's more difficult .
we have to be in close contact with the local authorities .
we have to constantly monitor the security situation , so access is the first challenge .
secondly , we have to have appropriate sites where we can host displaced people .
this is a challenge in terms of logistics and has , of course , to be closely coordinated with the district authorities . "
preparations under way the united nations already had to assist a large number of displaced people in pakistan earlier this year .
mr bessler said this makes its task easier in certain ways : " the humanitarian community consisting of un , un agencies but also quite importantly of international and national non-governmental organizations -lrb- ngos -rrb- has worked in the country for quite a while , and had to cope with the huge displacement crisis in summer of this year from the malakand division , where we had -lrb- around end of may - june -rrb- 2.7 million displaced people .
we are quite well prepared .
there are stocks available of relief item : tents , mattresses , kitchen sets , quilts . "
as the government of pakistan is heading to a new war front to eradicate militancy , observers say the relief and rehabilition of idps must not be ignored .
otherwise , many might easily be recruited by militants .

and as the prime minister has said that orakzai will be the next target , thousands of refugees have already begun to flee the area . the prime minister of pakistan , syed yusuf raza gillani recently hinted that the army might shift its focus to orakzai , southwest of peshawar , after having successfully completed the previous anti-taliban operations in swat and , most recently , south waziristan .
a large number of people have already been shifted from orakzai to the neighbouring districts of hangu and kohat , although there has been no official announcement of the military operation .
up to 80,000 refugees expected manuel bessler , head of the un office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs in islamabad , said , " we have about 40,000 individuals that were displaced during the recent upsurge of the fighting in the orakzai agency .
we expect up to 80,000 displaced people .
it depends very much on the course of the military operations , how extensive they are , how long they continue . "
so far , no formal registration has taken place but discussions are currently going on to start formal registration for the internally displaced persons from orakzai agency in the coming days .
work for the united nations and other humanitarian agencies in orakzai will not be easy .
" the challenges are several and quite difficult ones " , manuel bessler said .
" first of all it is access to go to the area .
it 's not impossible but it 's more difficult .
we have to be in close contact with the local authorities .
we have to constantly monitor the security situation , so access is the first challenge .
secondly , we have to have appropriate sites where we can host displaced people .
this is a challenge in terms of logistics and has , of course , to be closely coordinated with the district authorities . "
preparations under way the united nations already had to assist a large number of displaced people in pakistan earlier this year .
mr bessler said this makes its task easier in certain ways : " the humanitarian community consisting of un , un agencies but also quite importantly of international and national non-governmental organizations -lrb- ngos -rrb- has worked in the country for quite a while , and had to cope with the huge displacement crisis in summer of this year from the malakand division , where we had -lrb- around end of may - june -rrb- 2.7 million displaced people .
we are quite well prepared .
there are stocks available of relief item : tents , mattresses , kitchen sets , quilts . "
as the government of pakistan is heading to a new war front to eradicate militancy , observers say the relief and rehabilition of idps must not be ignored .
otherwise , many might easily be recruited by militants .

however , wolfgang schaeuble has not yet explained how . the german finance minister says he will come up with a plan to start reducing germany 's national debt in the course of 2010 .
wolfgang schaeuble told the mass-circulation tabloid bild that germany must reduce its deficit considerably , even if it 's a challenge . " we must reduce the structural deficit , starting in 2011 , by around 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 14 billion -rrb- per year , " he said .
" that will be tough , but we have to do it . " schaeuble promised to draw up a plan to achieve his goal for six consecutive years by july of next year ; however , last week he admitted that he was n't sure where to begin making the cuts . germany 's national debt is currently 1,725 billion euros -lrb- $ 2,470 billion -rrb- , and it 's rising by 4,439 euros per second .
that total figure equates to just over 21,000 euros of debt for every german citizen . to make matters worse , ongoing government spending in a bid to fend off the recent recession means germany is set to dig deeper than ever before in 2010 .
last week , chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet gave the green light to a 2010 budget proposal that foresees borrowing a record 85.8 billion euros over the course of the year . balancing the books bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german national debt is no secret , and it 's still rising meanwhile , chancellor merkel 's new centre-right coalition last week succeeded in delivering one of its key election promises , a heavily disputed 8.5 billion euro tax relief package , which would take effect in 2011 . many prominent members of merkel 's christian democrat party have already voiced their doubts about the sustainability of these tax breaks at a time of record national borrowing . " anybody who 's crying out for a tax reform package in 2011 needs to also explain how we can finance it , " michael meister , deputy leader of the christian democrat 's parliamentary group , told the handelsblatt business daily . " further tax relief packages , which will cost the state 10 billion euros , are hardly conducive to our current need to save money . " germany is one of a slew of eu economies under pressure from brussels to bring their annual borrowing back in line with the eu 's prescribed limit of three per cent of gross domestic product .
now , finance minister wolfgang schaeuble and his team must find a way to make it happen . msh / afp / ap editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this move has cast doubt on a crucial international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and eu-led 7.5 billion euro bailout for the recession-hit state .
the pension cuts have been in force since july , and constitutional court chief gunars kutris says they take away anywhere between 10 and 70 percent of old-age pensions depending on an individual 's status .

the thieves had cut the sign into three pieces . police in krakow , southern poland , told reporters on monday it was too early to tell what the motive behind the theft of the auschwitz sign really was .
however , the five suspects arrested when the sign was recovered are not members of a neo-nazi group .
the men do have criminal records for either violence or theft . " we can say that none of the five are members of a neo-nazi group , " andrzej rokita , district police chief in the city of krakow , told a news conference .
" their intent was undoubtedly robbery related .
we will be able to decide later whether the crime was ordered or whether they acted on their own initiative . " the five men , aged 20 to 39 , are believed to have stolen the infamous " arbeit macht frei " sign , which hung over the entrance to the nazi death camp auschwitz , at dawn on friday .
police recovered the sign , cut into three pieces , near the home of one of the suspects . " the sign had been cut into three pieces at the site of the theft , to make it easier to transport .
it had been hidden in a wood near the home of one of the thieves , " rokita said . when intact , the sign was five meters long .
its cynical message " work sets you free " became a symbol of the efforts of the nazis to deceive their victims .
over a million people , mostly jews , perished in the nazi death camp in southern poland during world war two - most of the site became a museum and memorial after the war ended . intensive search the five alleged thieves were captured after poland stepped up border security , set up roadblocks , deployed a team of around 40 forensic experts and sought the help of international policing bodies interpol and europol in a bid to recover the sign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the museum soon put this image right , hanging a replica sign on the gates as an interim solution the auschwitz museum offered a 100,000-zloty reward -lrb- 24,000 euros or $ 34,000 -rrb- for information which would help to recapture the sign , and polish police offered a further 5,000 zlotys . friday 's theft sparked condemnation from world leaders , jewish groups and holocaust survivors . " a worldwide symbol of the cynicism of hitler 's executioners and the martyrdom of their victims has been stolen , " polish president lech kaczynski said after the theft . auschwitz , visited by one million people last year , was one of a network of camps set up to kill some 6 million jews , along with members of other ethnic , religious , political , or social groups that hitler 's regime wanted to eliminate . msh / afp / ap / reuters editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some found a silver lining , however . the newspaper de volkskrant from holland acknowledged that copenhagen delivered a disappointing result but focused on the positive : the fact that at least the problem is being addressed .
" climate change is now an international problem par excellence .
it seems inevitable that all countries will be brought into negotiations sooner or later .
at the same time , it is nearly impossible to get 192 states of varying size and with diverse interests to reach a unified stance . "
" but there is a glimmer of hope .
all of the participants in the climate conference know that the talks will continue .
and possibly , those actors will be watched by the public and by activists and ngos with a more critical eye than they have been up to now .
because one thing was attained for certain : the climate will never disappear from the political agenda . "
likewise , britain 's guardian newspaper saw positives alongside negatives in the outcome of the conference .
on the bad side : " a considered reading of the accord , which was its only tangible output , reveals that it is not just inadequate but in fact utterly empty . "
on the plus side , however , is " the novel manner in which this ultimate failure was reached . "
" as the sight of the daily chaos -lrb- of copenhagen -rrb- drops out of view , it becomes easier to appreciate that the rich world was forced to haggle with the bigger emerging economies on more equal terms than ever before . "
in other words , " while the copenhagen product is every inch the sham that campaigners say it is , the copenhagen process has set important precedents , " the guardian wrote .
" most obviously … the sheer fact that it took place – and at such a high political level – means it will probably do so again . "
taking a harsher line , left-leaning french newspaper la libération oozed disappointment in the " large countries which , in a delirium of diplomatic ineptitude and the blindness of superiority , torpedoed the binding worldwide accord " they had hoped for . the paper pitched for the eu to take immediate , unilateral action : " eco-reformers need to focus on the us and china , " it wrote ; " after that come the nations that are a bit more environmentally aware , particularly in europe .
but these can not wait until there is an international agreement .
it is much more important for them to become instructive with their actions .
if the eu took the necessary actions from its side , it would jump to the head of the movement .
then the fiasco of copenhagen could be overcome step by step . " in switzerland , zurich 's tages-anzeiger also focused on results ; those who come up with solutions will ultimately benefit in the end , the paper wrote .
at the conference , " concrete solutions were presented on how to reach a climate-friendly future and at the same time remain economically profitable .
numerous companies seemed to have little patience for the political lethargy … the biggest climate-change effect will be felt by those companies and countries that start preparing now .
they will be the ultimate winners , " the paper said .
german editorialists were less inclined to focus on positive signals from the conference .
the sueddeutsche zeitung called the copenhagen summit an " insult to the world community , " noting that " never were expectations for a climate conference higher , and never before were so many heads of state and government officials in one place , meeting to solve one single problem .
but they did n't solve it - they made it worse . "
" as if they were replaying an old , bad film , the heads of the most powerful nations came up with aid funds to silence the developing nations .
they bought their way out .
instead of mutually promising a much-needed rejection of the destructive path of economic development , they agreed on a vague and distant goal .
it is like agreeing on a place to meet , but not a time . "
meanwhile , advocating a just-do-it approach in the wake of the talks , the frankfurter rundschau sent a strong warning to voters and the politicians they elect : " there is no point in allowing the un climate conference circus to continue its performances .
the only chance that remains is for the big heat-producers of the planet to lead by example - without any stipulations about taking others along for the ride , if need be .
fifteen countries on earth are responsible for 80 percent of c02 emissions around the world ; in copenhagen they all said how important climate protection is to them .
now , the politicians of these countries need to make the necessary changes .
and if they do n't the voters have to deal with it - and vote them out of office ... "
finally , the stuttgarter zeitung expressed the disappointment felt by many in europe when they compared us president barack obama 's focus on china and other developing countries with his relative lack of interest in the european negotatiors .
in the wake of the conference , " we need to keep up the ambition of climate protection , and keep the expectations in a realistic framework , " the paper wrote .
" but one prerequisite for this is the recognition that it will be really hard for europe to effectively influence the usa .
the trans-atlantic relationship is coming up on hard times .
barack obama showed one thing for certain in copenhagen : his focus will be on the trans-pacific axis with china .

however , wolfgang schaeuble has not yet explained how . the german finance minister says he will come up with a plan to start reducing germany 's national debt in the course of 2010 .
wolfgang schaeuble told the mass-circulation tabloid bild that germany must reduce its deficit considerably , even if it 's a challenge . " we must reduce the structural deficit , starting in 2011 , by around 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 14 billion -rrb- per year , " he said .
" that will be tough , but we have to do it . " schaeuble promised to draw up a plan to achieve his goal for six consecutive years by july of next year ; however , last week he admitted that he was n't sure where to begin making the cuts . germany 's national debt is currently 1,725 billion euros -lrb- $ 2,470 billion -rrb- , and it 's rising by 4,439 euros per second .
that total figure equates to just over 21,000 euros of debt for every german citizen . to make matters worse , ongoing government spending in a bid to fend off the recent recession means germany is set to dig deeper than ever before in 2010 .

" anybody who 's crying out for a tax reform package in 2011 needs to also explain how we can finance it , " michael meister , deputy leader of the christian democrat 's parliamentary group , told the handelsblatt business daily . " further tax relief packages , which will cost the state 10 billion euros , are hardly conducive to our current need to save money . " germany is one of a slew of eu economies under pressure from brussels to bring their annual borrowing back in line with the eu 's prescribed limit of three per cent of gross domestic product .

three companies now face huge fines for price fixing , with more investigations underway . bosses from coffee companies tchibo , melitta and dallmayr worked together to keep their prices artificially high , a competition watchdog has ruled . germany 's cartel office has imposed fines amounting to almost 159.5 million euros against the coffee producers .
the fine is against the three coffee roasters and six employees who were deemed to be responsible .
there were several price fixes from the beginning of 2000 until the company was investigated in july 2008 .
the bonn-based cartel office said that a circle of company leaders and sales bosses had met to fix prices on products that included coffee beans , espresso coffee and ordinary filter coffee .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : espresso coffee was one of the products that were made more expensive dates and periods as well as the scope and level of the price rises were agreed upon .
five price hikes were set up between 2003 and 2008 .
the effect of just two of these increases - in winter 2004 and spring 2005 - led to an average price increase of a euro on a 500g pack of coffee .
melitta coffee spokeswoman anette kahre said the firm would appeal against the fine and that it had cooperated fully with authorities in the investigation .
the company also regretted what had happened , kahre added , and it had " made arrangements for such a thing not to happen again . "
" fine is completely excessive " dallmayr said the fine was " completely excessive " and that taking into account tax , german coffee was the best value in europe .

three companies now face huge fines for price fixing , with more investigations underway . bosses from coffee companies tchibo , melitta and dallmayr worked together to keep their prices artificially high , a competition watchdog has ruled . germany 's cartel office has imposed fines amounting to almost 159.5 million euros against the coffee producers .
the fine is against the three coffee roasters and six employees who were deemed to be responsible .
there were several price fixes from the beginning of 2000 until the company was investigated in july 2008 .
the bonn-based cartel office said that a circle of company leaders and sales bosses had met to fix prices on products that included coffee beans , espresso coffee and ordinary filter coffee .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : espresso coffee was one of the products that were made more expensive dates and periods as well as the scope and level of the price rises were agreed upon .
five price hikes were set up between 2003 and 2008 .
the effect of just two of these increases - in winter 2004 and spring 2005 - led to an average price increase of a euro on a 500g pack of coffee .
melitta coffee spokeswoman anette kahre said the firm would appeal against the fine and that it had cooperated fully with authorities in the investigation .
the company also regretted what had happened , kahre added , and it had " made arrangements for such a thing not to happen again . "
" fine is completely excessive " dallmayr said the fine was " completely excessive " and that taking into account tax , german coffee was the best value in europe .
there was no comment from tchibo , although it did confirm the amount of the fine .
the cartel office said that the fines were still not legally binding and that the companies had an opportunity to put forward objections .
it added that further investigations were also taking place into numerous coffee producers , including cappuccino producers , and are expected to be completed in the first half of 2010. rc / afp / dpa editor : ranty islam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the spyker leadership has submitted a renewed offer in the hopes of securing a future for saab , its employees and the brand - despite the announcement that the winding down of saab would begin , " the company said in a statement . spyker said it hoped " the renewed offer would remove each of the obstacles that were standing in the way of a swift transaction . "
the company 's chief executive , victor muller , said its revised bid included an 11-point proposal addressing issues that arose during the due diligence process . " we have made every effort to resolve the issues that were preventing the conclusion of this matter and we have asked gm and all other involved parties to seriously consider this offer , " said muller .
he added that the new offer eliminates the need for loan approval by the european investment bank -lrb- eib -rrb- prior to year end , which would allow the deal to be concluded within gm 's original december 31 deadline . while muller did not reveal any details about the financing of the new offer , he said spyker 's bid would remain valid until 11pm central european time -lrb- 5pm eastern time -rrb- on monday . several suitors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so far only small carmakers have shown real interest in acquiring saab on its website , general motors said it had received inquiries from several potential bidders since friday 's announcement that it would start the orderly closure of saab . " we will evaluate each inquiry .
we will not comment further until these evaluations have been completed , " gm said in a statement .
the head of sweden 's influential if metall union urged gm to seriously consider the renewed bid for saab , which employs about 3,400 people in sweden . " i understand the frustration felt by everyone who is dependent on saab : to be thrown between hope and despair is terrible .
gm must now respond with a serious examination of the new bid , " union chairman stefan loefven said . swedish media report that the closure of saab could lead to more than 8,000 job losses , including subcontractors and others dependent on the carmaker .
the company 's global distribution network is comprised of 1,100 dealerships . gm has been trying to sell the unit since the start of the year .
swedish luxury carmaker koenigsegg , which builds around 18 high-end sports cars a year , pulled out of a deal to buy saab last month , citing costly delays . like koenigsegg , spyker is also a premium niche manufacturer .
in 2008 , it sold just 37 cars worldwide with prices starting at 200,000 euros -lrb- $ 290,000 -rrb- . saab sold just over 93,000 cars last year .
the company 's history as an automaker dates back to the 1940s , when the first cars were produced by the swedish aircraft maker svenska aeroplan aktiebolaget or saab .
gm acquired saab automobile in 1990 . sje / afp / reuters editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" climate change is now an international problem par excellence .
it seems inevitable that all countries will be brought into negotiations sooner or later .
at the same time , it is nearly impossible to get 192 states of varying size and with diverse interests to reach a unified stance . "

on the plus side , however , is " the novel manner in which this ultimate failure was reached . "
" as the sight of the daily chaos -lrb- of copenhagen -rrb- drops out of view , it becomes easier to appreciate that the rich world was forced to haggle with the bigger emerging economies on more equal terms than ever before . "
in other words , " while the copenhagen product is every inch the sham that campaigners say it is , the copenhagen process has set important precedents , " the guardian wrote .

this move has cast doubt on a crucial international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and eu-led 7.5 billion euro bailout for the recession-hit state .
the pension cuts have been in force since july , and constitutional court chief gunars kutris says they take away anywhere between 10 and 70 percent of old-age pensions depending on an individual 's status .
kurtis said the measures were illegal and that parliament must have measures in place to refund the cuts by march 2010 .
" violation " of social security and rule of law in its judgement , the court stated that " the decision to cut pensions violated the individual 's right to social security and the principle of the rule of law . "
it added that agreements with international lenders in and of themselves can not be used as an argument to limit basic rights .
the court 's ruling in the case is final and can not be appealed .
the case was brought to the court by 9,000 individual pensioners .
it has been ruled that the money itself must be paid back in full no later than 2015 .
the sum is estimated around 100 million lats -lrb- 140 million euros -rrb- .
currently , latvia is in the middle of one of the deepest recessions in the european union , with its economy expected to shrink by up to 18 percent this year .
over the past year , its government has been raising taxes and reducing public spending as it attempts to stick to the terms of the imf / eu bailout .
under the deal , latvia pledged to cut 500 million lats -lrb- 702 million euros -rrb- every year until 2012. mk / afp / reuters editor : ranty islam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

three companies now face huge fines for price fixing , with more investigations underway . bosses from coffee companies tchibo , melitta and dallmayr worked together to keep their prices artificially high , a competition watchdog has ruled . germany 's cartel office has imposed fines amounting to almost 159.5 million euros against the coffee producers .
the fine is against the three coffee roasters and six employees who were deemed to be responsible .
there were several price fixes from the beginning of 2000 until the company was investigated in july 2008 .
the bonn-based cartel office said that a circle of company leaders and sales bosses had met to fix prices on products that included coffee beans , espresso coffee and ordinary filter coffee .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : espresso coffee was one of the products that were made more expensive dates and periods as well as the scope and level of the price rises were agreed upon .
five price hikes were set up between 2003 and 2008 .
the effect of just two of these increases - in winter 2004 and spring 2005 - led to an average price increase of a euro on a 500g pack of coffee .
melitta coffee spokeswoman anette kahre said the firm would appeal against the fine and that it had cooperated fully with authorities in the investigation .
the company also regretted what had happened , kahre added , and it had " made arrangements for such a thing not to happen again . "

there was no comment from tchibo , although it did confirm the amount of the fine .
the cartel office said that the fines were still not legally binding and that the companies had an opportunity to put forward objections .

three companies now face huge fines for price fixing , with more investigations underway . bosses from coffee companies tchibo , melitta and dallmayr worked together to keep their prices artificially high , a competition watchdog has ruled . germany 's cartel office has imposed fines amounting to almost 159.5 million euros against the coffee producers .
the fine is against the three coffee roasters and six employees who were deemed to be responsible .
there were several price fixes from the beginning of 2000 until the company was investigated in july 2008 .
the bonn-based cartel office said that a circle of company leaders and sales bosses had met to fix prices on products that included coffee beans , espresso coffee and ordinary filter coffee .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : espresso coffee was one of the products that were made more expensive dates and periods as well as the scope and level of the price rises were agreed upon .
five price hikes were set up between 2003 and 2008 .
the effect of just two of these increases - in winter 2004 and spring 2005 - led to an average price increase of a euro on a 500g pack of coffee .
melitta coffee spokeswoman anette kahre said the firm would appeal against the fine and that it had cooperated fully with authorities in the investigation .
the company also regretted what had happened , kahre added , and it had " made arrangements for such a thing not to happen again . "
" fine is completely excessive " dallmayr said the fine was " completely excessive " and that taking into account tax , german coffee was the best value in europe .
there was no comment from tchibo , although it did confirm the amount of the fine .
the cartel office said that the fines were still not legally binding and that the companies had an opportunity to put forward objections .
it added that further investigations were also taking place into numerous coffee producers , including cappuccino producers , and are expected to be completed in the first half of 2010. rc / afp / dpa editor : ranty islam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press review -pipe- 21.12.2009 copenhagen 's legacy : bitter disappointment , with a glimmer of hope großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : editorialists acknowledged that copenhagen was a disappointment after the widely disappointing un climate conference in copenhagen - aka ' flopenhagen ' - european editorialists let the bitter comments flow .
some found a silver lining , however . the newspaper de volkskrant from holland acknowledged that copenhagen delivered a disappointing result but focused on the positive : the fact that at least the problem is being addressed .
" climate change is now an international problem par excellence .
it seems inevitable that all countries will be brought into negotiations sooner or later .
at the same time , it is nearly impossible to get 192 states of varying size and with diverse interests to reach a unified stance . "
" but there is a glimmer of hope .
all of the participants in the climate conference know that the talks will continue .
and possibly , those actors will be watched by the public and by activists and ngos with a more critical eye than they have been up to now .
because one thing was attained for certain : the climate will never disappear from the political agenda . "
likewise , britain 's guardian newspaper saw positives alongside negatives in the outcome of the conference .
on the bad side : " a considered reading of the accord , which was its only tangible output , reveals that it is not just inadequate but in fact utterly empty . "
on the plus side , however , is " the novel manner in which this ultimate failure was reached . "
" as the sight of the daily chaos -lrb- of copenhagen -rrb- drops out of view , it becomes easier to appreciate that the rich world was forced to haggle with the bigger emerging economies on more equal terms than ever before . "
in other words , " while the copenhagen product is every inch the sham that campaigners say it is , the copenhagen process has set important precedents , " the guardian wrote .
" most obviously … the sheer fact that it took place – and at such a high political level – means it will probably do so again . "
taking a harsher line , left-leaning french newspaper la libération oozed disappointment in the " large countries which , in a delirium of diplomatic ineptitude and the blindness of superiority , torpedoed the binding worldwide accord " they had hoped for . the paper pitched for the eu to take immediate , unilateral action : " eco-reformers need to focus on the us and china , " it wrote ; " after that come the nations that are a bit more environmentally aware , particularly in europe .
but these can not wait until there is an international agreement .
it is much more important for them to become instructive with their actions .
if the eu took the necessary actions from its side , it would jump to the head of the movement .
then the fiasco of copenhagen could be overcome step by step . " in switzerland , zurich 's tages-anzeiger also focused on results ; those who come up with solutions will ultimately benefit in the end , the paper wrote .
at the conference , " concrete solutions were presented on how to reach a climate-friendly future and at the same time remain economically profitable .
numerous companies seemed to have little patience for the political lethargy … the biggest climate-change effect will be felt by those companies and countries that start preparing now .
they will be the ultimate winners , " the paper said .
german editorialists were less inclined to focus on positive signals from the conference .
the sueddeutsche zeitung called the copenhagen summit an " insult to the world community , " noting that " never were expectations for a climate conference higher , and never before were so many heads of state and government officials in one place , meeting to solve one single problem .
but they did n't solve it - they made it worse . "
" as if they were replaying an old , bad film , the heads of the most powerful nations came up with aid funds to silence the developing nations .
they bought their way out .
instead of mutually promising a much-needed rejection of the destructive path of economic development , they agreed on a vague and distant goal .
it is like agreeing on a place to meet , but not a time . "
meanwhile , advocating a just-do-it approach in the wake of the talks , the frankfurter rundschau sent a strong warning to voters and the politicians they elect : " there is no point in allowing the un climate conference circus to continue its performances .
the only chance that remains is for the big heat-producers of the planet to lead by example - without any stipulations about taking others along for the ride , if need be .
fifteen countries on earth are responsible for 80 percent of c02 emissions around the world ; in copenhagen they all said how important climate protection is to them .
now , the politicians of these countries need to make the necessary changes .
and if they do n't the voters have to deal with it - and vote them out of office ... "
finally , the stuttgarter zeitung expressed the disappointment felt by many in europe when they compared us president barack obama 's focus on china and other developing countries with his relative lack of interest in the european negotatiors .
in the wake of the conference , " we need to keep up the ambition of climate protection , and keep the expectations in a realistic framework , " the paper wrote .
" but one prerequisite for this is the recognition that it will be really hard for europe to effectively influence the usa .
the trans-atlantic relationship is coming up on hard times .
barack obama showed one thing for certain in copenhagen : his focus will be on the trans-pacific axis with china .

in 2009 , the spotlight fell on one of the female stars from this summer 's world athletics championships in berlin , the only man to beat michael phelps in a major swimming competition since 2005 , and the women 's national soccer team for their clear dominance over their european competitors .
steffi nerius throws for gold after the opening weekend of the world athletics championships in august , the biggest star to emerge from berlin 's olympic stadium was usain bolt , whose record-breaking 100-meter dash on the competition 's second day captivated germans and out-of-town visitors alike .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nerius 's first throw was good enough for gold two days later , bolt had competition for the newspaper headlines , and it was from a member of the home team .
when steffi nerius stepped to the line of the finals in the javelin competition , germany had yet to produce a single gold medal winner .
tournament organizers had staggered the events so there was a german gold medal hopeful on each of the nine days of competition , but on the fourth day , they were still waiting for the first german champion .
nerius 's first throw of the finals sailed 67.30 meters , which held as the best mark throughout the entire competition .
when eventual czech silver medalist barbora spotakova 's final throw of the event failed to beat nerius ' mark , nerius raised her arms in the air and celebrated germany 's first gold of the competition , with a stadium full of loud supporters cheering her on .
it was the first world championship gold medal of the 37-year-old 's career .
before the world championships began , there had been fears that germany would repeat its performance from the beijing olympics and come up short in the medals column .
but after nerius set the precedent , german athletes went on to take home a total of two gold , three silver , and four bronze medals , which represented a successful competition for the host nation .
paul biedermann upsets michael phelps new world records were practically a drop in the deep end at the world swimming championships in rome last july .
controversial new swimsuits , made partially or entirely out of polyurethane , seemed to be giving swimmers who wore them a slight edge , and as a result , 43 world records fell at the meet in rome .
bildunterschrift : biedermann bested the world record - and michael phelps - in the 200m freestyle paul biedermann grabbed two of those records , and they happened to be two of the most impressive of the entire competition .
wearing a full-body polyurethane suit , biedermann bested legendary australian swimmer ian thorpe 's world record in the 400 meter freestyle , a mark that many in the sport thought would be safe for many years .
biedermann 's next record was even more impressive , especially because of the man he handily beat in the race .
in the 200 ´ -meter freestyle , biedermann shattered american michael phelps 's world record time by over a second , and handed phelps his only silver medal in world or olympic competition since 2005 .
phelps did n't wear one of the all-polyurethane suits against biedermann , but still praised the 23-year-old german 's performance .
" paul swam a great race .
i did not have anything in the last 50 meters , " phelps said after the swim .
" in the race i was beaten by the swimmer , not the suit . "
starting in 2010 , swimming 's governing body fina will implement a ban on all-polyurethane suits , but eight-time beijing gold medallist michael phelps has a new top rival for next season : germany 's paul biedermann .
women 's national team wins european championships german soccer fans remember well the impressive march by bundesliga squad vfl wolfsburg to the german championship at the end of the 2008/2009 bundesliga season .
it was the first title in the team 's history .
but to be considered germany 's best team of the year , one title just is n't enough .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inka grings had six goals to celebrate at this year 's european championship seven is more appropriate - the number of titles the german women 's national soccer team has after winning the 2009 european championship in finland by convincingly beating england 6-2 in the final .
winning yet another title continued an impressive streak for the german women .
in european championship competition , the team remains unbeaten since 1995 .
that 's a total of 26 matches , and five titles in a row .
in fact , since the first women 's european championship took place in 1984 , only two other countries - sweden once and norway twice - have won the title other than germany .
like squads in the past , the 2009 european champions simply overpowered their opponents .
in the six matches played by the german side in finland , they scored 21 goals against their opponents ' 5 goals combined .
six of those goals came from striker inka grings , and the rest came from a team effort of nine other goal scorers .
2009 marks the second time the women 's national team has been elected team of the year by german sports journalists .
the first was in 2003 , after the team won its first women 's world cup .
they followed it up with another title in 2007 , and have a shot at their third straight world cup in 2011 as the host country. mz / dpa / sid editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in 2009 , the spotlight fell on one of the female stars from this summer 's world athletics championships in berlin , the only man to beat michael phelps in a major swimming competition since 2005 , and the women 's national soccer team for their clear dominance over their european competitors .
steffi nerius throws for gold after the opening weekend of the world athletics championships in august , the biggest star to emerge from berlin 's olympic stadium was usain bolt , whose record-breaking 100-meter dash on the competition 's second day captivated germans and out-of-town visitors alike .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nerius 's first throw was good enough for gold two days later , bolt had competition for the newspaper headlines , and it was from a member of the home team .
when steffi nerius stepped to the line of the finals in the javelin competition , germany had yet to produce a single gold medal winner .
tournament organizers had staggered the events so there was a german gold medal hopeful on each of the nine days of competition , but on the fourth day , they were still waiting for the first german champion .
nerius 's first throw of the finals sailed 67.30 meters , which held as the best mark throughout the entire competition .
when eventual czech silver medalist barbora spotakova 's final throw of the event failed to beat nerius ' mark , nerius raised her arms in the air and celebrated germany 's first gold of the competition , with a stadium full of loud supporters cheering her on .
it was the first world championship gold medal of the 37-year-old 's career .
before the world championships began , there had been fears that germany would repeat its performance from the beijing olympics and come up short in the medals column .
but after nerius set the precedent , german athletes went on to take home a total of two gold , three silver , and four bronze medals , which represented a successful competition for the host nation .
paul biedermann upsets michael phelps new world records were practically a drop in the deep end at the world swimming championships in rome last july .
controversial new swimsuits , made partially or entirely out of polyurethane , seemed to be giving swimmers who wore them a slight edge , and as a result , 43 world records fell at the meet in rome .
bildunterschrift : biedermann bested the world record - and michael phelps - in the 200m freestyle paul biedermann grabbed two of those records , and they happened to be two of the most impressive of the entire competition .
wearing a full-body polyurethane suit , biedermann bested legendary australian swimmer ian thorpe 's world record in the 400 meter freestyle , a mark that many in the sport thought would be safe for many years .
biedermann 's next record was even more impressive , especially because of the man he handily beat in the race .
in the 200 ´ -meter freestyle , biedermann shattered american michael phelps 's world record time by over a second , and handed phelps his only silver medal in world or olympic competition since 2005 .
phelps did n't wear one of the all-polyurethane suits against biedermann , but still praised the 23-year-old german 's performance .
" paul swam a great race .
i did not have anything in the last 50 meters , " phelps said after the swim .
" in the race i was beaten by the swimmer , not the suit . "
starting in 2010 , swimming 's governing body fina will implement a ban on all-polyurethane suits , but eight-time beijing gold medallist michael phelps has a new top rival for next season : germany 's paul biedermann .
women 's national team wins european championships german soccer fans remember well the impressive march by bundesliga squad vfl wolfsburg to the german championship at the end of the 2008/2009 bundesliga season .
it was the first title in the team 's history .
but to be considered germany 's best team of the year , one title just is n't enough .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inka grings had six goals to celebrate at this year 's european championship seven is more appropriate - the number of titles the german women 's national soccer team has after winning the 2009 european championship in finland by convincingly beating england 6-2 in the final .
winning yet another title continued an impressive streak for the german women .
in european championship competition , the team remains unbeaten since 1995 .
that 's a total of 26 matches , and five titles in a row .
in fact , since the first women 's european championship took place in 1984 , only two other countries - sweden once and norway twice - have won the title other than germany .
like squads in the past , the 2009 european champions simply overpowered their opponents .
in the six matches played by the german side in finland , they scored 21 goals against their opponents ' 5 goals combined .
six of those goals came from striker inka grings , and the rest came from a team effort of nine other goal scorers .
2009 marks the second time the women 's national team has been elected team of the year by german sports journalists .
the first was in 2003 , after the team won its first women 's world cup .
they followed it up with another title in 2007 , and have a shot at their third straight world cup in 2011 as the host country. mz / dpa / sid editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the men do have criminal records for either violence or theft . " we can say that none of the five are members of a neo-nazi group , " andrzej rokita , district police chief in the city of krakow , told a news conference .
" their intent was undoubtedly robbery related .
we will be able to decide later whether the crime was ordered or whether they acted on their own initiative . " the five men , aged 20 to 39 , are believed to have stolen the infamous " arbeit macht frei " sign , which hung over the entrance to the nazi death camp auschwitz , at dawn on friday .
police recovered the sign , cut into three pieces , near the home of one of the suspects . " the sign had been cut into three pieces at the site of the theft , to make it easier to transport .
it had been hidden in a wood near the home of one of the thieves , " rokita said . when intact , the sign was five meters long .
its cynical message " work sets you free " became a symbol of the efforts of the nazis to deceive their victims .
over a million people , mostly jews , perished in the nazi death camp in southern poland during world war two - most of the site became a museum and memorial after the war ended . intensive search the five alleged thieves were captured after poland stepped up border security , set up roadblocks , deployed a team of around 40 forensic experts and sought the help of international policing bodies interpol and europol in a bid to recover the sign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the museum soon put this image right , hanging a replica sign on the gates as an interim solution the auschwitz museum offered a 100,000-zloty reward -lrb- 24,000 euros or $ 34,000 -rrb- for information which would help to recapture the sign , and polish police offered a further 5,000 zlotys . friday 's theft sparked condemnation from world leaders , jewish groups and holocaust survivors . " a worldwide symbol of the cynicism of hitler 's executioners and the martyrdom of their victims has been stolen , " polish president lech kaczynski said after the theft . auschwitz , visited by one million people last year , was one of a network of camps set up to kill some 6 million jews , along with members of other ethnic , religious , political , or social groups that hitler 's regime wanted to eliminate . msh / afp / ap / reuters editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this is part of a larger effort by egypt to reclaim its ancient treasures . egypt 's chief antiquities official zahi hawass says he will make a formal request for the return of the bust of queen nefertiti from berlin 's neues museum .
in a statement released sunday , hawass said he was presented with documents by the head of the berlin neues museum , where the bust is currently on display , which supported his claim that the statue is in germany illegally . german archeologist acted “ unethically ” according to hawass , the documents confirmed that the german archeologist ludwig borchardt produced fraudulent papers to secure the 3,300 year old bust for berlin in 1913 .
borchardt , who discovered the bust , tried to pass off the artefact as a less significant find in order to take it out of egypt .
“ these materials confirm egypt 's contention that borchardt did act unethically , with intent to deceive , ” the statement said .
“ the limestone head of the queen is listed on the protocol as a painted plaster bust of a princess . ”
the statement went on to say that friederike seyfried , a museum director who oversees the section where the bust is on display , would assist in negotiations between hawass and german officials .
however , in a statement released december 18 by the museum 's operators , the prussian cultural heritage foundation , it was said that , while seyfried would meet with hawass in cairo soon , she would not discuss nefertiti 's return , since the documents showed the prussian state acquired the bust lawfully and egypt had no legal claim for its return .
new campaign for return of artefacts despite the claims of the foundation , hawass says he is optimistic about the bust 's return .
“ i always ask for artefacts to come and it always happens ” he told reuters .
the push for nefertiti 's return is part of a larger effort for egypt to reclaim its ancient artefacts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bust has attracted millions of visitors since it was sent to germany in 1913 hawass previously retrieved wall fragments of a 3,200 year old tomb from the french louvre , and is also currently working on having the rosetta stone returned from the british museum . the bust of nefertiti was discovered in egypt in 1912 at tell el-amarna , the short-lived capital of the kingdom under nefertiti 's husband , pharaoh akhenaten .
it was shipped to germany the following year , and has since attracted millions of visitors from around the world. mk / ap / reuters editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

borchardt , who discovered the bust , tried to pass off the artefact as a less significant find in order to take it out of egypt .
“ these materials confirm egypt 's contention that borchardt did act unethically , with intent to deceive , ” the statement said .
“ the limestone head of the queen is listed on the protocol as a painted plaster bust of a princess . ”
the statement went on to say that friederike seyfried , a museum director who oversees the section where the bust is on display , would assist in negotiations between hawass and german officials .

this move has cast doubt on a crucial international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and eu-led 7.5 billion euro bailout for the recession-hit state .
the pension cuts have been in force since july , and constitutional court chief gunars kutris says they take away anywhere between 10 and 70 percent of old-age pensions depending on an individual 's status .
kurtis said the measures were illegal and that parliament must have measures in place to refund the cuts by march 2010 .
" violation " of social security and rule of law in its judgement , the court stated that " the decision to cut pensions violated the individual 's right to social security and the principle of the rule of law . "
it added that agreements with international lenders in and of themselves can not be used as an argument to limit basic rights .
the court 's ruling in the case is final and can not be appealed .
the case was brought to the court by 9,000 individual pensioners .
it has been ruled that the money itself must be paid back in full no later than 2015 .
the sum is estimated around 100 million lats -lrb- 140 million euros -rrb- .
currently , latvia is in the middle of one of the deepest recessions in the european union , with its economy expected to shrink by up to 18 percent this year .
over the past year , its government has been raising taxes and reducing public spending as it attempts to stick to the terms of the imf / eu bailout .
under the deal , latvia pledged to cut 500 million lats -lrb- 702 million euros -rrb- every year until 2012. mk / afp / reuters editor : ranty islam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the thieves had cut the sign into three pieces . police in krakow , southern poland , told reporters on monday it was too early to tell what the motive behind the theft of the auschwitz sign really was .
however , the five suspects arrested when the sign was recovered are not members of a neo-nazi group .
the men do have criminal records for either violence or theft . " we can say that none of the five are members of a neo-nazi group , " andrzej rokita , district police chief in the city of krakow , told a news conference .
" their intent was undoubtedly robbery related .
we will be able to decide later whether the crime was ordered or whether they acted on their own initiative . " the five men , aged 20 to 39 , are believed to have stolen the infamous " arbeit macht frei " sign , which hung over the entrance to the nazi death camp auschwitz , at dawn on friday .
police recovered the sign , cut into three pieces , near the home of one of the suspects . " the sign had been cut into three pieces at the site of the theft , to make it easier to transport .
it had been hidden in a wood near the home of one of the thieves , " rokita said . when intact , the sign was five meters long .
its cynical message " work sets you free " became a symbol of the efforts of the nazis to deceive their victims .
over a million people , mostly jews , perished in the nazi death camp in southern poland during world war two - most of the site became a museum and memorial after the war ended . intensive search the five alleged thieves were captured after poland stepped up border security , set up roadblocks , deployed a team of around 40 forensic experts and sought the help of international policing bodies interpol and europol in a bid to recover the sign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the museum soon put this image right , hanging a replica sign on the gates as an interim solution the auschwitz museum offered a 100,000-zloty reward -lrb- 24,000 euros or $ 34,000 -rrb- for information which would help to recapture the sign , and polish police offered a further 5,000 zlotys . friday 's theft sparked condemnation from world leaders , jewish groups and holocaust survivors . " a worldwide symbol of the cynicism of hitler 's executioners and the martyrdom of their victims has been stolen , " polish president lech kaczynski said after the theft . auschwitz , visited by one million people last year , was one of a network of camps set up to kill some 6 million jews , along with members of other ethnic , religious , political , or social groups that hitler 's regime wanted to eliminate . msh / afp / ap / reuters editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this move has cast doubt on a crucial international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and eu-led 7.5 billion euro bailout for the recession-hit state .
the pension cuts have been in force since july , and constitutional court chief gunars kutris says they take away anywhere between 10 and 70 percent of old-age pensions depending on an individual 's status .

it added that agreements with international lenders in and of themselves can not be used as an argument to limit basic rights .
the court 's ruling in the case is final and can not be appealed .
the case was brought to the court by 9,000 individual pensioners .
it has been ruled that the money itself must be paid back in full no later than 2015 .

china has been investing heavily in the african market and is keen to stress the benefits to local businesses .
is that involvement an opportunity or a risk to africa ’ s development and is europe being left behind ? on the copperbelt in zambia , investment in luanshya mine by china 's non-ferrous meter mining group corporation -lrb- nfca -rrb- has been welcomed by locals .
a veteran of the mining industry who wanted to remain anonymous told deutsche welle that " -lsb- s -rsb- o far -lsb- the chinese investors -rsb- are good guys because they are putting -lsb- in -rsb- a lot of money before production starts . "
for a small town whose future appeared bleak when mining production was shut down , the creation of an estimated 3,000 jobs is good news .
the warm welcome of chinese investment in luanshya is in stark contrast to the anti-chinese sentiment in a town less than an hour away .
the memory of a mine explosion that left 46 dead still lingers in chambeshi .
for many , graves located close to the mine are a daily reminder of the deaths of a colleague or loved one .
more than four years after the incident , the community remains ambivalent about the reopening of the plant where the explosion occurred even if it will bring many jobs to the area .
some still feel that their chinese employers are to blame for the incident .
mukuka chilufya , a safety officer who participated in rescue operations following the explosion , told deutsche welle that " maybe they could have received a bulk order and they were running out of time .
so the night shift that were involved in the male dyke collided with the day shift that were involved in the female dyke .
in fact , what is going to confirm that is that the chinese who were knowledgeable of the consequences all were not in the factory when the explosion took place because they knew that something like that could happen . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is investing heavily in africa 's mining industry most of the criticism surrounding china 's involvement in africa debate has been on the working conditions of the miners who are subjected to low wages and questionable safety procedures .
the incident at chambishi mine in zambia in april 2005 drew attention to this .
but as professor helmut asche , director of the institute for african studies at the university of leipzig , notes these conditions are no different from those that miners in northern china are subjected to .
since beijing is unable to control the working conditions of its citizens , african governments are responsible for exerting effective control over chinese investors so that they implement fair wages and adequate safety procedures .
benefits , implications of chinese investment china 's african policy states that it intends to be africa 's equal -lrb- economic -rrb- partner .
experts like he wenping , director of the institute of west-asian and african studies at the chinese academy of social science in beijing , say that china 's goals in africa are more political than economic .
according to asche , a change in china 's africa foreign policy began after the tiananmen square massacre when china needed more foreign allies .
china 's current african partners , who are in the group of 77 , provide it with more influence in the united nations .
asche feels that the import of cheap goods from china can have very different effects as is the case with the south african textile industry and the ethiopian footwear industry .
the protection of local industry in south africa meant that the manufacturers did not modernize their techniques in order to be able to compete successfully with the chinese imports .
on the other hand , in ethiopia where the local footwear manufacturing industry was not protected , production became more competitive and now ethiopia is exporting footwear to china .
zambians often say that " you thank the person who guides you at night when it is dawn . "
the relationship between china and africa is still in its infancy , but as asche told deutsche welle " it is crystal clear -lsb- … -rsb- in scientific research that the chinese investment in all its facets is positive for africa . "
he goes onto say that current investment is doing more to strengthen economies than democracy and good governance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is helping africa develop its infrastructure .
the chinese news agency xinhua estimates that there are currently one million chinese immigrants in africa .
their growing presence is more often than not unwelcome as is shown by attacks on immigrants in nigeria and angola .
most zambians complain that the chinese community isolates itself .
chinese immigrants have not been as successful as indians or other immigrants in integrating in africa , however asche says that both locals and immigrants are responsible for the integration of the chinese migrants .
the role of germany and europe asche feels that germany should do more to get involved in africa : " … the german investors should -lsb- … -rsb- be encouraged to become as courageous as the chinese are .
it is a crystal clear fact that china and its investors and not only the state-owned companies but also private investors see the african market a lot more positive than do quite a number of investors from european countries , and the germans are certainly not among the most courageous . "
in addition to those fears , asche attributes the lack of increased trade between the two continents to the european union 's trade policy , which does not treat africa as an equal partner as china does : “ -lsb- eu trade policy -rsb- is a good example of how not to deal with partner countries and by way of comparison china all of a sudden stands out as , trade policy-wise , a fair partner to africa in comparison with the eu . "
asche says that the growing trade between china and africa is " an irreversible expression of the new multi-polar world , and european powers -lsb- … -rsb- simply have to learn to live in this multi-polar environment in which there is no longer an exclusive relationship between the eu , the us and africa . "

china has been investing heavily in the african market and is keen to stress the benefits to local businesses .
is that involvement an opportunity or a risk to africa ’ s development and is europe being left behind ? on the copperbelt in zambia , investment in luanshya mine by china 's non-ferrous meter mining group corporation -lrb- nfca -rrb- has been welcomed by locals .
a veteran of the mining industry who wanted to remain anonymous told deutsche welle that " -lsb- s -rsb- o far -lsb- the chinese investors -rsb- are good guys because they are putting -lsb- in -rsb- a lot of money before production starts . "
for a small town whose future appeared bleak when mining production was shut down , the creation of an estimated 3,000 jobs is good news .
the warm welcome of chinese investment in luanshya is in stark contrast to the anti-chinese sentiment in a town less than an hour away .
the memory of a mine explosion that left 46 dead still lingers in chambeshi .
for many , graves located close to the mine are a daily reminder of the deaths of a colleague or loved one .
more than four years after the incident , the community remains ambivalent about the reopening of the plant where the explosion occurred even if it will bring many jobs to the area .
some still feel that their chinese employers are to blame for the incident .
mukuka chilufya , a safety officer who participated in rescue operations following the explosion , told deutsche welle that " maybe they could have received a bulk order and they were running out of time .
so the night shift that were involved in the male dyke collided with the day shift that were involved in the female dyke .
in fact , what is going to confirm that is that the chinese who were knowledgeable of the consequences all were not in the factory when the explosion took place because they knew that something like that could happen . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is investing heavily in africa 's mining industry most of the criticism surrounding china 's involvement in africa debate has been on the working conditions of the miners who are subjected to low wages and questionable safety procedures .
the incident at chambishi mine in zambia in april 2005 drew attention to this .
but as professor helmut asche , director of the institute for african studies at the university of leipzig , notes these conditions are no different from those that miners in northern china are subjected to .
since beijing is unable to control the working conditions of its citizens , african governments are responsible for exerting effective control over chinese investors so that they implement fair wages and adequate safety procedures .
benefits , implications of chinese investment china 's african policy states that it intends to be africa 's equal -lrb- economic -rrb- partner .
experts like he wenping , director of the institute of west-asian and african studies at the chinese academy of social science in beijing , say that china 's goals in africa are more political than economic .
according to asche , a change in china 's africa foreign policy began after the tiananmen square massacre when china needed more foreign allies .
china 's current african partners , who are in the group of 77 , provide it with more influence in the united nations .
asche feels that the import of cheap goods from china can have very different effects as is the case with the south african textile industry and the ethiopian footwear industry .
the protection of local industry in south africa meant that the manufacturers did not modernize their techniques in order to be able to compete successfully with the chinese imports .
on the other hand , in ethiopia where the local footwear manufacturing industry was not protected , production became more competitive and now ethiopia is exporting footwear to china .
zambians often say that " you thank the person who guides you at night when it is dawn . "
the relationship between china and africa is still in its infancy , but as asche told deutsche welle " it is crystal clear -lsb- … -rsb- in scientific research that the chinese investment in all its facets is positive for africa . "
he goes onto say that current investment is doing more to strengthen economies than democracy and good governance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is helping africa develop its infrastructure .
the chinese news agency xinhua estimates that there are currently one million chinese immigrants in africa .
their growing presence is more often than not unwelcome as is shown by attacks on immigrants in nigeria and angola .
most zambians complain that the chinese community isolates itself .
chinese immigrants have not been as successful as indians or other immigrants in integrating in africa , however asche says that both locals and immigrants are responsible for the integration of the chinese migrants .
the role of germany and europe asche feels that germany should do more to get involved in africa : " … the german investors should -lsb- … -rsb- be encouraged to become as courageous as the chinese are .
it is a crystal clear fact that china and its investors and not only the state-owned companies but also private investors see the african market a lot more positive than do quite a number of investors from european countries , and the germans are certainly not among the most courageous . "
in addition to those fears , asche attributes the lack of increased trade between the two continents to the european union 's trade policy , which does not treat africa as an equal partner as china does : “ -lsb- eu trade policy -rsb- is a good example of how not to deal with partner countries and by way of comparison china all of a sudden stands out as , trade policy-wise , a fair partner to africa in comparison with the eu . "
asche says that the growing trade between china and africa is " an irreversible expression of the new multi-polar world , and european powers -lsb- … -rsb- simply have to learn to live in this multi-polar environment in which there is no longer an exclusive relationship between the eu , the us and africa . "

" the spyker leadership has submitted a renewed offer in the hopes of securing a future for saab , its employees and the brand - despite the announcement that the winding down of saab would begin , " the company said in a statement . spyker said it hoped " the renewed offer would remove each of the obstacles that were standing in the way of a swift transaction . "
the company 's chief executive , victor muller , said its revised bid included an 11-point proposal addressing issues that arose during the due diligence process . " we have made every effort to resolve the issues that were preventing the conclusion of this matter and we have asked gm and all other involved parties to seriously consider this offer , " said muller .
he added that the new offer eliminates the need for loan approval by the european investment bank -lrb- eib -rrb- prior to year end , which would allow the deal to be concluded within gm 's original december 31 deadline . while muller did not reveal any details about the financing of the new offer , he said spyker 's bid would remain valid until 11pm central european time -lrb- 5pm eastern time -rrb- on monday . several suitors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so far only small carmakers have shown real interest in acquiring saab on its website , general motors said it had received inquiries from several potential bidders since friday 's announcement that it would start the orderly closure of saab .

the company 's global distribution network is comprised of 1,100 dealerships . gm has been trying to sell the unit since the start of the year .
swedish luxury carmaker koenigsegg , which builds around 18 high-end sports cars a year , pulled out of a deal to buy saab last month , citing costly delays . like koenigsegg , spyker is also a premium niche manufacturer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press review -pipe- 21.12.2009 copenhagen 's legacy : bitter disappointment , with a glimmer of hope großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : editorialists acknowledged that copenhagen was a disappointment after the widely disappointing un climate conference in copenhagen - aka ' flopenhagen ' - european editorialists let the bitter comments flow .
some found a silver lining , however . the newspaper de volkskrant from holland acknowledged that copenhagen delivered a disappointing result but focused on the positive : the fact that at least the problem is being addressed .
" climate change is now an international problem par excellence .
it seems inevitable that all countries will be brought into negotiations sooner or later .
at the same time , it is nearly impossible to get 192 states of varying size and with diverse interests to reach a unified stance . "
" but there is a glimmer of hope .
all of the participants in the climate conference know that the talks will continue .
and possibly , those actors will be watched by the public and by activists and ngos with a more critical eye than they have been up to now .
because one thing was attained for certain : the climate will never disappear from the political agenda . "
likewise , britain 's guardian newspaper saw positives alongside negatives in the outcome of the conference .
on the bad side : " a considered reading of the accord , which was its only tangible output , reveals that it is not just inadequate but in fact utterly empty . "
on the plus side , however , is " the novel manner in which this ultimate failure was reached . "
" as the sight of the daily chaos -lrb- of copenhagen -rrb- drops out of view , it becomes easier to appreciate that the rich world was forced to haggle with the bigger emerging economies on more equal terms than ever before . "
in other words , " while the copenhagen product is every inch the sham that campaigners say it is , the copenhagen process has set important precedents , " the guardian wrote .
" most obviously … the sheer fact that it took place – and at such a high political level – means it will probably do so again . "
taking a harsher line , left-leaning french newspaper la libération oozed disappointment in the " large countries which , in a delirium of diplomatic ineptitude and the blindness of superiority , torpedoed the binding worldwide accord " they had hoped for . the paper pitched for the eu to take immediate , unilateral action : " eco-reformers need to focus on the us and china , " it wrote ; " after that come the nations that are a bit more environmentally aware , particularly in europe .
but these can not wait until there is an international agreement .
it is much more important for them to become instructive with their actions .
if the eu took the necessary actions from its side , it would jump to the head of the movement .
then the fiasco of copenhagen could be overcome step by step . " in switzerland , zurich 's tages-anzeiger also focused on results ; those who come up with solutions will ultimately benefit in the end , the paper wrote .
at the conference , " concrete solutions were presented on how to reach a climate-friendly future and at the same time remain economically profitable .
numerous companies seemed to have little patience for the political lethargy … the biggest climate-change effect will be felt by those companies and countries that start preparing now .
they will be the ultimate winners , " the paper said .
german editorialists were less inclined to focus on positive signals from the conference .
the sueddeutsche zeitung called the copenhagen summit an " insult to the world community , " noting that " never were expectations for a climate conference higher , and never before were so many heads of state and government officials in one place , meeting to solve one single problem .
but they did n't solve it - they made it worse . "
" as if they were replaying an old , bad film , the heads of the most powerful nations came up with aid funds to silence the developing nations .
they bought their way out .
instead of mutually promising a much-needed rejection of the destructive path of economic development , they agreed on a vague and distant goal .
it is like agreeing on a place to meet , but not a time . "
meanwhile , advocating a just-do-it approach in the wake of the talks , the frankfurter rundschau sent a strong warning to voters and the politicians they elect : " there is no point in allowing the un climate conference circus to continue its performances .
the only chance that remains is for the big heat-producers of the planet to lead by example - without any stipulations about taking others along for the ride , if need be .
fifteen countries on earth are responsible for 80 percent of c02 emissions around the world ; in copenhagen they all said how important climate protection is to them .
now , the politicians of these countries need to make the necessary changes .
and if they do n't the voters have to deal with it - and vote them out of office ... "
finally , the stuttgarter zeitung expressed the disappointment felt by many in europe when they compared us president barack obama 's focus on china and other developing countries with his relative lack of interest in the european negotatiors .
in the wake of the conference , " we need to keep up the ambition of climate protection , and keep the expectations in a realistic framework , " the paper wrote .
" but one prerequisite for this is the recognition that it will be really hard for europe to effectively influence the usa .
the trans-atlantic relationship is coming up on hard times .
barack obama showed one thing for certain in copenhagen : his focus will be on the trans-pacific axis with china .

this move has cast doubt on a crucial international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and eu-led 7.5 billion euro bailout for the recession-hit state .
the pension cuts have been in force since july , and constitutional court chief gunars kutris says they take away anywhere between 10 and 70 percent of old-age pensions depending on an individual 's status .
kurtis said the measures were illegal and that parliament must have measures in place to refund the cuts by march 2010 .
" violation " of social security and rule of law in its judgement , the court stated that " the decision to cut pensions violated the individual 's right to social security and the principle of the rule of law . "
it added that agreements with international lenders in and of themselves can not be used as an argument to limit basic rights .
the court 's ruling in the case is final and can not be appealed .
the case was brought to the court by 9,000 individual pensioners .
it has been ruled that the money itself must be paid back in full no later than 2015 .
the sum is estimated around 100 million lats -lrb- 140 million euros -rrb- .
currently , latvia is in the middle of one of the deepest recessions in the european union , with its economy expected to shrink by up to 18 percent this year .
over the past year , its government has been raising taxes and reducing public spending as it attempts to stick to the terms of the imf / eu bailout .
under the deal , latvia pledged to cut 500 million lats -lrb- 702 million euros -rrb- every year until 2012. mk / afp / reuters editor : ranty islam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this is part of a larger effort by egypt to reclaim its ancient treasures . egypt 's chief antiquities official zahi hawass says he will make a formal request for the return of the bust of queen nefertiti from berlin 's neues museum .
in a statement released sunday , hawass said he was presented with documents by the head of the berlin neues museum , where the bust is currently on display , which supported his claim that the statue is in germany illegally . german archeologist acted “ unethically ” according to hawass , the documents confirmed that the german archeologist ludwig borchardt produced fraudulent papers to secure the 3,300 year old bust for berlin in 1913 .
borchardt , who discovered the bust , tried to pass off the artefact as a less significant find in order to take it out of egypt .
“ these materials confirm egypt 's contention that borchardt did act unethically , with intent to deceive , ” the statement said .
“ the limestone head of the queen is listed on the protocol as a painted plaster bust of a princess . ”
the statement went on to say that friederike seyfried , a museum director who oversees the section where the bust is on display , would assist in negotiations between hawass and german officials .
however , in a statement released december 18 by the museum 's operators , the prussian cultural heritage foundation , it was said that , while seyfried would meet with hawass in cairo soon , she would not discuss nefertiti 's return , since the documents showed the prussian state acquired the bust lawfully and egypt had no legal claim for its return .
new campaign for return of artefacts despite the claims of the foundation , hawass says he is optimistic about the bust 's return .
“ i always ask for artefacts to come and it always happens ” he told reuters .
the push for nefertiti 's return is part of a larger effort for egypt to reclaim its ancient artefacts .

this move has cast doubt on a crucial international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and eu-led 7.5 billion euro bailout for the recession-hit state .
the pension cuts have been in force since july , and constitutional court chief gunars kutris says they take away anywhere between 10 and 70 percent of old-age pensions depending on an individual 's status .
kurtis said the measures were illegal and that parliament must have measures in place to refund the cuts by march 2010 .
" violation " of social security and rule of law in its judgement , the court stated that " the decision to cut pensions violated the individual 's right to social security and the principle of the rule of law . "
it added that agreements with international lenders in and of themselves can not be used as an argument to limit basic rights .
the court 's ruling in the case is final and can not be appealed .
the case was brought to the court by 9,000 individual pensioners .
it has been ruled that the money itself must be paid back in full no later than 2015 .
the sum is estimated around 100 million lats -lrb- 140 million euros -rrb- .
currently , latvia is in the middle of one of the deepest recessions in the european union , with its economy expected to shrink by up to 18 percent this year .
over the past year , its government has been raising taxes and reducing public spending as it attempts to stick to the terms of the imf / eu bailout .
under the deal , latvia pledged to cut 500 million lats -lrb- 702 million euros -rrb- every year until 2012. mk / afp / reuters editor : ranty islam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

china has been investing heavily in the african market and is keen to stress the benefits to local businesses .
is that involvement an opportunity or a risk to africa ’ s development and is europe being left behind ? on the copperbelt in zambia , investment in luanshya mine by china 's non-ferrous meter mining group corporation -lrb- nfca -rrb- has been welcomed by locals .
a veteran of the mining industry who wanted to remain anonymous told deutsche welle that " -lsb- s -rsb- o far -lsb- the chinese investors -rsb- are good guys because they are putting -lsb- in -rsb- a lot of money before production starts . "
for a small town whose future appeared bleak when mining production was shut down , the creation of an estimated 3,000 jobs is good news .
the warm welcome of chinese investment in luanshya is in stark contrast to the anti-chinese sentiment in a town less than an hour away .
the memory of a mine explosion that left 46 dead still lingers in chambeshi .
for many , graves located close to the mine are a daily reminder of the deaths of a colleague or loved one .
more than four years after the incident , the community remains ambivalent about the reopening of the plant where the explosion occurred even if it will bring many jobs to the area .
some still feel that their chinese employers are to blame for the incident .
mukuka chilufya , a safety officer who participated in rescue operations following the explosion , told deutsche welle that " maybe they could have received a bulk order and they were running out of time .
so the night shift that were involved in the male dyke collided with the day shift that were involved in the female dyke .
in fact , what is going to confirm that is that the chinese who were knowledgeable of the consequences all were not in the factory when the explosion took place because they knew that something like that could happen . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is investing heavily in africa 's mining industry most of the criticism surrounding china 's involvement in africa debate has been on the working conditions of the miners who are subjected to low wages and questionable safety procedures .
the incident at chambishi mine in zambia in april 2005 drew attention to this .
but as professor helmut asche , director of the institute for african studies at the university of leipzig , notes these conditions are no different from those that miners in northern china are subjected to .
since beijing is unable to control the working conditions of its citizens , african governments are responsible for exerting effective control over chinese investors so that they implement fair wages and adequate safety procedures .
benefits , implications of chinese investment china 's african policy states that it intends to be africa 's equal -lrb- economic -rrb- partner .
experts like he wenping , director of the institute of west-asian and african studies at the chinese academy of social science in beijing , say that china 's goals in africa are more political than economic .
according to asche , a change in china 's africa foreign policy began after the tiananmen square massacre when china needed more foreign allies .
china 's current african partners , who are in the group of 77 , provide it with more influence in the united nations .
asche feels that the import of cheap goods from china can have very different effects as is the case with the south african textile industry and the ethiopian footwear industry .
the protection of local industry in south africa meant that the manufacturers did not modernize their techniques in order to be able to compete successfully with the chinese imports .

china has been investing heavily in the african market and is keen to stress the benefits to local businesses .
is that involvement an opportunity or a risk to africa ’ s development and is europe being left behind ? on the copperbelt in zambia , investment in luanshya mine by china 's non-ferrous meter mining group corporation -lrb- nfca -rrb- has been welcomed by locals .
a veteran of the mining industry who wanted to remain anonymous told deutsche welle that " -lsb- s -rsb- o far -lsb- the chinese investors -rsb- are good guys because they are putting -lsb- in -rsb- a lot of money before production starts . "
for a small town whose future appeared bleak when mining production was shut down , the creation of an estimated 3,000 jobs is good news .
the warm welcome of chinese investment in luanshya is in stark contrast to the anti-chinese sentiment in a town less than an hour away .
the memory of a mine explosion that left 46 dead still lingers in chambeshi .
for many , graves located close to the mine are a daily reminder of the deaths of a colleague or loved one .
more than four years after the incident , the community remains ambivalent about the reopening of the plant where the explosion occurred even if it will bring many jobs to the area .
some still feel that their chinese employers are to blame for the incident .
mukuka chilufya , a safety officer who participated in rescue operations following the explosion , told deutsche welle that " maybe they could have received a bulk order and they were running out of time .
so the night shift that were involved in the male dyke collided with the day shift that were involved in the female dyke .
in fact , what is going to confirm that is that the chinese who were knowledgeable of the consequences all were not in the factory when the explosion took place because they knew that something like that could happen . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is investing heavily in africa 's mining industry most of the criticism surrounding china 's involvement in africa debate has been on the working conditions of the miners who are subjected to low wages and questionable safety procedures .
the incident at chambishi mine in zambia in april 2005 drew attention to this .
but as professor helmut asche , director of the institute for african studies at the university of leipzig , notes these conditions are no different from those that miners in northern china are subjected to .
since beijing is unable to control the working conditions of its citizens , african governments are responsible for exerting effective control over chinese investors so that they implement fair wages and adequate safety procedures .
benefits , implications of chinese investment china 's african policy states that it intends to be africa 's equal -lrb- economic -rrb- partner .
experts like he wenping , director of the institute of west-asian and african studies at the chinese academy of social science in beijing , say that china 's goals in africa are more political than economic .
according to asche , a change in china 's africa foreign policy began after the tiananmen square massacre when china needed more foreign allies .
china 's current african partners , who are in the group of 77 , provide it with more influence in the united nations .
asche feels that the import of cheap goods from china can have very different effects as is the case with the south african textile industry and the ethiopian footwear industry .
the protection of local industry in south africa meant that the manufacturers did not modernize their techniques in order to be able to compete successfully with the chinese imports .
on the other hand , in ethiopia where the local footwear manufacturing industry was not protected , production became more competitive and now ethiopia is exporting footwear to china .
zambians often say that " you thank the person who guides you at night when it is dawn . "
the relationship between china and africa is still in its infancy , but as asche told deutsche welle " it is crystal clear -lsb- … -rsb- in scientific research that the chinese investment in all its facets is positive for africa . "

" climate change is now an international problem par excellence .
it seems inevitable that all countries will be brought into negotiations sooner or later .
at the same time , it is nearly impossible to get 192 states of varying size and with diverse interests to reach a unified stance . "
" but there is a glimmer of hope .
all of the participants in the climate conference know that the talks will continue .
and possibly , those actors will be watched by the public and by activists and ngos with a more critical eye than they have been up to now .
because one thing was attained for certain : the climate will never disappear from the political agenda . "
likewise , britain 's guardian newspaper saw positives alongside negatives in the outcome of the conference .
on the bad side : " a considered reading of the accord , which was its only tangible output , reveals that it is not just inadequate but in fact utterly empty . "
on the plus side , however , is " the novel manner in which this ultimate failure was reached . "
" as the sight of the daily chaos -lrb- of copenhagen -rrb- drops out of view , it becomes easier to appreciate that the rich world was forced to haggle with the bigger emerging economies on more equal terms than ever before . "
in other words , " while the copenhagen product is every inch the sham that campaigners say it is , the copenhagen process has set important precedents , " the guardian wrote .

it is much more important for them to become instructive with their actions .
if the eu took the necessary actions from its side , it would jump to the head of the movement .

numerous companies seemed to have little patience for the political lethargy … the biggest climate-change effect will be felt by those companies and countries that start preparing now .
they will be the ultimate winners , " the paper said .
german editorialists were less inclined to focus on positive signals from the conference .
the sueddeutsche zeitung called the copenhagen summit an " insult to the world community , " noting that " never were expectations for a climate conference higher , and never before were so many heads of state and government officials in one place , meeting to solve one single problem .

they bought their way out .
instead of mutually promising a much-needed rejection of the destructive path of economic development , they agreed on a vague and distant goal .
it is like agreeing on a place to meet , but not a time . "
meanwhile , advocating a just-do-it approach in the wake of the talks , the frankfurter rundschau sent a strong warning to voters and the politicians they elect : " there is no point in allowing the un climate conference circus to continue its performances .

some found a silver lining , however . the newspaper de volkskrant from holland acknowledged that copenhagen delivered a disappointing result but focused on the positive : the fact that at least the problem is being addressed .
" climate change is now an international problem par excellence .
it seems inevitable that all countries will be brought into negotiations sooner or later .
at the same time , it is nearly impossible to get 192 states of varying size and with diverse interests to reach a unified stance . "
" but there is a glimmer of hope .
all of the participants in the climate conference know that the talks will continue .
and possibly , those actors will be watched by the public and by activists and ngos with a more critical eye than they have been up to now .
because one thing was attained for certain : the climate will never disappear from the political agenda . "
likewise , britain 's guardian newspaper saw positives alongside negatives in the outcome of the conference .
on the bad side : " a considered reading of the accord , which was its only tangible output , reveals that it is not just inadequate but in fact utterly empty . "
on the plus side , however , is " the novel manner in which this ultimate failure was reached . "
" as the sight of the daily chaos -lrb- of copenhagen -rrb- drops out of view , it becomes easier to appreciate that the rich world was forced to haggle with the bigger emerging economies on more equal terms than ever before . "
in other words , " while the copenhagen product is every inch the sham that campaigners say it is , the copenhagen process has set important precedents , " the guardian wrote .
" most obviously … the sheer fact that it took place – and at such a high political level – means it will probably do so again . "
taking a harsher line , left-leaning french newspaper la libération oozed disappointment in the " large countries which , in a delirium of diplomatic ineptitude and the blindness of superiority , torpedoed the binding worldwide accord " they had hoped for . the paper pitched for the eu to take immediate , unilateral action : " eco-reformers need to focus on the us and china , " it wrote ; " after that come the nations that are a bit more environmentally aware , particularly in europe .
but these can not wait until there is an international agreement .
it is much more important for them to become instructive with their actions .
if the eu took the necessary actions from its side , it would jump to the head of the movement .

this move has cast doubt on a crucial international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and eu-led 7.5 billion euro bailout for the recession-hit state .
the pension cuts have been in force since july , and constitutional court chief gunars kutris says they take away anywhere between 10 and 70 percent of old-age pensions depending on an individual 's status .
kurtis said the measures were illegal and that parliament must have measures in place to refund the cuts by march 2010 .
" violation " of social security and rule of law in its judgement , the court stated that " the decision to cut pensions violated the individual 's right to social security and the principle of the rule of law . "
it added that agreements with international lenders in and of themselves can not be used as an argument to limit basic rights .
the court 's ruling in the case is final and can not be appealed .
the case was brought to the court by 9,000 individual pensioners .
it has been ruled that the money itself must be paid back in full no later than 2015 .
the sum is estimated around 100 million lats -lrb- 140 million euros -rrb- .
currently , latvia is in the middle of one of the deepest recessions in the european union , with its economy expected to shrink by up to 18 percent this year .
over the past year , its government has been raising taxes and reducing public spending as it attempts to stick to the terms of the imf / eu bailout .
under the deal , latvia pledged to cut 500 million lats -lrb- 702 million euros -rrb- every year until 2012. mk / afp / reuters editor : ranty islam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de awards -pipe- 21.12.2009 sports journalists name athletes of the year in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul biedermann and steffi nerius show off their awards in a tradition that dates back to 1947 , german sports journalists have voted on the man , woman , and team who impacted the world of german sports the most over the past twelve months . all told , around 1400 journalists cast their ballots for the german sports awards , which were presented at a ceremony sunday night in baden baden .
in 2009 , the spotlight fell on one of the female stars from this summer 's world athletics championships in berlin , the only man to beat michael phelps in a major swimming competition since 2005 , and the women 's national soccer team for their clear dominance over their european competitors .
steffi nerius throws for gold after the opening weekend of the world athletics championships in august , the biggest star to emerge from berlin 's olympic stadium was usain bolt , whose record-breaking 100-meter dash on the competition 's second day captivated germans and out-of-town visitors alike .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nerius 's first throw was good enough for gold two days later , bolt had competition for the newspaper headlines , and it was from a member of the home team .
when steffi nerius stepped to the line of the finals in the javelin competition , germany had yet to produce a single gold medal winner .
tournament organizers had staggered the events so there was a german gold medal hopeful on each of the nine days of competition , but on the fourth day , they were still waiting for the first german champion .
nerius 's first throw of the finals sailed 67.30 meters , which held as the best mark throughout the entire competition .
when eventual czech silver medalist barbora spotakova 's final throw of the event failed to beat nerius ' mark , nerius raised her arms in the air and celebrated germany 's first gold of the competition , with a stadium full of loud supporters cheering her on .
it was the first world championship gold medal of the 37-year-old 's career .
before the world championships began , there had been fears that germany would repeat its performance from the beijing olympics and come up short in the medals column .
but after nerius set the precedent , german athletes went on to take home a total of two gold , three silver , and four bronze medals , which represented a successful competition for the host nation .
paul biedermann upsets michael phelps new world records were practically a drop in the deep end at the world swimming championships in rome last july .
controversial new swimsuits , made partially or entirely out of polyurethane , seemed to be giving swimmers who wore them a slight edge , and as a result , 43 world records fell at the meet in rome .
bildunterschrift : biedermann bested the world record - and michael phelps - in the 200m freestyle paul biedermann grabbed two of those records , and they happened to be two of the most impressive of the entire competition .
wearing a full-body polyurethane suit , biedermann bested legendary australian swimmer ian thorpe 's world record in the 400 meter freestyle , a mark that many in the sport thought would be safe for many years .
biedermann 's next record was even more impressive , especially because of the man he handily beat in the race .
in the 200 ´ -meter freestyle , biedermann shattered american michael phelps 's world record time by over a second , and handed phelps his only silver medal in world or olympic competition since 2005 .
phelps did n't wear one of the all-polyurethane suits against biedermann , but still praised the 23-year-old german 's performance .
" paul swam a great race .
i did not have anything in the last 50 meters , " phelps said after the swim .
" in the race i was beaten by the swimmer , not the suit . "
starting in 2010 , swimming 's governing body fina will implement a ban on all-polyurethane suits , but eight-time beijing gold medallist michael phelps has a new top rival for next season : germany 's paul biedermann .
women 's national team wins european championships german soccer fans remember well the impressive march by bundesliga squad vfl wolfsburg to the german championship at the end of the 2008/2009 bundesliga season .
it was the first title in the team 's history .
but to be considered germany 's best team of the year , one title just is n't enough .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inka grings had six goals to celebrate at this year 's european championship seven is more appropriate - the number of titles the german women 's national soccer team has after winning the 2009 european championship in finland by convincingly beating england 6-2 in the final .
winning yet another title continued an impressive streak for the german women .

in 2009 , the spotlight fell on one of the female stars from this summer 's world athletics championships in berlin , the only man to beat michael phelps in a major swimming competition since 2005 , and the women 's national soccer team for their clear dominance over their european competitors .
steffi nerius throws for gold after the opening weekend of the world athletics championships in august , the biggest star to emerge from berlin 's olympic stadium was usain bolt , whose record-breaking 100-meter dash on the competition 's second day captivated germans and out-of-town visitors alike .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nerius 's first throw was good enough for gold two days later , bolt had competition for the newspaper headlines , and it was from a member of the home team .
when steffi nerius stepped to the line of the finals in the javelin competition , germany had yet to produce a single gold medal winner .
tournament organizers had staggered the events so there was a german gold medal hopeful on each of the nine days of competition , but on the fourth day , they were still waiting for the first german champion .
nerius 's first throw of the finals sailed 67.30 meters , which held as the best mark throughout the entire competition .
when eventual czech silver medalist barbora spotakova 's final throw of the event failed to beat nerius ' mark , nerius raised her arms in the air and celebrated germany 's first gold of the competition , with a stadium full of loud supporters cheering her on .
it was the first world championship gold medal of the 37-year-old 's career .
before the world championships began , there had been fears that germany would repeat its performance from the beijing olympics and come up short in the medals column .
but after nerius set the precedent , german athletes went on to take home a total of two gold , three silver , and four bronze medals , which represented a successful competition for the host nation .
paul biedermann upsets michael phelps new world records were practically a drop in the deep end at the world swimming championships in rome last july .
controversial new swimsuits , made partially or entirely out of polyurethane , seemed to be giving swimmers who wore them a slight edge , and as a result , 43 world records fell at the meet in rome .
bildunterschrift : biedermann bested the world record - and michael phelps - in the 200m freestyle paul biedermann grabbed two of those records , and they happened to be two of the most impressive of the entire competition .
wearing a full-body polyurethane suit , biedermann bested legendary australian swimmer ian thorpe 's world record in the 400 meter freestyle , a mark that many in the sport thought would be safe for many years .
biedermann 's next record was even more impressive , especially because of the man he handily beat in the race .
in the 200 ´ -meter freestyle , biedermann shattered american michael phelps 's world record time by over a second , and handed phelps his only silver medal in world or olympic competition since 2005 .
phelps did n't wear one of the all-polyurethane suits against biedermann , but still praised the 23-year-old german 's performance .
" paul swam a great race .
i did not have anything in the last 50 meters , " phelps said after the swim .
" in the race i was beaten by the swimmer , not the suit . "
starting in 2010 , swimming 's governing body fina will implement a ban on all-polyurethane suits , but eight-time beijing gold medallist michael phelps has a new top rival for next season : germany 's paul biedermann .
women 's national team wins european championships german soccer fans remember well the impressive march by bundesliga squad vfl wolfsburg to the german championship at the end of the 2008/2009 bundesliga season .
it was the first title in the team 's history .
but to be considered germany 's best team of the year , one title just is n't enough .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inka grings had six goals to celebrate at this year 's european championship seven is more appropriate - the number of titles the german women 's national soccer team has after winning the 2009 european championship in finland by convincingly beating england 6-2 in the final .
winning yet another title continued an impressive streak for the german women .
in european championship competition , the team remains unbeaten since 1995 .
that 's a total of 26 matches , and five titles in a row .
in fact , since the first women 's european championship took place in 1984 , only two other countries - sweden once and norway twice - have won the title other than germany .

the thieves had cut the sign into three pieces . police in krakow , southern poland , told reporters on monday it was too early to tell what the motive behind the theft of the auschwitz sign really was .
however , the five suspects arrested when the sign was recovered are not members of a neo-nazi group .
the men do have criminal records for either violence or theft . " we can say that none of the five are members of a neo-nazi group , " andrzej rokita , district police chief in the city of krakow , told a news conference .
" their intent was undoubtedly robbery related .
we will be able to decide later whether the crime was ordered or whether they acted on their own initiative . " the five men , aged 20 to 39 , are believed to have stolen the infamous " arbeit macht frei " sign , which hung over the entrance to the nazi death camp auschwitz , at dawn on friday .
police recovered the sign , cut into three pieces , near the home of one of the suspects . " the sign had been cut into three pieces at the site of the theft , to make it easier to transport .
it had been hidden in a wood near the home of one of the thieves , " rokita said . when intact , the sign was five meters long .
its cynical message " work sets you free " became a symbol of the efforts of the nazis to deceive their victims .
over a million people , mostly jews , perished in the nazi death camp in southern poland during world war two - most of the site became a museum and memorial after the war ended . intensive search the five alleged thieves were captured after poland stepped up border security , set up roadblocks , deployed a team of around 40 forensic experts and sought the help of international policing bodies interpol and europol in a bid to recover the sign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the museum soon put this image right , hanging a replica sign on the gates as an interim solution the auschwitz museum offered a 100,000-zloty reward -lrb- 24,000 euros or $ 34,000 -rrb- for information which would help to recapture the sign , and polish police offered a further 5,000 zlotys . friday 's theft sparked condemnation from world leaders , jewish groups and holocaust survivors . " a worldwide symbol of the cynicism of hitler 's executioners and the martyrdom of their victims has been stolen , " polish president lech kaczynski said after the theft . auschwitz , visited by one million people last year , was one of a network of camps set up to kill some 6 million jews , along with members of other ethnic , religious , political , or social groups that hitler 's regime wanted to eliminate . msh / afp / ap / reuters editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

china has been investing heavily in the african market and is keen to stress the benefits to local businesses .

a veteran of the mining industry who wanted to remain anonymous told deutsche welle that " -lsb- s -rsb- o far -lsb- the chinese investors -rsb- are good guys because they are putting -lsb- in -rsb- a lot of money before production starts . "
for a small town whose future appeared bleak when mining production was shut down , the creation of an estimated 3,000 jobs is good news .
the warm welcome of chinese investment in luanshya is in stark contrast to the anti-chinese sentiment in a town less than an hour away .
the memory of a mine explosion that left 46 dead still lingers in chambeshi .
for many , graves located close to the mine are a daily reminder of the deaths of a colleague or loved one .
more than four years after the incident , the community remains ambivalent about the reopening of the plant where the explosion occurred even if it will bring many jobs to the area .
some still feel that their chinese employers are to blame for the incident .
mukuka chilufya , a safety officer who participated in rescue operations following the explosion , told deutsche welle that " maybe they could have received a bulk order and they were running out of time .
so the night shift that were involved in the male dyke collided with the day shift that were involved in the female dyke .
in fact , what is going to confirm that is that the chinese who were knowledgeable of the consequences all were not in the factory when the explosion took place because they knew that something like that could happen . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is investing heavily in africa 's mining industry most of the criticism surrounding china 's involvement in africa debate has been on the working conditions of the miners who are subjected to low wages and questionable safety procedures .
the incident at chambishi mine in zambia in april 2005 drew attention to this .
but as professor helmut asche , director of the institute for african studies at the university of leipzig , notes these conditions are no different from those that miners in northern china are subjected to .
since beijing is unable to control the working conditions of its citizens , african governments are responsible for exerting effective control over chinese investors so that they implement fair wages and adequate safety procedures .
benefits , implications of chinese investment china 's african policy states that it intends to be africa 's equal -lrb- economic -rrb- partner .
experts like he wenping , director of the institute of west-asian and african studies at the chinese academy of social science in beijing , say that china 's goals in africa are more political than economic .
according to asche , a change in china 's africa foreign policy began after the tiananmen square massacre when china needed more foreign allies .
china 's current african partners , who are in the group of 77 , provide it with more influence in the united nations .
asche feels that the import of cheap goods from china can have very different effects as is the case with the south african textile industry and the ethiopian footwear industry .
the protection of local industry in south africa meant that the manufacturers did not modernize their techniques in order to be able to compete successfully with the chinese imports .
on the other hand , in ethiopia where the local footwear manufacturing industry was not protected , production became more competitive and now ethiopia is exporting footwear to china .
zambians often say that " you thank the person who guides you at night when it is dawn . "
the relationship between china and africa is still in its infancy , but as asche told deutsche welle " it is crystal clear -lsb- … -rsb- in scientific research that the chinese investment in all its facets is positive for africa . "
he goes onto say that current investment is doing more to strengthen economies than democracy and good governance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is helping africa develop its infrastructure .
the chinese news agency xinhua estimates that there are currently one million chinese immigrants in africa .
their growing presence is more often than not unwelcome as is shown by attacks on immigrants in nigeria and angola .
most zambians complain that the chinese community isolates itself .
chinese immigrants have not been as successful as indians or other immigrants in integrating in africa , however asche says that both locals and immigrants are responsible for the integration of the chinese migrants .
the role of germany and europe asche feels that germany should do more to get involved in africa : " … the german investors should -lsb- … -rsb- be encouraged to become as courageous as the chinese are .
it is a crystal clear fact that china and its investors and not only the state-owned companies but also private investors see the african market a lot more positive than do quite a number of investors from european countries , and the germans are certainly not among the most courageous . "
in addition to those fears , asche attributes the lack of increased trade between the two continents to the european union 's trade policy , which does not treat africa as an equal partner as china does : “ -lsb- eu trade policy -rsb- is a good example of how not to deal with partner countries and by way of comparison china all of a sudden stands out as , trade policy-wise , a fair partner to africa in comparison with the eu . "
asche says that the growing trade between china and africa is " an irreversible expression of the new multi-polar world , and european powers -lsb- … -rsb- simply have to learn to live in this multi-polar environment in which there is no longer an exclusive relationship between the eu , the us and africa .

china has been investing heavily in the african market and is keen to stress the benefits to local businesses .
is that involvement an opportunity or a risk to africa ’ s development and is europe being left behind ? on the copperbelt in zambia , investment in luanshya mine by china 's non-ferrous meter mining group corporation -lrb- nfca -rrb- has been welcomed by locals .
a veteran of the mining industry who wanted to remain anonymous told deutsche welle that " -lsb- s -rsb- o far -lsb- the chinese investors -rsb- are good guys because they are putting -lsb- in -rsb- a lot of money before production starts . "
for a small town whose future appeared bleak when mining production was shut down , the creation of an estimated 3,000 jobs is good news .
the warm welcome of chinese investment in luanshya is in stark contrast to the anti-chinese sentiment in a town less than an hour away .
the memory of a mine explosion that left 46 dead still lingers in chambeshi .
for many , graves located close to the mine are a daily reminder of the deaths of a colleague or loved one .
more than four years after the incident , the community remains ambivalent about the reopening of the plant where the explosion occurred even if it will bring many jobs to the area .
some still feel that their chinese employers are to blame for the incident .
mukuka chilufya , a safety officer who participated in rescue operations following the explosion , told deutsche welle that " maybe they could have received a bulk order and they were running out of time .
so the night shift that were involved in the male dyke collided with the day shift that were involved in the female dyke .
in fact , what is going to confirm that is that the chinese who were knowledgeable of the consequences all were not in the factory when the explosion took place because they knew that something like that could happen . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is investing heavily in africa 's mining industry most of the criticism surrounding china 's involvement in africa debate has been on the working conditions of the miners who are subjected to low wages and questionable safety procedures .
the incident at chambishi mine in zambia in april 2005 drew attention to this .
but as professor helmut asche , director of the institute for african studies at the university of leipzig , notes these conditions are no different from those that miners in northern china are subjected to .
since beijing is unable to control the working conditions of its citizens , african governments are responsible for exerting effective control over chinese investors so that they implement fair wages and adequate safety procedures .
benefits , implications of chinese investment china 's african policy states that it intends to be africa 's equal -lrb- economic -rrb- partner .
experts like he wenping , director of the institute of west-asian and african studies at the chinese academy of social science in beijing , say that china 's goals in africa are more political than economic .
according to asche , a change in china 's africa foreign policy began after the tiananmen square massacre when china needed more foreign allies .
china 's current african partners , who are in the group of 77 , provide it with more influence in the united nations .
asche feels that the import of cheap goods from china can have very different effects as is the case with the south african textile industry and the ethiopian footwear industry .
the protection of local industry in south africa meant that the manufacturers did not modernize their techniques in order to be able to compete successfully with the chinese imports .
on the other hand , in ethiopia where the local footwear manufacturing industry was not protected , production became more competitive and now ethiopia is exporting footwear to china .
zambians often say that " you thank the person who guides you at night when it is dawn . "
the relationship between china and africa is still in its infancy , but as asche told deutsche welle " it is crystal clear -lsb- … -rsb- in scientific research that the chinese investment in all its facets is positive for africa . "
he goes onto say that current investment is doing more to strengthen economies than democracy and good governance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is helping africa develop its infrastructure .
the chinese news agency xinhua estimates that there are currently one million chinese immigrants in africa .
their growing presence is more often than not unwelcome as is shown by attacks on immigrants in nigeria and angola .
most zambians complain that the chinese community isolates itself .
chinese immigrants have not been as successful as indians or other immigrants in integrating in africa , however asche says that both locals and immigrants are responsible for the integration of the chinese migrants .
the role of germany and europe asche feels that germany should do more to get involved in africa : " … the german investors should -lsb- … -rsb- be encouraged to become as courageous as the chinese are .
it is a crystal clear fact that china and its investors and not only the state-owned companies but also private investors see the african market a lot more positive than do quite a number of investors from european countries , and the germans are certainly not among the most courageous . "
in addition to those fears , asche attributes the lack of increased trade between the two continents to the european union 's trade policy , which does not treat africa as an equal partner as china does : “ -lsb- eu trade policy -rsb- is a good example of how not to deal with partner countries and by way of comparison china all of a sudden stands out as , trade policy-wise , a fair partner to africa in comparison with the eu . "
asche says that the growing trade between china and africa is " an irreversible expression of the new multi-polar world , and european powers -lsb- … -rsb- simply have to learn to live in this multi-polar environment in which there is no longer an exclusive relationship between the eu , the us and africa .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 21.12.2009 demjanjuk presents german law with an almost impossible problem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demjanjuk worked in the sobibor concentration camp the demjanjuk trial , which resumed monday , has offered up some awkward moral questions for the german justice system .
but compared with other nazi trials , demjanjuk represents a completely new legal challenge . the trial of john demjanjuk , a ukrainian former prisoner-of-war turned concentration camp guard , has once again lifted the lid on questions about how the german justice system has dealt with the murderers of the holocaust .
not least among these questions is : ' why now ? '
even by the glacial time-scale dictated by the law , the demjanjuk trial has been a long time coming .
the file of evidence against him has not changed since his identity was established in 1993 , when an israeli court cleared him of being a notorious treblinka guard called ivan the terrible .
a single identity card is the main piece of evidence : it shows that demjanjuk was indeed a guard at sobibor , probably between march and september 1943 , and therefore must have helped murder at least 27,900 people thought to have died there in that period .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demjanjuk 's id is the main piece of evidence but the rest of the evidence against demjanjuk is either circumstantial or mitigating .
most of the 35 plaintiffs are simply relatives of those killed at sobibor , and the four actual survivors of the camp are too old to have a reliable memory of him or his immediate actions .
the defense lawyer ulrich busch has repeatedly argued that demjanjuk is also a victim of the nazi regime : as a ukrainian prisoner of war , demjanjuk became a trawniki - one of the many local non-germans trained as guards in the easternmost concentration camps - to avoid starvation .
why now ?
busch also asked the question ' why now ? ' in court in the first days of the trial in early december .
demjanjuk has only been legally pursued for these crimes since 2001 .
busch pointed to the trials of demjanjuk 's superiors that had resulted in acquittals - particularly that of karl streibel , a trawniki recruiter , tried in germany in 1976 and scandalously acquitted after his attorneys successfully argued that he did not know what the guards he trained would be used for .
" how can those that give the orders be innocent , when those that receive them are guilty ? "
busch asked the court .
angelika benz , a phd history student writing a thesis on the concentration camps in eastern poland , visited the first days of the demjanjuk trial and described the central difficulty in blunt terms .
" even though we know what happened at sobibor , the problem is that this crime - the holocaust - simply ca n't be dealt with by our judicial system , " benz told deutsche welle , " this becomes clear when we 're dealing with someone like demjanjuk - someone about whom we know very little . "
with so many facts missing about demjanjuk 's actions and motivations , his judges are forced to redefine the law according to the general and abstract definition of the holocaust itself .
the judges ' answer to busch 's question of how demjanjuk could be considered guilty when the man who may have trained him had been acquitted was simple - the past mistakes of the german judiciary need not be repeated .
this signal that past judgements in nazi trials are irrelevant , even flawed , is apparently necessary if any judgement can be passed on demjanjuk at all .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only the decision-makers were originally put on trial the precedents are useless the historian joerg friedrich became famous when he published two provocative books on the nazi trials in the early 1980 's - " freispruch fuer die nazi-justiz " -lrb- " acquittal for the nazi-judiciary " -rrb- and " die kalte amnestie " -lrb- " the cold amnesty " -rrb- - in which he argued that the german judiciary had failed to bring the nazi perpetrators to justice .
now he believes that the judiciary has come round to his point of view , and is attempting to correct its mistake by going after the last remaining perpetrators with new vigor .
the trial of 88- year-old heinrich boere , a dutch member of the ss , is also currently under way in aachen after decades of legal prevarication and a tireless campaign to bring him to justice .
friedrich believes that the demjanjuk trial illustrates two important developments in the german judiciary 's attitude to the holocaust .
firstly , that it is rethinking , or being forced to rethink , its definition of a holocaust perpetrator .
secondly , that it is prepared to lower the bar of required evidence in order to convict holocaust perpetrators .
but boere 's crime is much easier to define than demjanjuk 's - he is accused of , and has admitted to , three specific acts of murder .
by current german law , this is the crime that demjanjuk will have to be found guilty of if he is to be convicted - of all the crimes that demjanjuk may or may not have committed , murder is the only one that has not exceeded its time-bar limit .
germany lifted that limit on murder in the 1960 's .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinrich boere 's trial is also under way in aachen " this is a problem that judges in the 50 's , 60 's , 70 's and 80 's ignored , " friedrich told deutsche welle , " the majority of holocaust-perpetrators were seen as abetters , those that helped the murderers .
the actual murderers were always defined as hitler , himmler , eichmann - those that made the decision to instigate the holocaust - or those that showed a personal motivation in the act .
murder is not simply killing someone - you must prove intent and motivation to ensure a conviction .
the abetters were those that helped hitler , but had no motives of their own - they simply carried out their tasks . "
this narrow definition of the murderers of the holocaust appears in almost all nazi trial judgements from previous trials .
simply working in a concentration camp never convicted anyone .
but this is all that can be established beyond doubt about demjanjuk .
in order to convict him , the judges will essentially have to redefine murder for the extreme and abstract circumstances of the holocaust .
a long chain " in previous nazi trials , those that were convicted were the so-called ' concentration camp monsters ' - people who had been seen tormenting , abusing , or beating jews before their execution , " friedrich explains , " such actions were considered ' personal contributions ' , and people were convicted not of being abetters to the crime but of being co-perpetrators . "
this goes some way to explaining why so few people were convicted of holocaust crimes in germany .
according to an article in news magazine der spiegel on the legacy of german guilt , of over 100,000 investigations that were carried out in postwar germany into nazi crimes , only around 6,500 people were convicted .
thirteen death sentences were passed , 167 life sentences , and the rest received shorter prison sentences or fines .
only a fifth of those convictions were for murder .
" for the german judiciary , the holocaust only ever existed within the camp gates , " friedrich points out , " but in fact the holocaust was a long chain .
the whole of society played dumb and those that did the bloody work appeared in court . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is investing heavily in africa 's mining industry most of the criticism surrounding china 's involvement in africa debate has been on the working conditions of the miners who are subjected to low wages and questionable safety procedures .
the incident at chambishi mine in zambia in april 2005 drew attention to this .
but as professor helmut asche , director of the institute for african studies at the university of leipzig , notes these conditions are no different from those that miners in northern china are subjected to .
since beijing is unable to control the working conditions of its citizens , african governments are responsible for exerting effective control over chinese investors so that they implement fair wages and adequate safety procedures .
benefits , implications of chinese investment china 's african policy states that it intends to be africa 's equal -lrb- economic -rrb- partner .
experts like he wenping , director of the institute of west-asian and african studies at the chinese academy of social science in beijing , say that china 's goals in africa are more political than economic .
according to asche , a change in china 's africa foreign policy began after the tiananmen square massacre when china needed more foreign allies .
china 's current african partners , who are in the group of 77 , provide it with more influence in the united nations .
asche feels that the import of cheap goods from china can have very different effects as is the case with the south african textile industry and the ethiopian footwear industry .
the protection of local industry in south africa meant that the manufacturers did not modernize their techniques in order to be able to compete successfully with the chinese imports .
on the other hand , in ethiopia where the local footwear manufacturing industry was not protected , production became more competitive and now ethiopia is exporting footwear to china .
zambians often say that " you thank the person who guides you at night when it is dawn . "
the relationship between china and africa is still in its infancy , but as asche told deutsche welle " it is crystal clear -lsb- … -rsb- in scientific research that the chinese investment in all its facets is positive for africa . "
he goes onto say that current investment is doing more to strengthen economies than democracy and good governance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is helping africa develop its infrastructure .
the chinese news agency xinhua estimates that there are currently one million chinese immigrants in africa .
their growing presence is more often than not unwelcome as is shown by attacks on immigrants in nigeria and angola .
most zambians complain that the chinese community isolates itself .
chinese immigrants have not been as successful as indians or other immigrants in integrating in africa , however asche says that both locals and immigrants are responsible for the integration of the chinese migrants .
the role of germany and europe asche feels that germany should do more to get involved in africa : " … the german investors should -lsb- … -rsb- be encouraged to become as courageous as the chinese are .
it is a crystal clear fact that china and its investors and not only the state-owned companies but also private investors see the african market a lot more positive than do quite a number of investors from european countries , and the germans are certainly not among the most courageous . "
in addition to those fears , asche attributes the lack of increased trade between the two continents to the european union 's trade policy , which does not treat africa as an equal partner as china does : “ -lsb- eu trade policy -rsb- is a good example of how not to deal with partner countries and by way of comparison china all of a sudden stands out as , trade policy-wise , a fair partner to africa in comparison with the eu . "
asche says that the growing trade between china and africa is " an irreversible expression of the new multi-polar world , and european powers -lsb- … -rsb- simply have to learn to live in this multi-polar environment in which there is no longer an exclusive relationship between the eu , the us and africa .

according to asche , a change in china 's africa foreign policy began after the tiananmen square massacre when china needed more foreign allies .
china 's current african partners , who are in the group of 77 , provide it with more influence in the united nations .
asche feels that the import of cheap goods from china can have very different effects as is the case with the south african textile industry and the ethiopian footwear industry .
the protection of local industry in south africa meant that the manufacturers did not modernize their techniques in order to be able to compete successfully with the chinese imports .
on the other hand , in ethiopia where the local footwear manufacturing industry was not protected , production became more competitive and now ethiopia is exporting footwear to china .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is investing heavily in africa 's mining industry most of the criticism surrounding china 's involvement in africa debate has been on the working conditions of the miners who are subjected to low wages and questionable safety procedures .
the incident at chambishi mine in zambia in april 2005 drew attention to this .
but as professor helmut asche , director of the institute for african studies at the university of leipzig , notes these conditions are no different from those that miners in northern china are subjected to .
since beijing is unable to control the working conditions of its citizens , african governments are responsible for exerting effective control over chinese investors so that they implement fair wages and adequate safety procedures .
benefits , implications of chinese investment china 's african policy states that it intends to be africa 's equal -lrb- economic -rrb- partner .
experts like he wenping , director of the institute of west-asian and african studies at the chinese academy of social science in beijing , say that china 's goals in africa are more political than economic .
according to asche , a change in china 's africa foreign policy began after the tiananmen square massacre when china needed more foreign allies .
china 's current african partners , who are in the group of 77 , provide it with more influence in the united nations .
asche feels that the import of cheap goods from china can have very different effects as is the case with the south african textile industry and the ethiopian footwear industry .
the protection of local industry in south africa meant that the manufacturers did not modernize their techniques in order to be able to compete successfully with the chinese imports .
on the other hand , in ethiopia where the local footwear manufacturing industry was not protected , production became more competitive and now ethiopia is exporting footwear to china .
zambians often say that " you thank the person who guides you at night when it is dawn . "
the relationship between china and africa is still in its infancy , but as asche told deutsche welle " it is crystal clear -lsb- … -rsb- in scientific research that the chinese investment in all its facets is positive for africa . "
he goes onto say that current investment is doing more to strengthen economies than democracy and good governance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is helping africa develop its infrastructure .
the chinese news agency xinhua estimates that there are currently one million chinese immigrants in africa .
their growing presence is more often than not unwelcome as is shown by attacks on immigrants in nigeria and angola .
most zambians complain that the chinese community isolates itself .
chinese immigrants have not been as successful as indians or other immigrants in integrating in africa , however asche says that both locals and immigrants are responsible for the integration of the chinese migrants .
the role of germany and europe asche feels that germany should do more to get involved in africa : " … the german investors should -lsb- … -rsb- be encouraged to become as courageous as the chinese are .
it is a crystal clear fact that china and its investors and not only the state-owned companies but also private investors see the african market a lot more positive than do quite a number of investors from european countries , and the germans are certainly not among the most courageous . "
in addition to those fears , asche attributes the lack of increased trade between the two continents to the european union 's trade policy , which does not treat africa as an equal partner as china does : “ -lsb- eu trade policy -rsb- is a good example of how not to deal with partner countries and by way of comparison china all of a sudden stands out as , trade policy-wise , a fair partner to africa in comparison with the eu . "
asche says that the growing trade between china and africa is " an irreversible expression of the new multi-polar world , and european powers -lsb- … -rsb- simply have to learn to live in this multi-polar environment in which there is no longer an exclusive relationship between the eu , the us and africa .

this is part of a larger effort by egypt to reclaim its ancient treasures . egypt 's chief antiquities official zahi hawass says he will make a formal request for the return of the bust of queen nefertiti from berlin 's neues museum .
in a statement released sunday , hawass said he was presented with documents by the head of the berlin neues museum , where the bust is currently on display , which supported his claim that the statue is in germany illegally . german archeologist acted “ unethically ” according to hawass , the documents confirmed that the german archeologist ludwig borchardt produced fraudulent papers to secure the 3,300 year old bust for berlin in 1913 .
borchardt , who discovered the bust , tried to pass off the artefact as a less significant find in order to take it out of egypt .
“ these materials confirm egypt 's contention that borchardt did act unethically , with intent to deceive , ” the statement said .
“ the limestone head of the queen is listed on the protocol as a painted plaster bust of a princess . ”
the statement went on to say that friederike seyfried , a museum director who oversees the section where the bust is on display , would assist in negotiations between hawass and german officials .
however , in a statement released december 18 by the museum 's operators , the prussian cultural heritage foundation , it was said that , while seyfried would meet with hawass in cairo soon , she would not discuss nefertiti 's return , since the documents showed the prussian state acquired the bust lawfully and egypt had no legal claim for its return .
new campaign for return of artefacts despite the claims of the foundation , hawass says he is optimistic about the bust 's return .
“ i always ask for artefacts to come and it always happens ” he told reuters .
the push for nefertiti 's return is part of a larger effort for egypt to reclaim its ancient artefacts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bust has attracted millions of visitors since it was sent to germany in 1913 hawass previously retrieved wall fragments of a 3,200 year old tomb from the french louvre , and is also currently working on having the rosetta stone returned from the british museum . the bust of nefertiti was discovered in egypt in 1912 at tell el-amarna , the short-lived capital of the kingdom under nefertiti 's husband , pharaoh akhenaten .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 21.12.2009 demjanjuk presents german law with an almost impossible problem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demjanjuk worked in the sobibor concentration camp the demjanjuk trial , which resumed monday , has offered up some awkward moral questions for the german justice system .
but compared with other nazi trials , demjanjuk represents a completely new legal challenge . the trial of john demjanjuk , a ukrainian former prisoner-of-war turned concentration camp guard , has once again lifted the lid on questions about how the german justice system has dealt with the murderers of the holocaust .
not least among these questions is : ' why now ? '
even by the glacial time-scale dictated by the law , the demjanjuk trial has been a long time coming .
the file of evidence against him has not changed since his identity was established in 1993 , when an israeli court cleared him of being a notorious treblinka guard called ivan the terrible .
a single identity card is the main piece of evidence : it shows that demjanjuk was indeed a guard at sobibor , probably between march and september 1943 , and therefore must have helped murder at least 27,900 people thought to have died there in that period .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demjanjuk 's id is the main piece of evidence but the rest of the evidence against demjanjuk is either circumstantial or mitigating .
most of the 35 plaintiffs are simply relatives of those killed at sobibor , and the four actual survivors of the camp are too old to have a reliable memory of him or his immediate actions .
the defense lawyer ulrich busch has repeatedly argued that demjanjuk is also a victim of the nazi regime : as a ukrainian prisoner of war , demjanjuk became a trawniki - one of the many local non-germans trained as guards in the easternmost concentration camps - to avoid starvation .
why now ?
busch also asked the question ' why now ? ' in court in the first days of the trial in early december .
demjanjuk has only been legally pursued for these crimes since 2001 .
busch pointed to the trials of demjanjuk 's superiors that had resulted in acquittals - particularly that of karl streibel , a trawniki recruiter , tried in germany in 1976 and scandalously acquitted after his attorneys successfully argued that he did not know what the guards he trained would be used for .
" how can those that give the orders be innocent , when those that receive them are guilty ? "
busch asked the court .
angelika benz , a phd history student writing a thesis on the concentration camps in eastern poland , visited the first days of the demjanjuk trial and described the central difficulty in blunt terms .
" even though we know what happened at sobibor , the problem is that this crime - the holocaust - simply ca n't be dealt with by our judicial system , " benz told deutsche welle , " this becomes clear when we 're dealing with someone like demjanjuk - someone about whom we know very little . "
with so many facts missing about demjanjuk 's actions and motivations , his judges are forced to redefine the law according to the general and abstract definition of the holocaust itself .
the judges ' answer to busch 's question of how demjanjuk could be considered guilty when the man who may have trained him had been acquitted was simple - the past mistakes of the german judiciary need not be repeated .
this signal that past judgements in nazi trials are irrelevant , even flawed , is apparently necessary if any judgement can be passed on demjanjuk at all .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only the decision-makers were originally put on trial the precedents are useless the historian joerg friedrich became famous when he published two provocative books on the nazi trials in the early 1980 's - " freispruch fuer die nazi-justiz " -lrb- " acquittal for the nazi-judiciary " -rrb- and " die kalte amnestie " -lrb- " the cold amnesty " -rrb- - in which he argued that the german judiciary had failed to bring the nazi perpetrators to justice .
now he believes that the judiciary has come round to his point of view , and is attempting to correct its mistake by going after the last remaining perpetrators with new vigor .
the trial of 88- year-old heinrich boere , a dutch member of the ss , is also currently under way in aachen after decades of legal prevarication and a tireless campaign to bring him to justice .
friedrich believes that the demjanjuk trial illustrates two important developments in the german judiciary 's attitude to the holocaust .
firstly , that it is rethinking , or being forced to rethink , its definition of a holocaust perpetrator .
secondly , that it is prepared to lower the bar of required evidence in order to convict holocaust perpetrators .
but boere 's crime is much easier to define than demjanjuk 's - he is accused of , and has admitted to , three specific acts of murder .
by current german law , this is the crime that demjanjuk will have to be found guilty of if he is to be convicted - of all the crimes that demjanjuk may or may not have committed , murder is the only one that has not exceeded its time-bar limit .
germany lifted that limit on murder in the 1960 's .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinrich boere 's trial is also under way in aachen " this is a problem that judges in the 50 's , 60 's , 70 's and 80 's ignored , " friedrich told deutsche welle , " the majority of holocaust-perpetrators were seen as abetters , those that helped the murderers .
the actual murderers were always defined as hitler , himmler , eichmann - those that made the decision to instigate the holocaust - or those that showed a personal motivation in the act .
murder is not simply killing someone - you must prove intent and motivation to ensure a conviction .
the abetters were those that helped hitler , but had no motives of their own - they simply carried out their tasks . "
this narrow definition of the murderers of the holocaust appears in almost all nazi trial judgements from previous trials .
simply working in a concentration camp never convicted anyone .
but this is all that can be established beyond doubt about demjanjuk .
in order to convict him , the judges will essentially have to redefine murder for the extreme and abstract circumstances of the holocaust .
a long chain " in previous nazi trials , those that were convicted were the so-called ' concentration camp monsters ' - people who had been seen tormenting , abusing , or beating jews before their execution , " friedrich explains , " such actions were considered ' personal contributions ' , and people were convicted not of being abetters to the crime but of being co-perpetrators . "
this goes some way to explaining why so few people were convicted of holocaust crimes in germany .
according to an article in news magazine der spiegel on the legacy of german guilt , of over 100,000 investigations that were carried out in postwar germany into nazi crimes , only around 6,500 people were convicted .
thirteen death sentences were passed , 167 life sentences , and the rest received shorter prison sentences or fines .
only a fifth of those convictions were for murder .
" for the german judiciary , the holocaust only ever existed within the camp gates , " friedrich points out , " but in fact the holocaust was a long chain .
the whole of society played dumb and those that did the bloody work appeared in court . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is investing heavily in africa 's mining industry most of the criticism surrounding china 's involvement in africa debate has been on the working conditions of the miners who are subjected to low wages and questionable safety procedures .
the incident at chambishi mine in zambia in april 2005 drew attention to this .
but as professor helmut asche , director of the institute for african studies at the university of leipzig , notes these conditions are no different from those that miners in northern china are subjected to .

benefits , implications of chinese investment china 's african policy states that it intends to be africa 's equal -lrb- economic -rrb- partner .
experts like he wenping , director of the institute of west-asian and african studies at the chinese academy of social science in beijing , say that china 's goals in africa are more political than economic .
according to asche , a change in china 's africa foreign policy began after the tiananmen square massacre when china needed more foreign allies .
china 's current african partners , who are in the group of 77 , provide it with more influence in the united nations .
asche feels that the import of cheap goods from china can have very different effects as is the case with the south african textile industry and the ethiopian footwear industry .
the protection of local industry in south africa meant that the manufacturers did not modernize their techniques in order to be able to compete successfully with the chinese imports .
on the other hand , in ethiopia where the local footwear manufacturing industry was not protected , production became more competitive and now ethiopia is exporting footwear to china .
zambians often say that " you thank the person who guides you at night when it is dawn . "
the relationship between china and africa is still in its infancy , but as asche told deutsche welle " it is crystal clear -lsb- … -rsb- in scientific research that the chinese investment in all its facets is positive for africa . "

the chinese news agency xinhua estimates that there are currently one million chinese immigrants in africa .
their growing presence is more often than not unwelcome as is shown by attacks on immigrants in nigeria and angola .

chinese immigrants have not been as successful as indians or other immigrants in integrating in africa , however asche says that both locals and immigrants are responsible for the integration of the chinese migrants .
the role of germany and europe asche feels that germany should do more to get involved in africa : " … the german investors should -lsb- … -rsb- be encouraged to become as courageous as the chinese are .
it is a crystal clear fact that china and its investors and not only the state-owned companies but also private investors see the african market a lot more positive than do quite a number of investors from european countries , and the germans are certainly not among the most courageous . "
in addition to those fears , asche attributes the lack of increased trade between the two continents to the european union 's trade policy , which does not treat africa as an equal partner as china does : “ -lsb- eu trade policy -rsb- is a good example of how not to deal with partner countries and by way of comparison china all of a sudden stands out as , trade policy-wise , a fair partner to africa in comparison with the eu .

asche says that the growing trade between china and africa is " an irreversible expression of the new multi-polar world , and european powers -lsb- … -rsb- simply have to learn to live in this multi-polar environment in which there is no longer an exclusive relationship between the eu , the us and africa .

experts like he wenping , director of the institute of west-asian and african studies at the chinese academy of social science in beijing , say that china 's goals in africa are more political than economic .
according to asche , a change in china 's africa foreign policy began after the tiananmen square massacre when china needed more foreign allies .
china 's current african partners , who are in the group of 77 , provide it with more influence in the united nations .
asche feels that the import of cheap goods from china can have very different effects as is the case with the south african textile industry and the ethiopian footwear industry .
the protection of local industry in south africa meant that the manufacturers did not modernize their techniques in order to be able to compete successfully with the chinese imports .

zambians often say that " you thank the person who guides you at night when it is dawn . "
the relationship between china and africa is still in its infancy , but as asche told deutsche welle " it is crystal clear -lsb- … -rsb- in scientific research that the chinese investment in all its facets is positive for africa . "
he goes onto say that current investment is doing more to strengthen economies than democracy and good governance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is helping africa develop its infrastructure .
the chinese news agency xinhua estimates that there are currently one million chinese immigrants in africa .
their growing presence is more often than not unwelcome as is shown by attacks on immigrants in nigeria and angola .
most zambians complain that the chinese community isolates itself .
chinese immigrants have not been as successful as indians or other immigrants in integrating in africa , however asche says that both locals and immigrants are responsible for the integration of the chinese migrants .
the role of germany and europe asche feels that germany should do more to get involved in africa : " … the german investors should -lsb- … -rsb- be encouraged to become as courageous as the chinese are .
it is a crystal clear fact that china and its investors and not only the state-owned companies but also private investors see the african market a lot more positive than do quite a number of investors from european countries , and the germans are certainly not among the most courageous . "
in addition to those fears , asche attributes the lack of increased trade between the two continents to the european union 's trade policy , which does not treat africa as an equal partner as china does : “ -lsb- eu trade policy -rsb- is a good example of how not to deal with partner countries and by way of comparison china all of a sudden stands out as , trade policy-wise , a fair partner to africa in comparison with the eu . "
asche says that the growing trade between china and africa is " an irreversible expression of the new multi-polar world , and european powers -lsb- … -rsb- simply have to learn to live in this multi-polar environment in which there is no longer an exclusive relationship between the eu , the us and africa . "

three companies now face huge fines for price fixing , with more investigations underway . bosses from coffee companies tchibo , melitta and dallmayr worked together to keep their prices artificially high , a competition watchdog has ruled . germany 's cartel office has imposed fines amounting to almost 159.5 million euros against the coffee producers .
the fine is against the three coffee roasters and six employees who were deemed to be responsible .
there were several price fixes from the beginning of 2000 until the company was investigated in july 2008 .
the bonn-based cartel office said that a circle of company leaders and sales bosses had met to fix prices on products that included coffee beans , espresso coffee and ordinary filter coffee .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : espresso coffee was one of the products that were made more expensive dates and periods as well as the scope and level of the price rises were agreed upon .
five price hikes were set up between 2003 and 2008 .
the effect of just two of these increases - in winter 2004 and spring 2005 - led to an average price increase of a euro on a 500g pack of coffee .
melitta coffee spokeswoman anette kahre said the firm would appeal against the fine and that it had cooperated fully with authorities in the investigation .
the company also regretted what had happened , kahre added , and it had " made arrangements for such a thing not to happen again . "
" fine is completely excessive " dallmayr said the fine was " completely excessive " and that taking into account tax , german coffee was the best value in europe .
there was no comment from tchibo , although it did confirm the amount of the fine .
the cartel office said that the fines were still not legally binding and that the companies had an opportunity to put forward objections .
it added that further investigations were also taking place into numerous coffee producers , including cappuccino producers , and are expected to be completed in the first half of 2010. rc / afp / dpa editor : ranty islam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

three companies now face huge fines for price fixing , with more investigations underway . bosses from coffee companies tchibo , melitta and dallmayr worked together to keep their prices artificially high , a competition watchdog has ruled . germany 's cartel office has imposed fines amounting to almost 159.5 million euros against the coffee producers .
the fine is against the three coffee roasters and six employees who were deemed to be responsible .
there were several price fixes from the beginning of 2000 until the company was investigated in july 2008 .
the bonn-based cartel office said that a circle of company leaders and sales bosses had met to fix prices on products that included coffee beans , espresso coffee and ordinary filter coffee .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : espresso coffee was one of the products that were made more expensive dates and periods as well as the scope and level of the price rises were agreed upon .
five price hikes were set up between 2003 and 2008 .
the effect of just two of these increases - in winter 2004 and spring 2005 - led to an average price increase of a euro on a 500g pack of coffee .
melitta coffee spokeswoman anette kahre said the firm would appeal against the fine and that it had cooperated fully with authorities in the investigation .
the company also regretted what had happened , kahre added , and it had " made arrangements for such a thing not to happen again . "
" fine is completely excessive " dallmayr said the fine was " completely excessive " and that taking into account tax , german coffee was the best value in europe .
there was no comment from tchibo , although it did confirm the amount of the fine .
the cartel office said that the fines were still not legally binding and that the companies had an opportunity to put forward objections .
it added that further investigations were also taking place into numerous coffee producers , including cappuccino producers , and are expected to be completed in the first half of 2010. rc / afp / dpa editor : ranty islam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de museums -pipe- 21.12.2009 egypt asks germany for return of nefertiti großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bust is currently on display in berlin 's neues museum egypt 's chief antiquities official says he will make a formal request for the bust of nefertiti to be returned from germany .
this is part of a larger effort by egypt to reclaim its ancient treasures . egypt 's chief antiquities official zahi hawass says he will make a formal request for the return of the bust of queen nefertiti from berlin 's neues museum .
in a statement released sunday , hawass said he was presented with documents by the head of the berlin neues museum , where the bust is currently on display , which supported his claim that the statue is in germany illegally . german archeologist acted “ unethically ” according to hawass , the documents confirmed that the german archeologist ludwig borchardt produced fraudulent papers to secure the 3,300 year old bust for berlin in 1913 .
borchardt , who discovered the bust , tried to pass off the artefact as a less significant find in order to take it out of egypt .
“ these materials confirm egypt 's contention that borchardt did act unethically , with intent to deceive , ” the statement said .
“ the limestone head of the queen is listed on the protocol as a painted plaster bust of a princess . ”
the statement went on to say that friederike seyfried , a museum director who oversees the section where the bust is on display , would assist in negotiations between hawass and german officials .
however , in a statement released december 18 by the museum 's operators , the prussian cultural heritage foundation , it was said that , while seyfried would meet with hawass in cairo soon , she would not discuss nefertiti 's return , since the documents showed the prussian state acquired the bust lawfully and egypt had no legal claim for its return .
new campaign for return of artefacts despite the claims of the foundation , hawass says he is optimistic about the bust 's return .
“ i always ask for artefacts to come and it always happens ” he told reuters .
the push for nefertiti 's return is part of a larger effort for egypt to reclaim its ancient artefacts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bust has attracted millions of visitors since it was sent to germany in 1913 hawass previously retrieved wall fragments of a 3,200 year old tomb from the french louvre , and is also currently working on having the rosetta stone returned from the british museum . the bust of nefertiti was discovered in egypt in 1912 at tell el-amarna , the short-lived capital of the kingdom under nefertiti 's husband , pharaoh akhenaten .
it was shipped to germany the following year , and has since attracted millions of visitors from around the world. mk / ap / reuters editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this is part of a larger effort by egypt to reclaim its ancient treasures . egypt 's chief antiquities official zahi hawass says he will make a formal request for the return of the bust of queen nefertiti from berlin 's neues museum .
in a statement released sunday , hawass said he was presented with documents by the head of the berlin neues museum , where the bust is currently on display , which supported his claim that the statue is in germany illegally . german archeologist acted “ unethically ” according to hawass , the documents confirmed that the german archeologist ludwig borchardt produced fraudulent papers to secure the 3,300 year old bust for berlin in 1913 .
borchardt , who discovered the bust , tried to pass off the artefact as a less significant find in order to take it out of egypt .
“ these materials confirm egypt 's contention that borchardt did act unethically , with intent to deceive , ” the statement said .
“ the limestone head of the queen is listed on the protocol as a painted plaster bust of a princess . ”
the statement went on to say that friederike seyfried , a museum director who oversees the section where the bust is on display , would assist in negotiations between hawass and german officials .
however , in a statement released december 18 by the museum 's operators , the prussian cultural heritage foundation , it was said that , while seyfried would meet with hawass in cairo soon , she would not discuss nefertiti 's return , since the documents showed the prussian state acquired the bust lawfully and egypt had no legal claim for its return .
new campaign for return of artefacts despite the claims of the foundation , hawass says he is optimistic about the bust 's return .
“ i always ask for artefacts to come and it always happens ” he told reuters .
the push for nefertiti 's return is part of a larger effort for egypt to reclaim its ancient artefacts .

some found a silver lining , however . the newspaper de volkskrant from holland acknowledged that copenhagen delivered a disappointing result but focused on the positive : the fact that at least the problem is being addressed .
" climate change is now an international problem par excellence .
it seems inevitable that all countries will be brought into negotiations sooner or later .
at the same time , it is nearly impossible to get 192 states of varying size and with diverse interests to reach a unified stance . "
" but there is a glimmer of hope .
all of the participants in the climate conference know that the talks will continue .
and possibly , those actors will be watched by the public and by activists and ngos with a more critical eye than they have been up to now .
because one thing was attained for certain : the climate will never disappear from the political agenda . "
likewise , britain 's guardian newspaper saw positives alongside negatives in the outcome of the conference .
on the bad side : " a considered reading of the accord , which was its only tangible output , reveals that it is not just inadequate but in fact utterly empty . "
on the plus side , however , is " the novel manner in which this ultimate failure was reached . "
" as the sight of the daily chaos -lrb- of copenhagen -rrb- drops out of view , it becomes easier to appreciate that the rich world was forced to haggle with the bigger emerging economies on more equal terms than ever before . "
in other words , " while the copenhagen product is every inch the sham that campaigners say it is , the copenhagen process has set important precedents , " the guardian wrote .
" most obviously … the sheer fact that it took place – and at such a high political level – means it will probably do so again . "
taking a harsher line , left-leaning french newspaper la libération oozed disappointment in the " large countries which , in a delirium of diplomatic ineptitude and the blindness of superiority , torpedoed the binding worldwide accord " they had hoped for . the paper pitched for the eu to take immediate , unilateral action : " eco-reformers need to focus on the us and china , " it wrote ; " after that come the nations that are a bit more environmentally aware , particularly in europe .
but these can not wait until there is an international agreement .
it is much more important for them to become instructive with their actions .
if the eu took the necessary actions from its side , it would jump to the head of the movement .
then the fiasco of copenhagen could be overcome step by step . " in switzerland , zurich 's tages-anzeiger also focused on results ; those who come up with solutions will ultimately benefit in the end , the paper wrote .
at the conference , " concrete solutions were presented on how to reach a climate-friendly future and at the same time remain economically profitable .
numerous companies seemed to have little patience for the political lethargy … the biggest climate-change effect will be felt by those companies and countries that start preparing now .
they will be the ultimate winners , " the paper said .
german editorialists were less inclined to focus on positive signals from the conference .
the sueddeutsche zeitung called the copenhagen summit an " insult to the world community , " noting that " never were expectations for a climate conference higher , and never before were so many heads of state and government officials in one place , meeting to solve one single problem .
but they did n't solve it - they made it worse . "
" as if they were replaying an old , bad film , the heads of the most powerful nations came up with aid funds to silence the developing nations .
they bought their way out .
instead of mutually promising a much-needed rejection of the destructive path of economic development , they agreed on a vague and distant goal .
it is like agreeing on a place to meet , but not a time . "
meanwhile , advocating a just-do-it approach in the wake of the talks , the frankfurter rundschau sent a strong warning to voters and the politicians they elect : " there is no point in allowing the un climate conference circus to continue its performances .
the only chance that remains is for the big heat-producers of the planet to lead by example - without any stipulations about taking others along for the ride , if need be .
fifteen countries on earth are responsible for 80 percent of c02 emissions around the world ; in copenhagen they all said how important climate protection is to them .
now , the politicians of these countries need to make the necessary changes .
and if they do n't the voters have to deal with it - and vote them out of office ... "
finally , the stuttgarter zeitung expressed the disappointment felt by many in europe when they compared us president barack obama 's focus on china and other developing countries with his relative lack of interest in the european negotatiors .
in the wake of the conference , " we need to keep up the ambition of climate protection , and keep the expectations in a realistic framework , " the paper wrote .
" but one prerequisite for this is the recognition that it will be really hard for europe to effectively influence the usa .
the trans-atlantic relationship is coming up on hard times .
barack obama showed one thing for certain in copenhagen : his focus will be on the trans-pacific axis with china .

some found a silver lining , however . the newspaper de volkskrant from holland acknowledged that copenhagen delivered a disappointing result but focused on the positive : the fact that at least the problem is being addressed .
" climate change is now an international problem par excellence .
it seems inevitable that all countries will be brought into negotiations sooner or later .
at the same time , it is nearly impossible to get 192 states of varying size and with diverse interests to reach a unified stance . "
" but there is a glimmer of hope .
all of the participants in the climate conference know that the talks will continue .

likewise , britain 's guardian newspaper saw positives alongside negatives in the outcome of the conference .
on the bad side : " a considered reading of the accord , which was its only tangible output , reveals that it is not just inadequate but in fact utterly empty . "
on the plus side , however , is " the novel manner in which this ultimate failure was reached . "
" as the sight of the daily chaos -lrb- of copenhagen -rrb- drops out of view , it becomes easier to appreciate that the rich world was forced to haggle with the bigger emerging economies on more equal terms than ever before . "
in other words , " while the copenhagen product is every inch the sham that campaigners say it is , the copenhagen process has set important precedents , " the guardian wrote .
" most obviously … the sheer fact that it took place – and at such a high political level – means it will probably do so again . "

numerous companies seemed to have little patience for the political lethargy … the biggest climate-change effect will be felt by those companies and countries that start preparing now .
they will be the ultimate winners , " the paper said .
german editorialists were less inclined to focus on positive signals from the conference .
the sueddeutsche zeitung called the copenhagen summit an " insult to the world community , " noting that " never were expectations for a climate conference higher , and never before were so many heads of state and government officials in one place , meeting to solve one single problem .
but they did n't solve it - they made it worse . "
" as if they were replaying an old , bad film , the heads of the most powerful nations came up with aid funds to silence the developing nations .
they bought their way out .
instead of mutually promising a much-needed rejection of the destructive path of economic development , they agreed on a vague and distant goal .
it is like agreeing on a place to meet , but not a time . "
meanwhile , advocating a just-do-it approach in the wake of the talks , the frankfurter rundschau sent a strong warning to voters and the politicians they elect : " there is no point in allowing the un climate conference circus to continue its performances .
the only chance that remains is for the big heat-producers of the planet to lead by example - without any stipulations about taking others along for the ride , if need be .
fifteen countries on earth are responsible for 80 percent of c02 emissions around the world ; in copenhagen they all said how important climate protection is to them .
now , the politicians of these countries need to make the necessary changes .

finally , the stuttgarter zeitung expressed the disappointment felt by many in europe when they compared us president barack obama 's focus on china and other developing countries with his relative lack of interest in the european negotatiors .
in the wake of the conference , " we need to keep up the ambition of climate protection , and keep the expectations in a realistic framework , " the paper wrote .
" but one prerequisite for this is the recognition that it will be really hard for europe to effectively influence the usa .

this move has cast doubt on a crucial international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and eu-led 7.5 billion euro bailout for the recession-hit state .
the pension cuts have been in force since july , and constitutional court chief gunars kutris says they take away anywhere between 10 and 70 percent of old-age pensions depending on an individual 's status .
kurtis said the measures were illegal and that parliament must have measures in place to refund the cuts by march 2010 .
" violation " of social security and rule of law in its judgement , the court stated that " the decision to cut pensions violated the individual 's right to social security and the principle of the rule of law . "
it added that agreements with international lenders in and of themselves can not be used as an argument to limit basic rights .
the court 's ruling in the case is final and can not be appealed .
the case was brought to the court by 9,000 individual pensioners .
it has been ruled that the money itself must be paid back in full no later than 2015 .
the sum is estimated around 100 million lats -lrb- 140 million euros -rrb- .
currently , latvia is in the middle of one of the deepest recessions in the european union , with its economy expected to shrink by up to 18 percent this year .
over the past year , its government has been raising taxes and reducing public spending as it attempts to stick to the terms of the imf / eu bailout .
under the deal , latvia pledged to cut 500 million lats -lrb- 702 million euros -rrb- every year until 2012. mk / afp / reuters editor : ranty islam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this move has cast doubt on a crucial international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and eu-led 7.5 billion euro bailout for the recession-hit state .
the pension cuts have been in force since july , and constitutional court chief gunars kutris says they take away anywhere between 10 and 70 percent of old-age pensions depending on an individual 's status .
kurtis said the measures were illegal and that parliament must have measures in place to refund the cuts by march 2010 .
" violation " of social security and rule of law in its judgement , the court stated that " the decision to cut pensions violated the individual 's right to social security and the principle of the rule of law . "
it added that agreements with international lenders in and of themselves can not be used as an argument to limit basic rights .
the court 's ruling in the case is final and can not be appealed .
the case was brought to the court by 9,000 individual pensioners .
it has been ruled that the money itself must be paid back in full no later than 2015 .
the sum is estimated around 100 million lats -lrb- 140 million euros -rrb- .
currently , latvia is in the middle of one of the deepest recessions in the european union , with its economy expected to shrink by up to 18 percent this year .
over the past year , its government has been raising taxes and reducing public spending as it attempts to stick to the terms of the imf / eu bailout .
under the deal , latvia pledged to cut 500 million lats -lrb- 702 million euros -rrb- every year until 2012. mk / afp / reuters editor : ranty islam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this move has cast doubt on a crucial international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and eu-led 7.5 billion euro bailout for the recession-hit state .
the pension cuts have been in force since july , and constitutional court chief gunars kutris says they take away anywhere between 10 and 70 percent of old-age pensions depending on an individual 's status .
kurtis said the measures were illegal and that parliament must have measures in place to refund the cuts by march 2010 .
" violation " of social security and rule of law in its judgement , the court stated that " the decision to cut pensions violated the individual 's right to social security and the principle of the rule of law . "
it added that agreements with international lenders in and of themselves can not be used as an argument to limit basic rights .

" the spyker leadership has submitted a renewed offer in the hopes of securing a future for saab , its employees and the brand - despite the announcement that the winding down of saab would begin , " the company said in a statement . spyker said it hoped " the renewed offer would remove each of the obstacles that were standing in the way of a swift transaction . "
the company 's chief executive , victor muller , said its revised bid included an 11-point proposal addressing issues that arose during the due diligence process . " we have made every effort to resolve the issues that were preventing the conclusion of this matter and we have asked gm and all other involved parties to seriously consider this offer , " said muller .
he added that the new offer eliminates the need for loan approval by the european investment bank -lrb- eib -rrb- prior to year end , which would allow the deal to be concluded within gm 's original december 31 deadline . while muller did not reveal any details about the financing of the new offer , he said spyker 's bid would remain valid until 11pm central european time -lrb- 5pm eastern time -rrb- on monday . several suitors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so far only small carmakers have shown real interest in acquiring saab on its website , general motors said it had received inquiries from several potential bidders since friday 's announcement that it would start the orderly closure of saab . " we will evaluate each inquiry .
we will not comment further until these evaluations have been completed , " gm said in a statement .
the head of sweden 's influential if metall union urged gm to seriously consider the renewed bid for saab , which employs about 3,400 people in sweden . " i understand the frustration felt by everyone who is dependent on saab : to be thrown between hope and despair is terrible .
gm must now respond with a serious examination of the new bid , " union chairman stefan loefven said . swedish media report that the closure of saab could lead to more than 8,000 job losses , including subcontractors and others dependent on the carmaker .
the company 's global distribution network is comprised of 1,100 dealerships . gm has been trying to sell the unit since the start of the year .
swedish luxury carmaker koenigsegg , which builds around 18 high-end sports cars a year , pulled out of a deal to buy saab last month , citing costly delays . like koenigsegg , spyker is also a premium niche manufacturer .
in 2008 , it sold just 37 cars worldwide with prices starting at 200,000 euros -lrb- $ 290,000 -rrb- . saab sold just over 93,000 cars last year .
the company 's history as an automaker dates back to the 1940s , when the first cars were produced by the swedish aircraft maker svenska aeroplan aktiebolaget or saab .

this move has cast doubt on a crucial international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and eu-led 7.5 billion euro bailout for the recession-hit state .
the pension cuts have been in force since july , and constitutional court chief gunars kutris says they take away anywhere between 10 and 70 percent of old-age pensions depending on an individual 's status .
kurtis said the measures were illegal and that parliament must have measures in place to refund the cuts by march 2010 .
" violation " of social security and rule of law in its judgement , the court stated that " the decision to cut pensions violated the individual 's right to social security and the principle of the rule of law . "
it added that agreements with international lenders in and of themselves can not be used as an argument to limit basic rights .
the court 's ruling in the case is final and can not be appealed .
the case was brought to the court by 9,000 individual pensioners .
it has been ruled that the money itself must be paid back in full no later than 2015 .
the sum is estimated around 100 million lats -lrb- 140 million euros -rrb- .
currently , latvia is in the middle of one of the deepest recessions in the european union , with its economy expected to shrink by up to 18 percent this year .
over the past year , its government has been raising taxes and reducing public spending as it attempts to stick to the terms of the imf / eu bailout .
under the deal , latvia pledged to cut 500 million lats -lrb- 702 million euros -rrb- every year until 2012. mk / afp / reuters editor : ranty islam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this move has cast doubt on a crucial international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and eu-led 7.5 billion euro bailout for the recession-hit state .
the pension cuts have been in force since july , and constitutional court chief gunars kutris says they take away anywhere between 10 and 70 percent of old-age pensions depending on an individual 's status .
kurtis said the measures were illegal and that parliament must have measures in place to refund the cuts by march 2010 .
" violation " of social security and rule of law in its judgement , the court stated that " the decision to cut pensions violated the individual 's right to social security and the principle of the rule of law . "
it added that agreements with international lenders in and of themselves can not be used as an argument to limit basic rights .
the court 's ruling in the case is final and can not be appealed .
the case was brought to the court by 9,000 individual pensioners .
it has been ruled that the money itself must be paid back in full no later than 2015 .
the sum is estimated around 100 million lats -lrb- 140 million euros -rrb- .
currently , latvia is in the middle of one of the deepest recessions in the european union , with its economy expected to shrink by up to 18 percent this year .
over the past year , its government has been raising taxes and reducing public spending as it attempts to stick to the terms of the imf / eu bailout .
under the deal , latvia pledged to cut 500 million lats -lrb- 702 million euros -rrb- every year until 2012. mk / afp / reuters editor : ranty islam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in 2009 , the spotlight fell on one of the female stars from this summer 's world athletics championships in berlin , the only man to beat michael phelps in a major swimming competition since 2005 , and the women 's national soccer team for their clear dominance over their european competitors .
steffi nerius throws for gold after the opening weekend of the world athletics championships in august , the biggest star to emerge from berlin 's olympic stadium was usain bolt , whose record-breaking 100-meter dash on the competition 's second day captivated germans and out-of-town visitors alike .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nerius 's first throw was good enough for gold two days later , bolt had competition for the newspaper headlines , and it was from a member of the home team .
when steffi nerius stepped to the line of the finals in the javelin competition , germany had yet to produce a single gold medal winner .
tournament organizers had staggered the events so there was a german gold medal hopeful on each of the nine days of competition , but on the fourth day , they were still waiting for the first german champion .
nerius 's first throw of the finals sailed 67.30 meters , which held as the best mark throughout the entire competition .
when eventual czech silver medalist barbora spotakova 's final throw of the event failed to beat nerius ' mark , nerius raised her arms in the air and celebrated germany 's first gold of the competition , with a stadium full of loud supporters cheering her on .
it was the first world championship gold medal of the 37-year-old 's career .
before the world championships began , there had been fears that germany would repeat its performance from the beijing olympics and come up short in the medals column .
but after nerius set the precedent , german athletes went on to take home a total of two gold , three silver , and four bronze medals , which represented a successful competition for the host nation .
paul biedermann upsets michael phelps new world records were practically a drop in the deep end at the world swimming championships in rome last july .
controversial new swimsuits , made partially or entirely out of polyurethane , seemed to be giving swimmers who wore them a slight edge , and as a result , 43 world records fell at the meet in rome .
bildunterschrift : biedermann bested the world record - and michael phelps - in the 200m freestyle paul biedermann grabbed two of those records , and they happened to be two of the most impressive of the entire competition .
wearing a full-body polyurethane suit , biedermann bested legendary australian swimmer ian thorpe 's world record in the 400 meter freestyle , a mark that many in the sport thought would be safe for many years .
biedermann 's next record was even more impressive , especially because of the man he handily beat in the race .
in the 200 ´ -meter freestyle , biedermann shattered american michael phelps 's world record time by over a second , and handed phelps his only silver medal in world or olympic competition since 2005 .
phelps did n't wear one of the all-polyurethane suits against biedermann , but still praised the 23-year-old german 's performance .
" paul swam a great race .
i did not have anything in the last 50 meters , " phelps said after the swim .
" in the race i was beaten by the swimmer , not the suit . "

winning yet another title continued an impressive streak for the german women .
in european championship competition , the team remains unbeaten since 1995 .
that 's a total of 26 matches , and five titles in a row .
in fact , since the first women 's european championship took place in 1984 , only two other countries - sweden once and norway twice - have won the title other than germany .

in the six matches played by the german side in finland , they scored 21 goals against their opponents ' 5 goals combined .
six of those goals came from striker inka grings , and the rest came from a team effort of nine other goal scorers .
2009 marks the second time the women 's national team has been elected team of the year by german sports journalists .

in 2009 , the spotlight fell on one of the female stars from this summer 's world athletics championships in berlin , the only man to beat michael phelps in a major swimming competition since 2005 , and the women 's national soccer team for their clear dominance over their european competitors .
steffi nerius throws for gold after the opening weekend of the world athletics championships in august , the biggest star to emerge from berlin 's olympic stadium was usain bolt , whose record-breaking 100-meter dash on the competition 's second day captivated germans and out-of-town visitors alike .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nerius 's first throw was good enough for gold two days later , bolt had competition for the newspaper headlines , and it was from a member of the home team .
when steffi nerius stepped to the line of the finals in the javelin competition , germany had yet to produce a single gold medal winner .
tournament organizers had staggered the events so there was a german gold medal hopeful on each of the nine days of competition , but on the fourth day , they were still waiting for the first german champion .
nerius 's first throw of the finals sailed 67.30 meters , which held as the best mark throughout the entire competition .
when eventual czech silver medalist barbora spotakova 's final throw of the event failed to beat nerius ' mark , nerius raised her arms in the air and celebrated germany 's first gold of the competition , with a stadium full of loud supporters cheering her on .
it was the first world championship gold medal of the 37-year-old 's career .
before the world championships began , there had been fears that germany would repeat its performance from the beijing olympics and come up short in the medals column .
but after nerius set the precedent , german athletes went on to take home a total of two gold , three silver , and four bronze medals , which represented a successful competition for the host nation .
paul biedermann upsets michael phelps new world records were practically a drop in the deep end at the world swimming championships in rome last july .
controversial new swimsuits , made partially or entirely out of polyurethane , seemed to be giving swimmers who wore them a slight edge , and as a result , 43 world records fell at the meet in rome .
bildunterschrift : biedermann bested the world record - and michael phelps - in the 200m freestyle paul biedermann grabbed two of those records , and they happened to be two of the most impressive of the entire competition .
wearing a full-body polyurethane suit , biedermann bested legendary australian swimmer ian thorpe 's world record in the 400 meter freestyle , a mark that many in the sport thought would be safe for many years .
biedermann 's next record was even more impressive , especially because of the man he handily beat in the race .
in the 200 ´ -meter freestyle , biedermann shattered american michael phelps 's world record time by over a second , and handed phelps his only silver medal in world or olympic competition since 2005 .
phelps did n't wear one of the all-polyurethane suits against biedermann , but still praised the 23-year-old german 's performance .
" paul swam a great race .
i did not have anything in the last 50 meters , " phelps said after the swim .
" in the race i was beaten by the swimmer , not the suit . "
starting in 2010 , swimming 's governing body fina will implement a ban on all-polyurethane suits , but eight-time beijing gold medallist michael phelps has a new top rival for next season : germany 's paul biedermann .
women 's national team wins european championships german soccer fans remember well the impressive march by bundesliga squad vfl wolfsburg to the german championship at the end of the 2008/2009 bundesliga season .
it was the first title in the team 's history .
but to be considered germany 's best team of the year , one title just is n't enough .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inka grings had six goals to celebrate at this year 's european championship seven is more appropriate - the number of titles the german women 's national soccer team has after winning the 2009 european championship in finland by convincingly beating england 6-2 in the final .
winning yet another title continued an impressive streak for the german women .
in european championship competition , the team remains unbeaten since 1995 .
that 's a total of 26 matches , and five titles in a row .
in fact , since the first women 's european championship took place in 1984 , only two other countries - sweden once and norway twice - have won the title other than germany .
like squads in the past , the 2009 european champions simply overpowered their opponents .
in the six matches played by the german side in finland , they scored 21 goals against their opponents ' 5 goals combined .
six of those goals came from striker inka grings , and the rest came from a team effort of nine other goal scorers .
2009 marks the second time the women 's national team has been elected team of the year by german sports journalists .
the first was in 2003 , after the team won its first women 's world cup .
they followed it up with another title in 2007 , and have a shot at their third straight world cup in 2011 as the host country. mz / dpa / sid editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the spyker leadership has submitted a renewed offer in the hopes of securing a future for saab , its employees and the brand - despite the announcement that the winding down of saab would begin , " the company said in a statement . spyker said it hoped " the renewed offer would remove each of the obstacles that were standing in the way of a swift transaction . "
the company 's chief executive , victor muller , said its revised bid included an 11-point proposal addressing issues that arose during the due diligence process . " we have made every effort to resolve the issues that were preventing the conclusion of this matter and we have asked gm and all other involved parties to seriously consider this offer , " said muller .
he added that the new offer eliminates the need for loan approval by the european investment bank -lrb- eib -rrb- prior to year end , which would allow the deal to be concluded within gm 's original december 31 deadline . while muller did not reveal any details about the financing of the new offer , he said spyker 's bid would remain valid until 11pm central european time -lrb- 5pm eastern time -rrb- on monday . several suitors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so far only small carmakers have shown real interest in acquiring saab on its website , general motors said it had received inquiries from several potential bidders since friday 's announcement that it would start the orderly closure of saab .

we will not comment further until these evaluations have been completed , " gm said in a statement .
the head of sweden 's influential if metall union urged gm to seriously consider the renewed bid for saab , which employs about 3,400 people in sweden . " i understand the frustration felt by everyone who is dependent on saab : to be thrown between hope and despair is terrible .
gm must now respond with a serious examination of the new bid , " union chairman stefan loefven said . swedish media report that the closure of saab could lead to more than 8,000 job losses , including subcontractors and others dependent on the carmaker .
the company 's global distribution network is comprised of 1,100 dealerships . gm has been trying to sell the unit since the start of the year .
swedish luxury carmaker koenigsegg , which builds around 18 high-end sports cars a year , pulled out of a deal to buy saab last month , citing costly delays . like koenigsegg , spyker is also a premium niche manufacturer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de awards -pipe- 21.12.2009 sports journalists name athletes of the year in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul biedermann and steffi nerius show off their awards in a tradition that dates back to 1947 , german sports journalists have voted on the man , woman , and team who impacted the world of german sports the most over the past twelve months . all told , around 1400 journalists cast their ballots for the german sports awards , which were presented at a ceremony sunday night in baden baden .
in 2009 , the spotlight fell on one of the female stars from this summer 's world athletics championships in berlin , the only man to beat michael phelps in a major swimming competition since 2005 , and the women 's national soccer team for their clear dominance over their european competitors .
steffi nerius throws for gold after the opening weekend of the world athletics championships in august , the biggest star to emerge from berlin 's olympic stadium was usain bolt , whose record-breaking 100-meter dash on the competition 's second day captivated germans and out-of-town visitors alike .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nerius 's first throw was good enough for gold two days later , bolt had competition for the newspaper headlines , and it was from a member of the home team .
when steffi nerius stepped to the line of the finals in the javelin competition , germany had yet to produce a single gold medal winner .
tournament organizers had staggered the events so there was a german gold medal hopeful on each of the nine days of competition , but on the fourth day , they were still waiting for the first german champion .
nerius 's first throw of the finals sailed 67.30 meters , which held as the best mark throughout the entire competition .
when eventual czech silver medalist barbora spotakova 's final throw of the event failed to beat nerius ' mark , nerius raised her arms in the air and celebrated germany 's first gold of the competition , with a stadium full of loud supporters cheering her on .
it was the first world championship gold medal of the 37-year-old 's career .
before the world championships began , there had been fears that germany would repeat its performance from the beijing olympics and come up short in the medals column .
but after nerius set the precedent , german athletes went on to take home a total of two gold , three silver , and four bronze medals , which represented a successful competition for the host nation .
paul biedermann upsets michael phelps new world records were practically a drop in the deep end at the world swimming championships in rome last july .
controversial new swimsuits , made partially or entirely out of polyurethane , seemed to be giving swimmers who wore them a slight edge , and as a result , 43 world records fell at the meet in rome .
bildunterschrift : biedermann bested the world record - and michael phelps - in the 200m freestyle paul biedermann grabbed two of those records , and they happened to be two of the most impressive of the entire competition .
wearing a full-body polyurethane suit , biedermann bested legendary australian swimmer ian thorpe 's world record in the 400 meter freestyle , a mark that many in the sport thought would be safe for many years .
biedermann 's next record was even more impressive , especially because of the man he handily beat in the race .
in the 200 ´ -meter freestyle , biedermann shattered american michael phelps 's world record time by over a second , and handed phelps his only silver medal in world or olympic competition since 2005 .
phelps did n't wear one of the all-polyurethane suits against biedermann , but still praised the 23-year-old german 's performance .
" paul swam a great race .
i did not have anything in the last 50 meters , " phelps said after the swim .
" in the race i was beaten by the swimmer , not the suit . "
starting in 2010 , swimming 's governing body fina will implement a ban on all-polyurethane suits , but eight-time beijing gold medallist michael phelps has a new top rival for next season : germany 's paul biedermann .
women 's national team wins european championships german soccer fans remember well the impressive march by bundesliga squad vfl wolfsburg to the german championship at the end of the 2008/2009 bundesliga season .
it was the first title in the team 's history .
but to be considered germany 's best team of the year , one title just is n't enough .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inka grings had six goals to celebrate at this year 's european championship seven is more appropriate - the number of titles the german women 's national soccer team has after winning the 2009 european championship in finland by convincingly beating england 6-2 in the final .
winning yet another title continued an impressive streak for the german women .
in european championship competition , the team remains unbeaten since 1995 .
that 's a total of 26 matches , and five titles in a row .
in fact , since the first women 's european championship took place in 1984 , only two other countries - sweden once and norway twice - have won the title other than germany .
like squads in the past , the 2009 european champions simply overpowered their opponents .
in the six matches played by the german side in finland , they scored 21 goals against their opponents ' 5 goals combined .
six of those goals came from striker inka grings , and the rest came from a team effort of nine other goal scorers .
2009 marks the second time the women 's national team has been elected team of the year by german sports journalists .
the first was in 2003 , after the team won its first women 's world cup .
they followed it up with another title in 2007 , and have a shot at their third straight world cup in 2011 as the host country. mz / dpa / sid editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but where will the army turn its attention now ?
many militants who left south waziristan during the military onslaught are believed to be hiding in other tribal agencies , including north waziristan and orakzai .
and as the prime minister has said that orakzai will be the next target , thousands of refugees have already begun to flee the area . the prime minister of pakistan , syed yusuf raza gillani recently hinted that the army might shift its focus to orakzai , southwest of peshawar , after having successfully completed the previous anti-taliban operations in swat and , most recently , south waziristan .
a large number of people have already been shifted from orakzai to the neighbouring districts of hangu and kohat , although there has been no official announcement of the military operation .
up to 80,000 refugees expected manuel bessler , head of the un office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs in islamabad , said , " we have about 40,000 individuals that were displaced during the recent upsurge of the fighting in the orakzai agency .
we expect up to 80,000 displaced people .
it depends very much on the course of the military operations , how extensive they are , how long they continue . "
so far , no formal registration has taken place but discussions are currently going on to start formal registration for the internally displaced persons from orakzai agency in the coming days .
work for the united nations and other humanitarian agencies in orakzai will not be easy .
" the challenges are several and quite difficult ones " , manuel bessler said .
" first of all it is access to go to the area .
it 's not impossible but it 's more difficult .
we have to be in close contact with the local authorities .
we have to constantly monitor the security situation , so access is the first challenge .
secondly , we have to have appropriate sites where we can host displaced people .
this is a challenge in terms of logistics and has , of course , to be closely coordinated with the district authorities . "
preparations under way the united nations already had to assist a large number of displaced people in pakistan earlier this year .
mr bessler said this makes its task easier in certain ways : " the humanitarian community consisting of un , un agencies but also quite importantly of international and national non-governmental organizations -lrb- ngos -rrb- has worked in the country for quite a while , and had to cope with the huge displacement crisis in summer of this year from the malakand division , where we had -lrb- around end of may - june -rrb- 2.7 million displaced people .
we are quite well prepared .
there are stocks available of relief item : tents , mattresses , kitchen sets , quilts . "
as the government of pakistan is heading to a new war front to eradicate militancy , observers say the relief and rehabilition of idps must not be ignored .
otherwise , many might easily be recruited by militants .

a large number of people have already been shifted from orakzai to the neighbouring districts of hangu and kohat , although there has been no official announcement of the military operation .

dramatic rescue pictures were beamed across the world and officials say 2,064 homes and businesses were flooded as the county experienced unprecedented rainfall on 20 november .
six bridges collapsed and many more were closed over safety fears in the wake of the torrents .
this has effectively cut off towns , villages and housing estates on the north side of the river derwent from the a66 - the main route into the major centres of workington and cockermouth .
peak-time journeys that took only a matter of minutes before the floods are now running into hours with drivers hitting " bumper to bumper " traffic on parts of the long detour route .
cumbria floods in figures the estimated bill for the damage is £ 100m government ministers have pledged a £ 3.7m aid package to help rebuild flood-hit communities the county council will pay £ 1.1m of the immediate flood recovery costs and £ 3m towards replacing bridges and roads the cumbria flood recovery fund has raised £ 1.35m the fund has so far distributed £ 116,000 to 218 households the tourism industry lost about £ 2.5m from cancellations in the wake of the floods accommodation bookings on the cumbria tourism website fell by 30 % immediately after the floods bookings have now recovered and are up 16 % on this time last year the village of papcastle , near cockermouth , which is next to the only remaining road bridge over the river , has now found itself at the centre of the detour bottleneck .
millions of pounds has been pledged to repair the destruction but despairing residents just want to hear news that the bridges are to be reopened or rebuilt .
ladia whitfield , 52 , whose bungalow on the south side of cockermouth was wrecked by the flood waters , is now living in bed and breakfast accommodation on the town 's only north side estate .
she said the closure of the town 's gote bridge and collapse of the memorial gardens footbridge had left residents on the north side with a five-mile commute to get to the main shops just 300 ft -lrb- 90 metres -rrb- over the river .
and with the estate boasting very little in the way of shops or cafes , the local church , which is also putting on daily bus services , now provides the main source of community spirit with a special canteen .
" it is now a month later and people feel as isolated as they did on day two after the floods " , she said .
" emotions are very raw and it is all people can do not to cry when they talk about getting the bridges open .
" they are desperate to get into town and just buy the normal things .
" everyone is trying to rally round for christmas but there is a sad cloud hanging over this side of the town . "
' horrendous ' traffic the feeling of frustration is being mirrored in great and little broughton , villages suffering from the closure of the flood damaged broughton bridge .
one of the crossing 's arches has a hole below the waterline and will have to be repaired with a new concrete support .
eric nicholson , district councillor for broughton and st bridget 's ward , said this work was unlikely to be finished until the end of january as contractors were demanding too much money to work over the christmas period .
he said : " at peak times the traffic is horrendous and it is taking 40 minutes to travel one mile - it used to take just seven minutes to get from great broughton to cockermouth .
" everybody is just praying for the bridges to be reopened but some contractors are asking for almost double to work over christmas .
" this is frustrating at a time when we want everybody to buckle down and put holidays on hold to another time . "
a temporary footbridge has been built in workington the most dramatic images of bridge closures came out of workington .
the town was effectively split in two as the waters destroyed the northside road bridge , a nearby footbridge , and left calva bridge on the brink of collapse .
drivers have been left with an 18-mile detour , via the papcastle bridge , to reach the other side of town .
an army-built footbridge , named barker crossing , after pc bill barker who was swept to his death from the northside bridge , has since helped unite the two sides of the town , as has the building of a temporary railway station on the north side .
last week it was announced that a temporary road bridge should open by late spring 2010 .
the county council will have to go through the long process of design , tendering , letting contracts and construction before permanent replacements span the river at workington .
john robinson , of cumbria county council 's highways department , said 1,400 bridges had been checked for structural damage and fourteen remained closed .
he said : " we have been struggling because of the bridge closures but we are doing what we can .
" we will know more about the gote bridge in cockermouth on tuesday when divers will hopefully be able to inspect it beneath the waterline .
" if we can get that open it will be fantastic and that will solve a large part of the problems .
" it wo n't be a quick fix but we are looking to repair the memorial garden footbridge . "

dramatic rescue pictures were beamed across the world and officials say 2,064 homes and businesses were flooded as the county experienced unprecedented rainfall on 20 november .
six bridges collapsed and many more were closed over safety fears in the wake of the torrents .
this has effectively cut off towns , villages and housing estates on the north side of the river derwent from the a66 - the main route into the major centres of workington and cockermouth .
peak-time journeys that took only a matter of minutes before the floods are now running into hours with drivers hitting " bumper to bumper " traffic on parts of the long detour route .
cumbria floods in figures the estimated bill for the damage is £ 100m government ministers have pledged a £ 3.7m aid package to help rebuild flood-hit communities the county council will pay £ 1.1m of the immediate flood recovery costs and £ 3m towards replacing bridges and roads the cumbria flood recovery fund has raised £ 1.35m the fund has so far distributed £ 116,000 to 218 households the tourism industry lost about £ 2.5m from cancellations in the wake of the floods accommodation bookings on the cumbria tourism website fell by 30 % immediately after the floods bookings have now recovered and are up 16 % on this time last year the village of papcastle , near cockermouth , which is next to the only remaining road bridge over the river , has now found itself at the centre of the detour bottleneck .
millions of pounds has been pledged to repair the destruction but despairing residents just want to hear news that the bridges are to be reopened or rebuilt .
ladia whitfield , 52 , whose bungalow on the south side of cockermouth was wrecked by the flood waters , is now living in bed and breakfast accommodation on the town 's only north side estate .
she said the closure of the town 's gote bridge and collapse of the memorial gardens footbridge had left residents on the north side with a five-mile commute to get to the main shops just 300 ft -lrb- 90 metres -rrb- over the river .
and with the estate boasting very little in the way of shops or cafes , the local church , which is also putting on daily bus services , now provides the main source of community spirit with a special canteen .
" it is now a month later and people feel as isolated as they did on day two after the floods " , she said .
" emotions are very raw and it is all people can do not to cry when they talk about getting the bridges open .
" they are desperate to get into town and just buy the normal things .
" everyone is trying to rally round for christmas but there is a sad cloud hanging over this side of the town . "
' horrendous ' traffic the feeling of frustration is being mirrored in great and little broughton , villages suffering from the closure of the flood damaged broughton bridge .
one of the crossing 's arches has a hole below the waterline and will have to be repaired with a new concrete support .
eric nicholson , district councillor for broughton and st bridget 's ward , said this work was unlikely to be finished until the end of january as contractors were demanding too much money to work over the christmas period .
he said : " at peak times the traffic is horrendous and it is taking 40 minutes to travel one mile - it used to take just seven minutes to get from great broughton to cockermouth .
" everybody is just praying for the bridges to be reopened but some contractors are asking for almost double to work over christmas .
" this is frustrating at a time when we want everybody to buckle down and put holidays on hold to another time . "
a temporary footbridge has been built in workington the most dramatic images of bridge closures came out of workington .
the town was effectively split in two as the waters destroyed the northside road bridge , a nearby footbridge , and left calva bridge on the brink of collapse .
drivers have been left with an 18-mile detour , via the papcastle bridge , to reach the other side of town .
an army-built footbridge , named barker crossing , after pc bill barker who was swept to his death from the northside bridge , has since helped unite the two sides of the town , as has the building of a temporary railway station on the north side .
last week it was announced that a temporary road bridge should open by late spring 2010 .
the county council will have to go through the long process of design , tendering , letting contracts and construction before permanent replacements span the river at workington .
john robinson , of cumbria county council 's highways department , said 1,400 bridges had been checked for structural damage and fourteen remained closed .
he said : " we have been struggling because of the bridge closures but we are doing what we can .
" we will know more about the gote bridge in cockermouth on tuesday when divers will hopefully be able to inspect it beneath the waterline .
" if we can get that open it will be fantastic and that will solve a large part of the problems .
" it wo n't be a quick fix but we are looking to repair the memorial garden footbridge . "
