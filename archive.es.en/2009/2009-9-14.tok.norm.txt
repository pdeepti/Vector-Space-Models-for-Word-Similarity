program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 14.09.2009 france delays dna test for immigrants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the law would have come into force on december 31 the french government is to rethink a controversial law authorizing dna tests for the families of immigrants seeking to join their relatives in france .
the law was meant to come into force at the end of the year . the law was originally part of a wider immigration bill passed by the government in the early days of nicolas sarkozy 's presidency in an attempt to tighten the rules on those seeking entry to france .
its supporters said voluntary dna tests could speed up visa applications and help prove a genuine biological link between children and parents .
the law has come under intense criticism from rights groups and now the country 's immigration minister , eric besson , has said that he is unable to comply with the web of conditions in the heavily-amended text that was finally voted by parliament .
the dna tests were to be carried out at french consulates around the world .
but besson said that so many constraints had been added that he believed the law would n't work in practice .
" the genetic samples should be taken by a doctor .
our consulates are n't equipped for that .
we 'd need to invest a lot of resources for a very marginal interest , " he added .
critics claim test unfair to africans when the law was introduced , it was claimed that dna tests could help in cases where there was doubt over whether birth certificates were valid .
but opposition politicians and human rights organizations protested that it stigmatized african immigrants in particular because many africans live in extended families where children are often adopted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics claim the law is especially unfair on people from sub-saharan africa critics , like dominique sopo , head of sos racism in france , have welcomed the immigration minister 's move to shelve the plan .
sopo said this was good news because " these tests were ethically indefensible . "
under the law , tests would be voluntary ; families in theory could seek a dna test to prove a link between an immigrant in france and their relatives abroad .
it was watered down to exclude people from morocco , algeria and tunisia - which reinforced a feeling that sub-saharan africans were being stigmatized .
prime minister promises to work on a solution initially the measure was strongly supported by those who argued that the rules on immigration needed tightening .
however , there are now signs of disagreement within the government 's camp .
according to afp , the leader of the right-wing ump party in the national assembly , jean-francis cope , warned that the executive had an obligation to sign the law into application .
prime minister francois fillon has tried to defuse the disagreement , defending the law in principle .
he said parliament would re-examine the law to try to find a solution .
the initial law was championed by then immigration minister brice hortefeux , who is currently fighting off accusations of racism after he was recorded on video making what appear to be anti-arab comments .

they fear german jobs might be saved at their expense .
now brussels is probing the deal . britain and belgium on monday urged the european commission to ensure the takeover of carmaker opel did not favor german workers because of 4.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.55 billion -rrb- in promised aid from berlin .
both countries are suspicious of the deal with canadian automotive supplier magna and its russian allies , under which all four german plants will stay open while opel 's belgian plant and one of two vauxhall sites in britain could close .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one vauxhall plant in britain may have to close " i think it is important to say that the -lrb- european -rrb- commission should not accept anything that looks like a political fix or any linkage between aid and retention of jobs in any specific plant or country , " british business secretary peter mandelson told the bbc .
the eu commission denied media reports alleging it had information that could potentially derail german state support for opel .
german weekly der spiegel had reported that the commission was in possession of documents showing that the opel plant in the belgian city of antwerp – which is threatened with closure – operates at greater efficiency than the facility in bochum , germany , which opel 's new owner magna has promised to keep .
eu law prohibits state guarantees for such a decision which – if true – would amount to economic nonsense .
belgium demands special probe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commissioner verheugen held talks with flanders ' chief minister in belgium , anger is mounting at the german decision and the flemish government has taken its argument to brussels .
kris peeters , first minister of flanders said he wants the eu 's executive commission to investigate whether german aid is in conflict with eu anti-competitive practices .
he held talks with eu industry commissioner guenter verheugen on the issue on monday .
peeters said he and verheugen agreed that commercial and economic , not political , factors were paramount in deciding which plants should survive .
" we are convinced antwerp has a fair chance .
antwerp has a better chance than certain german plants , " he told reporters , adding flanders would consider filing a complaint with the commission .
eu scrutiny adds uncertainty to magna-deal the german government said it does not anticipate problems in connection with state aid being extended to opel .
a government spokesman said the support package is in line with existing eu guidelines and does not need to be presented to brussels for special scrutiny .
but the eu commission takes a different view and has announced it will examine closely the conditions attached to german support for the carmaker .
eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said that the rules of the european market do not tolerate protectionism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : september 10 : gm managers announced what now appears to have been little more than a declaration of intent however , the required documentation is not expected to arrive from berlin before the german general election at the end of september .
the magna deal , therefore , faces the prospect of a potential veto from brussels for another few weeks .
this adds further uncertainty to the whole project , which at present consists of little more than a declaration of intent by general motors and magna .
gm in particular warned that " key issues " still need to be dealt with during the negotiations on the way to a final agreement over the sale of opel .
germany hosts opel meeting given these challenges , the german government is trying to move swiftly and has announced a meeting will be held on tuesday in berlin , at which european states with opel factories are invited to discuss and agree on the disbursement of state funds for restructuring measures .
but agreement , it seems , does not even exist over who is invited .
belgian foreign minister yves leterme complained on monday that his country had received no invitation .

banks say they are simply trying to avoid risky loans . french banks have recently been accused of shunning small and medium-sized businesses in particular since the crisis struck - despite receiving billions of euros in state aid designed to keep credit flowing . clair service hotellerie is one of the companies affected by the banks tightened lending .
from small headquarters in paris , it provides staff for the hotel industry worldwide .
its recruits , often from eastern europe , are employed directly and trained by the company . the agency 's survival has been threatened by cash flow problems since its bank revoked the company 's overdraft facility a year ago , burdening the agency with tens of thousands of euros in extra charges . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : staffing hotels could become impossible for one french company " overnight we could not pay salaries or social charges on time , " the agency 's marketing manager , renaud chemin , said .
he added that the bank had told it to increase its capital , a suggestion the company says is impossible under current circumstances . clair service hotellerie now faces bankruptcy within three months . " since the bank will not make our situation easier , it just means the end of the company , " chemin said . such an outcome would be bound to have an impact on employees like katarina piekarmiak . she trained to be a french teacher in her native poland , but found jobs hard to come by . she replied to an advertisement from france and , since january , she has been on the agency 's books , hired out to a hotel in paris where she works as a receptionist . " in poland i was unemployed , so this work allows me to earn money and live normally , " she said .
" without this agency i 'd be unemployed again , and if i found nothing else here i 'd go back home and probably be out of work again . " banks accused of starving businesses many other small firms face problems similar to those of clair service hotellerie - especially in the restaurant industry where the banks stand accused of eschewing the whole sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : banks are becoming extremely cautious , mezziouane said " i increasingly notice banks that are more and more hesitant and more and more cautious when it comes to taking risks , " said abdellah mezziouane , general secretary of the cgpme in paris , which represents small and medium-sized businesses .
" we have concrete cases where small and medium-sized businesses can no longer find the means to finance their development and their investment , and no longer have access to funds . " a mediator appointed by the government to investigate complaints is dealing with a surge in the number of claims from small and medium-sized businesses .
last year , the banks , which had received billions of euros in state aid , agreed to increase loans by 3 percent to 4 percent .
but they have not reached that target . who is to blame ? the banks have defended themselves against charges that they are becoming too tight-fisted . some analysts have agreed with the banks , saying reduced demand caused by the recession is to blame for failure to meet lending targets . " for one or two quarters neither households nor companies were willing to borrow any more , " said cyril blesson , chief economist with seeds finance consultants . banks have perceived small businesses in particular to be too high a risk during the crisis , and tightened their lending conditions late last year , blesson added . however , with interest rates consistently low , he said he sees grounds for optimism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demand for credit is slowing picking up , some analysts said " according to the lending surveys from the central banks and especially the banque de france , we have signs of a revival in demand for credit , " blesson said .
" that is good , but now we also need banks to lend to households and companies that are willing to get indebted again . " adopt " small-business attitude " in the meantime , as many smaller companies continue to suffer , both the french government and business leaders have appealed to the banks to be more flexible . finance minister christine lagarde has written to 12 banks that have received state support , giving them until the end of the month to outline the measures they are taking to revitalize their credit policies . " i ask the french banking sector to adopt the attitude of small and medium sized companies , " laurence parisot , head of the medef employers ' organization , said in a recent radio interview .
" it is the most difficult time for them because for months they 've had order books falling by 30 , 40 , 50 percent . a large company can get by ; a small business ca n't .

" mea culpa " is the third part of an autobiographical trilogy .
the munich performance comes just days after news of his relapse . the director was diagnosed with lung cancer in 2008 , but was in remission when he wrote " mea culpa , " which premiered in vienna 's burgtheater in march . " the illness is back , but i am feeling positive and i have the strength for my next projects , " he told the german press agency dpa on saturday . " the latest test results are sad for my wife and myself , but i do n't want to moan a lot more in public now , but rather to give others strength and concentrate on my africa project . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' mea culpa ' includes film , music and text excerpts in " mea culpa , " the 48-year-old describes the highs and lows that he has suffered during his illness , and reveals his feelings and his dreams - among them the idea of creating a festival hall in africa . link to earlier work the opera also evokes earlier works , such as his staging of richard wagner 's " parsifal . "
schlingensief has indicated a link between his life-changing illness and his work on a controversial production of richard wagner 's “ parsifal ” for the 2004-2007 bayreuth festivals . wagner is a kind of leitmotif through the collage-like work , which also includes music by johann sebastian bach , arnold schoenberg , franz schubert and robert schumann .
it also incorporates texts by goethe and austrian writer elfriede jelinek , among others . in the past , the work of the enfant terrible of german theater has frequently prompted people to leave the auditorium in protest and shock , the performance of " mea culpa " was met with enthusiastic applause . homecoming for schlingensief schlingensief is no stranger to the bavarian capital .
in 1981 he moved to munich to study german , philosophy and art history , living in an apartment block side by side with prostitutes and alcoholics .
" that was an ideal biotope for my hunt for disasters , " he told german news magazine spiegel in an interview in 1995 . the burgtheater guest performance is being staged again in munich 's bayerische staatsoper on monday , sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 14.09.2009 a year after lehman collapse , bankers rebuild their bubble großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehman is gone but bankers are back in business banks are raking in profits again , thanks partly to state bailouts , but remain hesitant about extending credit .
now governments have prominent roles in the financial sector and are under pressure to change the rules . the casino is back in business , trading and speculating on the financial markets are on their way to reach pre-crisis levels .
banks are again posting profits and managers are again looking forward to big bonuses .
a year after us investment bank lehman brothers filed for bankruptcy , not much has changed - at least not in the sector that triggered the global financial crisis . new data suggest that after passing the crisis on to the economy beyond the walls of wall street , the financial markets have yet again managed to close the shutters to the real world . the bank for international settlements , the world 's biggest central bank body , reported sunday that interbank money markets are recovering to levels not seen since early 2008 .
the bank said that shows financial institutions are once again dealing with one another , but that they also remain hesitant to extend credit to businesses . reduced risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's central bank chief axel weber says : " growth not sustainable yet . "
germany 's federal bank chief axel weber , however , said the somewhat brighter general economic outlook is in part due to the government bailout of financial markets , which has contributed to " systemic risk reduction . " " aggressive monetary policy and huge economic stimulus packages " have also helped improve prospects , he said , but added that such measures make it hard to know if growth will be self-sustainable . but while bankers are benefiting from rebounding markets for the moment , the impact of the crisis on global economies and political decisions means that even they will face new realities in the long run .
to prevent markets - and ultimately their economies - from collapsing , national governments have financially propped up or de facto nationalized major banks . leaders of the g-20 group of major nations pledged in april to strengthen financial supervision and establish stricter rules on bonus payments .
when they meet again this month in the united states they are expected to reinforce those measures . economic crisis not over yet politicians have ample reason to remain anxious .
germany is bracing for a new wave of bankruptcies this fall and unemployment figures are also set to rise , just statistics have shown that more businesses and individuals are expected to default on credit payments . experts estimate that german lenders alone could face losing 120 billion euros -lrb- $ 176 billion -rrb- by 2011 as a result .
the situation across the european union does not look much different , even though the european commission on monday announced that the euro zone is emerging from recession . " the eu economy appears to be at a turning point , " an interim forecast said , but it confirmed that the economy of the 16 countries using the euro would contract by 4 percent this year . disaster lurking in balance sheets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imf warns the crisis is not over despite positive signals from europe 's biggest economies , the head of the international monetary fund has warned that the global economic crisis is not over yet . " in the minds of too many - not only regular people but also top politicians - the financial crisis is already behind us , " dominique strauss-kahn told german news weekly der spiegel , adding that more work on financial sector regulation was needed . despite posting massive profits , the economic underpinnings of financial businesses themselves remain fragile a year after the lehman collapse . hypo real estate , nationalized by the german government and injected with 3 billion euros of fresh capital , is continuing to cause problems for german politicians and economic leaders .
the bank is set to receive 7 billion euros more before the year 's end but , according to media reports , another 16 billion euros of losses that have not yet " materialized " are lurking in the bank 's books . those least responsible for crisis are worst affected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prices for commodities from developing nations have slumped while wall street thinks it has recovered and industrialized economies anticipate they will soon follow , the global crisis may continue to affect those least responsible for it . the downturn has hit the african continent especially hard despite it not being involved in its making , civil society organizations gathered in the capital of the democratic republic of the congo heard at the fifth people 's summit of the southern african development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- . commodity prices have all but collapsed , ngos told the gathering .
among others , cotton farmers ' earnings have been whittled down to just a quarter of what they used to be before the outbreak of the financial crisis last year . rri / dpa / ap / reuters / ips editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

together they would produce more than 12,000 megawatts of energy , which could supply power to 12 million households , the transport ministry said . " this would bring us closer to our goal of producing 25,000 megawatts offshore by 2030 , " tiefensee told the daily hamburger abendblatt . he added that the ministry had approved some of the 2,500 applications received by his office for wind turbines in the north and baltic seas .
tiefensee told the paper he would present a proposal for the wind farms at a cabinet meeting with chancellor angela merkel on wednesday . costs for the new wind farms have not yet been established , a spokesperson for the transport ministry told the hamburg newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in germany are wondering where and how to store radioactive waste the move comes as politicians debate the continued use of nuclear power in germany and how to deal with the radioactive waste it generates . " the current discussion about the nuclear waste depot gorleben shows once again very clearly that we need to expand renewable energy , " said tiefensee , who is a member of the center-left social democrats . dozens of farms already approved of the 40 wind farms planned , 30 would be in the north sea and 10 in the baltic sea .
twenty-two have already received government approval and berlin intends to set aside some 100 square kilometers -lrb- 39 square miles -rrb- for offshore power projects .
most will be built near the east frisian islands . " we are securing and creating jobs in one of the markets of the future , " tiefensee said , adding that wind farms could mean 30,000 jobs in germany .
" we want germany to be at the fore of this technology . " approval has already been given for 22 offshore wind farms in the north sea and another three in the baltic with a total of 1,800 turbines , according to christian dahmke of germany 's federal maritime and hydrographic agency .
he added that officials were considering another 55 applications . germany is n't out to sea alone over the last week a number of similar announcements have been made in other european countries , indicating that wind energy will gain greater prominence in the political and public debates over renewable energy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are already some turbines spinning off the german coast turbine maker ge electric announced thursday that it signed agreements to supply what would become the largest european on-shore wind farm in romania , while oil-nation norway said the same day it had authorized its first ever off-shore wind facility . planning for huge wind farms out at sea has been going on for years , but little tangible progress had actually been made .
technical problems have been a main challenge . the head of the european wind energy association , christian kjaer , on monday also called on eu governments to give a clear signal of their support to the wind power industry . up to 16 percent of all energy consumed in the eu could come from wind farms by 2020 .
plans for such offshore facilities would cost 57 billion euros -lrb- $ 83 billion -rrb- with transmission lines costing between 20 and 30 billion euros , the organization estimated . sms / rri / dpa / afp / ap editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

banks say they are simply trying to avoid risky loans . french banks have recently been accused of shunning small and medium-sized businesses in particular since the crisis struck - despite receiving billions of euros in state aid designed to keep credit flowing . clair service hotellerie is one of the companies affected by the banks tightened lending .
from small headquarters in paris , it provides staff for the hotel industry worldwide .
its recruits , often from eastern europe , are employed directly and trained by the company . the agency 's survival has been threatened by cash flow problems since its bank revoked the company 's overdraft facility a year ago , burdening the agency with tens of thousands of euros in extra charges . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : staffing hotels could become impossible for one french company " overnight we could not pay salaries or social charges on time , " the agency 's marketing manager , renaud chemin , said .
he added that the bank had told it to increase its capital , a suggestion the company says is impossible under current circumstances . clair service hotellerie now faces bankruptcy within three months . " since the bank will not make our situation easier , it just means the end of the company , " chemin said . such an outcome would be bound to have an impact on employees like katarina piekarmiak . she trained to be a french teacher in her native poland , but found jobs hard to come by . she replied to an advertisement from france and , since january , she has been on the agency 's books , hired out to a hotel in paris where she works as a receptionist . " in poland i was unemployed , so this work allows me to earn money and live normally , " she said .

twenty million people watched the tv debate , hoping to see a clear winner emerge after 90 minutes .
but there was no real heated political debate from the two partners in germany 's four-year-old grand coalition .
two snap polls held after the debates came to very different conclusions .
a poll by german broadcaster zdf showed 31 percent for spd challenger steinmeier as the winner of the tv duel compared to 28 percent for merkel .
a poll conducted by forsa poll had merkel in front with 37 percent , against 35 percent for steinmeier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fireworks were missing in the chancellor debate but asked which candidate was best qualified to run the country , 58 percent chose merkel compared to 28 percent for steinmeier , a poll by broadcaster rtl showed .
dressed in dark business suits , both candidates emphasized what they had achieved in the last four years in a coalition government .
for steinmeier the stakes were higher .
the spd challenger had to score points to make up for a poor showing in the polls .
" we have achieved a lot .
quite a bit of it since the crisis and we may only have done so because there was a grand coalition , " he said .
" but we have n't managed everything , we fell short of what we could do in a number of areas because the cdu did n't go along with it .
for example on minimum wages and limiting executive pay .
that would have helped people . "
merkel agreed that they had " worked well together " but said that to turn around the economy after the financial crisis she would prefer the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- as her junior coalition partner .
" i think we could make more progress on jobs which is why i 'm appealing for a new government , " she said .
" the past has been good and you wo n't change my mind about the fact that we have got a lot done .
but i think for a democracy it 's good when grand coalitions do n't become normality . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : duel or duet ?
german foreign minister and vice chancellor steinmeier spoke of a change in political direction , emphasizing that voters had a clear alternative to a future coalition between the christian democrats and free democrats .
merkel and steinmeier both tried to claim credit for the rescue of car maker opel after canadian-austrian parts maker magna agreed last week to take over the troubled general motors ' subsidiary .
most political observers agreed that the more " presidential " chancellor merkel showed her crisis management credentials while steinmeier scored points on social equality .
much of the 90-minute debate focused on ways out of the economic crisis with merkel arguing in favor of tax cuts to stimulate demand .
merkel and steinmeier also discussed managers ' salary and bonus payments , minimum wages and nuclear energy .
the candidates voiced broad agreement on germany 's military presence in afghanistan , arguing against a premature withdrawal of troops. nrt / dpa / afp / reuters editor : john kluempers send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it could n't have been a duel anyway , " wrote die welt daily . " for one thing , the need for ideological debate seems to be exhausted in this country .
and for another , the two politicians could not hit out at one another because it is not their style .
another reason is that they have worked together for four years in a coalition government they managed in harmony .
they agree on many issues , so they could not have credibly portrayed being at odds with each other .
the debate ended with a balanced 1:1 . "
" and why should the politicians badmouth the work they have been doing together for the past four years , " asked the sueddeutsche zeitung paper , " they may have to rule together again after -lsb- the -rsb- sept .
27 -lsb- election -rsb- .
the format of a duel is not appropriate to convey political content . "
the berliner zeitung wrote : " steinmeier only managed to attack for a few moments .
he was obviously lacking the necessary brutality and ruthlessness in view of the past four years in a joint government .
voters who wanted to find out what the world would look like with a coalition of christian democrats and free democrats , or under the leadership of the social democrats , did not learn a thing in the debate . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two are anxious to set themselves apart mass-circulation daily bild had the following assessment : " after a 90-minute ' duel , ' we are none the wiser .

together they would produce more than 12,000 megawatts of energy , which could supply power to 12 million households , the transport ministry said . " this would bring us closer to our goal of producing 25,000 megawatts offshore by 2030 , " tiefensee told the daily hamburger abendblatt . he added that the ministry had approved some of the 2,500 applications received by his office for wind turbines in the north and baltic seas .
tiefensee told the paper he would present a proposal for the wind farms at a cabinet meeting with chancellor angela merkel on wednesday . costs for the new wind farms have not yet been established , a spokesperson for the transport ministry told the hamburg newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in germany are wondering where and how to store radioactive waste the move comes as politicians debate the continued use of nuclear power in germany and how to deal with the radioactive waste it generates . " the current discussion about the nuclear waste depot gorleben shows once again very clearly that we need to expand renewable energy , " said tiefensee , who is a member of the center-left social democrats . dozens of farms already approved of the 40 wind farms planned , 30 would be in the north sea and 10 in the baltic sea .
twenty-two have already received government approval and berlin intends to set aside some 100 square kilometers -lrb- 39 square miles -rrb- for offshore power projects .
most will be built near the east frisian islands . " we are securing and creating jobs in one of the markets of the future , " tiefensee said , adding that wind farms could mean 30,000 jobs in germany .
" we want germany to be at the fore of this technology . " approval has already been given for 22 offshore wind farms in the north sea and another three in the baltic with a total of 1,800 turbines , according to christian dahmke of germany 's federal maritime and hydrographic agency .
he added that officials were considering another 55 applications . germany is n't out to sea alone over the last week a number of similar announcements have been made in other european countries , indicating that wind energy will gain greater prominence in the political and public debates over renewable energy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are already some turbines spinning off the german coast turbine maker ge electric announced thursday that it signed agreements to supply what would become the largest european on-shore wind farm in romania , while oil-nation norway said the same day it had authorized its first ever off-shore wind facility . planning for huge wind farms out at sea has been going on for years , but little tangible progress had actually been made .
technical problems have been a main challenge . the head of the european wind energy association , christian kjaer , on monday also called on eu governments to give a clear signal of their support to the wind power industry . up to 16 percent of all energy consumed in the eu could come from wind farms by 2020 .
plans for such offshore facilities would cost 57 billion euros -lrb- $ 83 billion -rrb- with transmission lines costing between 20 and 30 billion euros , the organization estimated . sms / rri / dpa / afp / ap editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

together they would produce more than 12,000 megawatts of energy , which could supply power to 12 million households , the transport ministry said . " this would bring us closer to our goal of producing 25,000 megawatts offshore by 2030 , " tiefensee told the daily hamburger abendblatt . he added that the ministry had approved some of the 2,500 applications received by his office for wind turbines in the north and baltic seas .
tiefensee told the paper he would present a proposal for the wind farms at a cabinet meeting with chancellor angela merkel on wednesday . costs for the new wind farms have not yet been established , a spokesperson for the transport ministry told the hamburg newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in germany are wondering where and how to store radioactive waste the move comes as politicians debate the continued use of nuclear power in germany and how to deal with the radioactive waste it generates . " the current discussion about the nuclear waste depot gorleben shows once again very clearly that we need to expand renewable energy , " said tiefensee , who is a member of the center-left social democrats . dozens of farms already approved of the 40 wind farms planned , 30 would be in the north sea and 10 in the baltic sea .

most will be built near the east frisian islands . " we are securing and creating jobs in one of the markets of the future , " tiefensee said , adding that wind farms could mean 30,000 jobs in germany .
" we want germany to be at the fore of this technology . " approval has already been given for 22 offshore wind farms in the north sea and another three in the baltic with a total of 1,800 turbines , according to christian dahmke of germany 's federal maritime and hydrographic agency .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 14.09.2009 a year after lehman collapse , bankers rebuild their bubble großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehman is gone but bankers are back in business banks are raking in profits again , thanks partly to state bailouts , but remain hesitant about extending credit .
now governments have prominent roles in the financial sector and are under pressure to change the rules . the casino is back in business , trading and speculating on the financial markets are on their way to reach pre-crisis levels .
banks are again posting profits and managers are again looking forward to big bonuses .
a year after us investment bank lehman brothers filed for bankruptcy , not much has changed - at least not in the sector that triggered the global financial crisis . new data suggest that after passing the crisis on to the economy beyond the walls of wall street , the financial markets have yet again managed to close the shutters to the real world . the bank for international settlements , the world 's biggest central bank body , reported sunday that interbank money markets are recovering to levels not seen since early 2008 .
the bank said that shows financial institutions are once again dealing with one another , but that they also remain hesitant to extend credit to businesses . reduced risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's central bank chief axel weber says : " growth not sustainable yet . "
germany 's federal bank chief axel weber , however , said the somewhat brighter general economic outlook is in part due to the government bailout of financial markets , which has contributed to " systemic risk reduction . " " aggressive monetary policy and huge economic stimulus packages " have also helped improve prospects , he said , but added that such measures make it hard to know if growth will be self-sustainable . but while bankers are benefiting from rebounding markets for the moment , the impact of the crisis on global economies and political decisions means that even they will face new realities in the long run .
to prevent markets - and ultimately their economies - from collapsing , national governments have financially propped up or de facto nationalized major banks . leaders of the g-20 group of major nations pledged in april to strengthen financial supervision and establish stricter rules on bonus payments .
when they meet again this month in the united states they are expected to reinforce those measures . economic crisis not over yet politicians have ample reason to remain anxious .
germany is bracing for a new wave of bankruptcies this fall and unemployment figures are also set to rise , just statistics have shown that more businesses and individuals are expected to default on credit payments . experts estimate that german lenders alone could face losing 120 billion euros -lrb- $ 176 billion -rrb- by 2011 as a result .
the situation across the european union does not look much different , even though the european commission on monday announced that the euro zone is emerging from recession . " the eu economy appears to be at a turning point , " an interim forecast said , but it confirmed that the economy of the 16 countries using the euro would contract by 4 percent this year . disaster lurking in balance sheets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imf warns the crisis is not over despite positive signals from europe 's biggest economies , the head of the international monetary fund has warned that the global economic crisis is not over yet .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 14.09.2009 a year after lehman collapse , bankers rebuild their bubble großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehman is gone but bankers are back in business banks are raking in profits again , thanks partly to state bailouts , but remain hesitant about extending credit .
now governments have prominent roles in the financial sector and are under pressure to change the rules . the casino is back in business , trading and speculating on the financial markets are on their way to reach pre-crisis levels .
banks are again posting profits and managers are again looking forward to big bonuses .
a year after us investment bank lehman brothers filed for bankruptcy , not much has changed - at least not in the sector that triggered the global financial crisis . new data suggest that after passing the crisis on to the economy beyond the walls of wall street , the financial markets have yet again managed to close the shutters to the real world . the bank for international settlements , the world 's biggest central bank body , reported sunday that interbank money markets are recovering to levels not seen since early 2008 .
the bank said that shows financial institutions are once again dealing with one another , but that they also remain hesitant to extend credit to businesses . reduced risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's central bank chief axel weber says : " growth not sustainable yet . "
germany 's federal bank chief axel weber , however , said the somewhat brighter general economic outlook is in part due to the government bailout of financial markets , which has contributed to " systemic risk reduction . " " aggressive monetary policy and huge economic stimulus packages " have also helped improve prospects , he said , but added that such measures make it hard to know if growth will be self-sustainable . but while bankers are benefiting from rebounding markets for the moment , the impact of the crisis on global economies and political decisions means that even they will face new realities in the long run .
to prevent markets - and ultimately their economies - from collapsing , national governments have financially propped up or de facto nationalized major banks . leaders of the g-20 group of major nations pledged in april to strengthen financial supervision and establish stricter rules on bonus payments .
when they meet again this month in the united states they are expected to reinforce those measures . economic crisis not over yet politicians have ample reason to remain anxious .
germany is bracing for a new wave of bankruptcies this fall and unemployment figures are also set to rise , just statistics have shown that more businesses and individuals are expected to default on credit payments . experts estimate that german lenders alone could face losing 120 billion euros -lrb- $ 176 billion -rrb- by 2011 as a result .
the situation across the european union does not look much different , even though the european commission on monday announced that the euro zone is emerging from recession . " the eu economy appears to be at a turning point , " an interim forecast said , but it confirmed that the economy of the 16 countries using the euro would contract by 4 percent this year . disaster lurking in balance sheets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imf warns the crisis is not over despite positive signals from europe 's biggest economies , the head of the international monetary fund has warned that the global economic crisis is not over yet . " in the minds of too many - not only regular people but also top politicians - the financial crisis is already behind us , " dominique strauss-kahn told german news weekly der spiegel , adding that more work on financial sector regulation was needed . despite posting massive profits , the economic underpinnings of financial businesses themselves remain fragile a year after the lehman collapse . hypo real estate , nationalized by the german government and injected with 3 billion euros of fresh capital , is continuing to cause problems for german politicians and economic leaders .

banks say they are simply trying to avoid risky loans . french banks have recently been accused of shunning small and medium-sized businesses in particular since the crisis struck - despite receiving billions of euros in state aid designed to keep credit flowing . clair service hotellerie is one of the companies affected by the banks tightened lending .
from small headquarters in paris , it provides staff for the hotel industry worldwide .
its recruits , often from eastern europe , are employed directly and trained by the company . the agency 's survival has been threatened by cash flow problems since its bank revoked the company 's overdraft facility a year ago , burdening the agency with tens of thousands of euros in extra charges . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : staffing hotels could become impossible for one french company " overnight we could not pay salaries or social charges on time , " the agency 's marketing manager , renaud chemin , said .
he added that the bank had told it to increase its capital , a suggestion the company says is impossible under current circumstances . clair service hotellerie now faces bankruptcy within three months . " since the bank will not make our situation easier , it just means the end of the company , " chemin said . such an outcome would be bound to have an impact on employees like katarina piekarmiak . she trained to be a french teacher in her native poland , but found jobs hard to come by . she replied to an advertisement from france and , since january , she has been on the agency 's books , hired out to a hotel in paris where she works as a receptionist .

" we have concrete cases where small and medium-sized businesses can no longer find the means to finance their development and their investment , and no longer have access to funds . " a mediator appointed by the government to investigate complaints is dealing with a surge in the number of claims from small and medium-sized businesses .
last year , the banks , which had received billions of euros in state aid , agreed to increase loans by 3 percent to 4 percent .
but they have not reached that target . who is to blame ? the banks have defended themselves against charges that they are becoming too tight-fisted . some analysts have agreed with the banks , saying reduced demand caused by the recession is to blame for failure to meet lending targets .

his accomplices , assad sawar , 29 , and tanvir hussain , 28 , received minimum sentences of 36 and 32 years , respectively . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from left , abdulla ahmed ali , assad sawar , and tanvir hussain addressing ali during sentencing , judge richard henriques said , " i have concluded you are a driven and determined extremist with boundless energy and an ambition to lead a terrorist outrage of boundless proportion .
by this conspiracy you sought the attention of the world , and you now have it . "
the thwarted suicide attack , intercepted by british intelligence services in august 2006 , would have been the " worst atrocity since 9/11 and woiuld have inflicted heavy casualties in the name of islam , " the court in london heard last week . all three men , though born in britain , had close links with pakistan .
four other men were found not guilty of involvement in the plot .
henriques said the defendants had " embraced islamic extremism and it is that burning extremism that has motivated you throughout this conspiracy and is likely to drive you again . "
trial almost did n't happen at a trial a year ago , ali , hussain and sarwar were found guilty of conspiracy to murder involving liquid bombs - but that jury could not decide whether their plans extended to detonating the devices on planes . an appeal by britain 's crown prosecution service -lrb- cps -rrb- led to a retrial , with the jury concluding that such a terror plot did exist , ultimately leading to last monday 's convictions at woolwich crown court in london . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as ringleader of the group , ali was given a minimum sentence of 40 years during the trial , the court was told that ali picked out seven flights to san francisco , toronto , montreal , washington , new york and chicago that departed from london 's heathrow airport within a two-and-a-half hour period .
jets were operated by united airlines , american airlines and air canada .
the prosecution alleged that the attack would have caused " mass murder on an unimaginable scale " and would have " exceeded the carnage " of the september 11 attacks in the us in 2001 . plan foiled thanks to british surveillance reports said the security services , courts and police had spent a total of 35 million pounds -lrb- 39 million euros , $ 57 million -rrb- on foiling the plot and bringing the men to justice .
undercover surveillance officers had watched ali converting a flat in east london into a bomb factory , which was also used to record suicide videos in which the british public was warned to expect " floods of martyr operations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan to blow up the jets led to a worldwide ban on most liquids in hand luggage according to prosecutors at the trial last week , the three men plotted to drill holes in the bottom of plastic drinks bottles , drain the contents and inject liquid explosive with a syringe before sealing the holes with glue .
that way the bottle tops would remain unopened .
the home-made liquid explosive was to be concocted from hydrogen peroxide and tang , a soft drink available in powdered form .
when mixed with such an organic material at an appropriate strength , hydrogen peroxide has explosive qualities .
the bottles would be detonated using the substance htmd , concealed in regular aa 1.5-volt batteries .
the detonator would have been ignited using a metal wire or a small light bulb , the court heard .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 14.09.2009 opel deal faces fresh challenge großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the writing 's on the wall : the eu 's competition commissioner is gearing up to investigate the opel takeover by magna two fellow eu members are taking germany to task for extending state aid to the new owner of carmaker opel .
they fear german jobs might be saved at their expense .
now brussels is probing the deal . britain and belgium on monday urged the european commission to ensure the takeover of carmaker opel did not favor german workers because of 4.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.55 billion -rrb- in promised aid from berlin .
both countries are suspicious of the deal with canadian automotive supplier magna and its russian allies , under which all four german plants will stay open while opel 's belgian plant and one of two vauxhall sites in britain could close .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one vauxhall plant in britain may have to close " i think it is important to say that the -lrb- european -rrb- commission should not accept anything that looks like a political fix or any linkage between aid and retention of jobs in any specific plant or country , " british business secretary peter mandelson told the bbc .
the eu commission denied media reports alleging it had information that could potentially derail german state support for opel .
german weekly der spiegel had reported that the commission was in possession of documents showing that the opel plant in the belgian city of antwerp – which is threatened with closure – operates at greater efficiency than the facility in bochum , germany , which opel 's new owner magna has promised to keep .
eu law prohibits state guarantees for such a decision which – if true – would amount to economic nonsense .
belgium demands special probe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commissioner verheugen held talks with flanders ' chief minister in belgium , anger is mounting at the german decision and the flemish government has taken its argument to brussels .
kris peeters , first minister of flanders said he wants the eu 's executive commission to investigate whether german aid is in conflict with eu anti-competitive practices .
he held talks with eu industry commissioner guenter verheugen on the issue on monday .
peeters said he and verheugen agreed that commercial and economic , not political , factors were paramount in deciding which plants should survive .
" we are convinced antwerp has a fair chance .
antwerp has a better chance than certain german plants , " he told reporters , adding flanders would consider filing a complaint with the commission .
eu scrutiny adds uncertainty to magna-deal the german government said it does not anticipate problems in connection with state aid being extended to opel .
a government spokesman said the support package is in line with existing eu guidelines and does not need to be presented to brussels for special scrutiny .
but the eu commission takes a different view and has announced it will examine closely the conditions attached to german support for the carmaker .
eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said that the rules of the european market do not tolerate protectionism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : september 10 : gm managers announced what now appears to have been little more than a declaration of intent however , the required documentation is not expected to arrive from berlin before the german general election at the end of september .
the magna deal , therefore , faces the prospect of a potential veto from brussels for another few weeks .
this adds further uncertainty to the whole project , which at present consists of little more than a declaration of intent by general motors and magna .
gm in particular warned that " key issues " still need to be dealt with during the negotiations on the way to a final agreement over the sale of opel .
germany hosts opel meeting given these challenges , the german government is trying to move swiftly and has announced a meeting will be held on tuesday in berlin , at which european states with opel factories are invited to discuss and agree on the disbursement of state funds for restructuring measures .
but agreement , it seems , does not even exist over who is invited .
belgian foreign minister yves leterme complained on monday that his country had received no invitation .
the german government 's spokesman denied this. rri / reuters / dpa / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de opel deal sparks concerns about job losses across europe general motors has vowed that opel factories in germany will remain secure after its decision to sell the carmaker to supplier magna .

they fear german jobs might be saved at their expense .
now brussels is probing the deal . britain and belgium on monday urged the european commission to ensure the takeover of carmaker opel did not favor german workers because of 4.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.55 billion -rrb- in promised aid from berlin .
both countries are suspicious of the deal with canadian automotive supplier magna and its russian allies , under which all four german plants will stay open while opel 's belgian plant and one of two vauxhall sites in britain could close .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one vauxhall plant in britain may have to close " i think it is important to say that the -lrb- european -rrb- commission should not accept anything that looks like a political fix or any linkage between aid and retention of jobs in any specific plant or country , " british business secretary peter mandelson told the bbc .
the eu commission denied media reports alleging it had information that could potentially derail german state support for opel .
german weekly der spiegel had reported that the commission was in possession of documents showing that the opel plant in the belgian city of antwerp – which is threatened with closure – operates at greater efficiency than the facility in bochum , germany , which opel 's new owner magna has promised to keep .
eu law prohibits state guarantees for such a decision which – if true – would amount to economic nonsense .
belgium demands special probe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commissioner verheugen held talks with flanders ' chief minister in belgium , anger is mounting at the german decision and the flemish government has taken its argument to brussels .
kris peeters , first minister of flanders said he wants the eu 's executive commission to investigate whether german aid is in conflict with eu anti-competitive practices .
he held talks with eu industry commissioner guenter verheugen on the issue on monday .
peeters said he and verheugen agreed that commercial and economic , not political , factors were paramount in deciding which plants should survive .
" we are convinced antwerp has a fair chance .
antwerp has a better chance than certain german plants , " he told reporters , adding flanders would consider filing a complaint with the commission .
eu scrutiny adds uncertainty to magna-deal the german government said it does not anticipate problems in connection with state aid being extended to opel .
a government spokesman said the support package is in line with existing eu guidelines and does not need to be presented to brussels for special scrutiny .
but the eu commission takes a different view and has announced it will examine closely the conditions attached to german support for the carmaker .
eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said that the rules of the european market do not tolerate protectionism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : september 10 : gm managers announced what now appears to have been little more than a declaration of intent however , the required documentation is not expected to arrive from berlin before the german general election at the end of september .
the magna deal , therefore , faces the prospect of a potential veto from brussels for another few weeks .
this adds further uncertainty to the whole project , which at present consists of little more than a declaration of intent by general motors and magna .
gm in particular warned that " key issues " still need to be dealt with during the negotiations on the way to a final agreement over the sale of opel .
germany hosts opel meeting given these challenges , the german government is trying to move swiftly and has announced a meeting will be held on tuesday in berlin , at which european states with opel factories are invited to discuss and agree on the disbursement of state funds for restructuring measures .
but agreement , it seems , does not even exist over who is invited .
belgian foreign minister yves leterme complained on monday that his country had received no invitation .

overall eu gdp for the year was expected to shrink by 4 percent , which is in line with previous estimates .
eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said a sharp upturn in the global economy meant " the drop is behind us " but added that it was based mainly on stimulus measures that " would not be there forever . "
in addition , almunia warned that " unemployment levels will continue to go up and employment levels will continue to decrease , since the negative impact on the labor market has a lag of two or three quarters . "
his comments came as the latest eu figures were released , showing that the number of people unemployed in the bloc had decreased by 0.6 percent , or 1.44 million , in the second quarter when compared to the first .

if " automatic stabilizers " such as unemployment benefit payments are also taken into account , the size of the eu 's stimulus package will have amounted to 5.5 per cent of gdp by next year .
but with this additional spending leading to ballooning budget deficits across the eu , almunia once again urged governments to start thinking about how to rein in public spending .
" we need to define a clear , credible and coordinated ' exit strategy ' to put public finances progressively back on a sustainable path and to find the necessary resources to increase europe 's growth and jobs potential , " almunia said .

monday 's interim forecasts were based on the outlook for germany , spain , france , italy , the netherlands , poland and britain , which together account for 80 per cent of the eu economy .

overall eu gdp for the year was expected to shrink by 4 percent , which is in line with previous estimates .
eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said a sharp upturn in the global economy meant " the drop is behind us " but added that it was based mainly on stimulus measures that " would not be there forever . "
in addition , almunia warned that " unemployment levels will continue to go up and employment levels will continue to decrease , since the negative impact on the labor market has a lag of two or three quarters . "
his comments came as the latest eu figures were released , showing that the number of people unemployed in the bloc had decreased by 0.6 percent , or 1.44 million , in the second quarter when compared to the first .
call for training schemes to help unemployed the commissioner said governments should provide training schemes and promote " active labor market policies " designed to ensure that the unemployed can find a job once the economy fully recovers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the economic growth , lines at unemployment offices are expected to get longer eu governments have pumped billions of euros into their economies to mitigate the impact of the bloc 's worst recession in decades .
according to almunia , additional discretionary spending will have totalled 2.5 per cent of the eu 's gdp over the 2009-10 period .
if " automatic stabilizers " such as unemployment benefit payments are also taken into account , the size of the eu 's stimulus package will have amounted to 5.5 per cent of gdp by next year .
but with this additional spending leading to ballooning budget deficits across the eu , almunia once again urged governments to start thinking about how to rein in public spending .
" we need to define a clear , credible and coordinated ' exit strategy ' to put public finances progressively back on a sustainable path and to find the necessary resources to increase europe 's growth and jobs potential , " almunia said .

the law was meant to come into force at the end of the year . the law was originally part of a wider immigration bill passed by the government in the early days of nicolas sarkozy 's presidency in an attempt to tighten the rules on those seeking entry to france .
its supporters said voluntary dna tests could speed up visa applications and help prove a genuine biological link between children and parents .
the law has come under intense criticism from rights groups and now the country 's immigration minister , eric besson , has said that he is unable to comply with the web of conditions in the heavily-amended text that was finally voted by parliament .
the dna tests were to be carried out at french consulates around the world .
but besson said that so many constraints had been added that he believed the law would n't work in practice .
" the genetic samples should be taken by a doctor .
our consulates are n't equipped for that .
we 'd need to invest a lot of resources for a very marginal interest , " he added .
critics claim test unfair to africans when the law was introduced , it was claimed that dna tests could help in cases where there was doubt over whether birth certificates were valid .
but opposition politicians and human rights organizations protested that it stigmatized african immigrants in particular because many africans live in extended families where children are often adopted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics claim the law is especially unfair on people from sub-saharan africa critics , like dominique sopo , head of sos racism in france , have welcomed the immigration minister 's move to shelve the plan .
sopo said this was good news because " these tests were ethically indefensible . "
under the law , tests would be voluntary ; families in theory could seek a dna test to prove a link between an immigrant in france and their relatives abroad .
it was watered down to exclude people from morocco , algeria and tunisia - which reinforced a feeling that sub-saharan africans were being stigmatized .
prime minister promises to work on a solution initially the measure was strongly supported by those who argued that the rules on immigration needed tightening .
however , there are now signs of disagreement within the government 's camp .
according to afp , the leader of the right-wing ump party in the national assembly , jean-francis cope , warned that the executive had an obligation to sign the law into application .
prime minister francois fillon has tried to defuse the disagreement , defending the law in principle .
he said parliament would re-examine the law to try to find a solution .
the initial law was championed by then immigration minister brice hortefeux , who is currently fighting off accusations of racism after he was recorded on video making what appear to be anti-arab comments .

the law was meant to come into force at the end of the year . the law was originally part of a wider immigration bill passed by the government in the early days of nicolas sarkozy 's presidency in an attempt to tighten the rules on those seeking entry to france .
its supporters said voluntary dna tests could speed up visa applications and help prove a genuine biological link between children and parents .
the law has come under intense criticism from rights groups and now the country 's immigration minister , eric besson , has said that he is unable to comply with the web of conditions in the heavily-amended text that was finally voted by parliament .
the dna tests were to be carried out at french consulates around the world .
but besson said that so many constraints had been added that he believed the law would n't work in practice .
" the genetic samples should be taken by a doctor .
our consulates are n't equipped for that .
we 'd need to invest a lot of resources for a very marginal interest , " he added .
critics claim test unfair to africans when the law was introduced , it was claimed that dna tests could help in cases where there was doubt over whether birth certificates were valid .
but opposition politicians and human rights organizations protested that it stigmatized african immigrants in particular because many africans live in extended families where children are often adopted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics claim the law is especially unfair on people from sub-saharan africa critics , like dominique sopo , head of sos racism in france , have welcomed the immigration minister 's move to shelve the plan .
sopo said this was good news because " these tests were ethically indefensible . "
under the law , tests would be voluntary ; families in theory could seek a dna test to prove a link between an immigrant in france and their relatives abroad .
it was watered down to exclude people from morocco , algeria and tunisia - which reinforced a feeling that sub-saharan africans were being stigmatized .
prime minister promises to work on a solution initially the measure was strongly supported by those who argued that the rules on immigration needed tightening .
however , there are now signs of disagreement within the government 's camp .
according to afp , the leader of the right-wing ump party in the national assembly , jean-francis cope , warned that the executive had an obligation to sign the law into application .
prime minister francois fillon has tried to defuse the disagreement , defending the law in principle .
he said parliament would re-examine the law to try to find a solution .
the initial law was championed by then immigration minister brice hortefeux , who is currently fighting off accusations of racism after he was recorded on video making what appear to be anti-arab comments .

many fear that the process is merely a show trial for the icc . much was made of the arrest of congolese militia leader thomas lubanga dyilo in 2005 on charges of recruiting and using child soldiers in the bloody congolese civil war between 1998 and 2003 .
lubanga was accused of creating an entire infrastructure around child soldiers in the ituri region and commanding forces responsible for massive human rights violations , including ethnic massacres , murder , torture , rape and mutilation in the democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- . his arrest , the first under a warrant issued by the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- , was seen as the first step in an international crackdown on seemingly out-of-control military leaders using human rights abuses as tactics in many of africa 's brutal conflicts .
his trial for war crimes in the hague , which began in january this year , appeared to show that the icc was a judicial force to be reckoned with and that a flood of arrests and convictions would follow . but as the prosecution rested its case in july , leaving lubanga 's counsel to prepare its defense case ahead of its october presentation , increasing criticism of the trial and accusations against the icc gathered pace in the drc . congolese call trial a " neo-colonial project " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the icc is making an example of lubanga many congolese accuse the historic process against lubanga as being a show trial , saying that the icc are trying one individual while many others remain free to commit more human rights abuses in congo .
some have called lubanga ’ s trial a " neo-colonial project " and that the icc is trying to set an example rather than using the case as part of an on-going quest to bring others like lubanga to justice .
they say his is a token arrest . " there 's a growing disconnection between how the icc is seen in the west and how it 's perceived in africa , " richard gowan , an africa expert at the european center for foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" it has focused almost entirely on african cases so far , so many africans believe it ’ s being used in a colonial way and western leaders haven ’ t done enough to dispel this negative impression . " anneke van woudenberg , human rights watch 's congo expert , believes that distrust in the icc has its roots in both a political agenda and public confusion in congo . " this is certainly not a sham trial and this is something which has been propagated by lubanga ’ s supporters and those loyal to him in the ituri region , " she told deutsche welle .
" there has been confusion in congo over the narrow nature of the charges .
many don ’ t understand why lubanga has been charged only with the recruitment of child soldiers when he was responsible for the ethnic murders , rape and torture which made the ituri conflict the bloodiest in the congo war .
in addition , the evidence against him is very strong . " others fear that a conviction against lubanga will be held up as a justification for the icc ’ s existence but will result in a slow decline of its pursuit of other war criminals , not only in the drc but all over africa and the world . " i do n't subscribe to these congolese assertions , other than the undeniable fact that many suspected perpetrators of war crimes in the drc remain free and in positions of authority , " andrew philip , a congo expert with amnesty international , told deutsche welle .
" amnesty welcomes the icc investigations and prosecutions , although we have encouraged and continue to encourage the icc prosecutor to extend investigations to other areas of drc than just in the ituri region , and to other crimes within its mandate . " van woudenberg also believes that many more war crimes suspects remain at large but believes that the icc will not be stopping with lubanga . " the icc will not stop with lubanga and besides , he is not alone in standing trial , " she said . " there are three other individuals charged alongside him .
but what the icc prosecutor has to do is to look past the ituri conflict and the warlords there and go after those who supported and funded lubanga .
this would lead them to the higher echelons of not only the congolese government but also those in uganda and rwanda .
for this to have a wider effect the icc must not stop at the warlord level . " critics claim un deaths accelerated lubanga pursuit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's claimed the death of un troops speeded up the pursuit it has also been alleged that lubanga was only brought to trial after he was implicated in the deaths of un troops in the drc and that otherwise , the international community would have continued to turn what some congolese believe to be a blind eye to atrocities there .
some claim that while six million people have been killed in congo over the last 12 years and a wide range of abuses recorded , it took the death of nine bangladeshi peacekeepers in the northwestern region of ituri to stir the icc into action . " the claim that the deaths of the un soldiers prompted international action is misplaced , " said van woudenberg .
" ituri was the bloodiest region where more people were killed than anywhere else in congo so this was the icc ’ s first focus in its search for war crimes suspects .
because of the violence there , there were a lot of un troops and consequently un troops died there - but it wasn ’ t the only place in congo where they died . " it is also claimed that congo 's natural resources played a part in the international community ’ s hesitation to act .
the drc is rich in natural gas and crude oil reserves , while zinc , uranium and copper deposits are also plentiful . experts say conviction would prove positive for human rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite international efforts , congo still suffers despite these claims , human rights and legal experts believe lubanga 's trial and possible conviction will have a positive effect on the overall battle for human rights and motivate the world to pursue war criminals and bring them to justice at the icc . " in terms of human rights , lubanga ’ s trial is hugely significant , " said van woudenberg . " it is the first case at the icc and a conviction would enhance the icc ’ s efforts .
if he is convicted it will be a first for a suspect involved in the recruitment and use of child soldiers .
his arrest has already has a huge effect , bringing child soldiers to international attention and making african leaders aware that this is actually a crime .
we would like to see more offences added to his charge sheet so any conviction would hopefully have as strong an impact on those areas of abuses .

many fear that the process is merely a show trial for the icc . much was made of the arrest of congolese militia leader thomas lubanga dyilo in 2005 on charges of recruiting and using child soldiers in the bloody congolese civil war between 1998 and 2003 .
lubanga was accused of creating an entire infrastructure around child soldiers in the ituri region and commanding forces responsible for massive human rights violations , including ethnic massacres , murder , torture , rape and mutilation in the democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- . his arrest , the first under a warrant issued by the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- , was seen as the first step in an international crackdown on seemingly out-of-control military leaders using human rights abuses as tactics in many of africa 's brutal conflicts .
his trial for war crimes in the hague , which began in january this year , appeared to show that the icc was a judicial force to be reckoned with and that a flood of arrests and convictions would follow . but as the prosecution rested its case in july , leaving lubanga 's counsel to prepare its defense case ahead of its october presentation , increasing criticism of the trial and accusations against the icc gathered pace in the drc . congolese call trial a " neo-colonial project " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the icc is making an example of lubanga many congolese accuse the historic process against lubanga as being a show trial , saying that the icc are trying one individual while many others remain free to commit more human rights abuses in congo .
some have called lubanga ’ s trial a " neo-colonial project " and that the icc is trying to set an example rather than using the case as part of an on-going quest to bring others like lubanga to justice .
they say his is a token arrest . " there 's a growing disconnection between how the icc is seen in the west and how it 's perceived in africa , " richard gowan , an africa expert at the european center for foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" it has focused almost entirely on african cases so far , so many africans believe it ’ s being used in a colonial way and western leaders haven ’ t done enough to dispel this negative impression . " anneke van woudenberg , human rights watch 's congo expert , believes that distrust in the icc has its roots in both a political agenda and public confusion in congo . " this is certainly not a sham trial and this is something which has been propagated by lubanga ’ s supporters and those loyal to him in the ituri region , " she told deutsche welle .
" there has been confusion in congo over the narrow nature of the charges .
many don ’ t understand why lubanga has been charged only with the recruitment of child soldiers when he was responsible for the ethnic murders , rape and torture which made the ituri conflict the bloodiest in the congo war .
in addition , the evidence against him is very strong . " others fear that a conviction against lubanga will be held up as a justification for the icc ’ s existence but will result in a slow decline of its pursuit of other war criminals , not only in the drc but all over africa and the world . " i do n't subscribe to these congolese assertions , other than the undeniable fact that many suspected perpetrators of war crimes in the drc remain free and in positions of authority , " andrew philip , a congo expert with amnesty international , told deutsche welle .
" amnesty welcomes the icc investigations and prosecutions , although we have encouraged and continue to encourage the icc prosecutor to extend investigations to other areas of drc than just in the ituri region , and to other crimes within its mandate . " van woudenberg also believes that many more war crimes suspects remain at large but believes that the icc will not be stopping with lubanga . " the icc will not stop with lubanga and besides , he is not alone in standing trial , " she said . " there are three other individuals charged alongside him .
but what the icc prosecutor has to do is to look past the ituri conflict and the warlords there and go after those who supported and funded lubanga .
this would lead them to the higher echelons of not only the congolese government but also those in uganda and rwanda .
for this to have a wider effect the icc must not stop at the warlord level . " critics claim un deaths accelerated lubanga pursuit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's claimed the death of un troops speeded up the pursuit it has also been alleged that lubanga was only brought to trial after he was implicated in the deaths of un troops in the drc and that otherwise , the international community would have continued to turn what some congolese believe to be a blind eye to atrocities there .
some claim that while six million people have been killed in congo over the last 12 years and a wide range of abuses recorded , it took the death of nine bangladeshi peacekeepers in the northwestern region of ituri to stir the icc into action . " the claim that the deaths of the un soldiers prompted international action is misplaced , " said van woudenberg .
" ituri was the bloodiest region where more people were killed than anywhere else in congo so this was the icc ’ s first focus in its search for war crimes suspects .
because of the violence there , there were a lot of un troops and consequently un troops died there - but it wasn ’ t the only place in congo where they died . " it is also claimed that congo 's natural resources played a part in the international community ’ s hesitation to act .
the drc is rich in natural gas and crude oil reserves , while zinc , uranium and copper deposits are also plentiful . experts say conviction would prove positive for human rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite international efforts , congo still suffers despite these claims , human rights and legal experts believe lubanga 's trial and possible conviction will have a positive effect on the overall battle for human rights and motivate the world to pursue war criminals and bring them to justice at the icc . " in terms of human rights , lubanga ’ s trial is hugely significant , " said van woudenberg . " it is the first case at the icc and a conviction would enhance the icc ’ s efforts .
if he is convicted it will be a first for a suspect involved in the recruitment and use of child soldiers .
his arrest has already has a huge effect , bringing child soldiers to international attention and making african leaders aware that this is actually a crime .
we would like to see more offences added to his charge sheet so any conviction would hopefully have as strong an impact on those areas of abuses .

his trial for war crimes in the hague , which began in january this year , appeared to show that the icc was a judicial force to be reckoned with and that a flood of arrests and convictions would follow . but as the prosecution rested its case in july , leaving lubanga 's counsel to prepare its defense case ahead of its october presentation , increasing criticism of the trial and accusations against the icc gathered pace in the drc . congolese call trial a " neo-colonial project " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the icc is making an example of lubanga many congolese accuse the historic process against lubanga as being a show trial , saying that the icc are trying one individual while many others remain free to commit more human rights abuses in congo .
some have called lubanga ’ s trial a " neo-colonial project " and that the icc is trying to set an example rather than using the case as part of an on-going quest to bring others like lubanga to justice .
they say his is a token arrest . " there 's a growing disconnection between how the icc is seen in the west and how it 's perceived in africa , " richard gowan , an africa expert at the european center for foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" it has focused almost entirely on african cases so far , so many africans believe it ’ s being used in a colonial way and western leaders haven ’ t done enough to dispel this negative impression . " anneke van woudenberg , human rights watch 's congo expert , believes that distrust in the icc has its roots in both a political agenda and public confusion in congo . " this is certainly not a sham trial and this is something which has been propagated by lubanga ’ s supporters and those loyal to him in the ituri region , " she told deutsche welle .
" there has been confusion in congo over the narrow nature of the charges .
many don ’ t understand why lubanga has been charged only with the recruitment of child soldiers when he was responsible for the ethnic murders , rape and torture which made the ituri conflict the bloodiest in the congo war .
in addition , the evidence against him is very strong . " others fear that a conviction against lubanga will be held up as a justification for the icc ’ s existence but will result in a slow decline of its pursuit of other war criminals , not only in the drc but all over africa and the world . " i do n't subscribe to these congolese assertions , other than the undeniable fact that many suspected perpetrators of war crimes in the drc remain free and in positions of authority , " andrew philip , a congo expert with amnesty international , told deutsche welle .
" amnesty welcomes the icc investigations and prosecutions , although we have encouraged and continue to encourage the icc prosecutor to extend investigations to other areas of drc than just in the ituri region , and to other crimes within its mandate . " van woudenberg also believes that many more war crimes suspects remain at large but believes that the icc will not be stopping with lubanga . " the icc will not stop with lubanga and besides , he is not alone in standing trial , " she said . " there are three other individuals charged alongside him .
but what the icc prosecutor has to do is to look past the ituri conflict and the warlords there and go after those who supported and funded lubanga .
this would lead them to the higher echelons of not only the congolese government but also those in uganda and rwanda .
for this to have a wider effect the icc must not stop at the warlord level . " critics claim un deaths accelerated lubanga pursuit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's claimed the death of un troops speeded up the pursuit it has also been alleged that lubanga was only brought to trial after he was implicated in the deaths of un troops in the drc and that otherwise , the international community would have continued to turn what some congolese believe to be a blind eye to atrocities there .
some claim that while six million people have been killed in congo over the last 12 years and a wide range of abuses recorded , it took the death of nine bangladeshi peacekeepers in the northwestern region of ituri to stir the icc into action . " the claim that the deaths of the un soldiers prompted international action is misplaced , " said van woudenberg .
" ituri was the bloodiest region where more people were killed than anywhere else in congo so this was the icc ’ s first focus in its search for war crimes suspects .
because of the violence there , there were a lot of un troops and consequently un troops died there - but it wasn ’ t the only place in congo where they died . " it is also claimed that congo 's natural resources played a part in the international community ’ s hesitation to act .
the drc is rich in natural gas and crude oil reserves , while zinc , uranium and copper deposits are also plentiful . experts say conviction would prove positive for human rights # b # despite these claims , human rights and legal experts believe lubanga 's trial and possible conviction will have a positive effect on the overall battle for human rights and motivate the world to pursue war criminals and bring them to justice at the icc . " in terms of human rights , lubanga ’ s trial is hugely significant , " said van woudenberg . " it is the first case at the icc and a conviction would enhance the icc ’ s efforts .
if he is convicted it will be a first for a suspect involved in the recruitment and use of child soldiers .
his arrest has already has a huge effect , bringing child soldiers to international attention and making african leaders aware that this is actually a crime .
we would like to see more offences added to his charge sheet so any conviction would hopefully have as strong an impact on those areas of abuses .

" it could n't have been a duel anyway , " wrote die welt daily . " for one thing , the need for ideological debate seems to be exhausted in this country .
and for another , the two politicians could not hit out at one another because it is not their style .
another reason is that they have worked together for four years in a coalition government they managed in harmony .
they agree on many issues , so they could not have credibly portrayed being at odds with each other .
the debate ended with a balanced 1:1 . "
" and why should the politicians badmouth the work they have been doing together for the past four years , " asked the sueddeutsche zeitung paper , " they may have to rule together again after -lsb- the -rsb- sept .
27 -lsb- election -rsb- .
the format of a duel is not appropriate to convey political content . "
the berliner zeitung wrote : " steinmeier only managed to attack for a few moments .
he was obviously lacking the necessary brutality and ruthlessness in view of the past four years in a joint government .
voters who wanted to find out what the world would look like with a coalition of christian democrats and free democrats , or under the leadership of the social democrats , did not learn a thing in the debate . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two are anxious to set themselves apart mass-circulation daily bild had the following assessment : " after a 90-minute ' duel , ' we are none the wiser .
this was not an exciting duel ; it was shop talk between the chancellor and her deputy . and this discussion was a signal : neither merkel nor steinmeier would mind continuing the grand coalition . "
" it seems as if merkel and steinmeier have forged a quiet alliance for the last weeks of the election campaign , even as their coalition government grows increasingly less popular among voters , " wrote the nordsee-zeitung from the country 's north .
" expectations for the debate were not high in the first place ; there was no real verbal sparring , there were no new facts : somehow , they do appear to still like each other . "
bonn 's general-anzeiger summed it up : " the two get along well , and that was evident last night . " db / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de merkel to face rival steinmeier in german election tv debate chancellor merkel squares off with rival steinmeier in a tv debate sunday seen as a last chance for him to boost support for his social democratic party and close the large gap on the popular german leader .
-lrb- 13.09.2009 -rrb- tv election debates attract viewers but are short on substance as chancellor merkel faces rival steinmeier in a tv debate sunday , guest commentators alan schroeder and christoph bieber trace the origins of televised election debates and their growing popularity around the world .

banks say they are simply trying to avoid risky loans . french banks have recently been accused of shunning small and medium-sized businesses in particular since the crisis struck - despite receiving billions of euros in state aid designed to keep credit flowing . clair service hotellerie is one of the companies affected by the banks tightened lending .
from small headquarters in paris , it provides staff for the hotel industry worldwide .
its recruits , often from eastern europe , are employed directly and trained by the company . the agency 's survival has been threatened by cash flow problems since its bank revoked the company 's overdraft facility a year ago , burdening the agency with tens of thousands of euros in extra charges . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : staffing hotels could become impossible for one french company " overnight we could not pay salaries or social charges on time , " the agency 's marketing manager , renaud chemin , said .
he added that the bank had told it to increase its capital , a suggestion the company says is impossible under current circumstances . clair service hotellerie now faces bankruptcy within three months . " since the bank will not make our situation easier , it just means the end of the company , " chemin said . such an outcome would be bound to have an impact on employees like katarina piekarmiak . she trained to be a french teacher in her native poland , but found jobs hard to come by . she replied to an advertisement from france and , since january , she has been on the agency 's books , hired out to a hotel in paris where she works as a receptionist . " in poland i was unemployed , so this work allows me to earn money and live normally , " she said .
" without this agency i 'd be unemployed again , and if i found nothing else here i 'd go back home and probably be out of work again . " banks accused of starving businesses many other small firms face problems similar to those of clair service hotellerie - especially in the restaurant industry where the banks stand accused of eschewing the whole sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : banks are becoming extremely cautious , mezziouane said " i increasingly notice banks that are more and more hesitant and more and more cautious when it comes to taking risks , " said abdellah mezziouane , general secretary of the cgpme in paris , which represents small and medium-sized businesses .
" we have concrete cases where small and medium-sized businesses can no longer find the means to finance their development and their investment , and no longer have access to funds . " a mediator appointed by the government to investigate complaints is dealing with a surge in the number of claims from small and medium-sized businesses .
last year , the banks , which had received billions of euros in state aid , agreed to increase loans by 3 percent to 4 percent .
but they have not reached that target . who is to blame ? the banks have defended themselves against charges that they are becoming too tight-fisted . some analysts have agreed with the banks , saying reduced demand caused by the recession is to blame for failure to meet lending targets . " for one or two quarters neither households nor companies were willing to borrow any more , " said cyril blesson , chief economist with seeds finance consultants . banks have perceived small businesses in particular to be too high a risk during the crisis , and tightened their lending conditions late last year , blesson added . however , with interest rates consistently low , he said he sees grounds for optimism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demand for credit is slowing picking up , some analysts said " according to the lending surveys from the central banks and especially the banque de france , we have signs of a revival in demand for credit , " blesson said .
" that is good , but now we also need banks to lend to households and companies that are willing to get indebted again . " adopt " small-business attitude " in the meantime , as many smaller companies continue to suffer , both the french government and business leaders have appealed to the banks to be more flexible . finance minister christine lagarde has written to 12 banks that have received state support , giving them until the end of the month to outline the measures they are taking to revitalize their credit policies . " i ask the french banking sector to adopt the attitude of small and medium sized companies , " laurence parisot , head of the medef employers ' organization , said in a recent radio interview .

now governments have prominent roles in the financial sector and are under pressure to change the rules . the casino is back in business , trading and speculating on the financial markets are on their way to reach pre-crisis levels .
banks are again posting profits and managers are again looking forward to big bonuses .
a year after us investment bank lehman brothers filed for bankruptcy , not much has changed - at least not in the sector that triggered the global financial crisis . new data suggest that after passing the crisis on to the economy beyond the walls of wall street , the financial markets have yet again managed to close the shutters to the real world . the bank for international settlements , the world 's biggest central bank body , reported sunday that interbank money markets are recovering to levels not seen since early 2008 .
the bank said that shows financial institutions are once again dealing with one another , but that they also remain hesitant to extend credit to businesses . reduced risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's central bank chief axel weber says : " growth not sustainable yet . "
germany 's federal bank chief axel weber , however , said the somewhat brighter general economic outlook is in part due to the government bailout of financial markets , which has contributed to " systemic risk reduction . " " aggressive monetary policy and huge economic stimulus packages " have also helped improve prospects , he said , but added that such measures make it hard to know if growth will be self-sustainable . but while bankers are benefiting from rebounding markets for the moment , the impact of the crisis on global economies and political decisions means that even they will face new realities in the long run .
to prevent markets - and ultimately their economies - from collapsing , national governments have financially propped up or de facto nationalized major banks . leaders of the g-20 group of major nations pledged in april to strengthen financial supervision and establish stricter rules on bonus payments .
when they meet again this month in the united states they are expected to reinforce those measures . economic crisis not over yet politicians have ample reason to remain anxious .
germany is bracing for a new wave of bankruptcies this fall and unemployment figures are also set to rise , just statistics have shown that more businesses and individuals are expected to default on credit payments . experts estimate that german lenders alone could face losing 120 billion euros -lrb- $ 176 billion -rrb- by 2011 as a result .
the situation across the european union does not look much different , even though the european commission on monday announced that the euro zone is emerging from recession . " the eu economy appears to be at a turning point , " an interim forecast said , but it confirmed that the economy of the 16 countries using the euro would contract by 4 percent this year . disaster lurking in balance sheets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imf warns the crisis is not over despite positive signals from europe 's biggest economies , the head of the international monetary fund has warned that the global economic crisis is not over yet . " in the minds of too many - not only regular people but also top politicians - the financial crisis is already behind us , " dominique strauss-kahn told german news weekly der spiegel , adding that more work on financial sector regulation was needed . despite posting massive profits , the economic underpinnings of financial businesses themselves remain fragile a year after the lehman collapse . hypo real estate , nationalized by the german government and injected with 3 billion euros of fresh capital , is continuing to cause problems for german politicians and economic leaders .
the bank is set to receive 7 billion euros more before the year 's end but , according to media reports , another 16 billion euros of losses that have not yet " materialized " are lurking in the bank 's books . those least responsible for crisis are worst affected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prices for commodities from developing nations have slumped while wall street thinks it has recovered and industrialized economies anticipate they will soon follow , the global crisis may continue to affect those least responsible for it . the downturn has hit the african continent especially hard despite it not being involved in its making , civil society organizations gathered in the capital of the democratic republic of the congo heard at the fifth people 's summit of the southern african development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- . commodity prices have all but collapsed , ngos told the gathering .

it has fired up simmering debates over juvenile justice , as well as moral decay and civil courage in germany .
on saturday afternoon , sept .
12 , a businessman riding a local tram stepped in to protect a group of four young teenagers from three youths , 17 and 18 years old , who were harassing the youngsters for money .
the 50-year-old man called the police from his cell phone , and offered the four , aged 13 to 15 , to accompany them off the tram at his end destination , the wealthy munich neighborhood of solln .
reminiscent of earlier attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people laid flowers where the yet-unnamed samaritan lost his life after they got off the tram , however , the older teens continued to harass the younger ones .
the good samaritan tried to intercede , and the two young men attacked him , punching and kicking him until he was unconscious on the tram platform .
according to police , he died in the hospital a few hours later .

together they would produce more than 12,000 megawatts of energy , which could supply power to 12 million households , the transport ministry said . " this would bring us closer to our goal of producing 25,000 megawatts offshore by 2030 , " tiefensee told the daily hamburger abendblatt . he added that the ministry had approved some of the 2,500 applications received by his office for wind turbines in the north and baltic seas .
tiefensee told the paper he would present a proposal for the wind farms at a cabinet meeting with chancellor angela merkel on wednesday . costs for the new wind farms have not yet been established , a spokesperson for the transport ministry told the hamburg newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in germany are wondering where and how to store radioactive waste the move comes as politicians debate the continued use of nuclear power in germany and how to deal with the radioactive waste it generates . " the current discussion about the nuclear waste depot gorleben shows once again very clearly that we need to expand renewable energy , " said tiefensee , who is a member of the center-left social democrats . dozens of farms already approved of the 40 wind farms planned , 30 would be in the north sea and 10 in the baltic sea .
twenty-two have already received government approval and berlin intends to set aside some 100 square kilometers -lrb- 39 square miles -rrb- for offshore power projects .
most will be built near the east frisian islands . " we are securing and creating jobs in one of the markets of the future , " tiefensee said , adding that wind farms could mean 30,000 jobs in germany .
" we want germany to be at the fore of this technology . " approval has already been given for 22 offshore wind farms in the north sea and another three in the baltic with a total of 1,800 turbines , according to christian dahmke of germany 's federal maritime and hydrographic agency .
he added that officials were considering another 55 applications . germany is n't out to sea alone over the last week a number of similar announcements have been made in other european countries , indicating that wind energy will gain greater prominence in the political and public debates over renewable energy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are already some turbines spinning off the german coast turbine maker ge electric announced thursday that it signed agreements to supply what would become the largest european on-shore wind farm in romania , while oil-nation norway said the same day it had authorized its first ever off-shore wind facility . planning for huge wind farms out at sea has been going on for years , but little tangible progress had actually been made .
technical problems have been a main challenge . the head of the european wind energy association , christian kjaer , on monday also called on eu governments to give a clear signal of their support to the wind power industry . up to 16 percent of all energy consumed in the eu could come from wind farms by 2020 .

together they would produce more than 12,000 megawatts of energy , which could supply power to 12 million households , the transport ministry said . " this would bring us closer to our goal of producing 25,000 megawatts offshore by 2030 , " tiefensee told the daily hamburger abendblatt . he added that the ministry had approved some of the 2,500 applications received by his office for wind turbines in the north and baltic seas .
tiefensee told the paper he would present a proposal for the wind farms at a cabinet meeting with chancellor angela merkel on wednesday . costs for the new wind farms have not yet been established , a spokesperson for the transport ministry told the hamburg newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in germany are wondering where and how to store radioactive waste the move comes as politicians debate the continued use of nuclear power in germany and how to deal with the radioactive waste it generates . " the current discussion about the nuclear waste depot gorleben shows once again very clearly that we need to expand renewable energy , " said tiefensee , who is a member of the center-left social democrats . dozens of farms already approved of the 40 wind farms planned , 30 would be in the north sea and 10 in the baltic sea .
twenty-two have already received government approval and berlin intends to set aside some 100 square kilometers -lrb- 39 square miles -rrb- for offshore power projects .
most will be built near the east frisian islands . " we are securing and creating jobs in one of the markets of the future , " tiefensee said , adding that wind farms could mean 30,000 jobs in germany .
" we want germany to be at the fore of this technology . " approval has already been given for 22 offshore wind farms in the north sea and another three in the baltic with a total of 1,800 turbines , according to christian dahmke of germany 's federal maritime and hydrographic agency .
he added that officials were considering another 55 applications . germany is n't out to sea alone over the last week a number of similar announcements have been made in other european countries , indicating that wind energy will gain greater prominence in the political and public debates over renewable energy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are already some turbines spinning off the german coast turbine maker ge electric announced thursday that it signed agreements to supply what would become the largest european on-shore wind farm in romania , while oil-nation norway said the same day it had authorized its first ever off-shore wind facility . planning for huge wind farms out at sea has been going on for years , but little tangible progress had actually been made .
technical problems have been a main challenge . the head of the european wind energy association , christian kjaer , on monday also called on eu governments to give a clear signal of their support to the wind power industry . up to 16 percent of all energy consumed in the eu could come from wind farms by 2020 .

twenty-two have already received government approval and berlin intends to set aside some 100 square kilometers -lrb- 39 square miles -rrb- for offshore power projects .
most will be built near the east frisian islands . " we are securing and creating jobs in one of the markets of the future , " tiefensee said , adding that wind farms could mean 30,000 jobs in germany .
" we want germany to be at the fore of this technology . " approval has already been given for 22 offshore wind farms in the north sea and another three in the baltic with a total of 1,800 turbines , according to christian dahmke of germany 's federal maritime and hydrographic agency .
he added that officials were considering another 55 applications . germany is n't out to sea alone over the last week a number of similar announcements have been made in other european countries , indicating that wind energy will gain greater prominence in the political and public debates over renewable energy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are already some turbines spinning off the german coast turbine maker ge electric announced thursday that it signed agreements to supply what would become the largest european on-shore wind farm in romania , while oil-nation norway said the same day it had authorized its first ever off-shore wind facility . planning for huge wind farms out at sea has been going on for years , but little tangible progress had actually been made .
technical problems have been a main challenge . the head of the european wind energy association , christian kjaer , on monday also called on eu governments to give a clear signal of their support to the wind power industry . up to 16 percent of all energy consumed in the eu could come from wind farms by 2020 .
plans for such offshore facilities would cost 57 billion euros -lrb- $ 83 billion -rrb- with transmission lines costing between 20 and 30 billion euros , the organization estimated . sms / rri / dpa / afp / ap editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' mea culpa ' includes film , music and text excerpts in " mea culpa , " the 48-year-old describes the highs and lows that he has suffered during his illness , and reveals his feelings and his dreams - among them the idea of creating a festival hall in africa . link to earlier work the opera also evokes earlier works , such as his staging of richard wagner 's " parsifal . "
schlingensief has indicated a link between his life-changing illness and his work on a controversial production of richard wagner 's “ parsifal ” for the 2004-2007 bayreuth festivals . wagner is a kind of leitmotif through the collage-like work , which also includes music by johann sebastian bach , arnold schoenberg , franz schubert and robert schumann .

" it could n't have been a duel anyway , " wrote die welt daily . " for one thing , the need for ideological debate seems to be exhausted in this country .
and for another , the two politicians could not hit out at one another because it is not their style .
another reason is that they have worked together for four years in a coalition government they managed in harmony .
they agree on many issues , so they could not have credibly portrayed being at odds with each other .
the debate ended with a balanced 1:1 . "
" and why should the politicians badmouth the work they have been doing together for the past four years , " asked the sueddeutsche zeitung paper , " they may have to rule together again after -lsb- the -rsb- sept .
27 -lsb- election -rsb- .
the format of a duel is not appropriate to convey political content . "
the berliner zeitung wrote : " steinmeier only managed to attack for a few moments .
he was obviously lacking the necessary brutality and ruthlessness in view of the past four years in a joint government .
voters who wanted to find out what the world would look like with a coalition of christian democrats and free democrats , or under the leadership of the social democrats , did not learn a thing in the debate . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two are anxious to set themselves apart mass-circulation daily bild had the following assessment : " after a 90-minute ' duel , ' we are none the wiser .
this was not an exciting duel ; it was shop talk between the chancellor and her deputy . and this discussion was a signal : neither merkel nor steinmeier would mind continuing the grand coalition . "
" it seems as if merkel and steinmeier have forged a quiet alliance for the last weeks of the election campaign , even as their coalition government grows increasingly less popular among voters , " wrote the nordsee-zeitung from the country 's north .
" expectations for the debate were not high in the first place ; there was no real verbal sparring , there were no new facts : somehow , they do appear to still like each other . "
bonn 's general-anzeiger summed it up : " the two get along well , and that was evident last night . " db / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

twenty million people watched the tv debate , hoping to see a clear winner emerge after 90 minutes .
but there was no real heated political debate from the two partners in germany 's four-year-old grand coalition .
two snap polls held after the debates came to very different conclusions .
a poll by german broadcaster zdf showed 31 percent for spd challenger steinmeier as the winner of the tv duel compared to 28 percent for merkel .
a poll conducted by forsa poll had merkel in front with 37 percent , against 35 percent for steinmeier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fireworks were missing in the chancellor debate but asked which candidate was best qualified to run the country , 58 percent chose merkel compared to 28 percent for steinmeier , a poll by broadcaster rtl showed .
dressed in dark business suits , both candidates emphasized what they had achieved in the last four years in a coalition government .
for steinmeier the stakes were higher .
the spd challenger had to score points to make up for a poor showing in the polls .
" we have achieved a lot .
quite a bit of it since the crisis and we may only have done so because there was a grand coalition , " he said .
" but we have n't managed everything , we fell short of what we could do in a number of areas because the cdu did n't go along with it .
for example on minimum wages and limiting executive pay .
that would have helped people . "
merkel agreed that they had " worked well together " but said that to turn around the economy after the financial crisis she would prefer the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- as her junior coalition partner .
" i think we could make more progress on jobs which is why i 'm appealing for a new government , " she said .
" the past has been good and you wo n't change my mind about the fact that we have got a lot done .
but i think for a democracy it 's good when grand coalitions do n't become normality . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : duel or duet ?
german foreign minister and vice chancellor steinmeier spoke of a change in political direction , emphasizing that voters had a clear alternative to a future coalition between the christian democrats and free democrats .
merkel and steinmeier both tried to claim credit for the rescue of car maker opel after canadian-austrian parts maker magna agreed last week to take over the troubled general motors ' subsidiary .
most political observers agreed that the more " presidential " chancellor merkel showed her crisis management credentials while steinmeier scored points on social equality .
much of the 90-minute debate focused on ways out of the economic crisis with merkel arguing in favor of tax cuts to stimulate demand .
merkel and steinmeier also discussed managers ' salary and bonus payments , minimum wages and nuclear energy .

many fear that the process is merely a show trial for the icc . much was made of the arrest of congolese militia leader thomas lubanga dyilo in 2005 on charges of recruiting and using child soldiers in the bloody congolese civil war between 1998 and 2003 .
lubanga was accused of creating an entire infrastructure around child soldiers in the ituri region and commanding forces responsible for massive human rights violations , including ethnic massacres , murder , torture , rape and mutilation in the democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- . his arrest , the first under a warrant issued by the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- , was seen as the first step in an international crackdown on seemingly out-of-control military leaders using human rights abuses as tactics in many of africa 's brutal conflicts .
his trial for war crimes in the hague , which began in january this year , appeared to show that the icc was a judicial force to be reckoned with and that a flood of arrests and convictions would follow . but as the prosecution rested its case in july , leaving lubanga 's counsel to prepare its defense case ahead of its october presentation , increasing criticism of the trial and accusations against the icc gathered pace in the drc . congolese call trial a " neo-colonial project " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the icc is making an example of lubanga many congolese accuse the historic process against lubanga as being a show trial , saying that the icc are trying one individual while many others remain free to commit more human rights abuses in congo .
some have called lubanga ’ s trial a " neo-colonial project " and that the icc is trying to set an example rather than using the case as part of an on-going quest to bring others like lubanga to justice .
they say his is a token arrest . " there 's a growing disconnection between how the icc is seen in the west and how it 's perceived in africa , " richard gowan , an africa expert at the european center for foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" it has focused almost entirely on african cases so far , so many africans believe it ’ s being used in a colonial way and western leaders haven ’ t done enough to dispel this negative impression . " anneke van woudenberg , human rights watch 's congo expert , believes that distrust in the icc has its roots in both a political agenda and public confusion in congo . " this is certainly not a sham trial and this is something which has been propagated by lubanga ’ s supporters and those loyal to him in the ituri region , " she told deutsche welle .
" there has been confusion in congo over the narrow nature of the charges .
many don ’ t understand why lubanga has been charged only with the recruitment of child soldiers when he was responsible for the ethnic murders , rape and torture which made the ituri conflict the bloodiest in the congo war .
in addition , the evidence against him is very strong . " others fear that a conviction against lubanga will be held up as a justification for the icc ’ s existence but will result in a slow decline of its pursuit of other war criminals , not only in the drc but all over africa and the world . " i do n't subscribe to these congolese assertions , other than the undeniable fact that many suspected perpetrators of war crimes in the drc remain free and in positions of authority , " andrew philip , a congo expert with amnesty international , told deutsche welle .
" amnesty welcomes the icc investigations and prosecutions , although we have encouraged and continue to encourage the icc prosecutor to extend investigations to other areas of drc than just in the ituri region , and to other crimes within its mandate . " van woudenberg also believes that many more war crimes suspects remain at large but believes that the icc will not be stopping with lubanga . " the icc will not stop with lubanga and besides , he is not alone in standing trial , " she said . " there are three other individuals charged alongside him .
but what the icc prosecutor has to do is to look past the ituri conflict and the warlords there and go after those who supported and funded lubanga .
this would lead them to the higher echelons of not only the congolese government but also those in uganda and rwanda .
for this to have a wider effect the icc must not stop at the warlord level . " critics claim un deaths accelerated lubanga pursuit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's claimed the death of un troops speeded up the pursuit it has also been alleged that lubanga was only brought to trial after he was implicated in the deaths of un troops in the drc and that otherwise , the international community would have continued to turn what some congolese believe to be a blind eye to atrocities there .
some claim that while six million people have been killed in congo over the last 12 years and a wide range of abuses recorded , it took the death of nine bangladeshi peacekeepers in the northwestern region of ituri to stir the icc into action . " the claim that the deaths of the un soldiers prompted international action is misplaced , " said van woudenberg .
" ituri was the bloodiest region where more people were killed than anywhere else in congo so this was the icc ’ s first focus in its search for war crimes suspects .
because of the violence there , there were a lot of un troops and consequently un troops died there - but it wasn ’ t the only place in congo where they died . " it is also claimed that congo 's natural resources played a part in the international community ’ s hesitation to act .
the drc is rich in natural gas and crude oil reserves , while zinc , uranium and copper deposits are also plentiful . experts say conviction would prove positive for human rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite international efforts , congo still suffers despite these claims , human rights and legal experts believe lubanga 's trial and possible conviction will have a positive effect on the overall battle for human rights and motivate the world to pursue war criminals and bring them to justice at the icc . " in terms of human rights , lubanga ’ s trial is hugely significant , " said van woudenberg . " it is the first case at the icc and a conviction would enhance the icc ’ s efforts .
if he is convicted it will be a first for a suspect involved in the recruitment and use of child soldiers .
his arrest has already has a huge effect , bringing child soldiers to international attention and making african leaders aware that this is actually a crime .
we would like to see more offences added to his charge sheet so any conviction would hopefully have as strong an impact on those areas of abuses .

many fear that the process is merely a show trial for the icc . much was made of the arrest of congolese militia leader thomas lubanga dyilo in 2005 on charges of recruiting and using child soldiers in the bloody congolese civil war between 1998 and 2003 .
lubanga was accused of creating an entire infrastructure around child soldiers in the ituri region and commanding forces responsible for massive human rights violations , including ethnic massacres , murder , torture , rape and mutilation in the democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- . his arrest , the first under a warrant issued by the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- , was seen as the first step in an international crackdown on seemingly out-of-control military leaders using human rights abuses as tactics in many of africa 's brutal conflicts .
his trial for war crimes in the hague , which began in january this year , appeared to show that the icc was a judicial force to be reckoned with and that a flood of arrests and convictions would follow . but as the prosecution rested its case in july , leaving lubanga 's counsel to prepare its defense case ahead of its october presentation , increasing criticism of the trial and accusations against the icc gathered pace in the drc . congolese call trial a " neo-colonial project " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the icc is making an example of lubanga many congolese accuse the historic process against lubanga as being a show trial , saying that the icc are trying one individual while many others remain free to commit more human rights abuses in congo .
some have called lubanga ’ s trial a " neo-colonial project " and that the icc is trying to set an example rather than using the case as part of an on-going quest to bring others like lubanga to justice .
they say his is a token arrest . " there 's a growing disconnection between how the icc is seen in the west and how it 's perceived in africa , " richard gowan , an africa expert at the european center for foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" it has focused almost entirely on african cases so far , so many africans believe it ’ s being used in a colonial way and western leaders haven ’ t done enough to dispel this negative impression . " anneke van woudenberg , human rights watch 's congo expert , believes that distrust in the icc has its roots in both a political agenda and public confusion in congo . " this is certainly not a sham trial and this is something which has been propagated by lubanga ’ s supporters and those loyal to him in the ituri region , " she told deutsche welle .
" there has been confusion in congo over the narrow nature of the charges .
many don ’ t understand why lubanga has been charged only with the recruitment of child soldiers when he was responsible for the ethnic murders , rape and torture which made the ituri conflict the bloodiest in the congo war .
in addition , the evidence against him is very strong . " others fear that a conviction against lubanga will be held up as a justification for the icc ’ s existence but will result in a slow decline of its pursuit of other war criminals , not only in the drc but all over africa and the world . " i do n't subscribe to these congolese assertions , other than the undeniable fact that many suspected perpetrators of war crimes in the drc remain free and in positions of authority , " andrew philip , a congo expert with amnesty international , told deutsche welle .
" amnesty welcomes the icc investigations and prosecutions , although we have encouraged and continue to encourage the icc prosecutor to extend investigations to other areas of drc than just in the ituri region , and to other crimes within its mandate . " van woudenberg also believes that many more war crimes suspects remain at large but believes that the icc will not be stopping with lubanga . " the icc will not stop with lubanga and besides , he is not alone in standing trial , " she said . " there are three other individuals charged alongside him .
but what the icc prosecutor has to do is to look past the ituri conflict and the warlords there and go after those who supported and funded lubanga .
this would lead them to the higher echelons of not only the congolese government but also those in uganda and rwanda .
for this to have a wider effect the icc must not stop at the warlord level . " critics claim un deaths accelerated lubanga pursuit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's claimed the death of un troops speeded up the pursuit it has also been alleged that lubanga was only brought to trial after he was implicated in the deaths of un troops in the drc and that otherwise , the international community would have continued to turn what some congolese believe to be a blind eye to atrocities there .
some claim that while six million people have been killed in congo over the last 12 years and a wide range of abuses recorded , it took the death of nine bangladeshi peacekeepers in the northwestern region of ituri to stir the icc into action . " the claim that the deaths of the un soldiers prompted international action is misplaced , " said van woudenberg .
" ituri was the bloodiest region where more people were killed than anywhere else in congo so this was the icc ’ s first focus in its search for war crimes suspects .
because of the violence there , there were a lot of un troops and consequently un troops died there - but it wasn ’ t the only place in congo where they died . " it is also claimed that congo 's natural resources played a part in the international community ’ s hesitation to act .
the drc is rich in natural gas and crude oil reserves , while zinc , uranium and copper deposits are also plentiful . experts say conviction would prove positive for human rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite international efforts , congo still suffers despite these claims , human rights and legal experts believe lubanga 's trial and possible conviction will have a positive effect on the overall battle for human rights and motivate the world to pursue war criminals and bring them to justice at the icc . " in terms of human rights , lubanga ’ s trial is hugely significant , " said van woudenberg . " it is the first case at the icc and a conviction would enhance the icc ’ s efforts .
if he is convicted it will be a first for a suspect involved in the recruitment and use of child soldiers .
his arrest has already has a huge effect , bringing child soldiers to international attention and making african leaders aware that this is actually a crime .
we would like to see more offences added to his charge sheet so any conviction would hopefully have as strong an impact on those areas of abuses .

some have called lubanga ’ s trial a " neo-colonial project " and that the icc is trying to set an example rather than using the case as part of an on-going quest to bring others like lubanga to justice .
they say his is a token arrest . " there 's a growing disconnection between how the icc is seen in the west and how it 's perceived in africa , " richard gowan , an africa expert at the european center for foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" it has focused almost entirely on african cases so far , so many africans believe it ’ s being used in a colonial way and western leaders haven ’ t done enough to dispel this negative impression . " anneke van woudenberg , human rights watch 's congo expert , believes that distrust in the icc has its roots in both a political agenda and public confusion in congo . " this is certainly not a sham trial and this is something which has been propagated by lubanga ’ s supporters and those loyal to him in the ituri region , " she told deutsche welle .
" there has been confusion in congo over the narrow nature of the charges .
many don ’ t understand why lubanga has been charged only with the recruitment of child soldiers when he was responsible for the ethnic murders , rape and torture which made the ituri conflict the bloodiest in the congo war .
in addition , the evidence against him is very strong . " others fear that a conviction against lubanga will be held up as a justification for the icc ’ s existence but will result in a slow decline of its pursuit of other war criminals , not only in the drc but all over africa and the world . " i do n't subscribe to these congolese assertions , other than the undeniable fact that many suspected perpetrators of war crimes in the drc remain free and in positions of authority , " andrew philip , a congo expert with amnesty international , told deutsche welle .
" amnesty welcomes the icc investigations and prosecutions , although we have encouraged and continue to encourage the icc prosecutor to extend investigations to other areas of drc than just in the ituri region , and to other crimes within its mandate . " van woudenberg also believes that many more war crimes suspects remain at large but believes that the icc will not be stopping with lubanga . " the icc will not stop with lubanga and besides , he is not alone in standing trial , " she said . " there are three other individuals charged alongside him .
but what the icc prosecutor has to do is to look past the ituri conflict and the warlords there and go after those who supported and funded lubanga .
this would lead them to the higher echelons of not only the congolese government but also those in uganda and rwanda .
for this to have a wider effect the icc must not stop at the warlord level . " critics claim un deaths accelerated lubanga pursuit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's claimed the death of un troops speeded up the pursuit it has also been alleged that lubanga was only brought to trial after he was implicated in the deaths of un troops in the drc and that otherwise , the international community would have continued to turn what some congolese believe to be a blind eye to atrocities there .
some claim that while six million people have been killed in congo over the last 12 years and a wide range of abuses recorded , it took the death of nine bangladeshi peacekeepers in the northwestern region of ituri to stir the icc into action . " the claim that the deaths of the un soldiers prompted international action is misplaced , " said van woudenberg .
" ituri was the bloodiest region where more people were killed than anywhere else in congo so this was the icc ’ s first focus in its search for war crimes suspects .
because of the violence there , there were a lot of un troops and consequently un troops died there - but it wasn ’ t the only place in congo where they died . " it is also claimed that congo 's natural resources played a part in the international community ’ s hesitation to act .
the drc is rich in natural gas and crude oil reserves , while zinc , uranium and copper deposits are also plentiful . experts say conviction would prove positive for human rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite international efforts , congo still suffers despite these claims , human rights and legal experts believe lubanga 's trial and possible conviction will have a positive effect on the overall battle for human rights and motivate the world to pursue war criminals and bring them to justice at the icc . " in terms of human rights , lubanga ’ s trial is hugely significant , " said van woudenberg . " it is the first case at the icc and a conviction would enhance the icc ’ s efforts .
if he is convicted it will be a first for a suspect involved in the recruitment and use of child soldiers .
his arrest has already has a huge effect , bringing child soldiers to international attention and making african leaders aware that this is actually a crime .
we would like to see more offences added to his charge sheet so any conviction would hopefully have as strong an impact on those areas of abuses .

many fear that the process is merely a show trial for the icc . much was made of the arrest of congolese militia leader thomas lubanga dyilo in 2005 on charges of recruiting and using child soldiers in the bloody congolese civil war between 1998 and 2003 .
lubanga was accused of creating an entire infrastructure around child soldiers in the ituri region and commanding forces responsible for massive human rights violations , including ethnic massacres , murder , torture , rape and mutilation in the democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- . his arrest , the first under a warrant issued by the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- , was seen as the first step in an international crackdown on seemingly out-of-control military leaders using human rights abuses as tactics in many of africa 's brutal conflicts .
his trial for war crimes in the hague , which began in january this year , appeared to show that the icc was a judicial force to be reckoned with and that a flood of arrests and convictions would follow . but as the prosecution rested its case in july , leaving lubanga 's counsel to prepare its defense case ahead of its october presentation , increasing criticism of the trial and accusations against the icc gathered pace in the drc . congolese call trial a " neo-colonial project " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the icc is making an example of lubanga many congolese accuse the historic process against lubanga as being a show trial , saying that the icc are trying one individual while many others remain free to commit more human rights abuses in congo .
some have called lubanga ’ s trial a " neo-colonial project " and that the icc is trying to set an example rather than using the case as part of an on-going quest to bring others like lubanga to justice .
they say his is a token arrest . " there 's a growing disconnection between how the icc is seen in the west and how it 's perceived in africa , " richard gowan , an africa expert at the european center for foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" it has focused almost entirely on african cases so far , so many africans believe it ’ s being used in a colonial way and western leaders haven ’ t done enough to dispel this negative impression . " anneke van woudenberg , human rights watch 's congo expert , believes that distrust in the icc has its roots in both a political agenda and public confusion in congo . " this is certainly not a sham trial and this is something which has been propagated by lubanga ’ s supporters and those loyal to him in the ituri region , " she told deutsche welle .
" there has been confusion in congo over the narrow nature of the charges .
many don ’ t understand why lubanga has been charged only with the recruitment of child soldiers when he was responsible for the ethnic murders , rape and torture which made the ituri conflict the bloodiest in the congo war .
in addition , the evidence against him is very strong . " others fear that a conviction against lubanga will be held up as a justification for the icc ’ s existence but will result in a slow decline of its pursuit of other war criminals , not only in the drc but all over africa and the world . " i do n't subscribe to these congolese assertions , other than the undeniable fact that many suspected perpetrators of war crimes in the drc remain free and in positions of authority , " andrew philip , a congo expert with amnesty international , told deutsche welle .

many fear that the process is merely a show trial for the icc . much was made of the arrest of congolese militia leader thomas lubanga dyilo in 2005 on charges of recruiting and using child soldiers in the bloody congolese civil war between 1998 and 2003 .
lubanga was accused of creating an entire infrastructure around child soldiers in the ituri region and commanding forces responsible for massive human rights violations , including ethnic massacres , murder , torture , rape and mutilation in the democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- . his arrest , the first under a warrant issued by the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- , was seen as the first step in an international crackdown on seemingly out-of-control military leaders using human rights abuses as tactics in many of africa 's brutal conflicts .
his trial for war crimes in the hague , which began in january this year , appeared to show that the icc was a judicial force to be reckoned with and that a flood of arrests and convictions would follow . but as the prosecution rested its case in july , leaving lubanga 's counsel to prepare its defense case ahead of its october presentation , increasing criticism of the trial and accusations against the icc gathered pace in the drc . congolese call trial a " neo-colonial project " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the icc is making an example of lubanga many congolese accuse the historic process against lubanga as being a show trial , saying that the icc are trying one individual while many others remain free to commit more human rights abuses in congo .
some have called lubanga ’ s trial a " neo-colonial project " and that the icc is trying to set an example rather than using the case as part of an on-going quest to bring others like lubanga to justice .
they say his is a token arrest . " there 's a growing disconnection between how the icc is seen in the west and how it 's perceived in africa , " richard gowan , an africa expert at the european center for foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" it has focused almost entirely on african cases so far , so many africans believe it ’ s being used in a colonial way and western leaders haven ’ t done enough to dispel this negative impression . " anneke van woudenberg , human rights watch 's congo expert , believes that distrust in the icc has its roots in both a political agenda and public confusion in congo . " this is certainly not a sham trial and this is something which has been propagated by lubanga ’ s supporters and those loyal to him in the ituri region , " she told deutsche welle .
" there has been confusion in congo over the narrow nature of the charges .
many don ’ t understand why lubanga has been charged only with the recruitment of child soldiers when he was responsible for the ethnic murders , rape and torture which made the ituri conflict the bloodiest in the congo war .
in addition , the evidence against him is very strong . " others fear that a conviction against lubanga will be held up as a justification for the icc ’ s existence but will result in a slow decline of its pursuit of other war criminals , not only in the drc but all over africa and the world . " i do n't subscribe to these congolese assertions , other than the undeniable fact that many suspected perpetrators of war crimes in the drc remain free and in positions of authority , " andrew philip , a congo expert with amnesty international , told deutsche welle .
" amnesty welcomes the icc investigations and prosecutions , although we have encouraged and continue to encourage the icc prosecutor to extend investigations to other areas of drc than just in the ituri region , and to other crimes within its mandate . " van woudenberg also believes that many more war crimes suspects remain at large but believes that the icc will not be stopping with lubanga . " the icc will not stop with lubanga and besides , he is not alone in standing trial , " she said . " there are three other individuals charged alongside him .
but what the icc prosecutor has to do is to look past the ituri conflict and the warlords there and go after those who supported and funded lubanga .
this would lead them to the higher echelons of not only the congolese government but also those in uganda and rwanda .
for this to have a wider effect the icc must not stop at the warlord level . " critics claim un deaths accelerated lubanga pursuit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's claimed the death of un troops speeded up the pursuit it has also been alleged that lubanga was only brought to trial after he was implicated in the deaths of un troops in the drc and that otherwise , the international community would have continued to turn what some congolese believe to be a blind eye to atrocities there .
some claim that while six million people have been killed in congo over the last 12 years and a wide range of abuses recorded , it took the death of nine bangladeshi peacekeepers in the northwestern region of ituri to stir the icc into action . " the claim that the deaths of the un soldiers prompted international action is misplaced , " said van woudenberg .

many fear that the process is merely a show trial for the icc . much was made of the arrest of congolese militia leader thomas lubanga dyilo in 2005 on charges of recruiting and using child soldiers in the bloody congolese civil war between 1998 and 2003 .
lubanga was accused of creating an entire infrastructure around child soldiers in the ituri region and commanding forces responsible for massive human rights violations , including ethnic massacres , murder , torture , rape and mutilation in the democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- . his arrest , the first under a warrant issued by the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- , was seen as the first step in an international crackdown on seemingly out-of-control military leaders using human rights abuses as tactics in many of africa 's brutal conflicts .
his trial for war crimes in the hague , which began in january this year , appeared to show that the icc was a judicial force to be reckoned with and that a flood of arrests and convictions would follow . but as the prosecution rested its case in july , leaving lubanga 's counsel to prepare its defense case ahead of its october presentation , increasing criticism of the trial and accusations against the icc gathered pace in the drc . congolese call trial a " neo-colonial project " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the icc is making an example of lubanga many congolese accuse the historic process against lubanga as being a show trial , saying that the icc are trying one individual while many others remain free to commit more human rights abuses in congo .
some have called lubanga ’ s trial a " neo-colonial project " and that the icc is trying to set an example rather than using the case as part of an on-going quest to bring others like lubanga to justice .
they say his is a token arrest . " there 's a growing disconnection between how the icc is seen in the west and how it 's perceived in africa , " richard gowan , an africa expert at the european center for foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" it has focused almost entirely on african cases so far , so many africans believe it ’ s being used in a colonial way and western leaders haven ’ t done enough to dispel this negative impression . " anneke van woudenberg , human rights watch 's congo expert , believes that distrust in the icc has its roots in both a political agenda and public confusion in congo . " this is certainly not a sham trial and this is something which has been propagated by lubanga ’ s supporters and those loyal to him in the ituri region , " she told deutsche welle .
" there has been confusion in congo over the narrow nature of the charges .
many don ’ t understand why lubanga has been charged only with the recruitment of child soldiers when he was responsible for the ethnic murders , rape and torture which made the ituri conflict the bloodiest in the congo war .
in addition , the evidence against him is very strong . " others fear that a conviction against lubanga will be held up as a justification for the icc ’ s existence but will result in a slow decline of its pursuit of other war criminals , not only in the drc but all over africa and the world . " i do n't subscribe to these congolese assertions , other than the undeniable fact that many suspected perpetrators of war crimes in the drc remain free and in positions of authority , " andrew philip , a congo expert with amnesty international , told deutsche welle .
" amnesty welcomes the icc investigations and prosecutions , although we have encouraged and continue to encourage the icc prosecutor to extend investigations to other areas of drc than just in the ituri region , and to other crimes within its mandate . " van woudenberg also believes that many more war crimes suspects remain at large but believes that the icc will not be stopping with lubanga . " the icc will not stop with lubanga and besides , he is not alone in standing trial , " she said . " there are three other individuals charged alongside him .
but what the icc prosecutor has to do is to look past the ituri conflict and the warlords there and go after those who supported and funded lubanga .
this would lead them to the higher echelons of not only the congolese government but also those in uganda and rwanda .
for this to have a wider effect the icc must not stop at the warlord level . " critics claim un deaths accelerated lubanga pursuit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's claimed the death of un troops speeded up the pursuit it has also been alleged that lubanga was only brought to trial after he was implicated in the deaths of un troops in the drc and that otherwise , the international community would have continued to turn what some congolese believe to be a blind eye to atrocities there .
some claim that while six million people have been killed in congo over the last 12 years and a wide range of abuses recorded , it took the death of nine bangladeshi peacekeepers in the northwestern region of ituri to stir the icc into action . " the claim that the deaths of the un soldiers prompted international action is misplaced , " said van woudenberg .
" ituri was the bloodiest region where more people were killed than anywhere else in congo so this was the icc ’ s first focus in its search for war crimes suspects .
because of the violence there , there were a lot of un troops and consequently un troops died there - but it wasn ’ t the only place in congo where they died . " it is also claimed that congo 's natural resources played a part in the international community ’ s hesitation to act .
the drc is rich in natural gas and crude oil reserves , while zinc , uranium and copper deposits are also plentiful . experts say conviction would prove positive for human rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite international efforts , congo still suffers despite these claims , human rights and legal experts believe lubanga 's trial and possible conviction will have a positive effect on the overall battle for human rights and motivate the world to pursue war criminals and bring them to justice at the icc . " in terms of human rights , lubanga ’ s trial is hugely significant , " said van woudenberg . " it is the first case at the icc and a conviction would enhance the icc ’ s efforts .
if he is convicted it will be a first for a suspect involved in the recruitment and use of child soldiers .
his arrest has already has a huge effect , bringing child soldiers to international attention and making african leaders aware that this is actually a crime .
we would like to see more offences added to his charge sheet so any conviction would hopefully have as strong an impact on those areas of abuses .

many fear that the process is merely a show trial for the icc . much was made of the arrest of congolese militia leader thomas lubanga dyilo in 2005 on charges of recruiting and using child soldiers in the bloody congolese civil war between 1998 and 2003 .
lubanga was accused of creating an entire infrastructure around child soldiers in the ituri region and commanding forces responsible for massive human rights violations , including ethnic massacres , murder , torture , rape and mutilation in the democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- . his arrest , the first under a warrant issued by the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- , was seen as the first step in an international crackdown on seemingly out-of-control military leaders using human rights abuses as tactics in many of africa 's brutal conflicts .
his trial for war crimes in the hague , which began in january this year , appeared to show that the icc was a judicial force to be reckoned with and that a flood of arrests and convictions would follow . but as the prosecution rested its case in july , leaving lubanga 's counsel to prepare its defense case ahead of its october presentation , increasing criticism of the trial and accusations against the icc gathered pace in the drc . congolese call trial a " neo-colonial project " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the icc is making an example of lubanga many congolese accuse the historic process against lubanga as being a show trial , saying that the icc are trying one individual while many others remain free to commit more human rights abuses in congo .
some have called lubanga ’ s trial a " neo-colonial project " and that the icc is trying to set an example rather than using the case as part of an on-going quest to bring others like lubanga to justice .
they say his is a token arrest . " there 's a growing disconnection between how the icc is seen in the west and how it 's perceived in africa , " richard gowan , an africa expert at the european center for foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" it has focused almost entirely on african cases so far , so many africans believe it ’ s being used in a colonial way and western leaders haven ’ t done enough to dispel this negative impression . " anneke van woudenberg , human rights watch 's congo expert , believes that distrust in the icc has its roots in both a political agenda and public confusion in congo . " this is certainly not a sham trial and this is something which has been propagated by lubanga ’ s supporters and those loyal to him in the ituri region , " she told deutsche welle .
" there has been confusion in congo over the narrow nature of the charges .
many don ’ t understand why lubanga has been charged only with the recruitment of child soldiers when he was responsible for the ethnic murders , rape and torture which made the ituri conflict the bloodiest in the congo war .
in addition , the evidence against him is very strong . " others fear that a conviction against lubanga will be held up as a justification for the icc ’ s existence but will result in a slow decline of its pursuit of other war criminals , not only in the drc but all over africa and the world . " i do n't subscribe to these congolese assertions , other than the undeniable fact that many suspected perpetrators of war crimes in the drc remain free and in positions of authority , " andrew philip , a congo expert with amnesty international , told deutsche welle .
" amnesty welcomes the icc investigations and prosecutions , although we have encouraged and continue to encourage the icc prosecutor to extend investigations to other areas of drc than just in the ituri region , and to other crimes within its mandate . " van woudenberg also believes that many more war crimes suspects remain at large but believes that the icc will not be stopping with lubanga . " the icc will not stop with lubanga and besides , he is not alone in standing trial , " she said . " there are three other individuals charged alongside him .
but what the icc prosecutor has to do is to look past the ituri conflict and the warlords there and go after those who supported and funded lubanga .
this would lead them to the higher echelons of not only the congolese government but also those in uganda and rwanda .
for this to have a wider effect the icc must not stop at the warlord level . " critics claim un deaths accelerated lubanga pursuit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's claimed the death of un troops speeded up the pursuit it has also been alleged that lubanga was only brought to trial after he was implicated in the deaths of un troops in the drc and that otherwise , the international community would have continued to turn what some congolese believe to be a blind eye to atrocities there .
some claim that while six million people have been killed in congo over the last 12 years and a wide range of abuses recorded , it took the death of nine bangladeshi peacekeepers in the northwestern region of ituri to stir the icc into action . " the claim that the deaths of the un soldiers prompted international action is misplaced , " said van woudenberg .
" ituri was the bloodiest region where more people were killed than anywhere else in congo so this was the icc ’ s first focus in its search for war crimes suspects .
because of the violence there , there were a lot of un troops and consequently un troops died there - but it wasn ’ t the only place in congo where they died . " it is also claimed that congo 's natural resources played a part in the international community ’ s hesitation to act .
the drc is rich in natural gas and crude oil reserves , while zinc , uranium and copper deposits are also plentiful . experts say conviction would prove positive for human rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite international efforts , congo still suffers despite these claims , human rights and legal experts believe lubanga 's trial and possible conviction will have a positive effect on the overall battle for human rights and motivate the world to pursue war criminals and bring them to justice at the icc . " in terms of human rights , lubanga ’ s trial is hugely significant , " said van woudenberg . " it is the first case at the icc and a conviction would enhance the icc ’ s efforts .
if he is convicted it will be a first for a suspect involved in the recruitment and use of child soldiers .
his arrest has already has a huge effect , bringing child soldiers to international attention and making african leaders aware that this is actually a crime .
we would like to see more offences added to his charge sheet so any conviction would hopefully have as strong an impact on those areas of abuses .

the law was meant to come into force at the end of the year . the law was originally part of a wider immigration bill passed by the government in the early days of nicolas sarkozy 's presidency in an attempt to tighten the rules on those seeking entry to france .
its supporters said voluntary dna tests could speed up visa applications and help prove a genuine biological link between children and parents .
the law has come under intense criticism from rights groups and now the country 's immigration minister , eric besson , has said that he is unable to comply with the web of conditions in the heavily-amended text that was finally voted by parliament .
the dna tests were to be carried out at french consulates around the world .
but besson said that so many constraints had been added that he believed the law would n't work in practice .
" the genetic samples should be taken by a doctor .
our consulates are n't equipped for that .
we 'd need to invest a lot of resources for a very marginal interest , " he added .
critics claim test unfair to africans when the law was introduced , it was claimed that dna tests could help in cases where there was doubt over whether birth certificates were valid .
but opposition politicians and human rights organizations protested that it stigmatized african immigrants in particular because many africans live in extended families where children are often adopted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics claim the law is especially unfair on people from sub-saharan africa critics , like dominique sopo , head of sos racism in france , have welcomed the immigration minister 's move to shelve the plan .
sopo said this was good news because " these tests were ethically indefensible . "
under the law , tests would be voluntary ; families in theory could seek a dna test to prove a link between an immigrant in france and their relatives abroad .
it was watered down to exclude people from morocco , algeria and tunisia - which reinforced a feeling that sub-saharan africans were being stigmatized .
prime minister promises to work on a solution initially the measure was strongly supported by those who argued that the rules on immigration needed tightening .
however , there are now signs of disagreement within the government 's camp .
according to afp , the leader of the right-wing ump party in the national assembly , jean-francis cope , warned that the executive had an obligation to sign the law into application .
prime minister francois fillon has tried to defuse the disagreement , defending the law in principle .
he said parliament would re-examine the law to try to find a solution .
the initial law was championed by then immigration minister brice hortefeux , who is currently fighting off accusations of racism after he was recorded on video making what appear to be anti-arab comments .

overall eu gdp for the year was expected to shrink by 4 percent , which is in line with previous estimates .
eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said a sharp upturn in the global economy meant " the drop is behind us " but added that it was based mainly on stimulus measures that " would not be there forever . "
in addition , almunia warned that " unemployment levels will continue to go up and employment levels will continue to decrease , since the negative impact on the labor market has a lag of two or three quarters . "
his comments came as the latest eu figures were released , showing that the number of people unemployed in the bloc had decreased by 0.6 percent , or 1.44 million , in the second quarter when compared to the first .
call for training schemes to help unemployed the commissioner said governments should provide training schemes and promote " active labor market policies " designed to ensure that the unemployed can find a job once the economy fully recovers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the economic growth , lines at unemployment offices are expected to get longer eu governments have pumped billions of euros into their economies to mitigate the impact of the bloc 's worst recession in decades .
according to almunia , additional discretionary spending will have totalled 2.5 per cent of the eu 's gdp over the 2009-10 period .
if " automatic stabilizers " such as unemployment benefit payments are also taken into account , the size of the eu 's stimulus package will have amounted to 5.5 per cent of gdp by next year .
but with this additional spending leading to ballooning budget deficits across the eu , almunia once again urged governments to start thinking about how to rein in public spending .
" we need to define a clear , credible and coordinated ' exit strategy ' to put public finances progressively back on a sustainable path and to find the necessary resources to increase europe 's growth and jobs potential , " almunia said .
the governments of ireland and spain are among those that have already announced tax hikes in order to reduce public debt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro continues to be strong against the us dollar too early for real optimism almunia insisted that monday 's figures should be treated with " a mix of optimism and prudence , " noting that the speed of the recovery would depend on a number of factors , including the fragility of the financial sector and the impact of weak labor markets .
monday 's interim forecasts were based on the outlook for germany , spain , france , italy , the netherlands , poland and britain , which together account for 80 per cent of the eu economy .
of these , only spain was expected to remain in recession until at least 2010 .
germany is expected to lead the recovery with the greatest third-quarter gain , with italy showing " gradual improvement " and britain making a " return to positive territory before the year 's end , " almunia added. mrm / dpa / reuters / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

overall eu gdp for the year was expected to shrink by 4 percent , which is in line with previous estimates .
eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said a sharp upturn in the global economy meant " the drop is behind us " but added that it was based mainly on stimulus measures that " would not be there forever . "
in addition , almunia warned that " unemployment levels will continue to go up and employment levels will continue to decrease , since the negative impact on the labor market has a lag of two or three quarters . "
his comments came as the latest eu figures were released , showing that the number of people unemployed in the bloc had decreased by 0.6 percent , or 1.44 million , in the second quarter when compared to the first .
call for training schemes to help unemployed the commissioner said governments should provide training schemes and promote " active labor market policies " designed to ensure that the unemployed can find a job once the economy fully recovers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the economic growth , lines at unemployment offices are expected to get longer eu governments have pumped billions of euros into their economies to mitigate the impact of the bloc 's worst recession in decades .
according to almunia , additional discretionary spending will have totalled 2.5 per cent of the eu 's gdp over the 2009-10 period .
if " automatic stabilizers " such as unemployment benefit payments are also taken into account , the size of the eu 's stimulus package will have amounted to 5.5 per cent of gdp by next year .
but with this additional spending leading to ballooning budget deficits across the eu , almunia once again urged governments to start thinking about how to rein in public spending .
" we need to define a clear , credible and coordinated ' exit strategy ' to put public finances progressively back on a sustainable path and to find the necessary resources to increase europe 's growth and jobs potential , " almunia said .
the governments of ireland and spain are among those that have already announced tax hikes in order to reduce public debt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro continues to be strong against the us dollar too early for real optimism almunia insisted that monday 's figures should be treated with " a mix of optimism and prudence , " noting that the speed of the recovery would depend on a number of factors , including the fragility of the financial sector and the impact of weak labor markets .
monday 's interim forecasts were based on the outlook for germany , spain , france , italy , the netherlands , poland and britain , which together account for 80 per cent of the eu economy .
of these , only spain was expected to remain in recession until at least 2010 .
germany is expected to lead the recovery with the greatest third-quarter gain , with italy showing " gradual improvement " and britain making a " return to positive territory before the year 's end , " almunia added. mrm / dpa / reuters / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 14.09.2009 eu economies could rebound , but unemployment worsens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the report , employment levels will continue to go down european union economies are expected to grow into the fourth quarter , but the recovery will be slow and officials in brussels have warned governments to brace themselves for more job losses . according to the european commission 's latest estimates , gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in the 27-nation bloc is expected to grow by 0.2 percent in the third quarter and 0.1 percent in the fourth after contracting sharply in the first half of the year .
overall eu gdp for the year was expected to shrink by 4 percent , which is in line with previous estimates .
eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said a sharp upturn in the global economy meant " the drop is behind us " but added that it was based mainly on stimulus measures that " would not be there forever . "
in addition , almunia warned that " unemployment levels will continue to go up and employment levels will continue to decrease , since the negative impact on the labor market has a lag of two or three quarters . "
his comments came as the latest eu figures were released , showing that the number of people unemployed in the bloc had decreased by 0.6 percent , or 1.44 million , in the second quarter when compared to the first .
call for training schemes to help unemployed the commissioner said governments should provide training schemes and promote " active labor market policies " designed to ensure that the unemployed can find a job once the economy fully recovers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the economic growth , lines at unemployment offices are expected to get longer eu governments have pumped billions of euros into their economies to mitigate the impact of the bloc 's worst recession in decades .
according to almunia , additional discretionary spending will have totalled 2.5 per cent of the eu 's gdp over the 2009-10 period .
if " automatic stabilizers " such as unemployment benefit payments are also taken into account , the size of the eu 's stimulus package will have amounted to 5.5 per cent of gdp by next year .
but with this additional spending leading to ballooning budget deficits across the eu , almunia once again urged governments to start thinking about how to rein in public spending .
" we need to define a clear , credible and coordinated ' exit strategy ' to put public finances progressively back on a sustainable path and to find the necessary resources to increase europe 's growth and jobs potential , " almunia said .
the governments of ireland and spain are among those that have already announced tax hikes in order to reduce public debt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro continues to be strong against the us dollar too early for real optimism almunia insisted that monday 's figures should be treated with " a mix of optimism and prudence , " noting that the speed of the recovery would depend on a number of factors , including the fragility of the financial sector and the impact of weak labor markets .
monday 's interim forecasts were based on the outlook for germany , spain , france , italy , the netherlands , poland and britain , which together account for 80 per cent of the eu economy .
of these , only spain was expected to remain in recession until at least 2010 .
germany is expected to lead the recovery with the greatest third-quarter gain , with italy showing " gradual improvement " and britain making a " return to positive territory before the year 's end , " almunia added. mrm / dpa / reuters / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the law was meant to come into force at the end of the year . the law was originally part of a wider immigration bill passed by the government in the early days of nicolas sarkozy 's presidency in an attempt to tighten the rules on those seeking entry to france .
its supporters said voluntary dna tests could speed up visa applications and help prove a genuine biological link between children and parents .
the law has come under intense criticism from rights groups and now the country 's immigration minister , eric besson , has said that he is unable to comply with the web of conditions in the heavily-amended text that was finally voted by parliament .
the dna tests were to be carried out at french consulates around the world .
but besson said that so many constraints had been added that he believed the law would n't work in practice .
" the genetic samples should be taken by a doctor .
our consulates are n't equipped for that .
we 'd need to invest a lot of resources for a very marginal interest , " he added .
critics claim test unfair to africans when the law was introduced , it was claimed that dna tests could help in cases where there was doubt over whether birth certificates were valid .
but opposition politicians and human rights organizations protested that it stigmatized african immigrants in particular because many africans live in extended families where children are often adopted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics claim the law is especially unfair on people from sub-saharan africa critics , like dominique sopo , head of sos racism in france , have welcomed the immigration minister 's move to shelve the plan .
sopo said this was good news because " these tests were ethically indefensible . "
under the law , tests would be voluntary ; families in theory could seek a dna test to prove a link between an immigrant in france and their relatives abroad .
it was watered down to exclude people from morocco , algeria and tunisia - which reinforced a feeling that sub-saharan africans were being stigmatized .
prime minister promises to work on a solution initially the measure was strongly supported by those who argued that the rules on immigration needed tightening .
however , there are now signs of disagreement within the government 's camp .
according to afp , the leader of the right-wing ump party in the national assembly , jean-francis cope , warned that the executive had an obligation to sign the law into application .
prime minister francois fillon has tried to defuse the disagreement , defending the law in principle .
he said parliament would re-examine the law to try to find a solution .
the initial law was championed by then immigration minister brice hortefeux , who is currently fighting off accusations of racism after he was recorded on video making what appear to be anti-arab comments .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 14.09.2009 no clear victor in german tv debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 14 million people watched the debate two weeks before the german election , chancellor angela merkel and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier went head to head on sunday in a highly anticipated tv debate . with 40 percent of the german electorate still undecided , the two main candidates in the national election had everything to play for .
twenty million people watched the tv debate , hoping to see a clear winner emerge after 90 minutes .
but there was no real heated political debate from the two partners in germany 's four-year-old grand coalition .
two snap polls held after the debates came to very different conclusions .
a poll by german broadcaster zdf showed 31 percent for spd challenger steinmeier as the winner of the tv duel compared to 28 percent for merkel .
a poll conducted by forsa poll had merkel in front with 37 percent , against 35 percent for steinmeier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fireworks were missing in the chancellor debate but asked which candidate was best qualified to run the country , 58 percent chose merkel compared to 28 percent for steinmeier , a poll by broadcaster rtl showed .
dressed in dark business suits , both candidates emphasized what they had achieved in the last four years in a coalition government .
for steinmeier the stakes were higher .
the spd challenger had to score points to make up for a poor showing in the polls .
" we have achieved a lot .
quite a bit of it since the crisis and we may only have done so because there was a grand coalition , " he said .
" but we have n't managed everything , we fell short of what we could do in a number of areas because the cdu did n't go along with it .
for example on minimum wages and limiting executive pay .
that would have helped people . "
merkel agreed that they had " worked well together " but said that to turn around the economy after the financial crisis she would prefer the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- as her junior coalition partner .
" i think we could make more progress on jobs which is why i 'm appealing for a new government , " she said .
" the past has been good and you wo n't change my mind about the fact that we have got a lot done .
but i think for a democracy it 's good when grand coalitions do n't become normality . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : duel or duet ?
german foreign minister and vice chancellor steinmeier spoke of a change in political direction , emphasizing that voters had a clear alternative to a future coalition between the christian democrats and free democrats .
merkel and steinmeier both tried to claim credit for the rescue of car maker opel after canadian-austrian parts maker magna agreed last week to take over the troubled general motors ' subsidiary .
most political observers agreed that the more " presidential " chancellor merkel showed her crisis management credentials while steinmeier scored points on social equality .
much of the 90-minute debate focused on ways out of the economic crisis with merkel arguing in favor of tax cuts to stimulate demand .
merkel and steinmeier also discussed managers ' salary and bonus payments , minimum wages and nuclear energy .
the candidates voiced broad agreement on germany 's military presence in afghanistan , arguing against a premature withdrawal of troops. nrt / dpa / afp / reuters editor : john kluempers send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they fear german jobs might be saved at their expense .
now brussels is probing the deal . britain and belgium on monday urged the european commission to ensure the takeover of carmaker opel did not favor german workers because of 4.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.55 billion -rrb- in promised aid from berlin .
both countries are suspicious of the deal with canadian automotive supplier magna and its russian allies , under which all four german plants will stay open while opel 's belgian plant and one of two vauxhall sites in britain could close .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one vauxhall plant in britain may have to close " i think it is important to say that the -lrb- european -rrb- commission should not accept anything that looks like a political fix or any linkage between aid and retention of jobs in any specific plant or country , " british business secretary peter mandelson told the bbc .
the eu commission denied media reports alleging it had information that could potentially derail german state support for opel .
german weekly der spiegel had reported that the commission was in possession of documents showing that the opel plant in the belgian city of antwerp – which is threatened with closure – operates at greater efficiency than the facility in bochum , germany , which opel 's new owner magna has promised to keep .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 14.09.2009 no clear victor in german tv debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 14 million people watched the debate two weeks before the german election , chancellor angela merkel and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier went head to head on sunday in a highly anticipated tv debate . with 40 percent of the german electorate still undecided , the two main candidates in the national election had everything to play for .
twenty million people watched the tv debate , hoping to see a clear winner emerge after 90 minutes .
but there was no real heated political debate from the two partners in germany 's four-year-old grand coalition .
two snap polls held after the debates came to very different conclusions .
a poll by german broadcaster zdf showed 31 percent for spd challenger steinmeier as the winner of the tv duel compared to 28 percent for merkel .
a poll conducted by forsa poll had merkel in front with 37 percent , against 35 percent for steinmeier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fireworks were missing in the chancellor debate but asked which candidate was best qualified to run the country , 58 percent chose merkel compared to 28 percent for steinmeier , a poll by broadcaster rtl showed .
dressed in dark business suits , both candidates emphasized what they had achieved in the last four years in a coalition government .
for steinmeier the stakes were higher .
the spd challenger had to score points to make up for a poor showing in the polls .
" we have achieved a lot .
quite a bit of it since the crisis and we may only have done so because there was a grand coalition , " he said .
" but we have n't managed everything , we fell short of what we could do in a number of areas because the cdu did n't go along with it .
for example on minimum wages and limiting executive pay .
that would have helped people . "
merkel agreed that they had " worked well together " but said that to turn around the economy after the financial crisis she would prefer the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- as her junior coalition partner .
" i think we could make more progress on jobs which is why i 'm appealing for a new government , " she said .

twenty million people watched the tv debate , hoping to see a clear winner emerge after 90 minutes .
but there was no real heated political debate from the two partners in germany 's four-year-old grand coalition .
two snap polls held after the debates came to very different conclusions .
a poll by german broadcaster zdf showed 31 percent for spd challenger steinmeier as the winner of the tv duel compared to 28 percent for merkel .
a poll conducted by forsa poll had merkel in front with 37 percent , against 35 percent for steinmeier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fireworks were missing in the chancellor debate but asked which candidate was best qualified to run the country , 58 percent chose merkel compared to 28 percent for steinmeier , a poll by broadcaster rtl showed .
dressed in dark business suits , both candidates emphasized what they had achieved in the last four years in a coalition government .
for steinmeier the stakes were higher .
the spd challenger had to score points to make up for a poor showing in the polls .
" we have achieved a lot .
quite a bit of it since the crisis and we may only have done so because there was a grand coalition , " he said .
" but we have n't managed everything , we fell short of what we could do in a number of areas because the cdu did n't go along with it .
for example on minimum wages and limiting executive pay .
that would have helped people . "
merkel agreed that they had " worked well together " but said that to turn around the economy after the financial crisis she would prefer the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- as her junior coalition partner .
" i think we could make more progress on jobs which is why i 'm appealing for a new government , " she said .
" the past has been good and you wo n't change my mind about the fact that we have got a lot done .

they fear german jobs might be saved at their expense .
now brussels is probing the deal . britain and belgium on monday urged the european commission to ensure the takeover of carmaker opel did not favor german workers because of 4.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.55 billion -rrb- in promised aid from berlin .
both countries are suspicious of the deal with canadian automotive supplier magna and its russian allies , under which all four german plants will stay open while opel 's belgian plant and one of two vauxhall sites in britain could close .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one vauxhall plant in britain may have to close " i think it is important to say that the -lrb- european -rrb- commission should not accept anything that looks like a political fix or any linkage between aid and retention of jobs in any specific plant or country , " british business secretary peter mandelson told the bbc .
the eu commission denied media reports alleging it had information that could potentially derail german state support for opel .
german weekly der spiegel had reported that the commission was in possession of documents showing that the opel plant in the belgian city of antwerp – which is threatened with closure – operates at greater efficiency than the facility in bochum , germany , which opel 's new owner magna has promised to keep .
eu law prohibits state guarantees for such a decision which – if true – would amount to economic nonsense .
belgium demands special probe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commissioner verheugen held talks with flanders ' chief minister in belgium , anger is mounting at the german decision and the flemish government has taken its argument to brussels .
kris peeters , first minister of flanders said he wants the eu 's executive commission to investigate whether german aid is in conflict with eu anti-competitive practices .
he held talks with eu industry commissioner guenter verheugen on the issue on monday .
peeters said he and verheugen agreed that commercial and economic , not political , factors were paramount in deciding which plants should survive .
" we are convinced antwerp has a fair chance .
antwerp has a better chance than certain german plants , " he told reporters , adding flanders would consider filing a complaint with the commission .
eu scrutiny adds uncertainty to magna-deal the german government said it does not anticipate problems in connection with state aid being extended to opel .
a government spokesman said the support package is in line with existing eu guidelines and does not need to be presented to brussels for special scrutiny .
but the eu commission takes a different view and has announced it will examine closely the conditions attached to german support for the carmaker .
eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said that the rules of the european market do not tolerate protectionism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : september 10 : gm managers announced what now appears to have been little more than a declaration of intent however , the required documentation is not expected to arrive from berlin before the german general election at the end of september .
the magna deal , therefore , faces the prospect of a potential veto from brussels for another few weeks .
this adds further uncertainty to the whole project , which at present consists of little more than a declaration of intent by general motors and magna .
gm in particular warned that " key issues " still need to be dealt with during the negotiations on the way to a final agreement over the sale of opel .
germany hosts opel meeting given these challenges , the german government is trying to move swiftly and has announced a meeting will be held on tuesday in berlin , at which european states with opel factories are invited to discuss and agree on the disbursement of state funds for restructuring measures .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 14.09.2009 france delays dna test for immigrants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the law would have come into force on december 31 the french government is to rethink a controversial law authorizing dna tests for the families of immigrants seeking to join their relatives in france .
the law was meant to come into force at the end of the year . the law was originally part of a wider immigration bill passed by the government in the early days of nicolas sarkozy 's presidency in an attempt to tighten the rules on those seeking entry to france .
its supporters said voluntary dna tests could speed up visa applications and help prove a genuine biological link between children and parents .
the law has come under intense criticism from rights groups and now the country 's immigration minister , eric besson , has said that he is unable to comply with the web of conditions in the heavily-amended text that was finally voted by parliament .
the dna tests were to be carried out at french consulates around the world .
but besson said that so many constraints had been added that he believed the law would n't work in practice .
" the genetic samples should be taken by a doctor .
our consulates are n't equipped for that .
we 'd need to invest a lot of resources for a very marginal interest , " he added .
critics claim test unfair to africans when the law was introduced , it was claimed that dna tests could help in cases where there was doubt over whether birth certificates were valid .
but opposition politicians and human rights organizations protested that it stigmatized african immigrants in particular because many africans live in extended families where children are often adopted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics claim the law is especially unfair on people from sub-saharan africa critics , like dominique sopo , head of sos racism in france , have welcomed the immigration minister 's move to shelve the plan .
sopo said this was good news because " these tests were ethically indefensible . "
under the law , tests would be voluntary ; families in theory could seek a dna test to prove a link between an immigrant in france and their relatives abroad .
it was watered down to exclude people from morocco , algeria and tunisia - which reinforced a feeling that sub-saharan africans were being stigmatized .
prime minister promises to work on a solution initially the measure was strongly supported by those who argued that the rules on immigration needed tightening .
however , there are now signs of disagreement within the government 's camp .
according to afp , the leader of the right-wing ump party in the national assembly , jean-francis cope , warned that the executive had an obligation to sign the law into application .
prime minister francois fillon has tried to defuse the disagreement , defending the law in principle .
he said parliament would re-examine the law to try to find a solution .
the initial law was championed by then immigration minister brice hortefeux , who is currently fighting off accusations of racism after he was recorded on video making what appear to be anti-arab comments .

its supporters said voluntary dna tests could speed up visa applications and help prove a genuine biological link between children and parents .
the law has come under intense criticism from rights groups and now the country 's immigration minister , eric besson , has said that he is unable to comply with the web of conditions in the heavily-amended text that was finally voted by parliament .
the dna tests were to be carried out at french consulates around the world .
but besson said that so many constraints had been added that he believed the law would n't work in practice .
" the genetic samples should be taken by a doctor .
our consulates are n't equipped for that .
we 'd need to invest a lot of resources for a very marginal interest , " he added .
critics claim test unfair to africans when the law was introduced , it was claimed that dna tests could help in cases where there was doubt over whether birth certificates were valid .
but opposition politicians and human rights organizations protested that it stigmatized african immigrants in particular because many africans live in extended families where children are often adopted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics claim the law is especially unfair on people from sub-saharan africa critics , like dominique sopo , head of sos racism in france , have welcomed the immigration minister 's move to shelve the plan .
sopo said this was good news because " these tests were ethically indefensible . "
under the law , tests would be voluntary ; families in theory could seek a dna test to prove a link between an immigrant in france and their relatives abroad .
it was watered down to exclude people from morocco , algeria and tunisia - which reinforced a feeling that sub-saharan africans were being stigmatized .
prime minister promises to work on a solution initially the measure was strongly supported by those who argued that the rules on immigration needed tightening .
however , there are now signs of disagreement within the government 's camp .
according to afp , the leader of the right-wing ump party in the national assembly , jean-francis cope , warned that the executive had an obligation to sign the law into application .
prime minister francois fillon has tried to defuse the disagreement , defending the law in principle .
he said parliament would re-examine the law to try to find a solution .
the initial law was championed by then immigration minister brice hortefeux , who is currently fighting off accusations of racism after he was recorded on video making what appear to be anti-arab comments .

" this would bring us closer to our goal of producing 25,000 megawatts offshore by 2030 , " tiefensee told the daily hamburger abendblatt . he added that the ministry had approved some of the 2,500 applications received by his office for wind turbines in the north and baltic seas .

together they would produce more than 12,000 megawatts of energy , which could supply power to 12 million households , the transport ministry said . " this would bring us closer to our goal of producing 25,000 megawatts offshore by 2030 , " tiefensee told the daily hamburger abendblatt . he added that the ministry had approved some of the 2,500 applications received by his office for wind turbines in the north and baltic seas .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 14.09.2009 opel deal faces fresh challenge großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the writing 's on the wall : the eu 's competition commissioner is gearing up to investigate the opel takeover by magna two fellow eu members are taking germany to task for extending state aid to the new owner of carmaker opel .
they fear german jobs might be saved at their expense .
now brussels is probing the deal . britain and belgium on monday urged the european commission to ensure the takeover of carmaker opel did not favor german workers because of 4.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.55 billion -rrb- in promised aid from berlin .
both countries are suspicious of the deal with canadian automotive supplier magna and its russian allies , under which all four german plants will stay open while opel 's belgian plant and one of two vauxhall sites in britain could close .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one vauxhall plant in britain may have to close " i think it is important to say that the -lrb- european -rrb- commission should not accept anything that looks like a political fix or any linkage between aid and retention of jobs in any specific plant or country , " british business secretary peter mandelson told the bbc .
the eu commission denied media reports alleging it had information that could potentially derail german state support for opel .
german weekly der spiegel had reported that the commission was in possession of documents showing that the opel plant in the belgian city of antwerp – which is threatened with closure – operates at greater efficiency than the facility in bochum , germany , which opel 's new owner magna has promised to keep .
eu law prohibits state guarantees for such a decision which – if true – would amount to economic nonsense .
belgium demands special probe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commissioner verheugen held talks with flanders ' chief minister in belgium , anger is mounting at the german decision and the flemish government has taken its argument to brussels .
kris peeters , first minister of flanders said he wants the eu 's executive commission to investigate whether german aid is in conflict with eu anti-competitive practices .
he held talks with eu industry commissioner guenter verheugen on the issue on monday .
peeters said he and verheugen agreed that commercial and economic , not political , factors were paramount in deciding which plants should survive .
" we are convinced antwerp has a fair chance .
antwerp has a better chance than certain german plants , " he told reporters , adding flanders would consider filing a complaint with the commission .
eu scrutiny adds uncertainty to magna-deal the german government said it does not anticipate problems in connection with state aid being extended to opel .
a government spokesman said the support package is in line with existing eu guidelines and does not need to be presented to brussels for special scrutiny .
but the eu commission takes a different view and has announced it will examine closely the conditions attached to german support for the carmaker .
eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said that the rules of the european market do not tolerate protectionism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : september 10 : gm managers announced what now appears to have been little more than a declaration of intent however , the required documentation is not expected to arrive from berlin before the german general election at the end of september .
the magna deal , therefore , faces the prospect of a potential veto from brussels for another few weeks .
this adds further uncertainty to the whole project , which at present consists of little more than a declaration of intent by general motors and magna .
gm in particular warned that " key issues " still need to be dealt with during the negotiations on the way to a final agreement over the sale of opel .
germany hosts opel meeting given these challenges , the german government is trying to move swiftly and has announced a meeting will be held on tuesday in berlin , at which european states with opel factories are invited to discuss and agree on the disbursement of state funds for restructuring measures .
but agreement , it seems , does not even exist over who is invited .
belgian foreign minister yves leterme complained on monday that his country had received no invitation .
the german government 's spokesman denied this. rri / reuters / dpa / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it could n't have been a duel anyway , " wrote die welt daily . " for one thing , the need for ideological debate seems to be exhausted in this country .
and for another , the two politicians could not hit out at one another because it is not their style .
another reason is that they have worked together for four years in a coalition government they managed in harmony .
they agree on many issues , so they could not have credibly portrayed being at odds with each other .
the debate ended with a balanced 1:1 . "
" and why should the politicians badmouth the work they have been doing together for the past four years , " asked the sueddeutsche zeitung paper , " they may have to rule together again after -lsb- the -rsb- sept .
27 -lsb- election -rsb- .
the format of a duel is not appropriate to convey political content . "
the berliner zeitung wrote : " steinmeier only managed to attack for a few moments .
he was obviously lacking the necessary brutality and ruthlessness in view of the past four years in a joint government .
voters who wanted to find out what the world would look like with a coalition of christian democrats and free democrats , or under the leadership of the social democrats , did not learn a thing in the debate . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two are anxious to set themselves apart mass-circulation daily bild had the following assessment : " after a 90-minute ' duel , ' we are none the wiser .
this was not an exciting duel ; it was shop talk between the chancellor and her deputy . and this discussion was a signal : neither merkel nor steinmeier would mind continuing the grand coalition . "
" it seems as if merkel and steinmeier have forged a quiet alliance for the last weeks of the election campaign , even as their coalition government grows increasingly less popular among voters , " wrote the nordsee-zeitung from the country 's north .
" expectations for the debate were not high in the first place ; there was no real verbal sparring , there were no new facts : somehow , they do appear to still like each other . "
bonn 's general-anzeiger summed it up : " the two get along well , and that was evident last night . " db / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 14.09.2009 a year after lehman collapse , bankers rebuild their bubble großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehman is gone but bankers are back in business banks are raking in profits again , thanks partly to state bailouts , but remain hesitant about extending credit .
now governments have prominent roles in the financial sector and are under pressure to change the rules . the casino is back in business , trading and speculating on the financial markets are on their way to reach pre-crisis levels .
banks are again posting profits and managers are again looking forward to big bonuses .
a year after us investment bank lehman brothers filed for bankruptcy , not much has changed - at least not in the sector that triggered the global financial crisis . new data suggest that after passing the crisis on to the economy beyond the walls of wall street , the financial markets have yet again managed to close the shutters to the real world . the bank for international settlements , the world 's biggest central bank body , reported sunday that interbank money markets are recovering to levels not seen since early 2008 .
the bank said that shows financial institutions are once again dealing with one another , but that they also remain hesitant to extend credit to businesses . reduced risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's central bank chief axel weber says : " growth not sustainable yet . "
germany 's federal bank chief axel weber , however , said the somewhat brighter general economic outlook is in part due to the government bailout of financial markets , which has contributed to " systemic risk reduction . " " aggressive monetary policy and huge economic stimulus packages " have also helped improve prospects , he said , but added that such measures make it hard to know if growth will be self-sustainable . but while bankers are benefiting from rebounding markets for the moment , the impact of the crisis on global economies and political decisions means that even they will face new realities in the long run .
to prevent markets - and ultimately their economies - from collapsing , national governments have financially propped up or de facto nationalized major banks . leaders of the g-20 group of major nations pledged in april to strengthen financial supervision and establish stricter rules on bonus payments .
when they meet again this month in the united states they are expected to reinforce those measures . economic crisis not over yet politicians have ample reason to remain anxious .
germany is bracing for a new wave of bankruptcies this fall and unemployment figures are also set to rise , just statistics have shown that more businesses and individuals are expected to default on credit payments . experts estimate that german lenders alone could face losing 120 billion euros -lrb- $ 176 billion -rrb- by 2011 as a result .
the situation across the european union does not look much different , even though the european commission on monday announced that the euro zone is emerging from recession . " the eu economy appears to be at a turning point , " an interim forecast said , but it confirmed that the economy of the 16 countries using the euro would contract by 4 percent this year . disaster lurking in balance sheets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imf warns the crisis is not over despite positive signals from europe 's biggest economies , the head of the international monetary fund has warned that the global economic crisis is not over yet . " in the minds of too many - not only regular people but also top politicians - the financial crisis is already behind us , " dominique strauss-kahn told german news weekly der spiegel , adding that more work on financial sector regulation was needed . despite posting massive profits , the economic underpinnings of financial businesses themselves remain fragile a year after the lehman collapse . hypo real estate , nationalized by the german government and injected with 3 billion euros of fresh capital , is continuing to cause problems for german politicians and economic leaders .
the bank is set to receive 7 billion euros more before the year 's end but , according to media reports , another 16 billion euros of losses that have not yet " materialized " are lurking in the bank 's books . those least responsible for crisis are worst affected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prices for commodities from developing nations have slumped while wall street thinks it has recovered and industrialized economies anticipate they will soon follow , the global crisis may continue to affect those least responsible for it . the downturn has hit the african continent especially hard despite it not being involved in its making , civil society organizations gathered in the capital of the democratic republic of the congo heard at the fifth people 's summit of the southern african development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- . commodity prices have all but collapsed , ngos told the gathering .

banks are again posting profits and managers are again looking forward to big bonuses .
a year after us investment bank lehman brothers filed for bankruptcy , not much has changed - at least not in the sector that triggered the global financial crisis . new data suggest that after passing the crisis on to the economy beyond the walls of wall street , the financial markets have yet again managed to close the shutters to the real world . the bank for international settlements , the world 's biggest central bank body , reported sunday that interbank money markets are recovering to levels not seen since early 2008 .

germany 's federal bank chief axel weber , however , said the somewhat brighter general economic outlook is in part due to the government bailout of financial markets , which has contributed to " systemic risk reduction . " " aggressive monetary policy and huge economic stimulus packages " have also helped improve prospects , he said , but added that such measures make it hard to know if growth will be self-sustainable . but while bankers are benefiting from rebounding markets for the moment , the impact of the crisis on global economies and political decisions means that even they will face new realities in the long run .

germany is bracing for a new wave of bankruptcies this fall and unemployment figures are also set to rise , just statistics have shown that more businesses and individuals are expected to default on credit payments . experts estimate that german lenders alone could face losing 120 billion euros -lrb- $ 176 billion -rrb- by 2011 as a result .
the situation across the european union does not look much different , even though the european commission on monday announced that the euro zone is emerging from recession . " the eu economy appears to be at a turning point , " an interim forecast said , but it confirmed that the economy of the 16 countries using the euro would contract by 4 percent this year . disaster lurking in balance sheets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imf warns the crisis is not over despite positive signals from europe 's biggest economies , the head of the international monetary fund has warned that the global economic crisis is not over yet .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 14.09.2009 no clear victor in german tv debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 14 million people watched the debate two weeks before the german election , chancellor angela merkel and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier went head to head on sunday in a highly anticipated tv debate . with 40 percent of the german electorate still undecided , the two main candidates in the national election had everything to play for .
twenty million people watched the tv debate , hoping to see a clear winner emerge after 90 minutes .
but there was no real heated political debate from the two partners in germany 's four-year-old grand coalition .
two snap polls held after the debates came to very different conclusions .
a poll by german broadcaster zdf showed 31 percent for spd challenger steinmeier as the winner of the tv duel compared to 28 percent for merkel .
a poll conducted by forsa poll had merkel in front with 37 percent , against 35 percent for steinmeier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fireworks were missing in the chancellor debate but asked which candidate was best qualified to run the country , 58 percent chose merkel compared to 28 percent for steinmeier , a poll by broadcaster rtl showed .
dressed in dark business suits , both candidates emphasized what they had achieved in the last four years in a coalition government .
for steinmeier the stakes were higher .
the spd challenger had to score points to make up for a poor showing in the polls .
" we have achieved a lot .
quite a bit of it since the crisis and we may only have done so because there was a grand coalition , " he said .
" but we have n't managed everything , we fell short of what we could do in a number of areas because the cdu did n't go along with it .
for example on minimum wages and limiting executive pay .
that would have helped people . "
merkel agreed that they had " worked well together " but said that to turn around the economy after the financial crisis she would prefer the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- as her junior coalition partner .

german foreign minister and vice chancellor steinmeier spoke of a change in political direction , emphasizing that voters had a clear alternative to a future coalition between the christian democrats and free democrats .
merkel and steinmeier both tried to claim credit for the rescue of car maker opel after canadian-austrian parts maker magna agreed last week to take over the troubled general motors ' subsidiary .
most political observers agreed that the more " presidential " chancellor merkel showed her crisis management credentials while steinmeier scored points on social equality .
much of the 90-minute debate focused on ways out of the economic crisis with merkel arguing in favor of tax cuts to stimulate demand .
merkel and steinmeier also discussed managers ' salary and bonus payments , minimum wages and nuclear energy .
the candidates voiced broad agreement on germany 's military presence in afghanistan , arguing against a premature withdrawal of troops. nrt / dpa / afp / reuters editor : john kluempers send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 14.09.2009 eu economies could rebound , but unemployment worsens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the report , employment levels will continue to go down european union economies are expected to grow into the fourth quarter , but the recovery will be slow and officials in brussels have warned governments to brace themselves for more job losses . according to the european commission 's latest estimates , gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in the 27-nation bloc is expected to grow by 0.2 percent in the third quarter and 0.1 percent in the fourth after contracting sharply in the first half of the year .
overall eu gdp for the year was expected to shrink by 4 percent , which is in line with previous estimates .
eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said a sharp upturn in the global economy meant " the drop is behind us " but added that it was based mainly on stimulus measures that " would not be there forever . "
in addition , almunia warned that " unemployment levels will continue to go up and employment levels will continue to decrease , since the negative impact on the labor market has a lag of two or three quarters . "
his comments came as the latest eu figures were released , showing that the number of people unemployed in the bloc had decreased by 0.6 percent , or 1.44 million , in the second quarter when compared to the first .
call for training schemes to help unemployed the commissioner said governments should provide training schemes and promote " active labor market policies " designed to ensure that the unemployed can find a job once the economy fully recovers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the economic growth , lines at unemployment offices are expected to get longer eu governments have pumped billions of euros into their economies to mitigate the impact of the bloc 's worst recession in decades .
according to almunia , additional discretionary spending will have totalled 2.5 per cent of the eu 's gdp over the 2009-10 period .
if " automatic stabilizers " such as unemployment benefit payments are also taken into account , the size of the eu 's stimulus package will have amounted to 5.5 per cent of gdp by next year .
but with this additional spending leading to ballooning budget deficits across the eu , almunia once again urged governments to start thinking about how to rein in public spending .
" we need to define a clear , credible and coordinated ' exit strategy ' to put public finances progressively back on a sustainable path and to find the necessary resources to increase europe 's growth and jobs potential , " almunia said .
the governments of ireland and spain are among those that have already announced tax hikes in order to reduce public debt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro continues to be strong against the us dollar too early for real optimism almunia insisted that monday 's figures should be treated with " a mix of optimism and prudence , " noting that the speed of the recovery would depend on a number of factors , including the fragility of the financial sector and the impact of weak labor markets .
monday 's interim forecasts were based on the outlook for germany , spain , france , italy , the netherlands , poland and britain , which together account for 80 per cent of the eu economy .
of these , only spain was expected to remain in recession until at least 2010 .
germany is expected to lead the recovery with the greatest third-quarter gain , with italy showing " gradual improvement " and britain making a " return to positive territory before the year 's end , " almunia added. mrm / dpa / reuters / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they fear german jobs might be saved at their expense .
now brussels is probing the deal . britain and belgium on monday urged the european commission to ensure the takeover of carmaker opel did not favor german workers because of 4.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.55 billion -rrb- in promised aid from berlin .
both countries are suspicious of the deal with canadian automotive supplier magna and its russian allies , under which all four german plants will stay open while opel 's belgian plant and one of two vauxhall sites in britain could close .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one vauxhall plant in britain may have to close " i think it is important to say that the -lrb- european -rrb- commission should not accept anything that looks like a political fix or any linkage between aid and retention of jobs in any specific plant or country , " british business secretary peter mandelson told the bbc .
the eu commission denied media reports alleging it had information that could potentially derail german state support for opel .
german weekly der spiegel had reported that the commission was in possession of documents showing that the opel plant in the belgian city of antwerp – which is threatened with closure – operates at greater efficiency than the facility in bochum , germany , which opel 's new owner magna has promised to keep .
eu law prohibits state guarantees for such a decision which – if true – would amount to economic nonsense .
belgium demands special probe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commissioner verheugen held talks with flanders ' chief minister in belgium , anger is mounting at the german decision and the flemish government has taken its argument to brussels .
kris peeters , first minister of flanders said he wants the eu 's executive commission to investigate whether german aid is in conflict with eu anti-competitive practices .
he held talks with eu industry commissioner guenter verheugen on the issue on monday .
peeters said he and verheugen agreed that commercial and economic , not political , factors were paramount in deciding which plants should survive .
" we are convinced antwerp has a fair chance .
antwerp has a better chance than certain german plants , " he told reporters , adding flanders would consider filing a complaint with the commission .
eu scrutiny adds uncertainty to magna-deal the german government said it does not anticipate problems in connection with state aid being extended to opel .
a government spokesman said the support package is in line with existing eu guidelines and does not need to be presented to brussels for special scrutiny .
but the eu commission takes a different view and has announced it will examine closely the conditions attached to german support for the carmaker .
eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said that the rules of the european market do not tolerate protectionism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : september 10 : gm managers announced what now appears to have been little more than a declaration of intent however , the required documentation is not expected to arrive from berlin before the german general election at the end of september .
the magna deal , therefore , faces the prospect of a potential veto from brussels for another few weeks .
this adds further uncertainty to the whole project , which at present consists of little more than a declaration of intent by general motors and magna .
gm in particular warned that " key issues " still need to be dealt with during the negotiations on the way to a final agreement over the sale of opel .
germany hosts opel meeting given these challenges , the german government is trying to move swiftly and has announced a meeting will be held on tuesday in berlin , at which european states with opel factories are invited to discuss and agree on the disbursement of state funds for restructuring measures .
but agreement , it seems , does not even exist over who is invited .
belgian foreign minister yves leterme complained on monday that his country had received no invitation .
the german government 's spokesman denied this. rri / reuters / dpa / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de opel deal sparks concerns about job losses across europe general motors has vowed that opel factories in germany will remain secure after its decision to sell the carmaker to supplier magna .

-lrb- 11.09.2009 -rrb- opel deal leaves many unanswered questions gm 's announcement to sell its european subsidiary opel to a russian-backed canadian firm was initially greeted optimistically in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 14.09.2009 opel deal faces fresh challenge großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the writing 's on the wall : the eu 's competition commissioner is gearing up to investigate the opel takeover by magna two fellow eu members are taking germany to task for extending state aid to the new owner of carmaker opel .
they fear german jobs might be saved at their expense .
now brussels is probing the deal . britain and belgium on monday urged the european commission to ensure the takeover of carmaker opel did not favor german workers because of 4.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.55 billion -rrb- in promised aid from berlin .
both countries are suspicious of the deal with canadian automotive supplier magna and its russian allies , under which all four german plants will stay open while opel 's belgian plant and one of two vauxhall sites in britain could close .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one vauxhall plant in britain may have to close " i think it is important to say that the -lrb- european -rrb- commission should not accept anything that looks like a political fix or any linkage between aid and retention of jobs in any specific plant or country , " british business secretary peter mandelson told the bbc .
the eu commission denied media reports alleging it had information that could potentially derail german state support for opel .
german weekly der spiegel had reported that the commission was in possession of documents showing that the opel plant in the belgian city of antwerp – which is threatened with closure – operates at greater efficiency than the facility in bochum , germany , which opel 's new owner magna has promised to keep .
eu law prohibits state guarantees for such a decision which – if true – would amount to economic nonsense .
belgium demands special probe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commissioner verheugen held talks with flanders ' chief minister in belgium , anger is mounting at the german decision and the flemish government has taken its argument to brussels .
kris peeters , first minister of flanders said he wants the eu 's executive commission to investigate whether german aid is in conflict with eu anti-competitive practices .
he held talks with eu industry commissioner guenter verheugen on the issue on monday .
peeters said he and verheugen agreed that commercial and economic , not political , factors were paramount in deciding which plants should survive .
" we are convinced antwerp has a fair chance .
antwerp has a better chance than certain german plants , " he told reporters , adding flanders would consider filing a complaint with the commission .
eu scrutiny adds uncertainty to magna-deal the german government said it does not anticipate problems in connection with state aid being extended to opel .

they fear german jobs might be saved at their expense .
now brussels is probing the deal . britain and belgium on monday urged the european commission to ensure the takeover of carmaker opel did not favor german workers because of 4.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.55 billion -rrb- in promised aid from berlin .
both countries are suspicious of the deal with canadian automotive supplier magna and its russian allies , under which all four german plants will stay open while opel 's belgian plant and one of two vauxhall sites in britain could close .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one vauxhall plant in britain may have to close " i think it is important to say that the -lrb- european -rrb- commission should not accept anything that looks like a political fix or any linkage between aid and retention of jobs in any specific plant or country , " british business secretary peter mandelson told the bbc .
the eu commission denied media reports alleging it had information that could potentially derail german state support for opel .
german weekly der spiegel had reported that the commission was in possession of documents showing that the opel plant in the belgian city of antwerp – which is threatened with closure – operates at greater efficiency than the facility in bochum , germany , which opel 's new owner magna has promised to keep .

kris peeters , first minister of flanders said he wants the eu 's executive commission to investigate whether german aid is in conflict with eu anti-competitive practices .
he held talks with eu industry commissioner guenter verheugen on the issue on monday .
peeters said he and verheugen agreed that commercial and economic , not political , factors were paramount in deciding which plants should survive .
" we are convinced antwerp has a fair chance .
antwerp has a better chance than certain german plants , " he told reporters , adding flanders would consider filing a complaint with the commission .
eu scrutiny adds uncertainty to magna-deal the german government said it does not anticipate problems in connection with state aid being extended to opel .
a government spokesman said the support package is in line with existing eu guidelines and does not need to be presented to brussels for special scrutiny .
but the eu commission takes a different view and has announced it will examine closely the conditions attached to german support for the carmaker .

the magna deal , therefore , faces the prospect of a potential veto from brussels for another few weeks .
this adds further uncertainty to the whole project , which at present consists of little more than a declaration of intent by general motors and magna .

his accomplices , assad sawar , 29 , and tanvir hussain , 28 , received minimum sentences of 36 and 32 years , respectively . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from left , abdulla ahmed ali , assad sawar , and tanvir hussain addressing ali during sentencing , judge richard henriques said , " i have concluded you are a driven and determined extremist with boundless energy and an ambition to lead a terrorist outrage of boundless proportion .
by this conspiracy you sought the attention of the world , and you now have it . "
the thwarted suicide attack , intercepted by british intelligence services in august 2006 , would have been the " worst atrocity since 9/11 and woiuld have inflicted heavy casualties in the name of islam , " the court in london heard last week . all three men , though born in britain , had close links with pakistan .
four other men were found not guilty of involvement in the plot .
henriques said the defendants had " embraced islamic extremism and it is that burning extremism that has motivated you throughout this conspiracy and is likely to drive you again . "
trial almost did n't happen at a trial a year ago , ali , hussain and sarwar were found guilty of conspiracy to murder involving liquid bombs - but that jury could not decide whether their plans extended to detonating the devices on planes . an appeal by britain 's crown prosecution service -lrb- cps -rrb- led to a retrial , with the jury concluding that such a terror plot did exist , ultimately leading to last monday 's convictions at woolwich crown court in london . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as ringleader of the group , ali was given a minimum sentence of 40 years during the trial , the court was told that ali picked out seven flights to san francisco , toronto , montreal , washington , new york and chicago that departed from london 's heathrow airport within a two-and-a-half hour period .
jets were operated by united airlines , american airlines and air canada .
the prosecution alleged that the attack would have caused " mass murder on an unimaginable scale " and would have " exceeded the carnage " of the september 11 attacks in the us in 2001 . plan foiled thanks to british surveillance reports said the security services , courts and police had spent a total of 35 million pounds -lrb- 39 million euros , $ 57 million -rrb- on foiling the plot and bringing the men to justice .
undercover surveillance officers had watched ali converting a flat in east london into a bomb factory , which was also used to record suicide videos in which the british public was warned to expect " floods of martyr operations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan to blow up the jets led to a worldwide ban on most liquids in hand luggage according to prosecutors at the trial last week , the three men plotted to drill holes in the bottom of plastic drinks bottles , drain the contents and inject liquid explosive with a syringe before sealing the holes with glue .
that way the bottle tops would remain unopened .
the home-made liquid explosive was to be concocted from hydrogen peroxide and tang , a soft drink available in powdered form .
when mixed with such an organic material at an appropriate strength , hydrogen peroxide has explosive qualities .
the bottles would be detonated using the substance htmd , concealed in regular aa 1.5-volt batteries .
the detonator would have been ignited using a metal wire or a small light bulb , the court heard .
the plan to blow up the seven airliners crossing the atlantic to canada and the us led to a worldwide ban on carrying liquids in hand luggage. mrm / dpa / afp / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 14.09.2009 france delays dna test for immigrants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the law would have come into force on december 31 the french government is to rethink a controversial law authorizing dna tests for the families of immigrants seeking to join their relatives in france .
the law was meant to come into force at the end of the year . the law was originally part of a wider immigration bill passed by the government in the early days of nicolas sarkozy 's presidency in an attempt to tighten the rules on those seeking entry to france .
its supporters said voluntary dna tests could speed up visa applications and help prove a genuine biological link between children and parents .
the law has come under intense criticism from rights groups and now the country 's immigration minister , eric besson , has said that he is unable to comply with the web of conditions in the heavily-amended text that was finally voted by parliament .
the dna tests were to be carried out at french consulates around the world .
but besson said that so many constraints had been added that he believed the law would n't work in practice .
" the genetic samples should be taken by a doctor .
our consulates are n't equipped for that .
we 'd need to invest a lot of resources for a very marginal interest , " he added .
critics claim test unfair to africans when the law was introduced , it was claimed that dna tests could help in cases where there was doubt over whether birth certificates were valid .
but opposition politicians and human rights organizations protested that it stigmatized african immigrants in particular because many africans live in extended families where children are often adopted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics claim the law is especially unfair on people from sub-saharan africa critics , like dominique sopo , head of sos racism in france , have welcomed the immigration minister 's move to shelve the plan .
sopo said this was good news because " these tests were ethically indefensible . "
under the law , tests would be voluntary ; families in theory could seek a dna test to prove a link between an immigrant in france and their relatives abroad .
it was watered down to exclude people from morocco , algeria and tunisia - which reinforced a feeling that sub-saharan africans were being stigmatized .
prime minister promises to work on a solution initially the measure was strongly supported by those who argued that the rules on immigration needed tightening .
however , there are now signs of disagreement within the government 's camp .
according to afp , the leader of the right-wing ump party in the national assembly , jean-francis cope , warned that the executive had an obligation to sign the law into application .
prime minister francois fillon has tried to defuse the disagreement , defending the law in principle .
he said parliament would re-examine the law to try to find a solution .
the initial law was championed by then immigration minister brice hortefeux , who is currently fighting off accusations of racism after he was recorded on video making what appear to be anti-arab comments .

overall eu gdp for the year was expected to shrink by 4 percent , which is in line with previous estimates .
eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said a sharp upturn in the global economy meant " the drop is behind us " but added that it was based mainly on stimulus measures that " would not be there forever . "
in addition , almunia warned that " unemployment levels will continue to go up and employment levels will continue to decrease , since the negative impact on the labor market has a lag of two or three quarters . "
his comments came as the latest eu figures were released , showing that the number of people unemployed in the bloc had decreased by 0.6 percent , or 1.44 million , in the second quarter when compared to the first .
call for training schemes to help unemployed the commissioner said governments should provide training schemes and promote " active labor market policies " designed to ensure that the unemployed can find a job once the economy fully recovers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the economic growth , lines at unemployment offices are expected to get longer eu governments have pumped billions of euros into their economies to mitigate the impact of the bloc 's worst recession in decades .
according to almunia , additional discretionary spending will have totalled 2.5 per cent of the eu 's gdp over the 2009-10 period .
if " automatic stabilizers " such as unemployment benefit payments are also taken into account , the size of the eu 's stimulus package will have amounted to 5.5 per cent of gdp by next year .
but with this additional spending leading to ballooning budget deficits across the eu , almunia once again urged governments to start thinking about how to rein in public spending .
" we need to define a clear , credible and coordinated ' exit strategy ' to put public finances progressively back on a sustainable path and to find the necessary resources to increase europe 's growth and jobs potential , " almunia said .
the governments of ireland and spain are among those that have already announced tax hikes in order to reduce public debt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro continues to be strong against the us dollar too early for real optimism almunia insisted that monday 's figures should be treated with " a mix of optimism and prudence , " noting that the speed of the recovery would depend on a number of factors , including the fragility of the financial sector and the impact of weak labor markets .
monday 's interim forecasts were based on the outlook for germany , spain , france , italy , the netherlands , poland and britain , which together account for 80 per cent of the eu economy .
of these , only spain was expected to remain in recession until at least 2010 .
germany is expected to lead the recovery with the greatest third-quarter gain , with italy showing " gradual improvement " and britain making a " return to positive territory before the year 's end , " almunia added. mrm / dpa / reuters / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

overall eu gdp for the year was expected to shrink by 4 percent , which is in line with previous estimates .
eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said a sharp upturn in the global economy meant " the drop is behind us " but added that it was based mainly on stimulus measures that " would not be there forever . "
in addition , almunia warned that " unemployment levels will continue to go up and employment levels will continue to decrease , since the negative impact on the labor market has a lag of two or three quarters . "
his comments came as the latest eu figures were released , showing that the number of people unemployed in the bloc had decreased by 0.6 percent , or 1.44 million , in the second quarter when compared to the first .
call for training schemes to help unemployed the commissioner said governments should provide training schemes and promote " active labor market policies " designed to ensure that the unemployed can find a job once the economy fully recovers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the economic growth , lines at unemployment offices are expected to get longer eu governments have pumped billions of euros into their economies to mitigate the impact of the bloc 's worst recession in decades .
according to almunia , additional discretionary spending will have totalled 2.5 per cent of the eu 's gdp over the 2009-10 period .
if " automatic stabilizers " such as unemployment benefit payments are also taken into account , the size of the eu 's stimulus package will have amounted to 5.5 per cent of gdp by next year .
but with this additional spending leading to ballooning budget deficits across the eu , almunia once again urged governments to start thinking about how to rein in public spending .
" we need to define a clear , credible and coordinated ' exit strategy ' to put public finances progressively back on a sustainable path and to find the necessary resources to increase europe 's growth and jobs potential , " almunia said .
the governments of ireland and spain are among those that have already announced tax hikes in order to reduce public debt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro continues to be strong against the us dollar too early for real optimism almunia insisted that monday 's figures should be treated with " a mix of optimism and prudence , " noting that the speed of the recovery would depend on a number of factors , including the fragility of the financial sector and the impact of weak labor markets .

eu scrutiny adds uncertainty to magna-deal the german government said it does not anticipate problems in connection with state aid being extended to opel .
a government spokesman said the support package is in line with existing eu guidelines and does not need to be presented to brussels for special scrutiny .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : september 10 : gm managers announced what now appears to have been little more than a declaration of intent however , the required documentation is not expected to arrive from berlin before the german general election at the end of september .

this adds further uncertainty to the whole project , which at present consists of little more than a declaration of intent by general motors and magna .
gm in particular warned that " key issues " still need to be dealt with during the negotiations on the way to a final agreement over the sale of opel .
germany hosts opel meeting given these challenges , the german government is trying to move swiftly and has announced a meeting will be held on tuesday in berlin , at which european states with opel factories are invited to discuss and agree on the disbursement of state funds for restructuring measures .
but agreement , it seems , does not even exist over who is invited .

" it could n't have been a duel anyway , " wrote die welt daily . " for one thing , the need for ideological debate seems to be exhausted in this country .
and for another , the two politicians could not hit out at one another because it is not their style .
another reason is that they have worked together for four years in a coalition government they managed in harmony .
they agree on many issues , so they could not have credibly portrayed being at odds with each other .
the debate ended with a balanced 1:1 . "
" and why should the politicians badmouth the work they have been doing together for the past four years , " asked the sueddeutsche zeitung paper , " they may have to rule together again after -lsb- the -rsb- sept .
27 -lsb- election -rsb- .
the format of a duel is not appropriate to convey political content . "
the berliner zeitung wrote : " steinmeier only managed to attack for a few moments .
he was obviously lacking the necessary brutality and ruthlessness in view of the past four years in a joint government .
voters who wanted to find out what the world would look like with a coalition of christian democrats and free democrats , or under the leadership of the social democrats , did not learn a thing in the debate . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two are anxious to set themselves apart mass-circulation daily bild had the following assessment : " after a 90-minute ' duel , ' we are none the wiser .
this was not an exciting duel ; it was shop talk between the chancellor and her deputy . and this discussion was a signal : neither merkel nor steinmeier would mind continuing the grand coalition . "
" it seems as if merkel and steinmeier have forged a quiet alliance for the last weeks of the election campaign , even as their coalition government grows increasingly less popular among voters , " wrote the nordsee-zeitung from the country 's north .
" expectations for the debate were not high in the first place ; there was no real verbal sparring , there were no new facts : somehow , they do appear to still like each other . "
bonn 's general-anzeiger summed it up : " the two get along well , and that was evident last night . " db / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

together they would produce more than 12,000 megawatts of energy , which could supply power to 12 million households , the transport ministry said . " this would bring us closer to our goal of producing 25,000 megawatts offshore by 2030 , " tiefensee told the daily hamburger abendblatt . he added that the ministry had approved some of the 2,500 applications received by his office for wind turbines in the north and baltic seas .
tiefensee told the paper he would present a proposal for the wind farms at a cabinet meeting with chancellor angela merkel on wednesday . costs for the new wind farms have not yet been established , a spokesperson for the transport ministry told the hamburg newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in germany are wondering where and how to store radioactive waste the move comes as politicians debate the continued use of nuclear power in germany and how to deal with the radioactive waste it generates . " the current discussion about the nuclear waste depot gorleben shows once again very clearly that we need to expand renewable energy , " said tiefensee , who is a member of the center-left social democrats . dozens of farms already approved of the 40 wind farms planned , 30 would be in the north sea and 10 in the baltic sea .
twenty-two have already received government approval and berlin intends to set aside some 100 square kilometers -lrb- 39 square miles -rrb- for offshore power projects .
most will be built near the east frisian islands . " we are securing and creating jobs in one of the markets of the future , " tiefensee said , adding that wind farms could mean 30,000 jobs in germany .
" we want germany to be at the fore of this technology . " approval has already been given for 22 offshore wind farms in the north sea and another three in the baltic with a total of 1,800 turbines , according to christian dahmke of germany 's federal maritime and hydrographic agency .
he added that officials were considering another 55 applications . germany is n't out to sea alone over the last week a number of similar announcements have been made in other european countries , indicating that wind energy will gain greater prominence in the political and public debates over renewable energy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are already some turbines spinning off the german coast turbine maker ge electric announced thursday that it signed agreements to supply what would become the largest european on-shore wind farm in romania , while oil-nation norway said the same day it had authorized its first ever off-shore wind facility . planning for huge wind farms out at sea has been going on for years , but little tangible progress had actually been made .
technical problems have been a main challenge . the head of the european wind energy association , christian kjaer , on monday also called on eu governments to give a clear signal of their support to the wind power industry . up to 16 percent of all energy consumed in the eu could come from wind farms by 2020 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 14.09.2009 deadly beating in munich sparks debate ahead of elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a horrible crime in a lovely neighborhood : the tram stop at solln a deadly beating in broad daylight has sparked a new debate in germany on the sensitive topics of public safety , civil courage and juvenile justice , shortly before national elections . a tragic drama that took place over the weekend in munich appears likely to become a campaign topic in upcoming parliamentary elections .
it has fired up simmering debates over juvenile justice , as well as moral decay and civil courage in germany .
on saturday afternoon , sept .
12 , a businessman riding a local tram stepped in to protect a group of four young teenagers from three youths , 17 and 18 years old , who were harassing the youngsters for money .
the 50-year-old man called the police from his cell phone , and offered the four , aged 13 to 15 , to accompany them off the tram at his end destination , the wealthy munich neighborhood of solln .
reminiscent of earlier attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people laid flowers where the yet-unnamed samaritan lost his life after they got off the tram , however , the older teens continued to harass the younger ones .
the good samaritan tried to intercede , and the two young men attacked him , punching and kicking him until he was unconscious on the tram platform .
according to police , he died in the hospital a few hours later .
the attackers have been taken into custody , and prosecutors have said they will likely be charged with murder .
the 18-year-old offender , who was drunk at the time of the crime , has a previous record of assault and battery , theft and extortionate theft .
the story has shocked munich and the rest of the country , and recalls a similar attack in late 2007 , when a retiree was nearly beaten to death by two youths in a subway station .
that attack became a topic in the then-hotly-contested parliamentary election in the state of hesse , with the focus on social decline and the fact that the attackers in that case had migrant backgrounds .
crime , juvenile justice on election agenda in contrast to the 2007 attack , however , the offenders in saturday 's deadly beating are both germans born in munich , noted munich prosecutor laurent lafleur .
still , the christian socialist union , the bavarian sister party to angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats , appears ready to make the case a campaign issue .
they have used it to call for stricter juvenile sentencing and increased public video surveillance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surveillance cameras caught the beating in december 2007 on monday , bavarian premier horst seehofer said the case should lead politicians to think about how to better combat crime , and that no subject should be considered taboo .
meanwhile , bavaria 's conservative interior minister joachim herrmann called for the maximum penalty for juveniles to be raised , from 10 to 15 years imprisonment .
the state 's justice minister , beate merk , also of the csu , said 18 to 21 year olds should be sentenced as adults .
currently in germany , offenders that age can also be sentenced according to milder juvenile sentencing guidelines .
horrible consequences for civil courage ?
conservative parliamentarian peter ramsauer also joined the debate .
he accused social democrats of having blocked stricter juvenile sentencing rules and said the social democrats had failed " to do the least thing " to combat juvenile crime .
in response , a spokeswoman for germany 's minister of justice , brigitte zypries , who is a social democrat , dismissed the csu demands .
despite recent events there is no need to change the law since , indeed , judges can already sentence 18 to 21 year-olds as adults , she pointed out .
and spd lawmaker dieter wiefelspuetz complained to the rheinische post newspaper that the csu had shown a " unique brand of irresponsiblity " by making policy recommendations just hours after such a horrible event .
meanwhile , police are concerned that the case could mean that people who witness crimes or dangerous situations in the future will be afraid to speak out , with potentially damaging consequences for law enforcement and the overall social fabric .
the investigators in the case say they are worried about the signal sent on crime prevention .
the victim behaved exactly as he should have , police agreed .
he got involved , was n't aggressive , and called the police - but he died anyway .
police spokesman wolfgang wenger told afp news service : " the worst thing that could happen is that the message that comes out of this is : ' do n't get involved .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 14.09.2009 a year after lehman collapse , bankers rebuild their bubble großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehman is gone but bankers are back in business banks are raking in profits again , thanks partly to state bailouts , but remain hesitant about extending credit .
now governments have prominent roles in the financial sector and are under pressure to change the rules . the casino is back in business , trading and speculating on the financial markets are on their way to reach pre-crisis levels .
banks are again posting profits and managers are again looking forward to big bonuses .
a year after us investment bank lehman brothers filed for bankruptcy , not much has changed - at least not in the sector that triggered the global financial crisis . new data suggest that after passing the crisis on to the economy beyond the walls of wall street , the financial markets have yet again managed to close the shutters to the real world . the bank for international settlements , the world 's biggest central bank body , reported sunday that interbank money markets are recovering to levels not seen since early 2008 .
the bank said that shows financial institutions are once again dealing with one another , but that they also remain hesitant to extend credit to businesses . reduced risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's central bank chief axel weber says : " growth not sustainable yet . "
germany 's federal bank chief axel weber , however , said the somewhat brighter general economic outlook is in part due to the government bailout of financial markets , which has contributed to " systemic risk reduction . " " aggressive monetary policy and huge economic stimulus packages " have also helped improve prospects , he said , but added that such measures make it hard to know if growth will be self-sustainable . but while bankers are benefiting from rebounding markets for the moment , the impact of the crisis on global economies and political decisions means that even they will face new realities in the long run .
to prevent markets - and ultimately their economies - from collapsing , national governments have financially propped up or de facto nationalized major banks . leaders of the g-20 group of major nations pledged in april to strengthen financial supervision and establish stricter rules on bonus payments .
when they meet again this month in the united states they are expected to reinforce those measures . economic crisis not over yet politicians have ample reason to remain anxious .
germany is bracing for a new wave of bankruptcies this fall and unemployment figures are also set to rise , just statistics have shown that more businesses and individuals are expected to default on credit payments . experts estimate that german lenders alone could face losing 120 billion euros -lrb- $ 176 billion -rrb- by 2011 as a result .
the situation across the european union does not look much different , even though the european commission on monday announced that the euro zone is emerging from recession . " the eu economy appears to be at a turning point , " an interim forecast said , but it confirmed that the economy of the 16 countries using the euro would contract by 4 percent this year . disaster lurking in balance sheets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imf warns the crisis is not over despite positive signals from europe 's biggest economies , the head of the international monetary fund has warned that the global economic crisis is not over yet . " in the minds of too many - not only regular people but also top politicians - the financial crisis is already behind us , " dominique strauss-kahn told german news weekly der spiegel , adding that more work on financial sector regulation was needed . despite posting massive profits , the economic underpinnings of financial businesses themselves remain fragile a year after the lehman collapse . hypo real estate , nationalized by the german government and injected with 3 billion euros of fresh capital , is continuing to cause problems for german politicians and economic leaders .
the bank is set to receive 7 billion euros more before the year 's end but , according to media reports , another 16 billion euros of losses that have not yet " materialized " are lurking in the bank 's books . those least responsible for crisis are worst affected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prices for commodities from developing nations have slumped while wall street thinks it has recovered and industrialized economies anticipate they will soon follow , the global crisis may continue to affect those least responsible for it . the downturn has hit the african continent especially hard despite it not being involved in its making , civil society organizations gathered in the capital of the democratic republic of the congo heard at the fifth people 's summit of the southern african development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- . commodity prices have all but collapsed , ngos told the gathering .
among others , cotton farmers ' earnings have been whittled down to just a quarter of what they used to be before the outbreak of the financial crisis last year . rri / dpa / ap / reuters / ips editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

banks say they are simply trying to avoid risky loans . french banks have recently been accused of shunning small and medium-sized businesses in particular since the crisis struck - despite receiving billions of euros in state aid designed to keep credit flowing . clair service hotellerie is one of the companies affected by the banks tightened lending .
from small headquarters in paris , it provides staff for the hotel industry worldwide .
its recruits , often from eastern europe , are employed directly and trained by the company . the agency 's survival has been threatened by cash flow problems since its bank revoked the company 's overdraft facility a year ago , burdening the agency with tens of thousands of euros in extra charges . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : staffing hotels could become impossible for one french company " overnight we could not pay salaries or social charges on time , " the agency 's marketing manager , renaud chemin , said .
he added that the bank had told it to increase its capital , a suggestion the company says is impossible under current circumstances . clair service hotellerie now faces bankruptcy within three months .

last year , the banks , which had received billions of euros in state aid , agreed to increase loans by 3 percent to 4 percent .

its recruits , often from eastern europe , are employed directly and trained by the company . the agency 's survival has been threatened by cash flow problems since its bank revoked the company 's overdraft facility a year ago , burdening the agency with tens of thousands of euros in extra charges . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : staffing hotels could become impossible for one french company " overnight we could not pay salaries or social charges on time , " the agency 's marketing manager , renaud chemin , said .
he added that the bank had told it to increase its capital , a suggestion the company says is impossible under current circumstances . clair service hotellerie now faces bankruptcy within three months . " since the bank will not make our situation easier , it just means the end of the company , " chemin said . such an outcome would be bound to have an impact on employees like katarina piekarmiak . she trained to be a french teacher in her native poland , but found jobs hard to come by . she replied to an advertisement from france and , since january , she has been on the agency 's books , hired out to a hotel in paris where she works as a receptionist . " in poland i was unemployed , so this work allows me to earn money and live normally , " she said .
" without this agency i 'd be unemployed again , and if i found nothing else here i 'd go back home and probably be out of work again . " banks accused of starving businesses many other small firms face problems similar to those of clair service hotellerie - especially in the restaurant industry where the banks stand accused of eschewing the whole sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : banks are becoming extremely cautious , mezziouane said " i increasingly notice banks that are more and more hesitant and more and more cautious when it comes to taking risks , " said abdellah mezziouane , general secretary of the cgpme in paris , which represents small and medium-sized businesses .
" we have concrete cases where small and medium-sized businesses can no longer find the means to finance their development and their investment , and no longer have access to funds . " a mediator appointed by the government to investigate complaints is dealing with a surge in the number of claims from small and medium-sized businesses .
last year , the banks , which had received billions of euros in state aid , agreed to increase loans by 3 percent to 4 percent .
but they have not reached that target . who is to blame ? the banks have defended themselves against charges that they are becoming too tight-fisted . some analysts have agreed with the banks , saying reduced demand caused by the recession is to blame for failure to meet lending targets . " for one or two quarters neither households nor companies were willing to borrow any more , " said cyril blesson , chief economist with seeds finance consultants . banks have perceived small businesses in particular to be too high a risk during the crisis , and tightened their lending conditions late last year , blesson added . however , with interest rates consistently low , he said he sees grounds for optimism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demand for credit is slowing picking up , some analysts said " according to the lending surveys from the central banks and especially the banque de france , we have signs of a revival in demand for credit , " blesson said .
" that is good , but now we also need banks to lend to households and companies that are willing to get indebted again . " adopt " small-business attitude " in the meantime , as many smaller companies continue to suffer , both the french government and business leaders have appealed to the banks to be more flexible . finance minister christine lagarde has written to 12 banks that have received state support , giving them until the end of the month to outline the measures they are taking to revitalize their credit policies . " i ask the french banking sector to adopt the attitude of small and medium sized companies , " laurence parisot , head of the medef employers ' organization , said in a recent radio interview .
" it is the most difficult time for them because for months they 've had order books falling by 30 , 40 , 50 percent . a large company can get by ; a small business ca n't .

his accomplices , assad sawar , 29 , and tanvir hussain , 28 , received minimum sentences of 36 and 32 years , respectively . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from left , abdulla ahmed ali , assad sawar , and tanvir hussain addressing ali during sentencing , judge richard henriques said , " i have concluded you are a driven and determined extremist with boundless energy and an ambition to lead a terrorist outrage of boundless proportion .
by this conspiracy you sought the attention of the world , and you now have it . "
the thwarted suicide attack , intercepted by british intelligence services in august 2006 , would have been the " worst atrocity since 9/11 and woiuld have inflicted heavy casualties in the name of islam , " the court in london heard last week . all three men , though born in britain , had close links with pakistan .
four other men were found not guilty of involvement in the plot .
henriques said the defendants had " embraced islamic extremism and it is that burning extremism that has motivated you throughout this conspiracy and is likely to drive you again . "
trial almost did n't happen at a trial a year ago , ali , hussain and sarwar were found guilty of conspiracy to murder involving liquid bombs - but that jury could not decide whether their plans extended to detonating the devices on planes . an appeal by britain 's crown prosecution service -lrb- cps -rrb- led to a retrial , with the jury concluding that such a terror plot did exist , ultimately leading to last monday 's convictions at woolwich crown court in london . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as ringleader of the group , ali was given a minimum sentence of 40 years during the trial , the court was told that ali picked out seven flights to san francisco , toronto , montreal , washington , new york and chicago that departed from london 's heathrow airport within a two-and-a-half hour period .
jets were operated by united airlines , american airlines and air canada .
the prosecution alleged that the attack would have caused " mass murder on an unimaginable scale " and would have " exceeded the carnage " of the september 11 attacks in the us in 2001 . plan foiled thanks to british surveillance reports said the security services , courts and police had spent a total of 35 million pounds -lrb- 39 million euros , $ 57 million -rrb- on foiling the plot and bringing the men to justice .
undercover surveillance officers had watched ali converting a flat in east london into a bomb factory , which was also used to record suicide videos in which the british public was warned to expect " floods of martyr operations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan to blow up the jets led to a worldwide ban on most liquids in hand luggage according to prosecutors at the trial last week , the three men plotted to drill holes in the bottom of plastic drinks bottles , drain the contents and inject liquid explosive with a syringe before sealing the holes with glue .
that way the bottle tops would remain unopened .
the home-made liquid explosive was to be concocted from hydrogen peroxide and tang , a soft drink available in powdered form .
when mixed with such an organic material at an appropriate strength , hydrogen peroxide has explosive qualities .
the bottles would be detonated using the substance htmd , concealed in regular aa 1.5-volt batteries .
the detonator would have been ignited using a metal wire or a small light bulb , the court heard .
the plan to blow up the seven airliners crossing the atlantic to canada and the us led to a worldwide ban on carrying liquids in hand luggage. mrm / dpa / afp / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the law was meant to come into force at the end of the year . the law was originally part of a wider immigration bill passed by the government in the early days of nicolas sarkozy 's presidency in an attempt to tighten the rules on those seeking entry to france .
its supporters said voluntary dna tests could speed up visa applications and help prove a genuine biological link between children and parents .
the law has come under intense criticism from rights groups and now the country 's immigration minister , eric besson , has said that he is unable to comply with the web of conditions in the heavily-amended text that was finally voted by parliament .
the dna tests were to be carried out at french consulates around the world .
but besson said that so many constraints had been added that he believed the law would n't work in practice .

we 'd need to invest a lot of resources for a very marginal interest , " he added .

sopo said this was good news because " these tests were ethically indefensible . "
under the law , tests would be voluntary ; families in theory could seek a dna test to prove a link between an immigrant in france and their relatives abroad .
it was watered down to exclude people from morocco , algeria and tunisia - which reinforced a feeling that sub-saharan africans were being stigmatized .
prime minister promises to work on a solution initially the measure was strongly supported by those who argued that the rules on immigration needed tightening .
however , there are now signs of disagreement within the government 's camp .
according to afp , the leader of the right-wing ump party in the national assembly , jean-francis cope , warned that the executive had an obligation to sign the law into application .
prime minister francois fillon has tried to defuse the disagreement , defending the law in principle .
he said parliament would re-examine the law to try to find a solution .
the initial law was championed by then immigration minister brice hortefeux , who is currently fighting off accusations of racism after he was recorded on video making what appear to be anti-arab comments .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 14.09.2009 eu economies could rebound , but unemployment worsens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the report , employment levels will continue to go down european union economies are expected to grow into the fourth quarter , but the recovery will be slow and officials in brussels have warned governments to brace themselves for more job losses . according to the european commission 's latest estimates , gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in the 27-nation bloc is expected to grow by 0.2 percent in the third quarter and 0.1 percent in the fourth after contracting sharply in the first half of the year .
overall eu gdp for the year was expected to shrink by 4 percent , which is in line with previous estimates .
eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said a sharp upturn in the global economy meant " the drop is behind us " but added that it was based mainly on stimulus measures that " would not be there forever . "
in addition , almunia warned that " unemployment levels will continue to go up and employment levels will continue to decrease , since the negative impact on the labor market has a lag of two or three quarters . "
his comments came as the latest eu figures were released , showing that the number of people unemployed in the bloc had decreased by 0.6 percent , or 1.44 million , in the second quarter when compared to the first .
call for training schemes to help unemployed the commissioner said governments should provide training schemes and promote " active labor market policies " designed to ensure that the unemployed can find a job once the economy fully recovers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the economic growth , lines at unemployment offices are expected to get longer eu governments have pumped billions of euros into their economies to mitigate the impact of the bloc 's worst recession in decades .
according to almunia , additional discretionary spending will have totalled 2.5 per cent of the eu 's gdp over the 2009-10 period .
if " automatic stabilizers " such as unemployment benefit payments are also taken into account , the size of the eu 's stimulus package will have amounted to 5.5 per cent of gdp by next year .
but with this additional spending leading to ballooning budget deficits across the eu , almunia once again urged governments to start thinking about how to rein in public spending .
" we need to define a clear , credible and coordinated ' exit strategy ' to put public finances progressively back on a sustainable path and to find the necessary resources to increase europe 's growth and jobs potential , " almunia said .
the governments of ireland and spain are among those that have already announced tax hikes in order to reduce public debt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro continues to be strong against the us dollar too early for real optimism almunia insisted that monday 's figures should be treated with " a mix of optimism and prudence , " noting that the speed of the recovery would depend on a number of factors , including the fragility of the financial sector and the impact of weak labor markets .
monday 's interim forecasts were based on the outlook for germany , spain , france , italy , the netherlands , poland and britain , which together account for 80 per cent of the eu economy .
of these , only spain was expected to remain in recession until at least 2010 .
germany is expected to lead the recovery with the greatest third-quarter gain , with italy showing " gradual improvement " and britain making a " return to positive territory before the year 's end , " almunia added. mrm / dpa / reuters / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

overall eu gdp for the year was expected to shrink by 4 percent , which is in line with previous estimates .
eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said a sharp upturn in the global economy meant " the drop is behind us " but added that it was based mainly on stimulus measures that " would not be there forever . "
in addition , almunia warned that " unemployment levels will continue to go up and employment levels will continue to decrease , since the negative impact on the labor market has a lag of two or three quarters . "
his comments came as the latest eu figures were released , showing that the number of people unemployed in the bloc had decreased by 0.6 percent , or 1.44 million , in the second quarter when compared to the first .
call for training schemes to help unemployed the commissioner said governments should provide training schemes and promote " active labor market policies " designed to ensure that the unemployed can find a job once the economy fully recovers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the economic growth , lines at unemployment offices are expected to get longer eu governments have pumped billions of euros into their economies to mitigate the impact of the bloc 's worst recession in decades .
according to almunia , additional discretionary spending will have totalled 2.5 per cent of the eu 's gdp over the 2009-10 period .
if " automatic stabilizers " such as unemployment benefit payments are also taken into account , the size of the eu 's stimulus package will have amounted to 5.5 per cent of gdp by next year .
but with this additional spending leading to ballooning budget deficits across the eu , almunia once again urged governments to start thinking about how to rein in public spending .
" we need to define a clear , credible and coordinated ' exit strategy ' to put public finances progressively back on a sustainable path and to find the necessary resources to increase europe 's growth and jobs potential , " almunia said .
the governments of ireland and spain are among those that have already announced tax hikes in order to reduce public debt .

they fear german jobs might be saved at their expense .
now brussels is probing the deal . britain and belgium on monday urged the european commission to ensure the takeover of carmaker opel did not favor german workers because of 4.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.55 billion -rrb- in promised aid from berlin .
both countries are suspicious of the deal with canadian automotive supplier magna and its russian allies , under which all four german plants will stay open while opel 's belgian plant and one of two vauxhall sites in britain could close .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one vauxhall plant in britain may have to close " i think it is important to say that the -lrb- european -rrb- commission should not accept anything that looks like a political fix or any linkage between aid and retention of jobs in any specific plant or country , " british business secretary peter mandelson told the bbc .
the eu commission denied media reports alleging it had information that could potentially derail german state support for opel .
german weekly der spiegel had reported that the commission was in possession of documents showing that the opel plant in the belgian city of antwerp – which is threatened with closure – operates at greater efficiency than the facility in bochum , germany , which opel 's new owner magna has promised to keep .

peeters said he and verheugen agreed that commercial and economic , not political , factors were paramount in deciding which plants should survive .

a government spokesman said the support package is in line with existing eu guidelines and does not need to be presented to brussels for special scrutiny .

the magna deal , therefore , faces the prospect of a potential veto from brussels for another few weeks .
this adds further uncertainty to the whole project , which at present consists of little more than a declaration of intent by general motors and magna .
gm in particular warned that " key issues " still need to be dealt with during the negotiations on the way to a final agreement over the sale of opel .

lubanga was accused of creating an entire infrastructure around child soldiers in the ituri region and commanding forces responsible for massive human rights violations , including ethnic massacres , murder , torture , rape and mutilation in the democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- . his arrest , the first under a warrant issued by the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- , was seen as the first step in an international crackdown on seemingly out-of-control military leaders using human rights abuses as tactics in many of africa 's brutal conflicts .
his trial for war crimes in the hague , which began in january this year , appeared to show that the icc was a judicial force to be reckoned with and that a flood of arrests and convictions would follow . but as the prosecution rested its case in july , leaving lubanga 's counsel to prepare its defense case ahead of its october presentation , increasing criticism of the trial and accusations against the icc gathered pace in the drc . congolese call trial a " neo-colonial project " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the icc is making an example of lubanga many congolese accuse the historic process against lubanga as being a show trial , saying that the icc are trying one individual while many others remain free to commit more human rights abuses in congo .
some have called lubanga ’ s trial a " neo-colonial project " and that the icc is trying to set an example rather than using the case as part of an on-going quest to bring others like lubanga to justice .
they say his is a token arrest . " there 's a growing disconnection between how the icc is seen in the west and how it 's perceived in africa , " richard gowan , an africa expert at the european center for foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" it has focused almost entirely on african cases so far , so many africans believe it ’ s being used in a colonial way and western leaders haven ’ t done enough to dispel this negative impression . " anneke van woudenberg , human rights watch 's congo expert , believes that distrust in the icc has its roots in both a political agenda and public confusion in congo . " this is certainly not a sham trial and this is something which has been propagated by lubanga ’ s supporters and those loyal to him in the ituri region , " she told deutsche welle .
" there has been confusion in congo over the narrow nature of the charges .
many don ’ t understand why lubanga has been charged only with the recruitment of child soldiers when he was responsible for the ethnic murders , rape and torture which made the ituri conflict the bloodiest in the congo war .
in addition , the evidence against him is very strong . " others fear that a conviction against lubanga will be held up as a justification for the icc ’ s existence but will result in a slow decline of its pursuit of other war criminals , not only in the drc but all over africa and the world . " i do n't subscribe to these congolese assertions , other than the undeniable fact that many suspected perpetrators of war crimes in the drc remain free and in positions of authority , " andrew philip , a congo expert with amnesty international , told deutsche welle .
" amnesty welcomes the icc investigations and prosecutions , although we have encouraged and continue to encourage the icc prosecutor to extend investigations to other areas of drc than just in the ituri region , and to other crimes within its mandate . " van woudenberg also believes that many more war crimes suspects remain at large but believes that the icc will not be stopping with lubanga . " the icc will not stop with lubanga and besides , he is not alone in standing trial , " she said . " there are three other individuals charged alongside him .
but what the icc prosecutor has to do is to look past the ituri conflict and the warlords there and go after those who supported and funded lubanga .
this would lead them to the higher echelons of not only the congolese government but also those in uganda and rwanda .
for this to have a wider effect the icc must not stop at the warlord level . " critics claim un deaths accelerated lubanga pursuit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's claimed the death of un troops speeded up the pursuit it has also been alleged that lubanga was only brought to trial after he was implicated in the deaths of un troops in the drc and that otherwise , the international community would have continued to turn what some congolese believe to be a blind eye to atrocities there .
some claim that while six million people have been killed in congo over the last 12 years and a wide range of abuses recorded , it took the death of nine bangladeshi peacekeepers in the northwestern region of ituri to stir the icc into action . " the claim that the deaths of the un soldiers prompted international action is misplaced , " said van woudenberg .
" ituri was the bloodiest region where more people were killed than anywhere else in congo so this was the icc ’ s first focus in its search for war crimes suspects .
because of the violence there , there were a lot of un troops and consequently un troops died there - but it wasn ’ t the only place in congo where they died . " it is also claimed that congo 's natural resources played a part in the international community ’ s hesitation to act .
the drc is rich in natural gas and crude oil reserves , while zinc , uranium and copper deposits are also plentiful . experts say conviction would prove positive for human rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite international efforts , congo still suffers despite these claims , human rights and legal experts believe lubanga 's trial and possible conviction will have a positive effect on the overall battle for human rights and motivate the world to pursue war criminals and bring them to justice at the icc . " in terms of human rights , lubanga ’ s trial is hugely significant , " said van woudenberg . " it is the first case at the icc and a conviction would enhance the icc ’ s efforts .
if he is convicted it will be a first for a suspect involved in the recruitment and use of child soldiers .
his arrest has already has a huge effect , bringing child soldiers to international attention and making african leaders aware that this is actually a crime .
we would like to see more offences added to his charge sheet so any conviction would hopefully have as strong an impact on those areas of abuses .

" it could n't have been a duel anyway , " wrote die welt daily . " for one thing , the need for ideological debate seems to be exhausted in this country .
and for another , the two politicians could not hit out at one another because it is not their style .
another reason is that they have worked together for four years in a coalition government they managed in harmony .
they agree on many issues , so they could not have credibly portrayed being at odds with each other .
the debate ended with a balanced 1:1 . "
" and why should the politicians badmouth the work they have been doing together for the past four years , " asked the sueddeutsche zeitung paper , " they may have to rule together again after -lsb- the -rsb- sept .
27 -lsb- election -rsb- .
the format of a duel is not appropriate to convey political content . "
the berliner zeitung wrote : " steinmeier only managed to attack for a few moments .
he was obviously lacking the necessary brutality and ruthlessness in view of the past four years in a joint government .
voters who wanted to find out what the world would look like with a coalition of christian democrats and free democrats , or under the leadership of the social democrats , did not learn a thing in the debate . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two are anxious to set themselves apart mass-circulation daily bild had the following assessment : " after a 90-minute ' duel , ' we are none the wiser .
this was not an exciting duel ; it was shop talk between the chancellor and her deputy . and this discussion was a signal : neither merkel nor steinmeier would mind continuing the grand coalition . "
" it seems as if merkel and steinmeier have forged a quiet alliance for the last weeks of the election campaign , even as their coalition government grows increasingly less popular among voters , " wrote the nordsee-zeitung from the country 's north .
" expectations for the debate were not high in the first place ; there was no real verbal sparring , there were no new facts : somehow , they do appear to still like each other . "
bonn 's general-anzeiger summed it up : " the two get along well , and that was evident last night . " db / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de merkel to face rival steinmeier in german election tv debate chancellor merkel squares off with rival steinmeier in a tv debate sunday seen as a last chance for him to boost support for his social democratic party and close the large gap on the popular german leader .
-lrb- 13.09.2009 -rrb- tv election debates attract viewers but are short on substance as chancellor merkel faces rival steinmeier in a tv debate sunday , guest commentators alan schroeder and christoph bieber trace the origins of televised election debates and their growing popularity around the world .

" it could n't have been a duel anyway , " wrote die welt daily . " for one thing , the need for ideological debate seems to be exhausted in this country .
and for another , the two politicians could not hit out at one another because it is not their style .
another reason is that they have worked together for four years in a coalition government they managed in harmony .
they agree on many issues , so they could not have credibly portrayed being at odds with each other .
the debate ended with a balanced 1:1 . "
" and why should the politicians badmouth the work they have been doing together for the past four years , " asked the sueddeutsche zeitung paper , " they may have to rule together again after -lsb- the -rsb- sept .
27 -lsb- election -rsb- .
the format of a duel is not appropriate to convey political content . "
the berliner zeitung wrote : " steinmeier only managed to attack for a few moments .
he was obviously lacking the necessary brutality and ruthlessness in view of the past four years in a joint government .
voters who wanted to find out what the world would look like with a coalition of christian democrats and free democrats , or under the leadership of the social democrats , did not learn a thing in the debate . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two are anxious to set themselves apart mass-circulation daily bild had the following assessment : " after a 90-minute ' duel , ' we are none the wiser .
this was not an exciting duel ; it was shop talk between the chancellor and her deputy . and this discussion was a signal : neither merkel nor steinmeier would mind continuing the grand coalition . "
" it seems as if merkel and steinmeier have forged a quiet alliance for the last weeks of the election campaign , even as their coalition government grows increasingly less popular among voters , " wrote the nordsee-zeitung from the country 's north .
" expectations for the debate were not high in the first place ; there was no real verbal sparring , there were no new facts : somehow , they do appear to still like each other . "
bonn 's general-anzeiger summed it up : " the two get along well , and that was evident last night . " db / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

overall eu gdp for the year was expected to shrink by 4 percent , which is in line with previous estimates .
eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said a sharp upturn in the global economy meant " the drop is behind us " but added that it was based mainly on stimulus measures that " would not be there forever . "
in addition , almunia warned that " unemployment levels will continue to go up and employment levels will continue to decrease , since the negative impact on the labor market has a lag of two or three quarters . "
his comments came as the latest eu figures were released , showing that the number of people unemployed in the bloc had decreased by 0.6 percent , or 1.44 million , in the second quarter when compared to the first .
call for training schemes to help unemployed the commissioner said governments should provide training schemes and promote " active labor market policies " designed to ensure that the unemployed can find a job once the economy fully recovers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the economic growth , lines at unemployment offices are expected to get longer eu governments have pumped billions of euros into their economies to mitigate the impact of the bloc 's worst recession in decades .
according to almunia , additional discretionary spending will have totalled 2.5 per cent of the eu 's gdp over the 2009-10 period .
if " automatic stabilizers " such as unemployment benefit payments are also taken into account , the size of the eu 's stimulus package will have amounted to 5.5 per cent of gdp by next year .
but with this additional spending leading to ballooning budget deficits across the eu , almunia once again urged governments to start thinking about how to rein in public spending .
" we need to define a clear , credible and coordinated ' exit strategy ' to put public finances progressively back on a sustainable path and to find the necessary resources to increase europe 's growth and jobs potential , " almunia said .
the governments of ireland and spain are among those that have already announced tax hikes in order to reduce public debt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro continues to be strong against the us dollar too early for real optimism almunia insisted that monday 's figures should be treated with " a mix of optimism and prudence , " noting that the speed of the recovery would depend on a number of factors , including the fragility of the financial sector and the impact of weak labor markets .
monday 's interim forecasts were based on the outlook for germany , spain , france , italy , the netherlands , poland and britain , which together account for 80 per cent of the eu economy .
of these , only spain was expected to remain in recession until at least 2010 .
germany is expected to lead the recovery with the greatest third-quarter gain , with italy showing " gradual improvement " and britain making a " return to positive territory before the year 's end , " almunia added. mrm / dpa / reuters / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

overall eu gdp for the year was expected to shrink by 4 percent , which is in line with previous estimates .
eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said a sharp upturn in the global economy meant " the drop is behind us " but added that it was based mainly on stimulus measures that " would not be there forever . "
in addition , almunia warned that " unemployment levels will continue to go up and employment levels will continue to decrease , since the negative impact on the labor market has a lag of two or three quarters . "
his comments came as the latest eu figures were released , showing that the number of people unemployed in the bloc had decreased by 0.6 percent , or 1.44 million , in the second quarter when compared to the first .
call for training schemes to help unemployed the commissioner said governments should provide training schemes and promote " active labor market policies " designed to ensure that the unemployed can find a job once the economy fully recovers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the economic growth , lines at unemployment offices are expected to get longer eu governments have pumped billions of euros into their economies to mitigate the impact of the bloc 's worst recession in decades .
according to almunia , additional discretionary spending will have totalled 2.5 per cent of the eu 's gdp over the 2009-10 period .
if " automatic stabilizers " such as unemployment benefit payments are also taken into account , the size of the eu 's stimulus package will have amounted to 5.5 per cent of gdp by next year .
but with this additional spending leading to ballooning budget deficits across the eu , almunia once again urged governments to start thinking about how to rein in public spending .
" we need to define a clear , credible and coordinated ' exit strategy ' to put public finances progressively back on a sustainable path and to find the necessary resources to increase europe 's growth and jobs potential , " almunia said .
the governments of ireland and spain are among those that have already announced tax hikes in order to reduce public debt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro continues to be strong against the us dollar too early for real optimism almunia insisted that monday 's figures should be treated with " a mix of optimism and prudence , " noting that the speed of the recovery would depend on a number of factors , including the fragility of the financial sector and the impact of weak labor markets .
monday 's interim forecasts were based on the outlook for germany , spain , france , italy , the netherlands , poland and britain , which together account for 80 per cent of the eu economy .
of these , only spain was expected to remain in recession until at least 2010 .
germany is expected to lead the recovery with the greatest third-quarter gain , with italy showing " gradual improvement " and britain making a " return to positive territory before the year 's end , " almunia added. mrm / dpa / reuters / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 14.09.2009 france delays dna test for immigrants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the law would have come into force on december 31 the french government is to rethink a controversial law authorizing dna tests for the families of immigrants seeking to join their relatives in france .
the law was meant to come into force at the end of the year . the law was originally part of a wider immigration bill passed by the government in the early days of nicolas sarkozy 's presidency in an attempt to tighten the rules on those seeking entry to france .
its supporters said voluntary dna tests could speed up visa applications and help prove a genuine biological link between children and parents .
the law has come under intense criticism from rights groups and now the country 's immigration minister , eric besson , has said that he is unable to comply with the web of conditions in the heavily-amended text that was finally voted by parliament .
the dna tests were to be carried out at french consulates around the world .
but besson said that so many constraints had been added that he believed the law would n't work in practice .
" the genetic samples should be taken by a doctor .
our consulates are n't equipped for that .
we 'd need to invest a lot of resources for a very marginal interest , " he added .
critics claim test unfair to africans when the law was introduced , it was claimed that dna tests could help in cases where there was doubt over whether birth certificates were valid .
but opposition politicians and human rights organizations protested that it stigmatized african immigrants in particular because many africans live in extended families where children are often adopted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics claim the law is especially unfair on people from sub-saharan africa critics , like dominique sopo , head of sos racism in france , have welcomed the immigration minister 's move to shelve the plan .
sopo said this was good news because " these tests were ethically indefensible . "
under the law , tests would be voluntary ; families in theory could seek a dna test to prove a link between an immigrant in france and their relatives abroad .
it was watered down to exclude people from morocco , algeria and tunisia - which reinforced a feeling that sub-saharan africans were being stigmatized .
prime minister promises to work on a solution initially the measure was strongly supported by those who argued that the rules on immigration needed tightening .
however , there are now signs of disagreement within the government 's camp .
according to afp , the leader of the right-wing ump party in the national assembly , jean-francis cope , warned that the executive had an obligation to sign the law into application .
prime minister francois fillon has tried to defuse the disagreement , defending the law in principle .
he said parliament would re-examine the law to try to find a solution .
the initial law was championed by then immigration minister brice hortefeux , who is currently fighting off accusations of racism after he was recorded on video making what appear to be anti-arab comments .

the law was meant to come into force at the end of the year . the law was originally part of a wider immigration bill passed by the government in the early days of nicolas sarkozy 's presidency in an attempt to tighten the rules on those seeking entry to france .
its supporters said voluntary dna tests could speed up visa applications and help prove a genuine biological link between children and parents .
the law has come under intense criticism from rights groups and now the country 's immigration minister , eric besson , has said that he is unable to comply with the web of conditions in the heavily-amended text that was finally voted by parliament .
the dna tests were to be carried out at french consulates around the world .
but besson said that so many constraints had been added that he believed the law would n't work in practice .
" the genetic samples should be taken by a doctor .
our consulates are n't equipped for that .
we 'd need to invest a lot of resources for a very marginal interest , " he added .
critics claim test unfair to africans when the law was introduced , it was claimed that dna tests could help in cases where there was doubt over whether birth certificates were valid .
but opposition politicians and human rights organizations protested that it stigmatized african immigrants in particular because many africans live in extended families where children are often adopted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics claim the law is especially unfair on people from sub-saharan africa critics , like dominique sopo , head of sos racism in france , have welcomed the immigration minister 's move to shelve the plan .
sopo said this was good news because " these tests were ethically indefensible . "
under the law , tests would be voluntary ; families in theory could seek a dna test to prove a link between an immigrant in france and their relatives abroad .
it was watered down to exclude people from morocco , algeria and tunisia - which reinforced a feeling that sub-saharan africans were being stigmatized .
prime minister promises to work on a solution initially the measure was strongly supported by those who argued that the rules on immigration needed tightening .
however , there are now signs of disagreement within the government 's camp .
according to afp , the leader of the right-wing ump party in the national assembly , jean-francis cope , warned that the executive had an obligation to sign the law into application .
prime minister francois fillon has tried to defuse the disagreement , defending the law in principle .
he said parliament would re-examine the law to try to find a solution .
the initial law was championed by then immigration minister brice hortefeux , who is currently fighting off accusations of racism after he was recorded on video making what appear to be anti-arab comments .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 14.09.2009 france delays dna test for immigrants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the law would have come into force on december 31 the french government is to rethink a controversial law authorizing dna tests for the families of immigrants seeking to join their relatives in france .
the law was meant to come into force at the end of the year . the law was originally part of a wider immigration bill passed by the government in the early days of nicolas sarkozy 's presidency in an attempt to tighten the rules on those seeking entry to france .
its supporters said voluntary dna tests could speed up visa applications and help prove a genuine biological link between children and parents .
the law has come under intense criticism from rights groups and now the country 's immigration minister , eric besson , has said that he is unable to comply with the web of conditions in the heavily-amended text that was finally voted by parliament .
the dna tests were to be carried out at french consulates around the world .
but besson said that so many constraints had been added that he believed the law would n't work in practice .
" the genetic samples should be taken by a doctor .
our consulates are n't equipped for that .
we 'd need to invest a lot of resources for a very marginal interest , " he added .
critics claim test unfair to africans when the law was introduced , it was claimed that dna tests could help in cases where there was doubt over whether birth certificates were valid .
but opposition politicians and human rights organizations protested that it stigmatized african immigrants in particular because many africans live in extended families where children are often adopted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics claim the law is especially unfair on people from sub-saharan africa critics , like dominique sopo , head of sos racism in france , have welcomed the immigration minister 's move to shelve the plan .
sopo said this was good news because " these tests were ethically indefensible . "
under the law , tests would be voluntary ; families in theory could seek a dna test to prove a link between an immigrant in france and their relatives abroad .
it was watered down to exclude people from morocco , algeria and tunisia - which reinforced a feeling that sub-saharan africans were being stigmatized .
prime minister promises to work on a solution initially the measure was strongly supported by those who argued that the rules on immigration needed tightening .
however , there are now signs of disagreement within the government 's camp .
according to afp , the leader of the right-wing ump party in the national assembly , jean-francis cope , warned that the executive had an obligation to sign the law into application .
prime minister francois fillon has tried to defuse the disagreement , defending the law in principle .
he said parliament would re-examine the law to try to find a solution .
the initial law was championed by then immigration minister brice hortefeux , who is currently fighting off accusations of racism after he was recorded on video making what appear to be anti-arab comments .

twenty million people watched the tv debate , hoping to see a clear winner emerge after 90 minutes .
but there was no real heated political debate from the two partners in germany 's four-year-old grand coalition .
two snap polls held after the debates came to very different conclusions .
a poll by german broadcaster zdf showed 31 percent for spd challenger steinmeier as the winner of the tv duel compared to 28 percent for merkel .
a poll conducted by forsa poll had merkel in front with 37 percent , against 35 percent for steinmeier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fireworks were missing in the chancellor debate but asked which candidate was best qualified to run the country , 58 percent chose merkel compared to 28 percent for steinmeier , a poll by broadcaster rtl showed .
dressed in dark business suits , both candidates emphasized what they had achieved in the last four years in a coalition government .
for steinmeier the stakes were higher .
the spd challenger had to score points to make up for a poor showing in the polls .
" we have achieved a lot .
quite a bit of it since the crisis and we may only have done so because there was a grand coalition , " he said .
" but we have n't managed everything , we fell short of what we could do in a number of areas because the cdu did n't go along with it .
for example on minimum wages and limiting executive pay .
that would have helped people . "
merkel agreed that they had " worked well together " but said that to turn around the economy after the financial crisis she would prefer the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- as her junior coalition partner .
" i think we could make more progress on jobs which is why i 'm appealing for a new government , " she said .
" the past has been good and you wo n't change my mind about the fact that we have got a lot done .
but i think for a democracy it 's good when grand coalitions do n't become normality . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : duel or duet ?
german foreign minister and vice chancellor steinmeier spoke of a change in political direction , emphasizing that voters had a clear alternative to a future coalition between the christian democrats and free democrats .
merkel and steinmeier both tried to claim credit for the rescue of car maker opel after canadian-austrian parts maker magna agreed last week to take over the troubled general motors ' subsidiary .
most political observers agreed that the more " presidential " chancellor merkel showed her crisis management credentials while steinmeier scored points on social equality .
much of the 90-minute debate focused on ways out of the economic crisis with merkel arguing in favor of tax cuts to stimulate demand .
merkel and steinmeier also discussed managers ' salary and bonus payments , minimum wages and nuclear energy .

now brussels is probing the deal . britain and belgium on monday urged the european commission to ensure the takeover of carmaker opel did not favor german workers because of 4.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.55 billion -rrb- in promised aid from berlin .
both countries are suspicious of the deal with canadian automotive supplier magna and its russian allies , under which all four german plants will stay open while opel 's belgian plant and one of two vauxhall sites in britain could close .

the eu commission denied media reports alleging it had information that could potentially derail german state support for opel .

they fear german jobs might be saved at their expense .
now brussels is probing the deal . britain and belgium on monday urged the european commission to ensure the takeover of carmaker opel did not favor german workers because of 4.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.55 billion -rrb- in promised aid from berlin .
both countries are suspicious of the deal with canadian automotive supplier magna and its russian allies , under which all four german plants will stay open while opel 's belgian plant and one of two vauxhall sites in britain could close .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one vauxhall plant in britain may have to close " i think it is important to say that the -lrb- european -rrb- commission should not accept anything that looks like a political fix or any linkage between aid and retention of jobs in any specific plant or country , " british business secretary peter mandelson told the bbc .
the eu commission denied media reports alleging it had information that could potentially derail german state support for opel .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 14.09.2009 opel deal faces fresh challenge großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the writing 's on the wall : the eu 's competition commissioner is gearing up to investigate the opel takeover by magna two fellow eu members are taking germany to task for extending state aid to the new owner of carmaker opel .
they fear german jobs might be saved at their expense .
now brussels is probing the deal . britain and belgium on monday urged the european commission to ensure the takeover of carmaker opel did not favor german workers because of 4.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.55 billion -rrb- in promised aid from berlin .
both countries are suspicious of the deal with canadian automotive supplier magna and its russian allies , under which all four german plants will stay open while opel 's belgian plant and one of two vauxhall sites in britain could close .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one vauxhall plant in britain may have to close " i think it is important to say that the -lrb- european -rrb- commission should not accept anything that looks like a political fix or any linkage between aid and retention of jobs in any specific plant or country , " british business secretary peter mandelson told the bbc .
the eu commission denied media reports alleging it had information that could potentially derail german state support for opel .
german weekly der spiegel had reported that the commission was in possession of documents showing that the opel plant in the belgian city of antwerp – which is threatened with closure – operates at greater efficiency than the facility in bochum , germany , which opel 's new owner magna has promised to keep .
eu law prohibits state guarantees for such a decision which – if true – would amount to economic nonsense .
belgium demands special probe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commissioner verheugen held talks with flanders ' chief minister in belgium , anger is mounting at the german decision and the flemish government has taken its argument to brussels .
kris peeters , first minister of flanders said he wants the eu 's executive commission to investigate whether german aid is in conflict with eu anti-competitive practices .
he held talks with eu industry commissioner guenter verheugen on the issue on monday .
peeters said he and verheugen agreed that commercial and economic , not political , factors were paramount in deciding which plants should survive .
" we are convinced antwerp has a fair chance .
antwerp has a better chance than certain german plants , " he told reporters , adding flanders would consider filing a complaint with the commission .
eu scrutiny adds uncertainty to magna-deal the german government said it does not anticipate problems in connection with state aid being extended to opel .
a government spokesman said the support package is in line with existing eu guidelines and does not need to be presented to brussels for special scrutiny .
but the eu commission takes a different view and has announced it will examine closely the conditions attached to german support for the carmaker .
eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said that the rules of the european market do not tolerate protectionism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : september 10 : gm managers announced what now appears to have been little more than a declaration of intent however , the required documentation is not expected to arrive from berlin before the german general election at the end of september .
the magna deal , therefore , faces the prospect of a potential veto from brussels for another few weeks .
this adds further uncertainty to the whole project , which at present consists of little more than a declaration of intent by general motors and magna .
gm in particular warned that " key issues " still need to be dealt with during the negotiations on the way to a final agreement over the sale of opel .
germany hosts opel meeting given these challenges , the german government is trying to move swiftly and has announced a meeting will be held on tuesday in berlin , at which european states with opel factories are invited to discuss and agree on the disbursement of state funds for restructuring measures .
but agreement , it seems , does not even exist over who is invited .
belgian foreign minister yves leterme complained on monday that his country had received no invitation .
the german government 's spokesman denied this. rri / reuters / dpa / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de opel deal sparks concerns about job losses across europe general motors has vowed that opel factories in germany will remain secure after its decision to sell the carmaker to supplier magna .
but other sites in europe have received no such guarantees from opel 's new owner .
-lrb- 11.09.2009 -rrb- opel deal leaves many unanswered questions gm 's announcement to sell its european subsidiary opel to a russian-backed canadian firm was initially greeted optimistically in germany .

both countries are suspicious of the deal with canadian automotive supplier magna and its russian allies , under which all four german plants will stay open while opel 's belgian plant and one of two vauxhall sites in britain could close .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one vauxhall plant in britain may have to close " i think it is important to say that the -lrb- european -rrb- commission should not accept anything that looks like a political fix or any linkage between aid and retention of jobs in any specific plant or country , " british business secretary peter mandelson told the bbc .
the eu commission denied media reports alleging it had information that could potentially derail german state support for opel .
german weekly der spiegel had reported that the commission was in possession of documents showing that the opel plant in the belgian city of antwerp – which is threatened with closure – operates at greater efficiency than the facility in bochum , germany , which opel 's new owner magna has promised to keep .
eu law prohibits state guarantees for such a decision which – if true – would amount to economic nonsense .
belgium demands special probe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commissioner verheugen held talks with flanders ' chief minister in belgium , anger is mounting at the german decision and the flemish government has taken its argument to brussels .
kris peeters , first minister of flanders said he wants the eu 's executive commission to investigate whether german aid is in conflict with eu anti-competitive practices .
he held talks with eu industry commissioner guenter verheugen on the issue on monday .
peeters said he and verheugen agreed that commercial and economic , not political , factors were paramount in deciding which plants should survive .
" we are convinced antwerp has a fair chance .
antwerp has a better chance than certain german plants , " he told reporters , adding flanders would consider filing a complaint with the commission .
eu scrutiny adds uncertainty to magna-deal the german government said it does not anticipate problems in connection with state aid being extended to opel .
a government spokesman said the support package is in line with existing eu guidelines and does not need to be presented to brussels for special scrutiny .
but the eu commission takes a different view and has announced it will examine closely the conditions attached to german support for the carmaker .
eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said that the rules of the european market do not tolerate protectionism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : september 10 : gm managers announced what now appears to have been little more than a declaration of intent however , the required documentation is not expected to arrive from berlin before the german general election at the end of september .
the magna deal , therefore , faces the prospect of a potential veto from brussels for another few weeks .
this adds further uncertainty to the whole project , which at present consists of little more than a declaration of intent by general motors and magna .
gm in particular warned that " key issues " still need to be dealt with during the negotiations on the way to a final agreement over the sale of opel .
germany hosts opel meeting given these challenges , the german government is trying to move swiftly and has announced a meeting will be held on tuesday in berlin , at which european states with opel factories are invited to discuss and agree on the disbursement of state funds for restructuring measures .
but agreement , it seems , does not even exist over who is invited .
belgian foreign minister yves leterme complained on monday that his country had received no invitation .
the german government 's spokesman denied this. rri / reuters / dpa / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de opel deal sparks concerns about job losses across europe general motors has vowed that opel factories in germany will remain secure after its decision to sell the carmaker to supplier magna .

together they would produce more than 12,000 megawatts of energy , which could supply power to 12 million households , the transport ministry said . " this would bring us closer to our goal of producing 25,000 megawatts offshore by 2030 , " tiefensee told the daily hamburger abendblatt . he added that the ministry had approved some of the 2,500 applications received by his office for wind turbines in the north and baltic seas .

the prosecution alleged that the attack would have caused " mass murder on an unimaginable scale " and would have " exceeded the carnage " of the september 11 attacks in the us in 2001 . plan foiled thanks to british surveillance reports said the security services , courts and police had spent a total of 35 million pounds -lrb- 39 million euros , $ 57 million -rrb- on foiling the plot and bringing the men to justice .
undercover surveillance officers had watched ali converting a flat in east london into a bomb factory , which was also used to record suicide videos in which the british public was warned to expect " floods of martyr operations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan to blow up the jets led to a worldwide ban on most liquids in hand luggage according to prosecutors at the trial last week , the three men plotted to drill holes in the bottom of plastic drinks bottles , drain the contents and inject liquid explosive with a syringe before sealing the holes with glue .
that way the bottle tops would remain unopened .
the home-made liquid explosive was to be concocted from hydrogen peroxide and tang , a soft drink available in powdered form .
when mixed with such an organic material at an appropriate strength , hydrogen peroxide has explosive qualities .
the bottles would be detonated using the substance htmd , concealed in regular aa 1.5-volt batteries .
the detonator would have been ignited using a metal wire or a small light bulb , the court heard .
the plan to blow up the seven airliners crossing the atlantic to canada and the us led to a worldwide ban on carrying liquids in hand luggage. mrm / dpa / afp / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

banks say they are simply trying to avoid risky loans . french banks have recently been accused of shunning small and medium-sized businesses in particular since the crisis struck - despite receiving billions of euros in state aid designed to keep credit flowing . clair service hotellerie is one of the companies affected by the banks tightened lending .
from small headquarters in paris , it provides staff for the hotel industry worldwide .
its recruits , often from eastern europe , are employed directly and trained by the company . the agency 's survival has been threatened by cash flow problems since its bank revoked the company 's overdraft facility a year ago , burdening the agency with tens of thousands of euros in extra charges . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : staffing hotels could become impossible for one french company " overnight we could not pay salaries or social charges on time , " the agency 's marketing manager , renaud chemin , said .
he added that the bank had told it to increase its capital , a suggestion the company says is impossible under current circumstances . clair service hotellerie now faces bankruptcy within three months . " since the bank will not make our situation easier , it just means the end of the company , " chemin said . such an outcome would be bound to have an impact on employees like katarina piekarmiak . she trained to be a french teacher in her native poland , but found jobs hard to come by . she replied to an advertisement from france and , since january , she has been on the agency 's books , hired out to a hotel in paris where she works as a receptionist .

" we have concrete cases where small and medium-sized businesses can no longer find the means to finance their development and their investment , and no longer have access to funds . " a mediator appointed by the government to investigate complaints is dealing with a surge in the number of claims from small and medium-sized businesses .
last year , the banks , which had received billions of euros in state aid , agreed to increase loans by 3 percent to 4 percent .
but they have not reached that target . who is to blame ? the banks have defended themselves against charges that they are becoming too tight-fisted . some analysts have agreed with the banks , saying reduced demand caused by the recession is to blame for failure to meet lending targets . " for one or two quarters neither households nor companies were willing to borrow any more , " said cyril blesson , chief economist with seeds finance consultants . banks have perceived small businesses in particular to be too high a risk during the crisis , and tightened their lending conditions late last year , blesson added . however , with interest rates consistently low , he said he sees grounds for optimism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demand for credit is slowing picking up , some analysts said " according to the lending surveys from the central banks and especially the banque de france , we have signs of a revival in demand for credit , " blesson said .

he added that the bank had told it to increase its capital , a suggestion the company says is impossible under current circumstances . clair service hotellerie now faces bankruptcy within three months . " since the bank will not make our situation easier , it just means the end of the company , " chemin said . such an outcome would be bound to have an impact on employees like katarina piekarmiak . she trained to be a french teacher in her native poland , but found jobs hard to come by . she replied to an advertisement from france and , since january , she has been on the agency 's books , hired out to a hotel in paris where she works as a receptionist .

together they would produce more than 12,000 megawatts of energy , which could supply power to 12 million households , the transport ministry said . " this would bring us closer to our goal of producing 25,000 megawatts offshore by 2030 , " tiefensee told the daily hamburger abendblatt . he added that the ministry had approved some of the 2,500 applications received by his office for wind turbines in the north and baltic seas .
tiefensee told the paper he would present a proposal for the wind farms at a cabinet meeting with chancellor angela merkel on wednesday . costs for the new wind farms have not yet been established , a spokesperson for the transport ministry told the hamburg newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in germany are wondering where and how to store radioactive waste the move comes as politicians debate the continued use of nuclear power in germany and how to deal with the radioactive waste it generates . " the current discussion about the nuclear waste depot gorleben shows once again very clearly that we need to expand renewable energy , " said tiefensee , who is a member of the center-left social democrats . dozens of farms already approved of the 40 wind farms planned , 30 would be in the north sea and 10 in the baltic sea .

most will be built near the east frisian islands . " we are securing and creating jobs in one of the markets of the future , " tiefensee said , adding that wind farms could mean 30,000 jobs in germany .
" we want germany to be at the fore of this technology . " approval has already been given for 22 offshore wind farms in the north sea and another three in the baltic with a total of 1,800 turbines , according to christian dahmke of germany 's federal maritime and hydrographic agency .
he added that officials were considering another 55 applications . germany is n't out to sea alone over the last week a number of similar announcements have been made in other european countries , indicating that wind energy will gain greater prominence in the political and public debates over renewable energy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are already some turbines spinning off the german coast turbine maker ge electric announced thursday that it signed agreements to supply what would become the largest european on-shore wind farm in romania , while oil-nation norway said the same day it had authorized its first ever off-shore wind facility . planning for huge wind farms out at sea has been going on for years , but little tangible progress had actually been made .
technical problems have been a main challenge . the head of the european wind energy association , christian kjaer , on monday also called on eu governments to give a clear signal of their support to the wind power industry . up to 16 percent of all energy consumed in the eu could come from wind farms by 2020 .

it has fired up simmering debates over juvenile justice , as well as moral decay and civil courage in germany .
on saturday afternoon , sept .
12 , a businessman riding a local tram stepped in to protect a group of four young teenagers from three youths , 17 and 18 years old , who were harassing the youngsters for money .
the 50-year-old man called the police from his cell phone , and offered the four , aged 13 to 15 , to accompany them off the tram at his end destination , the wealthy munich neighborhood of solln .
reminiscent of earlier attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people laid flowers where the yet-unnamed samaritan lost his life after they got off the tram , however , the older teens continued to harass the younger ones .
the good samaritan tried to intercede , and the two young men attacked him , punching and kicking him until he was unconscious on the tram platform .
according to police , he died in the hospital a few hours later .
the attackers have been taken into custody , and prosecutors have said they will likely be charged with murder .
the 18-year-old offender , who was drunk at the time of the crime , has a previous record of assault and battery , theft and extortionate theft .
the story has shocked munich and the rest of the country , and recalls a similar attack in late 2007 , when a retiree was nearly beaten to death by two youths in a subway station .
that attack became a topic in the then-hotly-contested parliamentary election in the state of hesse , with the focus on social decline and the fact that the attackers in that case had migrant backgrounds .
crime , juvenile justice on election agenda in contrast to the 2007 attack , however , the offenders in saturday 's deadly beating are both germans born in munich , noted munich prosecutor laurent lafleur .
still , the christian socialist union , the bavarian sister party to angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats , appears ready to make the case a campaign issue .
they have used it to call for stricter juvenile sentencing and increased public video surveillance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surveillance cameras caught the beating in december 2007 on monday , bavarian premier horst seehofer said the case should lead politicians to think about how to better combat crime , and that no subject should be considered taboo .
meanwhile , bavaria 's conservative interior minister joachim herrmann called for the maximum penalty for juveniles to be raised , from 10 to 15 years imprisonment .
the state 's justice minister , beate merk , also of the csu , said 18 to 21 year olds should be sentenced as adults .
currently in germany , offenders that age can also be sentenced according to milder juvenile sentencing guidelines .
horrible consequences for civil courage ?
conservative parliamentarian peter ramsauer also joined the debate .
he accused social democrats of having blocked stricter juvenile sentencing rules and said the social democrats had failed " to do the least thing " to combat juvenile crime .
in response , a spokeswoman for germany 's minister of justice , brigitte zypries , who is a social democrat , dismissed the csu demands .
despite recent events there is no need to change the law since , indeed , judges can already sentence 18 to 21 year-olds as adults , she pointed out .
and spd lawmaker dieter wiefelspuetz complained to the rheinische post newspaper that the csu had shown a " unique brand of irresponsiblity " by making policy recommendations just hours after such a horrible event .
meanwhile , police are concerned that the case could mean that people who witness crimes or dangerous situations in the future will be afraid to speak out , with potentially damaging consequences for law enforcement and the overall social fabric .
the investigators in the case say they are worried about the signal sent on crime prevention .
the victim behaved exactly as he should have , police agreed .
he got involved , was n't aggressive , and called the police - but he died anyway .
police spokesman wolfgang wenger told afp news service : " the worst thing that could happen is that the message that comes out of this is : ' do n't get involved .

it has fired up simmering debates over juvenile justice , as well as moral decay and civil courage in germany .
on saturday afternoon , sept .
12 , a businessman riding a local tram stepped in to protect a group of four young teenagers from three youths , 17 and 18 years old , who were harassing the youngsters for money .
the 50-year-old man called the police from his cell phone , and offered the four , aged 13 to 15 , to accompany them off the tram at his end destination , the wealthy munich neighborhood of solln .
reminiscent of earlier attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people laid flowers where the yet-unnamed samaritan lost his life after they got off the tram , however , the older teens continued to harass the younger ones .
the good samaritan tried to intercede , and the two young men attacked him , punching and kicking him until he was unconscious on the tram platform .
according to police , he died in the hospital a few hours later .
the attackers have been taken into custody , and prosecutors have said they will likely be charged with murder .
the 18-year-old offender , who was drunk at the time of the crime , has a previous record of assault and battery , theft and extortionate theft .
the story has shocked munich and the rest of the country , and recalls a similar attack in late 2007 , when a retiree was nearly beaten to death by two youths in a subway station .
that attack became a topic in the then-hotly-contested parliamentary election in the state of hesse , with the focus on social decline and the fact that the attackers in that case had migrant backgrounds .
crime , juvenile justice on election agenda in contrast to the 2007 attack , however , the offenders in saturday 's deadly beating are both germans born in munich , noted munich prosecutor laurent lafleur .
still , the christian socialist union , the bavarian sister party to angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats , appears ready to make the case a campaign issue .
they have used it to call for stricter juvenile sentencing and increased public video surveillance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surveillance cameras caught the beating in december 2007 on monday , bavarian premier horst seehofer said the case should lead politicians to think about how to better combat crime , and that no subject should be considered taboo .
meanwhile , bavaria 's conservative interior minister joachim herrmann called for the maximum penalty for juveniles to be raised , from 10 to 15 years imprisonment .
the state 's justice minister , beate merk , also of the csu , said 18 to 21 year olds should be sentenced as adults .
currently in germany , offenders that age can also be sentenced according to milder juvenile sentencing guidelines .
horrible consequences for civil courage ?
conservative parliamentarian peter ramsauer also joined the debate .
he accused social democrats of having blocked stricter juvenile sentencing rules and said the social democrats had failed " to do the least thing " to combat juvenile crime .
in response , a spokeswoman for germany 's minister of justice , brigitte zypries , who is a social democrat , dismissed the csu demands .
despite recent events there is no need to change the law since , indeed , judges can already sentence 18 to 21 year-olds as adults , she pointed out .
and spd lawmaker dieter wiefelspuetz complained to the rheinische post newspaper that the csu had shown a " unique brand of irresponsiblity " by making policy recommendations just hours after such a horrible event .
meanwhile , police are concerned that the case could mean that people who witness crimes or dangerous situations in the future will be afraid to speak out , with potentially damaging consequences for law enforcement and the overall social fabric .
the investigators in the case say they are worried about the signal sent on crime prevention .
the victim behaved exactly as he should have , police agreed .
he got involved , was n't aggressive , and called the police - but he died anyway .

banks are again posting profits and managers are again looking forward to big bonuses .
a year after us investment bank lehman brothers filed for bankruptcy , not much has changed - at least not in the sector that triggered the global financial crisis . new data suggest that after passing the crisis on to the economy beyond the walls of wall street , the financial markets have yet again managed to close the shutters to the real world . the bank for international settlements , the world 's biggest central bank body , reported sunday that interbank money markets are recovering to levels not seen since early 2008 .

the situation across the european union does not look much different , even though the european commission on monday announced that the euro zone is emerging from recession .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 14.09.2009 a year after lehman collapse , bankers rebuild their bubble großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehman is gone but bankers are back in business banks are raking in profits again , thanks partly to state bailouts , but remain hesitant about extending credit .
now governments have prominent roles in the financial sector and are under pressure to change the rules . the casino is back in business , trading and speculating on the financial markets are on their way to reach pre-crisis levels .
banks are again posting profits and managers are again looking forward to big bonuses .
a year after us investment bank lehman brothers filed for bankruptcy , not much has changed - at least not in the sector that triggered the global financial crisis . new data suggest that after passing the crisis on to the economy beyond the walls of wall street , the financial markets have yet again managed to close the shutters to the real world . the bank for international settlements , the world 's biggest central bank body , reported sunday that interbank money markets are recovering to levels not seen since early 2008 .
the bank said that shows financial institutions are once again dealing with one another , but that they also remain hesitant to extend credit to businesses . reduced risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's central bank chief axel weber says : " growth not sustainable yet . "
germany 's federal bank chief axel weber , however , said the somewhat brighter general economic outlook is in part due to the government bailout of financial markets , which has contributed to " systemic risk reduction . " " aggressive monetary policy and huge economic stimulus packages " have also helped improve prospects , he said , but added that such measures make it hard to know if growth will be self-sustainable . but while bankers are benefiting from rebounding markets for the moment , the impact of the crisis on global economies and political decisions means that even they will face new realities in the long run .
to prevent markets - and ultimately their economies - from collapsing , national governments have financially propped up or de facto nationalized major banks . leaders of the g-20 group of major nations pledged in april to strengthen financial supervision and establish stricter rules on bonus payments .
when they meet again this month in the united states they are expected to reinforce those measures . economic crisis not over yet politicians have ample reason to remain anxious .
germany is bracing for a new wave of bankruptcies this fall and unemployment figures are also set to rise , just statistics have shown that more businesses and individuals are expected to default on credit payments . experts estimate that german lenders alone could face losing 120 billion euros -lrb- $ 176 billion -rrb- by 2011 as a result .
the situation across the european union does not look much different , even though the european commission on monday announced that the euro zone is emerging from recession . " the eu economy appears to be at a turning point , " an interim forecast said , but it confirmed that the economy of the 16 countries using the euro would contract by 4 percent this year . disaster lurking in balance sheets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imf warns the crisis is not over despite positive signals from europe 's biggest economies , the head of the international monetary fund has warned that the global economic crisis is not over yet . " in the minds of too many - not only regular people but also top politicians - the financial crisis is already behind us , " dominique strauss-kahn told german news weekly der spiegel , adding that more work on financial sector regulation was needed . despite posting massive profits , the economic underpinnings of financial businesses themselves remain fragile a year after the lehman collapse . hypo real estate , nationalized by the german government and injected with 3 billion euros of fresh capital , is continuing to cause problems for german politicians and economic leaders .
the bank is set to receive 7 billion euros more before the year 's end but , according to media reports , another 16 billion euros of losses that have not yet " materialized " are lurking in the bank 's books . those least responsible for crisis are worst affected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prices for commodities from developing nations have slumped while wall street thinks it has recovered and industrialized economies anticipate they will soon follow , the global crisis may continue to affect those least responsible for it . the downturn has hit the african continent especially hard despite it not being involved in its making , civil society organizations gathered in the capital of the democratic republic of the congo heard at the fifth people 's summit of the southern african development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- . commodity prices have all but collapsed , ngos told the gathering .
among others , cotton farmers ' earnings have been whittled down to just a quarter of what they used to be before the outbreak of the financial crisis last year . rri / dpa / ap / reuters / ips editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it could n't have been a duel anyway , " wrote die welt daily . " for one thing , the need for ideological debate seems to be exhausted in this country .
and for another , the two politicians could not hit out at one another because it is not their style .
another reason is that they have worked together for four years in a coalition government they managed in harmony .
they agree on many issues , so they could not have credibly portrayed being at odds with each other .
the debate ended with a balanced 1:1 . "
" and why should the politicians badmouth the work they have been doing together for the past four years , " asked the sueddeutsche zeitung paper , " they may have to rule together again after -lsb- the -rsb- sept .
27 -lsb- election -rsb- .
the format of a duel is not appropriate to convey political content . "
the berliner zeitung wrote : " steinmeier only managed to attack for a few moments .
he was obviously lacking the necessary brutality and ruthlessness in view of the past four years in a joint government .
voters who wanted to find out what the world would look like with a coalition of christian democrats and free democrats , or under the leadership of the social democrats , did not learn a thing in the debate . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two are anxious to set themselves apart mass-circulation daily bild had the following assessment : " after a 90-minute ' duel , ' we are none the wiser .
this was not an exciting duel ; it was shop talk between the chancellor and her deputy . and this discussion was a signal : neither merkel nor steinmeier would mind continuing the grand coalition . "
" it seems as if merkel and steinmeier have forged a quiet alliance for the last weeks of the election campaign , even as their coalition government grows increasingly less popular among voters , " wrote the nordsee-zeitung from the country 's north .
" expectations for the debate were not high in the first place ; there was no real verbal sparring , there were no new facts : somehow , they do appear to still like each other . "
bonn 's general-anzeiger summed it up : " the two get along well , and that was evident last night . " db / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the law was meant to come into force at the end of the year . the law was originally part of a wider immigration bill passed by the government in the early days of nicolas sarkozy 's presidency in an attempt to tighten the rules on those seeking entry to france .
its supporters said voluntary dna tests could speed up visa applications and help prove a genuine biological link between children and parents .
the law has come under intense criticism from rights groups and now the country 's immigration minister , eric besson , has said that he is unable to comply with the web of conditions in the heavily-amended text that was finally voted by parliament .
the dna tests were to be carried out at french consulates around the world .
but besson said that so many constraints had been added that he believed the law would n't work in practice .
" the genetic samples should be taken by a doctor .
our consulates are n't equipped for that .
we 'd need to invest a lot of resources for a very marginal interest , " he added .
critics claim test unfair to africans when the law was introduced , it was claimed that dna tests could help in cases where there was doubt over whether birth certificates were valid .
but opposition politicians and human rights organizations protested that it stigmatized african immigrants in particular because many africans live in extended families where children are often adopted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics claim the law is especially unfair on people from sub-saharan africa critics , like dominique sopo , head of sos racism in france , have welcomed the immigration minister 's move to shelve the plan .
sopo said this was good news because " these tests were ethically indefensible . "
under the law , tests would be voluntary ; families in theory could seek a dna test to prove a link between an immigrant in france and their relatives abroad .
it was watered down to exclude people from morocco , algeria and tunisia - which reinforced a feeling that sub-saharan africans were being stigmatized .
prime minister promises to work on a solution initially the measure was strongly supported by those who argued that the rules on immigration needed tightening .
however , there are now signs of disagreement within the government 's camp .
according to afp , the leader of the right-wing ump party in the national assembly , jean-francis cope , warned that the executive had an obligation to sign the law into application .
prime minister francois fillon has tried to defuse the disagreement , defending the law in principle .
he said parliament would re-examine the law to try to find a solution .
the initial law was championed by then immigration minister brice hortefeux , who is currently fighting off accusations of racism after he was recorded on video making what appear to be anti-arab comments .

the law was meant to come into force at the end of the year . the law was originally part of a wider immigration bill passed by the government in the early days of nicolas sarkozy 's presidency in an attempt to tighten the rules on those seeking entry to france .
its supporters said voluntary dna tests could speed up visa applications and help prove a genuine biological link between children and parents .
the law has come under intense criticism from rights groups and now the country 's immigration minister , eric besson , has said that he is unable to comply with the web of conditions in the heavily-amended text that was finally voted by parliament .
the dna tests were to be carried out at french consulates around the world .
but besson said that so many constraints had been added that he believed the law would n't work in practice .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 14.09.2009 icc 's trial of congo militia leader raises questions and concerns in drc großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lubanga , left , and his militia are accused of massive abuses the trial of militia leader thomas lubanga at the international criminal court in the hague is being heavily criticized in the democratic republic of congo .
many fear that the process is merely a show trial for the icc . much was made of the arrest of congolese militia leader thomas lubanga dyilo in 2005 on charges of recruiting and using child soldiers in the bloody congolese civil war between 1998 and 2003 .
lubanga was accused of creating an entire infrastructure around child soldiers in the ituri region and commanding forces responsible for massive human rights violations , including ethnic massacres , murder , torture , rape and mutilation in the democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- . his arrest , the first under a warrant issued by the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- , was seen as the first step in an international crackdown on seemingly out-of-control military leaders using human rights abuses as tactics in many of africa 's brutal conflicts .
his trial for war crimes in the hague , which began in january this year , appeared to show that the icc was a judicial force to be reckoned with and that a flood of arrests and convictions would follow . but as the prosecution rested its case in july , leaving lubanga 's counsel to prepare its defense case ahead of its october presentation , increasing criticism of the trial and accusations against the icc gathered pace in the drc . congolese call trial a " neo-colonial project " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the icc is making an example of lubanga many congolese accuse the historic process against lubanga as being a show trial , saying that the icc are trying one individual while many others remain free to commit more human rights abuses in congo .
some have called lubanga ’ s trial a " neo-colonial project " and that the icc is trying to set an example rather than using the case as part of an on-going quest to bring others like lubanga to justice .
they say his is a token arrest . " there 's a growing disconnection between how the icc is seen in the west and how it 's perceived in africa , " richard gowan , an africa expert at the european center for foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" it has focused almost entirely on african cases so far , so many africans believe it ’ s being used in a colonial way and western leaders haven ’ t done enough to dispel this negative impression . " anneke van woudenberg , human rights watch 's congo expert , believes that distrust in the icc has its roots in both a political agenda and public confusion in congo . " this is certainly not a sham trial and this is something which has been propagated by lubanga ’ s supporters and those loyal to him in the ituri region , " she told deutsche welle .
" there has been confusion in congo over the narrow nature of the charges .
many don ’ t understand why lubanga has been charged only with the recruitment of child soldiers when he was responsible for the ethnic murders , rape and torture which made the ituri conflict the bloodiest in the congo war .
in addition , the evidence against him is very strong . " others fear that a conviction against lubanga will be held up as a justification for the icc ’ s existence but will result in a slow decline of its pursuit of other war criminals , not only in the drc but all over africa and the world . " i do n't subscribe to these congolese assertions , other than the undeniable fact that many suspected perpetrators of war crimes in the drc remain free and in positions of authority , " andrew philip , a congo expert with amnesty international , told deutsche welle .
" amnesty welcomes the icc investigations and prosecutions , although we have encouraged and continue to encourage the icc prosecutor to extend investigations to other areas of drc than just in the ituri region , and to other crimes within its mandate . " van woudenberg also believes that many more war crimes suspects remain at large but believes that the icc will not be stopping with lubanga . " the icc will not stop with lubanga and besides , he is not alone in standing trial , " she said . " there are three other individuals charged alongside him .
but what the icc prosecutor has to do is to look past the ituri conflict and the warlords there and go after those who supported and funded lubanga .
this would lead them to the higher echelons of not only the congolese government but also those in uganda and rwanda .
for this to have a wider effect the icc must not stop at the warlord level . " critics claim un deaths accelerated lubanga pursuit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's claimed the death of un troops speeded up the pursuit it has also been alleged that lubanga was only brought to trial after he was implicated in the deaths of un troops in the drc and that otherwise , the international community would have continued to turn what some congolese believe to be a blind eye to atrocities there .
some claim that while six million people have been killed in congo over the last 12 years and a wide range of abuses recorded , it took the death of nine bangladeshi peacekeepers in the northwestern region of ituri to stir the icc into action . " the claim that the deaths of the un soldiers prompted international action is misplaced , " said van woudenberg .
" ituri was the bloodiest region where more people were killed than anywhere else in congo so this was the icc ’ s first focus in its search for war crimes suspects .
because of the violence there , there were a lot of un troops and consequently un troops died there - but it wasn ’ t the only place in congo where they died . " it is also claimed that congo 's natural resources played a part in the international community ’ s hesitation to act .
the drc is rich in natural gas and crude oil reserves , while zinc , uranium and copper deposits are also plentiful . experts say conviction would prove positive for human rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite international efforts , congo still suffers despite these claims , human rights and legal experts believe lubanga 's trial and possible conviction will have a positive effect on the overall battle for human rights and motivate the world to pursue war criminals and bring them to justice at the icc . " in terms of human rights , lubanga ’ s trial is hugely significant , " said van woudenberg . " it is the first case at the icc and a conviction would enhance the icc ’ s efforts .
if he is convicted it will be a first for a suspect involved in the recruitment and use of child soldiers .
his arrest has already has a huge effect , bringing child soldiers to international attention and making african leaders aware that this is actually a crime .
we would like to see more offences added to his charge sheet so any conviction would hopefully have as strong an impact on those areas of abuses .

many fear that the process is merely a show trial for the icc . much was made of the arrest of congolese militia leader thomas lubanga dyilo in 2005 on charges of recruiting and using child soldiers in the bloody congolese civil war between 1998 and 2003 .
lubanga was accused of creating an entire infrastructure around child soldiers in the ituri region and commanding forces responsible for massive human rights violations , including ethnic massacres , murder , torture , rape and mutilation in the democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- . his arrest , the first under a warrant issued by the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- , was seen as the first step in an international crackdown on seemingly out-of-control military leaders using human rights abuses as tactics in many of africa 's brutal conflicts .
his trial for war crimes in the hague , which began in january this year , appeared to show that the icc was a judicial force to be reckoned with and that a flood of arrests and convictions would follow . but as the prosecution rested its case in july , leaving lubanga 's counsel to prepare its defense case ahead of its october presentation , increasing criticism of the trial and accusations against the icc gathered pace in the drc . congolese call trial a " neo-colonial project " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the icc is making an example of lubanga many congolese accuse the historic process against lubanga as being a show trial , saying that the icc are trying one individual while many others remain free to commit more human rights abuses in congo .
some have called lubanga ’ s trial a " neo-colonial project " and that the icc is trying to set an example rather than using the case as part of an on-going quest to bring others like lubanga to justice .
they say his is a token arrest . " there 's a growing disconnection between how the icc is seen in the west and how it 's perceived in africa , " richard gowan , an africa expert at the european center for foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" it has focused almost entirely on african cases so far , so many africans believe it ’ s being used in a colonial way and western leaders haven ’ t done enough to dispel this negative impression . " anneke van woudenberg , human rights watch 's congo expert , believes that distrust in the icc has its roots in both a political agenda and public confusion in congo . " this is certainly not a sham trial and this is something which has been propagated by lubanga ’ s supporters and those loyal to him in the ituri region , " she told deutsche welle .
" there has been confusion in congo over the narrow nature of the charges .
many don ’ t understand why lubanga has been charged only with the recruitment of child soldiers when he was responsible for the ethnic murders , rape and torture which made the ituri conflict the bloodiest in the congo war .
in addition , the evidence against him is very strong . " others fear that a conviction against lubanga will be held up as a justification for the icc ’ s existence but will result in a slow decline of its pursuit of other war criminals , not only in the drc but all over africa and the world . " i do n't subscribe to these congolese assertions , other than the undeniable fact that many suspected perpetrators of war crimes in the drc remain free and in positions of authority , " andrew philip , a congo expert with amnesty international , told deutsche welle .
" amnesty welcomes the icc investigations and prosecutions , although we have encouraged and continue to encourage the icc prosecutor to extend investigations to other areas of drc than just in the ituri region , and to other crimes within its mandate . " van woudenberg also believes that many more war crimes suspects remain at large but believes that the icc will not be stopping with lubanga . " the icc will not stop with lubanga and besides , he is not alone in standing trial , " she said . " there are three other individuals charged alongside him .
but what the icc prosecutor has to do is to look past the ituri conflict and the warlords there and go after those who supported and funded lubanga .
this would lead them to the higher echelons of not only the congolese government but also those in uganda and rwanda .
for this to have a wider effect the icc must not stop at the warlord level . " critics claim un deaths accelerated lubanga pursuit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's claimed the death of un troops speeded up the pursuit it has also been alleged that lubanga was only brought to trial after he was implicated in the deaths of un troops in the drc and that otherwise , the international community would have continued to turn what some congolese believe to be a blind eye to atrocities there .
some claim that while six million people have been killed in congo over the last 12 years and a wide range of abuses recorded , it took the death of nine bangladeshi peacekeepers in the northwestern region of ituri to stir the icc into action . " the claim that the deaths of the un soldiers prompted international action is misplaced , " said van woudenberg .
" ituri was the bloodiest region where more people were killed than anywhere else in congo so this was the icc ’ s first focus in its search for war crimes suspects .
because of the violence there , there were a lot of un troops and consequently un troops died there - but it wasn ’ t the only place in congo where they died . " it is also claimed that congo 's natural resources played a part in the international community ’ s hesitation to act .
the drc is rich in natural gas and crude oil reserves , while zinc , uranium and copper deposits are also plentiful . experts say conviction would prove positive for human rights # b # despite these claims , human rights and legal experts believe lubanga 's trial and possible conviction will have a positive effect on the overall battle for human rights and motivate the world to pursue war criminals and bring them to justice at the icc . " in terms of human rights , lubanga ’ s trial is hugely significant , " said van woudenberg . " it is the first case at the icc and a conviction would enhance the icc ’ s efforts .
if he is convicted it will be a first for a suspect involved in the recruitment and use of child soldiers .
his arrest has already has a huge effect , bringing child soldiers to international attention and making african leaders aware that this is actually a crime .
we would like to see more offences added to his charge sheet so any conviction would hopefully have as strong an impact on those areas of abuses .

" this is certainly not a sham trial and this is something which has been propagated by lubanga ’ s supporters and those loyal to him in the ituri region , " she told deutsche welle .
" there has been confusion in congo over the narrow nature of the charges .
many don ’ t understand why lubanga has been charged only with the recruitment of child soldiers when he was responsible for the ethnic murders , rape and torture which made the ituri conflict the bloodiest in the congo war .
in addition , the evidence against him is very strong . " others fear that a conviction against lubanga will be held up as a justification for the icc ’ s existence but will result in a slow decline of its pursuit of other war criminals , not only in the drc but all over africa and the world . " i do n't subscribe to these congolese assertions , other than the undeniable fact that many suspected perpetrators of war crimes in the drc remain free and in positions of authority , " andrew philip , a congo expert with amnesty international , told deutsche welle .
" amnesty welcomes the icc investigations and prosecutions , although we have encouraged and continue to encourage the icc prosecutor to extend investigations to other areas of drc than just in the ituri region , and to other crimes within its mandate . " van woudenberg also believes that many more war crimes suspects remain at large but believes that the icc will not be stopping with lubanga . " the icc will not stop with lubanga and besides , he is not alone in standing trial , " she said . " there are three other individuals charged alongside him .
but what the icc prosecutor has to do is to look past the ituri conflict and the warlords there and go after those who supported and funded lubanga .
this would lead them to the higher echelons of not only the congolese government but also those in uganda and rwanda .
for this to have a wider effect the icc must not stop at the warlord level . " critics claim un deaths accelerated lubanga pursuit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's claimed the death of un troops speeded up the pursuit it has also been alleged that lubanga was only brought to trial after he was implicated in the deaths of un troops in the drc and that otherwise , the international community would have continued to turn what some congolese believe to be a blind eye to atrocities there .
some claim that while six million people have been killed in congo over the last 12 years and a wide range of abuses recorded , it took the death of nine bangladeshi peacekeepers in the northwestern region of ituri to stir the icc into action . " the claim that the deaths of the un soldiers prompted international action is misplaced , " said van woudenberg .
" ituri was the bloodiest region where more people were killed than anywhere else in congo so this was the icc ’ s first focus in its search for war crimes suspects .
because of the violence there , there were a lot of un troops and consequently un troops died there - but it wasn ’ t the only place in congo where they died . " it is also claimed that congo 's natural resources played a part in the international community ’ s hesitation to act .
the drc is rich in natural gas and crude oil reserves , while zinc , uranium and copper deposits are also plentiful . experts say conviction would prove positive for human rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite international efforts , congo still suffers despite these claims , human rights and legal experts believe lubanga 's trial and possible conviction will have a positive effect on the overall battle for human rights and motivate the world to pursue war criminals and bring them to justice at the icc . " in terms of human rights , lubanga ’ s trial is hugely significant , " said van woudenberg . " it is the first case at the icc and a conviction would enhance the icc ’ s efforts .
if he is convicted it will be a first for a suspect involved in the recruitment and use of child soldiers .
his arrest has already has a huge effect , bringing child soldiers to international attention and making african leaders aware that this is actually a crime .
we would like to see more offences added to his charge sheet so any conviction would hopefully have as strong an impact on those areas of abuses .

many fear that the process is merely a show trial for the icc . much was made of the arrest of congolese militia leader thomas lubanga dyilo in 2005 on charges of recruiting and using child soldiers in the bloody congolese civil war between 1998 and 2003 .
lubanga was accused of creating an entire infrastructure around child soldiers in the ituri region and commanding forces responsible for massive human rights violations , including ethnic massacres , murder , torture , rape and mutilation in the democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- . his arrest , the first under a warrant issued by the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- , was seen as the first step in an international crackdown on seemingly out-of-control military leaders using human rights abuses as tactics in many of africa 's brutal conflicts .
his trial for war crimes in the hague , which began in january this year , appeared to show that the icc was a judicial force to be reckoned with and that a flood of arrests and convictions would follow . but as the prosecution rested its case in july , leaving lubanga 's counsel to prepare its defense case ahead of its october presentation , increasing criticism of the trial and accusations against the icc gathered pace in the drc . congolese call trial a " neo-colonial project " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the icc is making an example of lubanga many congolese accuse the historic process against lubanga as being a show trial , saying that the icc are trying one individual while many others remain free to commit more human rights abuses in congo .
some have called lubanga ’ s trial a " neo-colonial project " and that the icc is trying to set an example rather than using the case as part of an on-going quest to bring others like lubanga to justice .
they say his is a token arrest . " there 's a growing disconnection between how the icc is seen in the west and how it 's perceived in africa , " richard gowan , an africa expert at the european center for foreign relations , told deutsche welle .

because of the violence there , there were a lot of un troops and consequently un troops died there - but it wasn ’ t the only place in congo where they died . " it is also claimed that congo 's natural resources played a part in the international community ’ s hesitation to act .

" in terms of human rights , lubanga ’ s trial is hugely significant , " said van woudenberg . " it is the first case at the icc and a conviction would enhance the icc ’ s efforts .
if he is convicted it will be a first for a suspect involved in the recruitment and use of child soldiers .
his arrest has already has a huge effect , bringing child soldiers to international attention and making african leaders aware that this is actually a crime .
we would like to see more offences added to his charge sheet so any conviction would hopefully have as strong an impact on those areas of abuses .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 14.09.2009 no clear victor in german tv debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 14 million people watched the debate two weeks before the german election , chancellor angela merkel and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier went head to head on sunday in a highly anticipated tv debate . with 40 percent of the german electorate still undecided , the two main candidates in the national election had everything to play for .
twenty million people watched the tv debate , hoping to see a clear winner emerge after 90 minutes .
but there was no real heated political debate from the two partners in germany 's four-year-old grand coalition .
two snap polls held after the debates came to very different conclusions .
a poll by german broadcaster zdf showed 31 percent for spd challenger steinmeier as the winner of the tv duel compared to 28 percent for merkel .
a poll conducted by forsa poll had merkel in front with 37 percent , against 35 percent for steinmeier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fireworks were missing in the chancellor debate but asked which candidate was best qualified to run the country , 58 percent chose merkel compared to 28 percent for steinmeier , a poll by broadcaster rtl showed .
dressed in dark business suits , both candidates emphasized what they had achieved in the last four years in a coalition government .
for steinmeier the stakes were higher .
the spd challenger had to score points to make up for a poor showing in the polls .
" we have achieved a lot .
quite a bit of it since the crisis and we may only have done so because there was a grand coalition , " he said .
" but we have n't managed everything , we fell short of what we could do in a number of areas because the cdu did n't go along with it .
for example on minimum wages and limiting executive pay .
that would have helped people . "
merkel agreed that they had " worked well together " but said that to turn around the economy after the financial crisis she would prefer the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- as her junior coalition partner .
" i think we could make more progress on jobs which is why i 'm appealing for a new government , " she said .
" the past has been good and you wo n't change my mind about the fact that we have got a lot done .
but i think for a democracy it 's good when grand coalitions do n't become normality . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : duel or duet ?
german foreign minister and vice chancellor steinmeier spoke of a change in political direction , emphasizing that voters had a clear alternative to a future coalition between the christian democrats and free democrats .
merkel and steinmeier both tried to claim credit for the rescue of car maker opel after canadian-austrian parts maker magna agreed last week to take over the troubled general motors ' subsidiary .
most political observers agreed that the more " presidential " chancellor merkel showed her crisis management credentials while steinmeier scored points on social equality .
much of the 90-minute debate focused on ways out of the economic crisis with merkel arguing in favor of tax cuts to stimulate demand .
merkel and steinmeier also discussed managers ' salary and bonus payments , minimum wages and nuclear energy .
the candidates voiced broad agreement on germany 's military presence in afghanistan , arguing against a premature withdrawal of troops. nrt / dpa / afp / reuters editor : john kluempers send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they fear german jobs might be saved at their expense .
now brussels is probing the deal . britain and belgium on monday urged the european commission to ensure the takeover of carmaker opel did not favor german workers because of 4.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.55 billion -rrb- in promised aid from berlin .
both countries are suspicious of the deal with canadian automotive supplier magna and its russian allies , under which all four german plants will stay open while opel 's belgian plant and one of two vauxhall sites in britain could close .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one vauxhall plant in britain may have to close " i think it is important to say that the -lrb- european -rrb- commission should not accept anything that looks like a political fix or any linkage between aid and retention of jobs in any specific plant or country , " british business secretary peter mandelson told the bbc .
the eu commission denied media reports alleging it had information that could potentially derail german state support for opel .
german weekly der spiegel had reported that the commission was in possession of documents showing that the opel plant in the belgian city of antwerp – which is threatened with closure – operates at greater efficiency than the facility in bochum , germany , which opel 's new owner magna has promised to keep .
eu law prohibits state guarantees for such a decision which – if true – would amount to economic nonsense .
belgium demands special probe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commissioner verheugen held talks with flanders ' chief minister in belgium , anger is mounting at the german decision and the flemish government has taken its argument to brussels .
kris peeters , first minister of flanders said he wants the eu 's executive commission to investigate whether german aid is in conflict with eu anti-competitive practices .
he held talks with eu industry commissioner guenter verheugen on the issue on monday .
peeters said he and verheugen agreed that commercial and economic , not political , factors were paramount in deciding which plants should survive .
" we are convinced antwerp has a fair chance .
antwerp has a better chance than certain german plants , " he told reporters , adding flanders would consider filing a complaint with the commission .
eu scrutiny adds uncertainty to magna-deal the german government said it does not anticipate problems in connection with state aid being extended to opel .
a government spokesman said the support package is in line with existing eu guidelines and does not need to be presented to brussels for special scrutiny .
but the eu commission takes a different view and has announced it will examine closely the conditions attached to german support for the carmaker .

this adds further uncertainty to the whole project , which at present consists of little more than a declaration of intent by general motors and magna .
gm in particular warned that " key issues " still need to be dealt with during the negotiations on the way to a final agreement over the sale of opel .

it has fired up simmering debates over juvenile justice , as well as moral decay and civil courage in germany .
on saturday afternoon , sept .
12 , a businessman riding a local tram stepped in to protect a group of four young teenagers from three youths , 17 and 18 years old , who were harassing the youngsters for money .
the 50-year-old man called the police from his cell phone , and offered the four , aged 13 to 15 , to accompany them off the tram at his end destination , the wealthy munich neighborhood of solln .
reminiscent of earlier attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people laid flowers where the yet-unnamed samaritan lost his life after they got off the tram , however , the older teens continued to harass the younger ones .
the good samaritan tried to intercede , and the two young men attacked him , punching and kicking him until he was unconscious on the tram platform .
according to police , he died in the hospital a few hours later .
the attackers have been taken into custody , and prosecutors have said they will likely be charged with murder .
the 18-year-old offender , who was drunk at the time of the crime , has a previous record of assault and battery , theft and extortionate theft .
the story has shocked munich and the rest of the country , and recalls a similar attack in late 2007 , when a retiree was nearly beaten to death by two youths in a subway station .
that attack became a topic in the then-hotly-contested parliamentary election in the state of hesse , with the focus on social decline and the fact that the attackers in that case had migrant backgrounds .
crime , juvenile justice on election agenda in contrast to the 2007 attack , however , the offenders in saturday 's deadly beating are both germans born in munich , noted munich prosecutor laurent lafleur .
still , the christian socialist union , the bavarian sister party to angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats , appears ready to make the case a campaign issue .
they have used it to call for stricter juvenile sentencing and increased public video surveillance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surveillance cameras caught the beating in december 2007 on monday , bavarian premier horst seehofer said the case should lead politicians to think about how to better combat crime , and that no subject should be considered taboo .
meanwhile , bavaria 's conservative interior minister joachim herrmann called for the maximum penalty for juveniles to be raised , from 10 to 15 years imprisonment .
the state 's justice minister , beate merk , also of the csu , said 18 to 21 year olds should be sentenced as adults .
currently in germany , offenders that age can also be sentenced according to milder juvenile sentencing guidelines .
horrible consequences for civil courage ?
conservative parliamentarian peter ramsauer also joined the debate .
he accused social democrats of having blocked stricter juvenile sentencing rules and said the social democrats had failed " to do the least thing " to combat juvenile crime .
in response , a spokeswoman for germany 's minister of justice , brigitte zypries , who is a social democrat , dismissed the csu demands .
despite recent events there is no need to change the law since , indeed , judges can already sentence 18 to 21 year-olds as adults , she pointed out .
and spd lawmaker dieter wiefelspuetz complained to the rheinische post newspaper that the csu had shown a " unique brand of irresponsiblity " by making policy recommendations just hours after such a horrible event .
meanwhile , police are concerned that the case could mean that people who witness crimes or dangerous situations in the future will be afraid to speak out , with potentially damaging consequences for law enforcement and the overall social fabric .
the investigators in the case say they are worried about the signal sent on crime prevention .
the victim behaved exactly as he should have , police agreed .
he got involved , was n't aggressive , and called the police - but he died anyway .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de banking -pipe- 14.09.2009 french government warns banks to start issuing loans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : small french companies are having a hard time getting banks to part with their cash the french government has told the country 's banks to keep lending to businesses and households following claims that they have become too tight with their money .
banks say they are simply trying to avoid risky loans . french banks have recently been accused of shunning small and medium-sized businesses in particular since the crisis struck - despite receiving billions of euros in state aid designed to keep credit flowing . clair service hotellerie is one of the companies affected by the banks tightened lending .
from small headquarters in paris , it provides staff for the hotel industry worldwide .
its recruits , often from eastern europe , are employed directly and trained by the company . the agency 's survival has been threatened by cash flow problems since its bank revoked the company 's overdraft facility a year ago , burdening the agency with tens of thousands of euros in extra charges . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : staffing hotels could become impossible for one french company " overnight we could not pay salaries or social charges on time , " the agency 's marketing manager , renaud chemin , said .
he added that the bank had told it to increase its capital , a suggestion the company says is impossible under current circumstances . clair service hotellerie now faces bankruptcy within three months . " since the bank will not make our situation easier , it just means the end of the company , " chemin said . such an outcome would be bound to have an impact on employees like katarina piekarmiak . she trained to be a french teacher in her native poland , but found jobs hard to come by . she replied to an advertisement from france and , since january , she has been on the agency 's books , hired out to a hotel in paris where she works as a receptionist . " in poland i was unemployed , so this work allows me to earn money and live normally , " she said .
" without this agency i 'd be unemployed again , and if i found nothing else here i 'd go back home and probably be out of work again . " banks accused of starving businesses many other small firms face problems similar to those of clair service hotellerie - especially in the restaurant industry where the banks stand accused of eschewing the whole sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : banks are becoming extremely cautious , mezziouane said " i increasingly notice banks that are more and more hesitant and more and more cautious when it comes to taking risks , " said abdellah mezziouane , general secretary of the cgpme in paris , which represents small and medium-sized businesses .
" we have concrete cases where small and medium-sized businesses can no longer find the means to finance their development and their investment , and no longer have access to funds . " a mediator appointed by the government to investigate complaints is dealing with a surge in the number of claims from small and medium-sized businesses .
last year , the banks , which had received billions of euros in state aid , agreed to increase loans by 3 percent to 4 percent .
but they have not reached that target . who is to blame ? the banks have defended themselves against charges that they are becoming too tight-fisted . some analysts have agreed with the banks , saying reduced demand caused by the recession is to blame for failure to meet lending targets . " for one or two quarters neither households nor companies were willing to borrow any more , " said cyril blesson , chief economist with seeds finance consultants . banks have perceived small businesses in particular to be too high a risk during the crisis , and tightened their lending conditions late last year , blesson added . however , with interest rates consistently low , he said he sees grounds for optimism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demand for credit is slowing picking up , some analysts said " according to the lending surveys from the central banks and especially the banque de france , we have signs of a revival in demand for credit , " blesson said .
" that is good , but now we also need banks to lend to households and companies that are willing to get indebted again . " adopt " small-business attitude " in the meantime , as many smaller companies continue to suffer , both the french government and business leaders have appealed to the banks to be more flexible . finance minister christine lagarde has written to 12 banks that have received state support , giving them until the end of the month to outline the measures they are taking to revitalize their credit policies .

overall eu gdp for the year was expected to shrink by 4 percent , which is in line with previous estimates .
eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said a sharp upturn in the global economy meant " the drop is behind us " but added that it was based mainly on stimulus measures that " would not be there forever . "
in addition , almunia warned that " unemployment levels will continue to go up and employment levels will continue to decrease , since the negative impact on the labor market has a lag of two or three quarters . "
his comments came as the latest eu figures were released , showing that the number of people unemployed in the bloc had decreased by 0.6 percent , or 1.44 million , in the second quarter when compared to the first .
call for training schemes to help unemployed the commissioner said governments should provide training schemes and promote " active labor market policies " designed to ensure that the unemployed can find a job once the economy fully recovers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the economic growth , lines at unemployment offices are expected to get longer eu governments have pumped billions of euros into their economies to mitigate the impact of the bloc 's worst recession in decades .
according to almunia , additional discretionary spending will have totalled 2.5 per cent of the eu 's gdp over the 2009-10 period .
if " automatic stabilizers " such as unemployment benefit payments are also taken into account , the size of the eu 's stimulus package will have amounted to 5.5 per cent of gdp by next year .
but with this additional spending leading to ballooning budget deficits across the eu , almunia once again urged governments to start thinking about how to rein in public spending .
" we need to define a clear , credible and coordinated ' exit strategy ' to put public finances progressively back on a sustainable path and to find the necessary resources to increase europe 's growth and jobs potential , " almunia said .
the governments of ireland and spain are among those that have already announced tax hikes in order to reduce public debt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro continues to be strong against the us dollar too early for real optimism almunia insisted that monday 's figures should be treated with " a mix of optimism and prudence , " noting that the speed of the recovery would depend on a number of factors , including the fragility of the financial sector and the impact of weak labor markets .
monday 's interim forecasts were based on the outlook for germany , spain , france , italy , the netherlands , poland and britain , which together account for 80 per cent of the eu economy .
of these , only spain was expected to remain in recession until at least 2010 .
germany is expected to lead the recovery with the greatest third-quarter gain , with italy showing " gradual improvement " and britain making a " return to positive territory before the year 's end , " almunia added. mrm / dpa / reuters / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 14.09.2009 no clear victor in german tv debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 14 million people watched the debate two weeks before the german election , chancellor angela merkel and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier went head to head on sunday in a highly anticipated tv debate . with 40 percent of the german electorate still undecided , the two main candidates in the national election had everything to play for .
twenty million people watched the tv debate , hoping to see a clear winner emerge after 90 minutes .
but there was no real heated political debate from the two partners in germany 's four-year-old grand coalition .
two snap polls held after the debates came to very different conclusions .
a poll by german broadcaster zdf showed 31 percent for spd challenger steinmeier as the winner of the tv duel compared to 28 percent for merkel .
a poll conducted by forsa poll had merkel in front with 37 percent , against 35 percent for steinmeier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fireworks were missing in the chancellor debate but asked which candidate was best qualified to run the country , 58 percent chose merkel compared to 28 percent for steinmeier , a poll by broadcaster rtl showed .
dressed in dark business suits , both candidates emphasized what they had achieved in the last four years in a coalition government .
for steinmeier the stakes were higher .
the spd challenger had to score points to make up for a poor showing in the polls .
" we have achieved a lot .
quite a bit of it since the crisis and we may only have done so because there was a grand coalition , " he said .
" but we have n't managed everything , we fell short of what we could do in a number of areas because the cdu did n't go along with it .
for example on minimum wages and limiting executive pay .
that would have helped people . "
merkel agreed that they had " worked well together " but said that to turn around the economy after the financial crisis she would prefer the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- as her junior coalition partner .
" i think we could make more progress on jobs which is why i 'm appealing for a new government , " she said .
" the past has been good and you wo n't change my mind about the fact that we have got a lot done .
but i think for a democracy it 's good when grand coalitions do n't become normality . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : duel or duet ?
german foreign minister and vice chancellor steinmeier spoke of a change in political direction , emphasizing that voters had a clear alternative to a future coalition between the christian democrats and free democrats .
merkel and steinmeier both tried to claim credit for the rescue of car maker opel after canadian-austrian parts maker magna agreed last week to take over the troubled general motors ' subsidiary .
most political observers agreed that the more " presidential " chancellor merkel showed her crisis management credentials while steinmeier scored points on social equality .
much of the 90-minute debate focused on ways out of the economic crisis with merkel arguing in favor of tax cuts to stimulate demand .
merkel and steinmeier also discussed managers ' salary and bonus payments , minimum wages and nuclear energy .
the candidates voiced broad agreement on germany 's military presence in afghanistan , arguing against a premature withdrawal of troops. nrt / dpa / afp / reuters editor : john kluempers send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 14.09.2009 eu economies could rebound , but unemployment worsens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the report , employment levels will continue to go down european union economies are expected to grow into the fourth quarter , but the recovery will be slow and officials in brussels have warned governments to brace themselves for more job losses . according to the european commission 's latest estimates , gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in the 27-nation bloc is expected to grow by 0.2 percent in the third quarter and 0.1 percent in the fourth after contracting sharply in the first half of the year .
overall eu gdp for the year was expected to shrink by 4 percent , which is in line with previous estimates .
eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said a sharp upturn in the global economy meant " the drop is behind us " but added that it was based mainly on stimulus measures that " would not be there forever . "
in addition , almunia warned that " unemployment levels will continue to go up and employment levels will continue to decrease , since the negative impact on the labor market has a lag of two or three quarters . "
his comments came as the latest eu figures were released , showing that the number of people unemployed in the bloc had decreased by 0.6 percent , or 1.44 million , in the second quarter when compared to the first .
call for training schemes to help unemployed the commissioner said governments should provide training schemes and promote " active labor market policies " designed to ensure that the unemployed can find a job once the economy fully recovers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the economic growth , lines at unemployment offices are expected to get longer eu governments have pumped billions of euros into their economies to mitigate the impact of the bloc 's worst recession in decades .
according to almunia , additional discretionary spending will have totalled 2.5 per cent of the eu 's gdp over the 2009-10 period .
if " automatic stabilizers " such as unemployment benefit payments are also taken into account , the size of the eu 's stimulus package will have amounted to 5.5 per cent of gdp by next year .
but with this additional spending leading to ballooning budget deficits across the eu , almunia once again urged governments to start thinking about how to rein in public spending .
" we need to define a clear , credible and coordinated ' exit strategy ' to put public finances progressively back on a sustainable path and to find the necessary resources to increase europe 's growth and jobs potential , " almunia said .
the governments of ireland and spain are among those that have already announced tax hikes in order to reduce public debt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro continues to be strong against the us dollar too early for real optimism almunia insisted that monday 's figures should be treated with " a mix of optimism and prudence , " noting that the speed of the recovery would depend on a number of factors , including the fragility of the financial sector and the impact of weak labor markets .
monday 's interim forecasts were based on the outlook for germany , spain , france , italy , the netherlands , poland and britain , which together account for 80 per cent of the eu economy .
of these , only spain was expected to remain in recession until at least 2010 .
germany is expected to lead the recovery with the greatest third-quarter gain , with italy showing " gradual improvement " and britain making a " return to positive territory before the year 's end , " almunia added. mrm / dpa / reuters / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 14.09.2009 eu economies could rebound , but unemployment worsens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the report , employment levels will continue to go down european union economies are expected to grow into the fourth quarter , but the recovery will be slow and officials in brussels have warned governments to brace themselves for more job losses . according to the european commission 's latest estimates , gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in the 27-nation bloc is expected to grow by 0.2 percent in the third quarter and 0.1 percent in the fourth after contracting sharply in the first half of the year .
overall eu gdp for the year was expected to shrink by 4 percent , which is in line with previous estimates .
eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said a sharp upturn in the global economy meant " the drop is behind us " but added that it was based mainly on stimulus measures that " would not be there forever . "
in addition , almunia warned that " unemployment levels will continue to go up and employment levels will continue to decrease , since the negative impact on the labor market has a lag of two or three quarters . "
his comments came as the latest eu figures were released , showing that the number of people unemployed in the bloc had decreased by 0.6 percent , or 1.44 million , in the second quarter when compared to the first .
call for training schemes to help unemployed the commissioner said governments should provide training schemes and promote " active labor market policies " designed to ensure that the unemployed can find a job once the economy fully recovers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the economic growth , lines at unemployment offices are expected to get longer eu governments have pumped billions of euros into their economies to mitigate the impact of the bloc 's worst recession in decades .
according to almunia , additional discretionary spending will have totalled 2.5 per cent of the eu 's gdp over the 2009-10 period .
if " automatic stabilizers " such as unemployment benefit payments are also taken into account , the size of the eu 's stimulus package will have amounted to 5.5 per cent of gdp by next year .
but with this additional spending leading to ballooning budget deficits across the eu , almunia once again urged governments to start thinking about how to rein in public spending .
" we need to define a clear , credible and coordinated ' exit strategy ' to put public finances progressively back on a sustainable path and to find the necessary resources to increase europe 's growth and jobs potential , " almunia said .
the governments of ireland and spain are among those that have already announced tax hikes in order to reduce public debt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro continues to be strong against the us dollar too early for real optimism almunia insisted that monday 's figures should be treated with " a mix of optimism and prudence , " noting that the speed of the recovery would depend on a number of factors , including the fragility of the financial sector and the impact of weak labor markets .
monday 's interim forecasts were based on the outlook for germany , spain , france , italy , the netherlands , poland and britain , which together account for 80 per cent of the eu economy .
of these , only spain was expected to remain in recession until at least 2010 .
germany is expected to lead the recovery with the greatest third-quarter gain , with italy showing " gradual improvement " and britain making a " return to positive territory before the year 's end , " almunia added. mrm / dpa / reuters / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

overall eu gdp for the year was expected to shrink by 4 percent , which is in line with previous estimates .
eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said a sharp upturn in the global economy meant " the drop is behind us " but added that it was based mainly on stimulus measures that " would not be there forever . "
in addition , almunia warned that " unemployment levels will continue to go up and employment levels will continue to decrease , since the negative impact on the labor market has a lag of two or three quarters . "
his comments came as the latest eu figures were released , showing that the number of people unemployed in the bloc had decreased by 0.6 percent , or 1.44 million , in the second quarter when compared to the first .
call for training schemes to help unemployed the commissioner said governments should provide training schemes and promote " active labor market policies " designed to ensure that the unemployed can find a job once the economy fully recovers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the economic growth , lines at unemployment offices are expected to get longer eu governments have pumped billions of euros into their economies to mitigate the impact of the bloc 's worst recession in decades .
according to almunia , additional discretionary spending will have totalled 2.5 per cent of the eu 's gdp over the 2009-10 period .
if " automatic stabilizers " such as unemployment benefit payments are also taken into account , the size of the eu 's stimulus package will have amounted to 5.5 per cent of gdp by next year .
but with this additional spending leading to ballooning budget deficits across the eu , almunia once again urged governments to start thinking about how to rein in public spending .
" we need to define a clear , credible and coordinated ' exit strategy ' to put public finances progressively back on a sustainable path and to find the necessary resources to increase europe 's growth and jobs potential , " almunia said .
the governments of ireland and spain are among those that have already announced tax hikes in order to reduce public debt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro continues to be strong against the us dollar too early for real optimism almunia insisted that monday 's figures should be treated with " a mix of optimism and prudence , " noting that the speed of the recovery would depend on a number of factors , including the fragility of the financial sector and the impact of weak labor markets .
monday 's interim forecasts were based on the outlook for germany , spain , france , italy , the netherlands , poland and britain , which together account for 80 per cent of the eu economy .
of these , only spain was expected to remain in recession until at least 2010 .
germany is expected to lead the recovery with the greatest third-quarter gain , with italy showing " gradual improvement " and britain making a " return to positive territory before the year 's end , " almunia added. mrm / dpa / reuters / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de banking -pipe- 14.09.2009 french government warns banks to start issuing loans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : small french companies are having a hard time getting banks to part with their cash the french government has told the country 's banks to keep lending to businesses and households following claims that they have become too tight with their money .
banks say they are simply trying to avoid risky loans . french banks have recently been accused of shunning small and medium-sized businesses in particular since the crisis struck - despite receiving billions of euros in state aid designed to keep credit flowing . clair service hotellerie is one of the companies affected by the banks tightened lending .
from small headquarters in paris , it provides staff for the hotel industry worldwide .
its recruits , often from eastern europe , are employed directly and trained by the company . the agency 's survival has been threatened by cash flow problems since its bank revoked the company 's overdraft facility a year ago , burdening the agency with tens of thousands of euros in extra charges . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : staffing hotels could become impossible for one french company " overnight we could not pay salaries or social charges on time , " the agency 's marketing manager , renaud chemin , said .
he added that the bank had told it to increase its capital , a suggestion the company says is impossible under current circumstances . clair service hotellerie now faces bankruptcy within three months . " since the bank will not make our situation easier , it just means the end of the company , " chemin said . such an outcome would be bound to have an impact on employees like katarina piekarmiak . she trained to be a french teacher in her native poland , but found jobs hard to come by . she replied to an advertisement from france and , since january , she has been on the agency 's books , hired out to a hotel in paris where she works as a receptionist . " in poland i was unemployed , so this work allows me to earn money and live normally , " she said .
" without this agency i 'd be unemployed again , and if i found nothing else here i 'd go back home and probably be out of work again . " banks accused of starving businesses many other small firms face problems similar to those of clair service hotellerie - especially in the restaurant industry where the banks stand accused of eschewing the whole sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : banks are becoming extremely cautious , mezziouane said " i increasingly notice banks that are more and more hesitant and more and more cautious when it comes to taking risks , " said abdellah mezziouane , general secretary of the cgpme in paris , which represents small and medium-sized businesses .
" we have concrete cases where small and medium-sized businesses can no longer find the means to finance their development and their investment , and no longer have access to funds . " a mediator appointed by the government to investigate complaints is dealing with a surge in the number of claims from small and medium-sized businesses .

" that was an ideal biotope for my hunt for disasters , " he told german news magazine spiegel in an interview in 1995 . the burgtheater guest performance is being staged again in munich 's bayerische staatsoper on monday , sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 14.09.2009 no clear victor in german tv debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 14 million people watched the debate two weeks before the german election , chancellor angela merkel and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier went head to head on sunday in a highly anticipated tv debate . with 40 percent of the german electorate still undecided , the two main candidates in the national election had everything to play for .
twenty million people watched the tv debate , hoping to see a clear winner emerge after 90 minutes .
but there was no real heated political debate from the two partners in germany 's four-year-old grand coalition .
two snap polls held after the debates came to very different conclusions .
a poll by german broadcaster zdf showed 31 percent for spd challenger steinmeier as the winner of the tv duel compared to 28 percent for merkel .
a poll conducted by forsa poll had merkel in front with 37 percent , against 35 percent for steinmeier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fireworks were missing in the chancellor debate but asked which candidate was best qualified to run the country , 58 percent chose merkel compared to 28 percent for steinmeier , a poll by broadcaster rtl showed .
dressed in dark business suits , both candidates emphasized what they had achieved in the last four years in a coalition government .
for steinmeier the stakes were higher .
the spd challenger had to score points to make up for a poor showing in the polls .
" we have achieved a lot .
quite a bit of it since the crisis and we may only have done so because there was a grand coalition , " he said .
" but we have n't managed everything , we fell short of what we could do in a number of areas because the cdu did n't go along with it .
for example on minimum wages and limiting executive pay .
that would have helped people . "
merkel agreed that they had " worked well together " but said that to turn around the economy after the financial crisis she would prefer the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- as her junior coalition partner .
" i think we could make more progress on jobs which is why i 'm appealing for a new government , " she said .
" the past has been good and you wo n't change my mind about the fact that we have got a lot done .
but i think for a democracy it 's good when grand coalitions do n't become normality . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : duel or duet ?
german foreign minister and vice chancellor steinmeier spoke of a change in political direction , emphasizing that voters had a clear alternative to a future coalition between the christian democrats and free democrats .
merkel and steinmeier both tried to claim credit for the rescue of car maker opel after canadian-austrian parts maker magna agreed last week to take over the troubled general motors ' subsidiary .
most political observers agreed that the more " presidential " chancellor merkel showed her crisis management credentials while steinmeier scored points on social equality .
much of the 90-minute debate focused on ways out of the economic crisis with merkel arguing in favor of tax cuts to stimulate demand .
merkel and steinmeier also discussed managers ' salary and bonus payments , minimum wages and nuclear energy .
the candidates voiced broad agreement on germany 's military presence in afghanistan , arguing against a premature withdrawal of troops. nrt / dpa / afp / reuters editor : john kluempers send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it has fired up simmering debates over juvenile justice , as well as moral decay and civil courage in germany .
on saturday afternoon , sept .
12 , a businessman riding a local tram stepped in to protect a group of four young teenagers from three youths , 17 and 18 years old , who were harassing the youngsters for money .
the 50-year-old man called the police from his cell phone , and offered the four , aged 13 to 15 , to accompany them off the tram at his end destination , the wealthy munich neighborhood of solln .
reminiscent of earlier attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people laid flowers where the yet-unnamed samaritan lost his life after they got off the tram , however , the older teens continued to harass the younger ones .
the good samaritan tried to intercede , and the two young men attacked him , punching and kicking him until he was unconscious on the tram platform .
according to police , he died in the hospital a few hours later .
the attackers have been taken into custody , and prosecutors have said they will likely be charged with murder .
the 18-year-old offender , who was drunk at the time of the crime , has a previous record of assault and battery , theft and extortionate theft .
the story has shocked munich and the rest of the country , and recalls a similar attack in late 2007 , when a retiree was nearly beaten to death by two youths in a subway station .
that attack became a topic in the then-hotly-contested parliamentary election in the state of hesse , with the focus on social decline and the fact that the attackers in that case had migrant backgrounds .
crime , juvenile justice on election agenda in contrast to the 2007 attack , however , the offenders in saturday 's deadly beating are both germans born in munich , noted munich prosecutor laurent lafleur .
still , the christian socialist union , the bavarian sister party to angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats , appears ready to make the case a campaign issue .
they have used it to call for stricter juvenile sentencing and increased public video surveillance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surveillance cameras caught the beating in december 2007 on monday , bavarian premier horst seehofer said the case should lead politicians to think about how to better combat crime , and that no subject should be considered taboo .
meanwhile , bavaria 's conservative interior minister joachim herrmann called for the maximum penalty for juveniles to be raised , from 10 to 15 years imprisonment .
the state 's justice minister , beate merk , also of the csu , said 18 to 21 year olds should be sentenced as adults .
currently in germany , offenders that age can also be sentenced according to milder juvenile sentencing guidelines .
horrible consequences for civil courage ?
conservative parliamentarian peter ramsauer also joined the debate .
he accused social democrats of having blocked stricter juvenile sentencing rules and said the social democrats had failed " to do the least thing " to combat juvenile crime .
in response , a spokeswoman for germany 's minister of justice , brigitte zypries , who is a social democrat , dismissed the csu demands .
despite recent events there is no need to change the law since , indeed , judges can already sentence 18 to 21 year-olds as adults , she pointed out .
and spd lawmaker dieter wiefelspuetz complained to the rheinische post newspaper that the csu had shown a " unique brand of irresponsiblity " by making policy recommendations just hours after such a horrible event .
meanwhile , police are concerned that the case could mean that people who witness crimes or dangerous situations in the future will be afraid to speak out , with potentially damaging consequences for law enforcement and the overall social fabric .
the investigators in the case say they are worried about the signal sent on crime prevention .
the victim behaved exactly as he should have , police agreed .
he got involved , was n't aggressive , and called the police - but he died anyway .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 14.09.2009 germany considers plan for 40 new offshore wind farms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind energy could account for 16 percent of all energy used in the eu by 2020 , one group said plans to build up to 40 offshore wind farms could lead to thousands of new jobs in the renewable energy sector and lower germany 's dependence on nuclear energy , according to transport minister wolfgang tiefensee . the wind farms would be built in german waters more than 12 miles off the coast and consists of some 2,500 turbines .
together they would produce more than 12,000 megawatts of energy , which could supply power to 12 million households , the transport ministry said . " this would bring us closer to our goal of producing 25,000 megawatts offshore by 2030 , " tiefensee told the daily hamburger abendblatt . he added that the ministry had approved some of the 2,500 applications received by his office for wind turbines in the north and baltic seas .
tiefensee told the paper he would present a proposal for the wind farms at a cabinet meeting with chancellor angela merkel on wednesday . costs for the new wind farms have not yet been established , a spokesperson for the transport ministry told the hamburg newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in germany are wondering where and how to store radioactive waste the move comes as politicians debate the continued use of nuclear power in germany and how to deal with the radioactive waste it generates . " the current discussion about the nuclear waste depot gorleben shows once again very clearly that we need to expand renewable energy , " said tiefensee , who is a member of the center-left social democrats . dozens of farms already approved of the 40 wind farms planned , 30 would be in the north sea and 10 in the baltic sea .
twenty-two have already received government approval and berlin intends to set aside some 100 square kilometers -lrb- 39 square miles -rrb- for offshore power projects .
most will be built near the east frisian islands . " we are securing and creating jobs in one of the markets of the future , " tiefensee said , adding that wind farms could mean 30,000 jobs in germany .
" we want germany to be at the fore of this technology . " approval has already been given for 22 offshore wind farms in the north sea and another three in the baltic with a total of 1,800 turbines , according to christian dahmke of germany 's federal maritime and hydrographic agency .

his accomplices , assad sawar , 29 , and tanvir hussain , 28 , received minimum sentences of 36 and 32 years , respectively . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from left , abdulla ahmed ali , assad sawar , and tanvir hussain addressing ali during sentencing , judge richard henriques said , " i have concluded you are a driven and determined extremist with boundless energy and an ambition to lead a terrorist outrage of boundless proportion .
by this conspiracy you sought the attention of the world , and you now have it . "
the thwarted suicide attack , intercepted by british intelligence services in august 2006 , would have been the " worst atrocity since 9/11 and woiuld have inflicted heavy casualties in the name of islam , " the court in london heard last week . all three men , though born in britain , had close links with pakistan .
four other men were found not guilty of involvement in the plot .
henriques said the defendants had " embraced islamic extremism and it is that burning extremism that has motivated you throughout this conspiracy and is likely to drive you again . "
trial almost did n't happen at a trial a year ago , ali , hussain and sarwar were found guilty of conspiracy to murder involving liquid bombs - but that jury could not decide whether their plans extended to detonating the devices on planes . an appeal by britain 's crown prosecution service -lrb- cps -rrb- led to a retrial , with the jury concluding that such a terror plot did exist , ultimately leading to last monday 's convictions at woolwich crown court in london . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as ringleader of the group , ali was given a minimum sentence of 40 years during the trial , the court was told that ali picked out seven flights to san francisco , toronto , montreal , washington , new york and chicago that departed from london 's heathrow airport within a two-and-a-half hour period .
jets were operated by united airlines , american airlines and air canada .
the prosecution alleged that the attack would have caused " mass murder on an unimaginable scale " and would have " exceeded the carnage " of the september 11 attacks in the us in 2001 . plan foiled thanks to british surveillance reports said the security services , courts and police had spent a total of 35 million pounds -lrb- 39 million euros , $ 57 million -rrb- on foiling the plot and bringing the men to justice .
undercover surveillance officers had watched ali converting a flat in east london into a bomb factory , which was also used to record suicide videos in which the british public was warned to expect " floods of martyr operations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan to blow up the jets led to a worldwide ban on most liquids in hand luggage according to prosecutors at the trial last week , the three men plotted to drill holes in the bottom of plastic drinks bottles , drain the contents and inject liquid explosive with a syringe before sealing the holes with glue .
that way the bottle tops would remain unopened .
the home-made liquid explosive was to be concocted from hydrogen peroxide and tang , a soft drink available in powdered form .
when mixed with such an organic material at an appropriate strength , hydrogen peroxide has explosive qualities .
the bottles would be detonated using the substance htmd , concealed in regular aa 1.5-volt batteries .
the detonator would have been ignited using a metal wire or a small light bulb , the court heard .

" it could n't have been a duel anyway , " wrote die welt daily . " for one thing , the need for ideological debate seems to be exhausted in this country .
and for another , the two politicians could not hit out at one another because it is not their style .
another reason is that they have worked together for four years in a coalition government they managed in harmony .
they agree on many issues , so they could not have credibly portrayed being at odds with each other .
the debate ended with a balanced 1:1 . "
" and why should the politicians badmouth the work they have been doing together for the past four years , " asked the sueddeutsche zeitung paper , " they may have to rule together again after -lsb- the -rsb- sept .
27 -lsb- election -rsb- .
the format of a duel is not appropriate to convey political content . "
the berliner zeitung wrote : " steinmeier only managed to attack for a few moments .
he was obviously lacking the necessary brutality and ruthlessness in view of the past four years in a joint government .
voters who wanted to find out what the world would look like with a coalition of christian democrats and free democrats , or under the leadership of the social democrats , did not learn a thing in the debate . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two are anxious to set themselves apart mass-circulation daily bild had the following assessment : " after a 90-minute ' duel , ' we are none the wiser .
this was not an exciting duel ; it was shop talk between the chancellor and her deputy . and this discussion was a signal : neither merkel nor steinmeier would mind continuing the grand coalition . "
" it seems as if merkel and steinmeier have forged a quiet alliance for the last weeks of the election campaign , even as their coalition government grows increasingly less popular among voters , " wrote the nordsee-zeitung from the country 's north .
" expectations for the debate were not high in the first place ; there was no real verbal sparring , there were no new facts : somehow , they do appear to still like each other . "

overall eu gdp for the year was expected to shrink by 4 percent , which is in line with previous estimates .
eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said a sharp upturn in the global economy meant " the drop is behind us " but added that it was based mainly on stimulus measures that " would not be there forever . "
in addition , almunia warned that " unemployment levels will continue to go up and employment levels will continue to decrease , since the negative impact on the labor market has a lag of two or three quarters . "
his comments came as the latest eu figures were released , showing that the number of people unemployed in the bloc had decreased by 0.6 percent , or 1.44 million , in the second quarter when compared to the first .
call for training schemes to help unemployed the commissioner said governments should provide training schemes and promote " active labor market policies " designed to ensure that the unemployed can find a job once the economy fully recovers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the economic growth , lines at unemployment offices are expected to get longer eu governments have pumped billions of euros into their economies to mitigate the impact of the bloc 's worst recession in decades .
according to almunia , additional discretionary spending will have totalled 2.5 per cent of the eu 's gdp over the 2009-10 period .
if " automatic stabilizers " such as unemployment benefit payments are also taken into account , the size of the eu 's stimulus package will have amounted to 5.5 per cent of gdp by next year .
but with this additional spending leading to ballooning budget deficits across the eu , almunia once again urged governments to start thinking about how to rein in public spending .
" we need to define a clear , credible and coordinated ' exit strategy ' to put public finances progressively back on a sustainable path and to find the necessary resources to increase europe 's growth and jobs potential , " almunia said .
the governments of ireland and spain are among those that have already announced tax hikes in order to reduce public debt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro continues to be strong against the us dollar too early for real optimism almunia insisted that monday 's figures should be treated with " a mix of optimism and prudence , " noting that the speed of the recovery would depend on a number of factors , including the fragility of the financial sector and the impact of weak labor markets .
monday 's interim forecasts were based on the outlook for germany , spain , france , italy , the netherlands , poland and britain , which together account for 80 per cent of the eu economy .
of these , only spain was expected to remain in recession until at least 2010 .
germany is expected to lead the recovery with the greatest third-quarter gain , with italy showing " gradual improvement " and britain making a " return to positive territory before the year 's end , " almunia added. mrm / dpa / reuters / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

henriques said the defendants had " embraced islamic extremism and it is that burning extremism that has motivated you throughout this conspiracy and is likely to drive you again . "
trial almost did n't happen at a trial a year ago , ali , hussain and sarwar were found guilty of conspiracy to murder involving liquid bombs - but that jury could not decide whether their plans extended to detonating the devices on planes . an appeal by britain 's crown prosecution service -lrb- cps -rrb- led to a retrial , with the jury concluding that such a terror plot did exist , ultimately leading to last monday 's convictions at woolwich crown court in london . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as ringleader of the group , ali was given a minimum sentence of 40 years during the trial , the court was told that ali picked out seven flights to san francisco , toronto , montreal , washington , new york and chicago that departed from london 's heathrow airport within a two-and-a-half hour period .

" that was an ideal biotope for my hunt for disasters , " he told german news magazine spiegel in an interview in 1995 . the burgtheater guest performance is being staged again in munich 's bayerische staatsoper on monday , sept .

together they would produce more than 12,000 megawatts of energy , which could supply power to 12 million households , the transport ministry said . " this would bring us closer to our goal of producing 25,000 megawatts offshore by 2030 , " tiefensee told the daily hamburger abendblatt . he added that the ministry had approved some of the 2,500 applications received by his office for wind turbines in the north and baltic seas .
tiefensee told the paper he would present a proposal for the wind farms at a cabinet meeting with chancellor angela merkel on wednesday . costs for the new wind farms have not yet been established , a spokesperson for the transport ministry told the hamburg newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in germany are wondering where and how to store radioactive waste the move comes as politicians debate the continued use of nuclear power in germany and how to deal with the radioactive waste it generates .

technical problems have been a main challenge . the head of the european wind energy association , christian kjaer , on monday also called on eu governments to give a clear signal of their support to the wind power industry . up to 16 percent of all energy consumed in the eu could come from wind farms by 2020 .

" it could n't have been a duel anyway , " wrote die welt daily . " for one thing , the need for ideological debate seems to be exhausted in this country .
and for another , the two politicians could not hit out at one another because it is not their style .
another reason is that they have worked together for four years in a coalition government they managed in harmony .
they agree on many issues , so they could not have credibly portrayed being at odds with each other .
the debate ended with a balanced 1:1 . "
" and why should the politicians badmouth the work they have been doing together for the past four years , " asked the sueddeutsche zeitung paper , " they may have to rule together again after -lsb- the -rsb- sept .
27 -lsb- election -rsb- .
the format of a duel is not appropriate to convey political content . "
the berliner zeitung wrote : " steinmeier only managed to attack for a few moments .
he was obviously lacking the necessary brutality and ruthlessness in view of the past four years in a joint government .
voters who wanted to find out what the world would look like with a coalition of christian democrats and free democrats , or under the leadership of the social democrats , did not learn a thing in the debate . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two are anxious to set themselves apart mass-circulation daily bild had the following assessment : " after a 90-minute ' duel , ' we are none the wiser .
this was not an exciting duel ; it was shop talk between the chancellor and her deputy . and this discussion was a signal : neither merkel nor steinmeier would mind continuing the grand coalition . "
" it seems as if merkel and steinmeier have forged a quiet alliance for the last weeks of the election campaign , even as their coalition government grows increasingly less popular among voters , " wrote the nordsee-zeitung from the country 's north .
" expectations for the debate were not high in the first place ; there was no real verbal sparring , there were no new facts : somehow , they do appear to still like each other . "
bonn 's general-anzeiger summed it up : " the two get along well , and that was evident last night . " db / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now brussels is probing the deal . britain and belgium on monday urged the european commission to ensure the takeover of carmaker opel did not favor german workers because of 4.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.55 billion -rrb- in promised aid from berlin .
both countries are suspicious of the deal with canadian automotive supplier magna and its russian allies , under which all four german plants will stay open while opel 's belgian plant and one of two vauxhall sites in britain could close .

the eu commission denied media reports alleging it had information that could potentially derail german state support for opel .
german weekly der spiegel had reported that the commission was in possession of documents showing that the opel plant in the belgian city of antwerp – which is threatened with closure – operates at greater efficiency than the facility in bochum , germany , which opel 's new owner magna has promised to keep .

he held talks with eu industry commissioner guenter verheugen on the issue on monday .
peeters said he and verheugen agreed that commercial and economic , not political , factors were paramount in deciding which plants should survive .
" we are convinced antwerp has a fair chance .
antwerp has a better chance than certain german plants , " he told reporters , adding flanders would consider filing a complaint with the commission .
eu scrutiny adds uncertainty to magna-deal the german government said it does not anticipate problems in connection with state aid being extended to opel .
a government spokesman said the support package is in line with existing eu guidelines and does not need to be presented to brussels for special scrutiny .
but the eu commission takes a different view and has announced it will examine closely the conditions attached to german support for the carmaker .
eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said that the rules of the european market do not tolerate protectionism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : september 10 : gm managers announced what now appears to have been little more than a declaration of intent however , the required documentation is not expected to arrive from berlin before the german general election at the end of september .
the magna deal , therefore , faces the prospect of a potential veto from brussels for another few weeks .
this adds further uncertainty to the whole project , which at present consists of little more than a declaration of intent by general motors and magna .
gm in particular warned that " key issues " still need to be dealt with during the negotiations on the way to a final agreement over the sale of opel .
germany hosts opel meeting given these challenges , the german government is trying to move swiftly and has announced a meeting will be held on tuesday in berlin , at which european states with opel factories are invited to discuss and agree on the disbursement of state funds for restructuring measures .
but agreement , it seems , does not even exist over who is invited .

a government spokesman said the support package is in line with existing eu guidelines and does not need to be presented to brussels for special scrutiny .
but the eu commission takes a different view and has announced it will examine closely the conditions attached to german support for the carmaker .
eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said that the rules of the european market do not tolerate protectionism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : september 10 : gm managers announced what now appears to have been little more than a declaration of intent however , the required documentation is not expected to arrive from berlin before the german general election at the end of september .
the magna deal , therefore , faces the prospect of a potential veto from brussels for another few weeks .
this adds further uncertainty to the whole project , which at present consists of little more than a declaration of intent by general motors and magna .
gm in particular warned that " key issues " still need to be dealt with during the negotiations on the way to a final agreement over the sale of opel .
germany hosts opel meeting given these challenges , the german government is trying to move swiftly and has announced a meeting will be held on tuesday in berlin , at which european states with opel factories are invited to discuss and agree on the disbursement of state funds for restructuring measures .

" it could n't have been a duel anyway , " wrote die welt daily . " for one thing , the need for ideological debate seems to be exhausted in this country .
and for another , the two politicians could not hit out at one another because it is not their style .
another reason is that they have worked together for four years in a coalition government they managed in harmony .
they agree on many issues , so they could not have credibly portrayed being at odds with each other .
the debate ended with a balanced 1:1 . "
" and why should the politicians badmouth the work they have been doing together for the past four years , " asked the sueddeutsche zeitung paper , " they may have to rule together again after -lsb- the -rsb- sept .
27 -lsb- election -rsb- .
the format of a duel is not appropriate to convey political content . "
the berliner zeitung wrote : " steinmeier only managed to attack for a few moments .
he was obviously lacking the necessary brutality and ruthlessness in view of the past four years in a joint government .
voters who wanted to find out what the world would look like with a coalition of christian democrats and free democrats , or under the leadership of the social democrats , did not learn a thing in the debate . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two are anxious to set themselves apart mass-circulation daily bild had the following assessment : " after a 90-minute ' duel , ' we are none the wiser .
this was not an exciting duel ; it was shop talk between the chancellor and her deputy . and this discussion was a signal : neither merkel nor steinmeier would mind continuing the grand coalition . "
" it seems as if merkel and steinmeier have forged a quiet alliance for the last weeks of the election campaign , even as their coalition government grows increasingly less popular among voters , " wrote the nordsee-zeitung from the country 's north .
" expectations for the debate were not high in the first place ; there was no real verbal sparring , there were no new facts : somehow , they do appear to still like each other . "
bonn 's general-anzeiger summed it up : " the two get along well , and that was evident last night . " db / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they fear german jobs might be saved at their expense .
now brussels is probing the deal . britain and belgium on monday urged the european commission to ensure the takeover of carmaker opel did not favor german workers because of 4.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.55 billion -rrb- in promised aid from berlin .
both countries are suspicious of the deal with canadian automotive supplier magna and its russian allies , under which all four german plants will stay open while opel 's belgian plant and one of two vauxhall sites in britain could close .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one vauxhall plant in britain may have to close " i think it is important to say that the -lrb- european -rrb- commission should not accept anything that looks like a political fix or any linkage between aid and retention of jobs in any specific plant or country , " british business secretary peter mandelson told the bbc .
the eu commission denied media reports alleging it had information that could potentially derail german state support for opel .
german weekly der spiegel had reported that the commission was in possession of documents showing that the opel plant in the belgian city of antwerp – which is threatened with closure – operates at greater efficiency than the facility in bochum , germany , which opel 's new owner magna has promised to keep .
eu law prohibits state guarantees for such a decision which – if true – would amount to economic nonsense .
belgium demands special probe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commissioner verheugen held talks with flanders ' chief minister in belgium , anger is mounting at the german decision and the flemish government has taken its argument to brussels .
kris peeters , first minister of flanders said he wants the eu 's executive commission to investigate whether german aid is in conflict with eu anti-competitive practices .
he held talks with eu industry commissioner guenter verheugen on the issue on monday .
peeters said he and verheugen agreed that commercial and economic , not political , factors were paramount in deciding which plants should survive .
" we are convinced antwerp has a fair chance .
antwerp has a better chance than certain german plants , " he told reporters , adding flanders would consider filing a complaint with the commission .

banks say they are simply trying to avoid risky loans . french banks have recently been accused of shunning small and medium-sized businesses in particular since the crisis struck - despite receiving billions of euros in state aid designed to keep credit flowing . clair service hotellerie is one of the companies affected by the banks tightened lending .
from small headquarters in paris , it provides staff for the hotel industry worldwide .
its recruits , often from eastern europe , are employed directly and trained by the company . the agency 's survival has been threatened by cash flow problems since its bank revoked the company 's overdraft facility a year ago , burdening the agency with tens of thousands of euros in extra charges . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : staffing hotels could become impossible for one french company " overnight we could not pay salaries or social charges on time , " the agency 's marketing manager , renaud chemin , said .
he added that the bank had told it to increase its capital , a suggestion the company says is impossible under current circumstances . clair service hotellerie now faces bankruptcy within three months . " since the bank will not make our situation easier , it just means the end of the company , " chemin said . such an outcome would be bound to have an impact on employees like katarina piekarmiak . she trained to be a french teacher in her native poland , but found jobs hard to come by . she replied to an advertisement from france and , since january , she has been on the agency 's books , hired out to a hotel in paris where she works as a receptionist . " in poland i was unemployed , so this work allows me to earn money and live normally , " she said .
" without this agency i 'd be unemployed again , and if i found nothing else here i 'd go back home and probably be out of work again . " banks accused of starving businesses many other small firms face problems similar to those of clair service hotellerie - especially in the restaurant industry where the banks stand accused of eschewing the whole sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : banks are becoming extremely cautious , mezziouane said " i increasingly notice banks that are more and more hesitant and more and more cautious when it comes to taking risks , " said abdellah mezziouane , general secretary of the cgpme in paris , which represents small and medium-sized businesses .
" we have concrete cases where small and medium-sized businesses can no longer find the means to finance their development and their investment , and no longer have access to funds . " a mediator appointed by the government to investigate complaints is dealing with a surge in the number of claims from small and medium-sized businesses .
last year , the banks , which had received billions of euros in state aid , agreed to increase loans by 3 percent to 4 percent .
but they have not reached that target . who is to blame ? the banks have defended themselves against charges that they are becoming too tight-fisted . some analysts have agreed with the banks , saying reduced demand caused by the recession is to blame for failure to meet lending targets . " for one or two quarters neither households nor companies were willing to borrow any more , " said cyril blesson , chief economist with seeds finance consultants . banks have perceived small businesses in particular to be too high a risk during the crisis , and tightened their lending conditions late last year , blesson added . however , with interest rates consistently low , he said he sees grounds for optimism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demand for credit is slowing picking up , some analysts said " according to the lending surveys from the central banks and especially the banque de france , we have signs of a revival in demand for credit , " blesson said .
" that is good , but now we also need banks to lend to households and companies that are willing to get indebted again . " adopt " small-business attitude " in the meantime , as many smaller companies continue to suffer , both the french government and business leaders have appealed to the banks to be more flexible . finance minister christine lagarde has written to 12 banks that have received state support , giving them until the end of the month to outline the measures they are taking to revitalize their credit policies . " i ask the french banking sector to adopt the attitude of small and medium sized companies , " laurence parisot , head of the medef employers ' organization , said in a recent radio interview .
" it is the most difficult time for them because for months they 've had order books falling by 30 , 40 , 50 percent . a large company can get by ; a small business ca n't .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 14.09.2009 a year after lehman collapse , bankers rebuild their bubble großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehman is gone but bankers are back in business banks are raking in profits again , thanks partly to state bailouts , but remain hesitant about extending credit .
now governments have prominent roles in the financial sector and are under pressure to change the rules . the casino is back in business , trading and speculating on the financial markets are on their way to reach pre-crisis levels .
banks are again posting profits and managers are again looking forward to big bonuses .
a year after us investment bank lehman brothers filed for bankruptcy , not much has changed - at least not in the sector that triggered the global financial crisis . new data suggest that after passing the crisis on to the economy beyond the walls of wall street , the financial markets have yet again managed to close the shutters to the real world . the bank for international settlements , the world 's biggest central bank body , reported sunday that interbank money markets are recovering to levels not seen since early 2008 .
the bank said that shows financial institutions are once again dealing with one another , but that they also remain hesitant to extend credit to businesses . reduced risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's central bank chief axel weber says : " growth not sustainable yet . "
germany 's federal bank chief axel weber , however , said the somewhat brighter general economic outlook is in part due to the government bailout of financial markets , which has contributed to " systemic risk reduction . " " aggressive monetary policy and huge economic stimulus packages " have also helped improve prospects , he said , but added that such measures make it hard to know if growth will be self-sustainable . but while bankers are benefiting from rebounding markets for the moment , the impact of the crisis on global economies and political decisions means that even they will face new realities in the long run .
to prevent markets - and ultimately their economies - from collapsing , national governments have financially propped up or de facto nationalized major banks . leaders of the g-20 group of major nations pledged in april to strengthen financial supervision and establish stricter rules on bonus payments .
when they meet again this month in the united states they are expected to reinforce those measures . economic crisis not over yet politicians have ample reason to remain anxious .
germany is bracing for a new wave of bankruptcies this fall and unemployment figures are also set to rise , just statistics have shown that more businesses and individuals are expected to default on credit payments . experts estimate that german lenders alone could face losing 120 billion euros -lrb- $ 176 billion -rrb- by 2011 as a result .
the situation across the european union does not look much different , even though the european commission on monday announced that the euro zone is emerging from recession . " the eu economy appears to be at a turning point , " an interim forecast said , but it confirmed that the economy of the 16 countries using the euro would contract by 4 percent this year . disaster lurking in balance sheets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imf warns the crisis is not over despite positive signals from europe 's biggest economies , the head of the international monetary fund has warned that the global economic crisis is not over yet . " in the minds of too many - not only regular people but also top politicians - the financial crisis is already behind us , " dominique strauss-kahn told german news weekly der spiegel , adding that more work on financial sector regulation was needed . despite posting massive profits , the economic underpinnings of financial businesses themselves remain fragile a year after the lehman collapse . hypo real estate , nationalized by the german government and injected with 3 billion euros of fresh capital , is continuing to cause problems for german politicians and economic leaders .
the bank is set to receive 7 billion euros more before the year 's end but , according to media reports , another 16 billion euros of losses that have not yet " materialized " are lurking in the bank 's books . those least responsible for crisis are worst affected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prices for commodities from developing nations have slumped while wall street thinks it has recovered and industrialized economies anticipate they will soon follow , the global crisis may continue to affect those least responsible for it . the downturn has hit the african continent especially hard despite it not being involved in its making , civil society organizations gathered in the capital of the democratic republic of the congo heard at the fifth people 's summit of the southern african development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- . commodity prices have all but collapsed , ngos told the gathering .
among others , cotton farmers ' earnings have been whittled down to just a quarter of what they used to be before the outbreak of the financial crisis last year . rri / dpa / ap / reuters / ips editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they fear german jobs might be saved at their expense .
now brussels is probing the deal . britain and belgium on monday urged the european commission to ensure the takeover of carmaker opel did not favor german workers because of 4.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.55 billion -rrb- in promised aid from berlin .
both countries are suspicious of the deal with canadian automotive supplier magna and its russian allies , under which all four german plants will stay open while opel 's belgian plant and one of two vauxhall sites in britain could close .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one vauxhall plant in britain may have to close " i think it is important to say that the -lrb- european -rrb- commission should not accept anything that looks like a political fix or any linkage between aid and retention of jobs in any specific plant or country , " british business secretary peter mandelson told the bbc .
the eu commission denied media reports alleging it had information that could potentially derail german state support for opel .
german weekly der spiegel had reported that the commission was in possession of documents showing that the opel plant in the belgian city of antwerp – which is threatened with closure – operates at greater efficiency than the facility in bochum , germany , which opel 's new owner magna has promised to keep .
eu law prohibits state guarantees for such a decision which – if true – would amount to economic nonsense .
belgium demands special probe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commissioner verheugen held talks with flanders ' chief minister in belgium , anger is mounting at the german decision and the flemish government has taken its argument to brussels .
kris peeters , first minister of flanders said he wants the eu 's executive commission to investigate whether german aid is in conflict with eu anti-competitive practices .
he held talks with eu industry commissioner guenter verheugen on the issue on monday .
peeters said he and verheugen agreed that commercial and economic , not political , factors were paramount in deciding which plants should survive .
" we are convinced antwerp has a fair chance .
antwerp has a better chance than certain german plants , " he told reporters , adding flanders would consider filing a complaint with the commission .
eu scrutiny adds uncertainty to magna-deal the german government said it does not anticipate problems in connection with state aid being extended to opel .
a government spokesman said the support package is in line with existing eu guidelines and does not need to be presented to brussels for special scrutiny .
but the eu commission takes a different view and has announced it will examine closely the conditions attached to german support for the carmaker .
eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said that the rules of the european market do not tolerate protectionism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : september 10 : gm managers announced what now appears to have been little more than a declaration of intent however , the required documentation is not expected to arrive from berlin before the german general election at the end of september .
the magna deal , therefore , faces the prospect of a potential veto from brussels for another few weeks .
this adds further uncertainty to the whole project , which at present consists of little more than a declaration of intent by general motors and magna .
gm in particular warned that " key issues " still need to be dealt with during the negotiations on the way to a final agreement over the sale of opel .
germany hosts opel meeting given these challenges , the german government is trying to move swiftly and has announced a meeting will be held on tuesday in berlin , at which european states with opel factories are invited to discuss and agree on the disbursement of state funds for restructuring measures .
but agreement , it seems , does not even exist over who is invited .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 14.09.2009 eu economies could rebound , but unemployment worsens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the report , employment levels will continue to go down european union economies are expected to grow into the fourth quarter , but the recovery will be slow and officials in brussels have warned governments to brace themselves for more job losses . according to the european commission 's latest estimates , gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in the 27-nation bloc is expected to grow by 0.2 percent in the third quarter and 0.1 percent in the fourth after contracting sharply in the first half of the year .
overall eu gdp for the year was expected to shrink by 4 percent , which is in line with previous estimates .
eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said a sharp upturn in the global economy meant " the drop is behind us " but added that it was based mainly on stimulus measures that " would not be there forever . "
in addition , almunia warned that " unemployment levels will continue to go up and employment levels will continue to decrease , since the negative impact on the labor market has a lag of two or three quarters . "
his comments came as the latest eu figures were released , showing that the number of people unemployed in the bloc had decreased by 0.6 percent , or 1.44 million , in the second quarter when compared to the first .
call for training schemes to help unemployed the commissioner said governments should provide training schemes and promote " active labor market policies " designed to ensure that the unemployed can find a job once the economy fully recovers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the economic growth , lines at unemployment offices are expected to get longer eu governments have pumped billions of euros into their economies to mitigate the impact of the bloc 's worst recession in decades .
according to almunia , additional discretionary spending will have totalled 2.5 per cent of the eu 's gdp over the 2009-10 period .
if " automatic stabilizers " such as unemployment benefit payments are also taken into account , the size of the eu 's stimulus package will have amounted to 5.5 per cent of gdp by next year .
but with this additional spending leading to ballooning budget deficits across the eu , almunia once again urged governments to start thinking about how to rein in public spending .
" we need to define a clear , credible and coordinated ' exit strategy ' to put public finances progressively back on a sustainable path and to find the necessary resources to increase europe 's growth and jobs potential , " almunia said .
the governments of ireland and spain are among those that have already announced tax hikes in order to reduce public debt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro continues to be strong against the us dollar too early for real optimism almunia insisted that monday 's figures should be treated with " a mix of optimism and prudence , " noting that the speed of the recovery would depend on a number of factors , including the fragility of the financial sector and the impact of weak labor markets .
monday 's interim forecasts were based on the outlook for germany , spain , france , italy , the netherlands , poland and britain , which together account for 80 per cent of the eu economy .
of these , only spain was expected to remain in recession until at least 2010 .
germany is expected to lead the recovery with the greatest third-quarter gain , with italy showing " gradual improvement " and britain making a " return to positive territory before the year 's end , " almunia added. mrm / dpa / reuters / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now governments have prominent roles in the financial sector and are under pressure to change the rules . the casino is back in business , trading and speculating on the financial markets are on their way to reach pre-crisis levels .
banks are again posting profits and managers are again looking forward to big bonuses .
a year after us investment bank lehman brothers filed for bankruptcy , not much has changed - at least not in the sector that triggered the global financial crisis . new data suggest that after passing the crisis on to the economy beyond the walls of wall street , the financial markets have yet again managed to close the shutters to the real world . the bank for international settlements , the world 's biggest central bank body , reported sunday that interbank money markets are recovering to levels not seen since early 2008 .
the bank said that shows financial institutions are once again dealing with one another , but that they also remain hesitant to extend credit to businesses . reduced risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's central bank chief axel weber says : " growth not sustainable yet . "
germany 's federal bank chief axel weber , however , said the somewhat brighter general economic outlook is in part due to the government bailout of financial markets , which has contributed to " systemic risk reduction . " " aggressive monetary policy and huge economic stimulus packages " have also helped improve prospects , he said , but added that such measures make it hard to know if growth will be self-sustainable . but while bankers are benefiting from rebounding markets for the moment , the impact of the crisis on global economies and political decisions means that even they will face new realities in the long run .
to prevent markets - and ultimately their economies - from collapsing , national governments have financially propped up or de facto nationalized major banks . leaders of the g-20 group of major nations pledged in april to strengthen financial supervision and establish stricter rules on bonus payments .
when they meet again this month in the united states they are expected to reinforce those measures . economic crisis not over yet politicians have ample reason to remain anxious .
germany is bracing for a new wave of bankruptcies this fall and unemployment figures are also set to rise , just statistics have shown that more businesses and individuals are expected to default on credit payments . experts estimate that german lenders alone could face losing 120 billion euros -lrb- $ 176 billion -rrb- by 2011 as a result .
the situation across the european union does not look much different , even though the european commission on monday announced that the euro zone is emerging from recession . " the eu economy appears to be at a turning point , " an interim forecast said , but it confirmed that the economy of the 16 countries using the euro would contract by 4 percent this year . disaster lurking in balance sheets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imf warns the crisis is not over despite positive signals from europe 's biggest economies , the head of the international monetary fund has warned that the global economic crisis is not over yet . " in the minds of too many - not only regular people but also top politicians - the financial crisis is already behind us , " dominique strauss-kahn told german news weekly der spiegel , adding that more work on financial sector regulation was needed . despite posting massive profits , the economic underpinnings of financial businesses themselves remain fragile a year after the lehman collapse . hypo real estate , nationalized by the german government and injected with 3 billion euros of fresh capital , is continuing to cause problems for german politicians and economic leaders .
the bank is set to receive 7 billion euros more before the year 's end but , according to media reports , another 16 billion euros of losses that have not yet " materialized " are lurking in the bank 's books . those least responsible for crisis are worst affected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prices for commodities from developing nations have slumped while wall street thinks it has recovered and industrialized economies anticipate they will soon follow , the global crisis may continue to affect those least responsible for it . the downturn has hit the african continent especially hard despite it not being involved in its making , civil society organizations gathered in the capital of the democratic republic of the congo heard at the fifth people 's summit of the southern african development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- . commodity prices have all but collapsed , ngos told the gathering .

" it could n't have been a duel anyway , " wrote die welt daily . " for one thing , the need for ideological debate seems to be exhausted in this country .
and for another , the two politicians could not hit out at one another because it is not their style .
another reason is that they have worked together for four years in a coalition government they managed in harmony .
they agree on many issues , so they could not have credibly portrayed being at odds with each other .
the debate ended with a balanced 1:1 . "
" and why should the politicians badmouth the work they have been doing together for the past four years , " asked the sueddeutsche zeitung paper , " they may have to rule together again after -lsb- the -rsb- sept .
27 -lsb- election -rsb- .
the format of a duel is not appropriate to convey political content . "
the berliner zeitung wrote : " steinmeier only managed to attack for a few moments .
he was obviously lacking the necessary brutality and ruthlessness in view of the past four years in a joint government .
voters who wanted to find out what the world would look like with a coalition of christian democrats and free democrats , or under the leadership of the social democrats , did not learn a thing in the debate . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two are anxious to set themselves apart mass-circulation daily bild had the following assessment : " after a 90-minute ' duel , ' we are none the wiser .
this was not an exciting duel ; it was shop talk between the chancellor and her deputy . and this discussion was a signal : neither merkel nor steinmeier would mind continuing the grand coalition . "
" it seems as if merkel and steinmeier have forged a quiet alliance for the last weeks of the election campaign , even as their coalition government grows increasingly less popular among voters , " wrote the nordsee-zeitung from the country 's north .
" expectations for the debate were not high in the first place ; there was no real verbal sparring , there were no new facts : somehow , they do appear to still like each other . "

banks say they are simply trying to avoid risky loans . french banks have recently been accused of shunning small and medium-sized businesses in particular since the crisis struck - despite receiving billions of euros in state aid designed to keep credit flowing . clair service hotellerie is one of the companies affected by the banks tightened lending .
from small headquarters in paris , it provides staff for the hotel industry worldwide .
its recruits , often from eastern europe , are employed directly and trained by the company . the agency 's survival has been threatened by cash flow problems since its bank revoked the company 's overdraft facility a year ago , burdening the agency with tens of thousands of euros in extra charges . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : staffing hotels could become impossible for one french company " overnight we could not pay salaries or social charges on time , " the agency 's marketing manager , renaud chemin , said .
he added that the bank had told it to increase its capital , a suggestion the company says is impossible under current circumstances . clair service hotellerie now faces bankruptcy within three months . " since the bank will not make our situation easier , it just means the end of the company , " chemin said . such an outcome would be bound to have an impact on employees like katarina piekarmiak . she trained to be a french teacher in her native poland , but found jobs hard to come by . she replied to an advertisement from france and , since january , she has been on the agency 's books , hired out to a hotel in paris where she works as a receptionist . " in poland i was unemployed , so this work allows me to earn money and live normally , " she said .
" without this agency i 'd be unemployed again , and if i found nothing else here i 'd go back home and probably be out of work again . " banks accused of starving businesses many other small firms face problems similar to those of clair service hotellerie - especially in the restaurant industry where the banks stand accused of eschewing the whole sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : banks are becoming extremely cautious , mezziouane said " i increasingly notice banks that are more and more hesitant and more and more cautious when it comes to taking risks , " said abdellah mezziouane , general secretary of the cgpme in paris , which represents small and medium-sized businesses .
" we have concrete cases where small and medium-sized businesses can no longer find the means to finance their development and their investment , and no longer have access to funds . " a mediator appointed by the government to investigate complaints is dealing with a surge in the number of claims from small and medium-sized businesses .
last year , the banks , which had received billions of euros in state aid , agreed to increase loans by 3 percent to 4 percent .
but they have not reached that target . who is to blame ? the banks have defended themselves against charges that they are becoming too tight-fisted . some analysts have agreed with the banks , saying reduced demand caused by the recession is to blame for failure to meet lending targets . " for one or two quarters neither households nor companies were willing to borrow any more , " said cyril blesson , chief economist with seeds finance consultants . banks have perceived small businesses in particular to be too high a risk during the crisis , and tightened their lending conditions late last year , blesson added . however , with interest rates consistently low , he said he sees grounds for optimism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demand for credit is slowing picking up , some analysts said " according to the lending surveys from the central banks and especially the banque de france , we have signs of a revival in demand for credit , " blesson said .
" that is good , but now we also need banks to lend to households and companies that are willing to get indebted again . " adopt " small-business attitude " in the meantime , as many smaller companies continue to suffer , both the french government and business leaders have appealed to the banks to be more flexible . finance minister christine lagarde has written to 12 banks that have received state support , giving them until the end of the month to outline the measures they are taking to revitalize their credit policies . " i ask the french banking sector to adopt the attitude of small and medium sized companies , " laurence parisot , head of the medef employers ' organization , said in a recent radio interview .
" it is the most difficult time for them because for months they 've had order books falling by 30 , 40 , 50 percent . a large company can get by ; a small business ca n't .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 14.09.2009 no clear victor in german tv debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 14 million people watched the debate two weeks before the german election , chancellor angela merkel and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier went head to head on sunday in a highly anticipated tv debate . with 40 percent of the german electorate still undecided , the two main candidates in the national election had everything to play for .
twenty million people watched the tv debate , hoping to see a clear winner emerge after 90 minutes .
but there was no real heated political debate from the two partners in germany 's four-year-old grand coalition .
two snap polls held after the debates came to very different conclusions .
a poll by german broadcaster zdf showed 31 percent for spd challenger steinmeier as the winner of the tv duel compared to 28 percent for merkel .
a poll conducted by forsa poll had merkel in front with 37 percent , against 35 percent for steinmeier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fireworks were missing in the chancellor debate but asked which candidate was best qualified to run the country , 58 percent chose merkel compared to 28 percent for steinmeier , a poll by broadcaster rtl showed .
dressed in dark business suits , both candidates emphasized what they had achieved in the last four years in a coalition government .
for steinmeier the stakes were higher .
the spd challenger had to score points to make up for a poor showing in the polls .
" we have achieved a lot .
quite a bit of it since the crisis and we may only have done so because there was a grand coalition , " he said .
" but we have n't managed everything , we fell short of what we could do in a number of areas because the cdu did n't go along with it .
for example on minimum wages and limiting executive pay .
that would have helped people . "
merkel agreed that they had " worked well together " but said that to turn around the economy after the financial crisis she would prefer the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- as her junior coalition partner .
" i think we could make more progress on jobs which is why i 'm appealing for a new government , " she said .
" the past has been good and you wo n't change my mind about the fact that we have got a lot done .
but i think for a democracy it 's good when grand coalitions do n't become normality . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : duel or duet ?
german foreign minister and vice chancellor steinmeier spoke of a change in political direction , emphasizing that voters had a clear alternative to a future coalition between the christian democrats and free democrats .
merkel and steinmeier both tried to claim credit for the rescue of car maker opel after canadian-austrian parts maker magna agreed last week to take over the troubled general motors ' subsidiary .
most political observers agreed that the more " presidential " chancellor merkel showed her crisis management credentials while steinmeier scored points on social equality .
much of the 90-minute debate focused on ways out of the economic crisis with merkel arguing in favor of tax cuts to stimulate demand .
merkel and steinmeier also discussed managers ' salary and bonus payments , minimum wages and nuclear energy .
the candidates voiced broad agreement on germany 's military presence in afghanistan , arguing against a premature withdrawal of troops. nrt / dpa / afp / reuters editor : john kluempers send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it could n't have been a duel anyway , " wrote die welt daily . " for one thing , the need for ideological debate seems to be exhausted in this country .
and for another , the two politicians could not hit out at one another because it is not their style .
another reason is that they have worked together for four years in a coalition government they managed in harmony .
they agree on many issues , so they could not have credibly portrayed being at odds with each other .
the debate ended with a balanced 1:1 . "
" and why should the politicians badmouth the work they have been doing together for the past four years , " asked the sueddeutsche zeitung paper , " they may have to rule together again after -lsb- the -rsb- sept .
27 -lsb- election -rsb- .
the format of a duel is not appropriate to convey political content . "
the berliner zeitung wrote : " steinmeier only managed to attack for a few moments .
he was obviously lacking the necessary brutality and ruthlessness in view of the past four years in a joint government .
voters who wanted to find out what the world would look like with a coalition of christian democrats and free democrats , or under the leadership of the social democrats , did not learn a thing in the debate . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two are anxious to set themselves apart mass-circulation daily bild had the following assessment : " after a 90-minute ' duel , ' we are none the wiser .
this was not an exciting duel ; it was shop talk between the chancellor and her deputy . and this discussion was a signal : neither merkel nor steinmeier would mind continuing the grand coalition . "
" it seems as if merkel and steinmeier have forged a quiet alliance for the last weeks of the election campaign , even as their coalition government grows increasingly less popular among voters , " wrote the nordsee-zeitung from the country 's north .
" expectations for the debate were not high in the first place ; there was no real verbal sparring , there were no new facts : somehow , they do appear to still like each other . "
bonn 's general-anzeiger summed it up : " the two get along well , and that was evident last night . " db / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for steinmeier the stakes were higher .
the spd challenger had to score points to make up for a poor showing in the polls .
" we have achieved a lot .
quite a bit of it since the crisis and we may only have done so because there was a grand coalition , " he said .
" but we have n't managed everything , we fell short of what we could do in a number of areas because the cdu did n't go along with it .
for example on minimum wages and limiting executive pay .
that would have helped people . "
merkel agreed that they had " worked well together " but said that to turn around the economy after the financial crisis she would prefer the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- as her junior coalition partner .
" i think we could make more progress on jobs which is why i 'm appealing for a new government , " she said .
" the past has been good and you wo n't change my mind about the fact that we have got a lot done .
but i think for a democracy it 's good when grand coalitions do n't become normality . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : duel or duet ?
german foreign minister and vice chancellor steinmeier spoke of a change in political direction , emphasizing that voters had a clear alternative to a future coalition between the christian democrats and free democrats .
merkel and steinmeier both tried to claim credit for the rescue of car maker opel after canadian-austrian parts maker magna agreed last week to take over the troubled general motors ' subsidiary .
most political observers agreed that the more " presidential " chancellor merkel showed her crisis management credentials while steinmeier scored points on social equality .
much of the 90-minute debate focused on ways out of the economic crisis with merkel arguing in favor of tax cuts to stimulate demand .
merkel and steinmeier also discussed managers ' salary and bonus payments , minimum wages and nuclear energy .
the candidates voiced broad agreement on germany 's military presence in afghanistan , arguing against a premature withdrawal of troops. nrt / dpa / afp / reuters editor : john kluempers send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

many fear that the process is merely a show trial for the icc . much was made of the arrest of congolese militia leader thomas lubanga dyilo in 2005 on charges of recruiting and using child soldiers in the bloody congolese civil war between 1998 and 2003 .
lubanga was accused of creating an entire infrastructure around child soldiers in the ituri region and commanding forces responsible for massive human rights violations , including ethnic massacres , murder , torture , rape and mutilation in the democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- . his arrest , the first under a warrant issued by the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- , was seen as the first step in an international crackdown on seemingly out-of-control military leaders using human rights abuses as tactics in many of africa 's brutal conflicts .
his trial for war crimes in the hague , which began in january this year , appeared to show that the icc was a judicial force to be reckoned with and that a flood of arrests and convictions would follow . but as the prosecution rested its case in july , leaving lubanga 's counsel to prepare its defense case ahead of its october presentation , increasing criticism of the trial and accusations against the icc gathered pace in the drc . congolese call trial a " neo-colonial project " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the icc is making an example of lubanga many congolese accuse the historic process against lubanga as being a show trial , saying that the icc are trying one individual while many others remain free to commit more human rights abuses in congo .
some have called lubanga ’ s trial a " neo-colonial project " and that the icc is trying to set an example rather than using the case as part of an on-going quest to bring others like lubanga to justice .
they say his is a token arrest . " there 's a growing disconnection between how the icc is seen in the west and how it 's perceived in africa , " richard gowan , an africa expert at the european center for foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" it has focused almost entirely on african cases so far , so many africans believe it ’ s being used in a colonial way and western leaders haven ’ t done enough to dispel this negative impression . " anneke van woudenberg , human rights watch 's congo expert , believes that distrust in the icc has its roots in both a political agenda and public confusion in congo . " this is certainly not a sham trial and this is something which has been propagated by lubanga ’ s supporters and those loyal to him in the ituri region , " she told deutsche welle .
" there has been confusion in congo over the narrow nature of the charges .
many don ’ t understand why lubanga has been charged only with the recruitment of child soldiers when he was responsible for the ethnic murders , rape and torture which made the ituri conflict the bloodiest in the congo war .
in addition , the evidence against him is very strong . " others fear that a conviction against lubanga will be held up as a justification for the icc ’ s existence but will result in a slow decline of its pursuit of other war criminals , not only in the drc but all over africa and the world . " i do n't subscribe to these congolese assertions , other than the undeniable fact that many suspected perpetrators of war crimes in the drc remain free and in positions of authority , " andrew philip , a congo expert with amnesty international , told deutsche welle .
" amnesty welcomes the icc investigations and prosecutions , although we have encouraged and continue to encourage the icc prosecutor to extend investigations to other areas of drc than just in the ituri region , and to other crimes within its mandate . " van woudenberg also believes that many more war crimes suspects remain at large but believes that the icc will not be stopping with lubanga . " the icc will not stop with lubanga and besides , he is not alone in standing trial , " she said . " there are three other individuals charged alongside him .
but what the icc prosecutor has to do is to look past the ituri conflict and the warlords there and go after those who supported and funded lubanga .
this would lead them to the higher echelons of not only the congolese government but also those in uganda and rwanda .
for this to have a wider effect the icc must not stop at the warlord level . " critics claim un deaths accelerated lubanga pursuit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's claimed the death of un troops speeded up the pursuit it has also been alleged that lubanga was only brought to trial after he was implicated in the deaths of un troops in the drc and that otherwise , the international community would have continued to turn what some congolese believe to be a blind eye to atrocities there .
some claim that while six million people have been killed in congo over the last 12 years and a wide range of abuses recorded , it took the death of nine bangladeshi peacekeepers in the northwestern region of ituri to stir the icc into action . " the claim that the deaths of the un soldiers prompted international action is misplaced , " said van woudenberg .
" ituri was the bloodiest region where more people were killed than anywhere else in congo so this was the icc ’ s first focus in its search for war crimes suspects .
because of the violence there , there were a lot of un troops and consequently un troops died there - but it wasn ’ t the only place in congo where they died . " it is also claimed that congo 's natural resources played a part in the international community ’ s hesitation to act .
the drc is rich in natural gas and crude oil reserves , while zinc , uranium and copper deposits are also plentiful . experts say conviction would prove positive for human rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite international efforts , congo still suffers despite these claims , human rights and legal experts believe lubanga 's trial and possible conviction will have a positive effect on the overall battle for human rights and motivate the world to pursue war criminals and bring them to justice at the icc . " in terms of human rights , lubanga ’ s trial is hugely significant , " said van woudenberg . " it is the first case at the icc and a conviction would enhance the icc ’ s efforts .
if he is convicted it will be a first for a suspect involved in the recruitment and use of child soldiers .
his arrest has already has a huge effect , bringing child soldiers to international attention and making african leaders aware that this is actually a crime .
we would like to see more offences added to his charge sheet so any conviction would hopefully have as strong an impact on those areas of abuses .

many fear that the process is merely a show trial for the icc . much was made of the arrest of congolese militia leader thomas lubanga dyilo in 2005 on charges of recruiting and using child soldiers in the bloody congolese civil war between 1998 and 2003 .
lubanga was accused of creating an entire infrastructure around child soldiers in the ituri region and commanding forces responsible for massive human rights violations , including ethnic massacres , murder , torture , rape and mutilation in the democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- . his arrest , the first under a warrant issued by the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- , was seen as the first step in an international crackdown on seemingly out-of-control military leaders using human rights abuses as tactics in many of africa 's brutal conflicts .
his trial for war crimes in the hague , which began in january this year , appeared to show that the icc was a judicial force to be reckoned with and that a flood of arrests and convictions would follow . but as the prosecution rested its case in july , leaving lubanga 's counsel to prepare its defense case ahead of its october presentation , increasing criticism of the trial and accusations against the icc gathered pace in the drc . congolese call trial a " neo-colonial project " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the icc is making an example of lubanga many congolese accuse the historic process against lubanga as being a show trial , saying that the icc are trying one individual while many others remain free to commit more human rights abuses in congo .
some have called lubanga ’ s trial a " neo-colonial project " and that the icc is trying to set an example rather than using the case as part of an on-going quest to bring others like lubanga to justice .
they say his is a token arrest . " there 's a growing disconnection between how the icc is seen in the west and how it 's perceived in africa , " richard gowan , an africa expert at the european center for foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" it has focused almost entirely on african cases so far , so many africans believe it ’ s being used in a colonial way and western leaders haven ’ t done enough to dispel this negative impression . " anneke van woudenberg , human rights watch 's congo expert , believes that distrust in the icc has its roots in both a political agenda and public confusion in congo . " this is certainly not a sham trial and this is something which has been propagated by lubanga ’ s supporters and those loyal to him in the ituri region , " she told deutsche welle .
" there has been confusion in congo over the narrow nature of the charges .
many don ’ t understand why lubanga has been charged only with the recruitment of child soldiers when he was responsible for the ethnic murders , rape and torture which made the ituri conflict the bloodiest in the congo war .
in addition , the evidence against him is very strong . " others fear that a conviction against lubanga will be held up as a justification for the icc ’ s existence but will result in a slow decline of its pursuit of other war criminals , not only in the drc but all over africa and the world . " i do n't subscribe to these congolese assertions , other than the undeniable fact that many suspected perpetrators of war crimes in the drc remain free and in positions of authority , " andrew philip , a congo expert with amnesty international , told deutsche welle .
" amnesty welcomes the icc investigations and prosecutions , although we have encouraged and continue to encourage the icc prosecutor to extend investigations to other areas of drc than just in the ituri region , and to other crimes within its mandate . " van woudenberg also believes that many more war crimes suspects remain at large but believes that the icc will not be stopping with lubanga . " the icc will not stop with lubanga and besides , he is not alone in standing trial , " she said . " there are three other individuals charged alongside him .
but what the icc prosecutor has to do is to look past the ituri conflict and the warlords there and go after those who supported and funded lubanga .
this would lead them to the higher echelons of not only the congolese government but also those in uganda and rwanda .
for this to have a wider effect the icc must not stop at the warlord level . " critics claim un deaths accelerated lubanga pursuit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's claimed the death of un troops speeded up the pursuit it has also been alleged that lubanga was only brought to trial after he was implicated in the deaths of un troops in the drc and that otherwise , the international community would have continued to turn what some congolese believe to be a blind eye to atrocities there .
some claim that while six million people have been killed in congo over the last 12 years and a wide range of abuses recorded , it took the death of nine bangladeshi peacekeepers in the northwestern region of ituri to stir the icc into action . " the claim that the deaths of the un soldiers prompted international action is misplaced , " said van woudenberg .
" ituri was the bloodiest region where more people were killed than anywhere else in congo so this was the icc ’ s first focus in its search for war crimes suspects .
because of the violence there , there were a lot of un troops and consequently un troops died there - but it wasn ’ t the only place in congo where they died . " it is also claimed that congo 's natural resources played a part in the international community ’ s hesitation to act .
the drc is rich in natural gas and crude oil reserves , while zinc , uranium and copper deposits are also plentiful . experts say conviction would prove positive for human rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite international efforts , congo still suffers despite these claims , human rights and legal experts believe lubanga 's trial and possible conviction will have a positive effect on the overall battle for human rights and motivate the world to pursue war criminals and bring them to justice at the icc . " in terms of human rights , lubanga ’ s trial is hugely significant , " said van woudenberg . " it is the first case at the icc and a conviction would enhance the icc ’ s efforts .
if he is convicted it will be a first for a suspect involved in the recruitment and use of child soldiers .
his arrest has already has a huge effect , bringing child soldiers to international attention and making african leaders aware that this is actually a crime .
we would like to see more offences added to his charge sheet so any conviction would hopefully have as strong an impact on those areas of abuses .

they fear german jobs might be saved at their expense .
now brussels is probing the deal . britain and belgium on monday urged the european commission to ensure the takeover of carmaker opel did not favor german workers because of 4.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.55 billion -rrb- in promised aid from berlin .
both countries are suspicious of the deal with canadian automotive supplier magna and its russian allies , under which all four german plants will stay open while opel 's belgian plant and one of two vauxhall sites in britain could close .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one vauxhall plant in britain may have to close " i think it is important to say that the -lrb- european -rrb- commission should not accept anything that looks like a political fix or any linkage between aid and retention of jobs in any specific plant or country , " british business secretary peter mandelson told the bbc .
the eu commission denied media reports alleging it had information that could potentially derail german state support for opel .
german weekly der spiegel had reported that the commission was in possession of documents showing that the opel plant in the belgian city of antwerp – which is threatened with closure – operates at greater efficiency than the facility in bochum , germany , which opel 's new owner magna has promised to keep .
eu law prohibits state guarantees for such a decision which – if true – would amount to economic nonsense .
belgium demands special probe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commissioner verheugen held talks with flanders ' chief minister in belgium , anger is mounting at the german decision and the flemish government has taken its argument to brussels .
kris peeters , first minister of flanders said he wants the eu 's executive commission to investigate whether german aid is in conflict with eu anti-competitive practices .
he held talks with eu industry commissioner guenter verheugen on the issue on monday .
peeters said he and verheugen agreed that commercial and economic , not political , factors were paramount in deciding which plants should survive .
" we are convinced antwerp has a fair chance .
antwerp has a better chance than certain german plants , " he told reporters , adding flanders would consider filing a complaint with the commission .
eu scrutiny adds uncertainty to magna-deal the german government said it does not anticipate problems in connection with state aid being extended to opel .
a government spokesman said the support package is in line with existing eu guidelines and does not need to be presented to brussels for special scrutiny .
but the eu commission takes a different view and has announced it will examine closely the conditions attached to german support for the carmaker .
eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said that the rules of the european market do not tolerate protectionism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : september 10 : gm managers announced what now appears to have been little more than a declaration of intent however , the required documentation is not expected to arrive from berlin before the german general election at the end of september .
the magna deal , therefore , faces the prospect of a potential veto from brussels for another few weeks .
this adds further uncertainty to the whole project , which at present consists of little more than a declaration of intent by general motors and magna .
gm in particular warned that " key issues " still need to be dealt with during the negotiations on the way to a final agreement over the sale of opel .
germany hosts opel meeting given these challenges , the german government is trying to move swiftly and has announced a meeting will be held on tuesday in berlin , at which european states with opel factories are invited to discuss and agree on the disbursement of state funds for restructuring measures .
but agreement , it seems , does not even exist over who is invited .
belgian foreign minister yves leterme complained on monday that his country had received no invitation .
the german government 's spokesman denied this. rri / reuters / dpa / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now governments have prominent roles in the financial sector and are under pressure to change the rules . the casino is back in business , trading and speculating on the financial markets are on their way to reach pre-crisis levels .
banks are again posting profits and managers are again looking forward to big bonuses .
a year after us investment bank lehman brothers filed for bankruptcy , not much has changed - at least not in the sector that triggered the global financial crisis . new data suggest that after passing the crisis on to the economy beyond the walls of wall street , the financial markets have yet again managed to close the shutters to the real world . the bank for international settlements , the world 's biggest central bank body , reported sunday that interbank money markets are recovering to levels not seen since early 2008 .
the bank said that shows financial institutions are once again dealing with one another , but that they also remain hesitant to extend credit to businesses . reduced risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's central bank chief axel weber says : " growth not sustainable yet . "
germany 's federal bank chief axel weber , however , said the somewhat brighter general economic outlook is in part due to the government bailout of financial markets , which has contributed to " systemic risk reduction . " " aggressive monetary policy and huge economic stimulus packages " have also helped improve prospects , he said , but added that such measures make it hard to know if growth will be self-sustainable . but while bankers are benefiting from rebounding markets for the moment , the impact of the crisis on global economies and political decisions means that even they will face new realities in the long run .
to prevent markets - and ultimately their economies - from collapsing , national governments have financially propped up or de facto nationalized major banks . leaders of the g-20 group of major nations pledged in april to strengthen financial supervision and establish stricter rules on bonus payments .
when they meet again this month in the united states they are expected to reinforce those measures . economic crisis not over yet politicians have ample reason to remain anxious .
germany is bracing for a new wave of bankruptcies this fall and unemployment figures are also set to rise , just statistics have shown that more businesses and individuals are expected to default on credit payments . experts estimate that german lenders alone could face losing 120 billion euros -lrb- $ 176 billion -rrb- by 2011 as a result .
the situation across the european union does not look much different , even though the european commission on monday announced that the euro zone is emerging from recession . " the eu economy appears to be at a turning point , " an interim forecast said , but it confirmed that the economy of the 16 countries using the euro would contract by 4 percent this year . disaster lurking in balance sheets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imf warns the crisis is not over despite positive signals from europe 's biggest economies , the head of the international monetary fund has warned that the global economic crisis is not over yet . " in the minds of too many - not only regular people but also top politicians - the financial crisis is already behind us , " dominique strauss-kahn told german news weekly der spiegel , adding that more work on financial sector regulation was needed . despite posting massive profits , the economic underpinnings of financial businesses themselves remain fragile a year after the lehman collapse . hypo real estate , nationalized by the german government and injected with 3 billion euros of fresh capital , is continuing to cause problems for german politicians and economic leaders .
the bank is set to receive 7 billion euros more before the year 's end but , according to media reports , another 16 billion euros of losses that have not yet " materialized " are lurking in the bank 's books . those least responsible for crisis are worst affected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prices for commodities from developing nations have slumped while wall street thinks it has recovered and industrialized economies anticipate they will soon follow , the global crisis may continue to affect those least responsible for it . the downturn has hit the african continent especially hard despite it not being involved in its making , civil society organizations gathered in the capital of the democratic republic of the congo heard at the fifth people 's summit of the southern african development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- . commodity prices have all but collapsed , ngos told the gathering .
among others , cotton farmers ' earnings have been whittled down to just a quarter of what they used to be before the outbreak of the financial crisis last year . rri / dpa / ap / reuters / ips editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the latest test results are sad for my wife and myself , but i do n't want to moan a lot more in public now , but rather to give others strength and concentrate on my africa project . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' mea culpa ' includes film , music and text excerpts in " mea culpa , " the 48-year-old describes the highs and lows that he has suffered during his illness , and reveals his feelings and his dreams - among them the idea of creating a festival hall in africa . link to earlier work the opera also evokes earlier works , such as his staging of richard wagner 's " parsifal . "
schlingensief has indicated a link between his life-changing illness and his work on a controversial production of richard wagner 's “ parsifal ” for the 2004-2007 bayreuth festivals . wagner is a kind of leitmotif through the collage-like work , which also includes music by johann sebastian bach , arnold schoenberg , franz schubert and robert schumann .
it also incorporates texts by goethe and austrian writer elfriede jelinek , among others . in the past , the work of the enfant terrible of german theater has frequently prompted people to leave the auditorium in protest and shock , the performance of " mea culpa " was met with enthusiastic applause . homecoming for schlingensief schlingensief is no stranger to the bavarian capital .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 14.09.2009 france delays dna test for immigrants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the law would have come into force on december 31 the french government is to rethink a controversial law authorizing dna tests for the families of immigrants seeking to join their relatives in france .
the law was meant to come into force at the end of the year . the law was originally part of a wider immigration bill passed by the government in the early days of nicolas sarkozy 's presidency in an attempt to tighten the rules on those seeking entry to france .
its supporters said voluntary dna tests could speed up visa applications and help prove a genuine biological link between children and parents .
the law has come under intense criticism from rights groups and now the country 's immigration minister , eric besson , has said that he is unable to comply with the web of conditions in the heavily-amended text that was finally voted by parliament .
the dna tests were to be carried out at french consulates around the world .
but besson said that so many constraints had been added that he believed the law would n't work in practice .
" the genetic samples should be taken by a doctor .
our consulates are n't equipped for that .
we 'd need to invest a lot of resources for a very marginal interest , " he added .
critics claim test unfair to africans when the law was introduced , it was claimed that dna tests could help in cases where there was doubt over whether birth certificates were valid .
but opposition politicians and human rights organizations protested that it stigmatized african immigrants in particular because many africans live in extended families where children are often adopted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics claim the law is especially unfair on people from sub-saharan africa critics , like dominique sopo , head of sos racism in france , have welcomed the immigration minister 's move to shelve the plan .
sopo said this was good news because " these tests were ethically indefensible . "
under the law , tests would be voluntary ; families in theory could seek a dna test to prove a link between an immigrant in france and their relatives abroad .
it was watered down to exclude people from morocco , algeria and tunisia - which reinforced a feeling that sub-saharan africans were being stigmatized .
prime minister promises to work on a solution initially the measure was strongly supported by those who argued that the rules on immigration needed tightening .
however , there are now signs of disagreement within the government 's camp .
according to afp , the leader of the right-wing ump party in the national assembly , jean-francis cope , warned that the executive had an obligation to sign the law into application .
prime minister francois fillon has tried to defuse the disagreement , defending the law in principle .
he said parliament would re-examine the law to try to find a solution .
the initial law was championed by then immigration minister brice hortefeux , who is currently fighting off accusations of racism after he was recorded on video making what appear to be anti-arab comments .

they set out unaware that the europe they dream of reaching is deep in recession and the welcome less than warm .
the man from the libyan security services held a black beret over his nose .
we had been walking in the heat for more than an hour across the dunes .
along the way we had seen discarded t-shirts and jeans , the occasional rucksack , and now this .
the body was fresh , around two weeks old .
it was that of a young man , clothed in a chocolate-brown t-shirt and faded jeans .
there was no visible injury , no blood .
he was lying on his back , propped awkwardly against the hot saharan rocks .
i crouched beside an outstretched arm and saw something had fallen from his grip .
it was a plastic water bottle , empty and half submerged in the sand .
the guard pointed back up the path .
" many more this way , many more , " he said .
our trip to this remote part of libya took place three weeks before the celebrations for colonel gaddafi 's 40 years in power .
while the rest of the world 's press struggled to get entry visas , and news of the pending release of the lockerbie bomber from a scottish prison not yet broken , we were embedded with libya 's security services in the sahara desert .
we were not looking for al-qaeda , even though its followers are known to operate close to here on the algerian border , we were looking for african migrants .
every year , around 40,000 of them cross the sahara on their way to europe .
we found ourselves in the middle of the most dangerous migration route in the world .
most of those who attempt to cross here are economic migrants , but some are political refugees , fleeing conflict and persecution in places like sudan , eritrea and somalia .
we had air-conditioned vehicles and huge tanks of water , but the migrants cross this part of the desert on foot .
when the british army patrol in similar conditions in afghanistan , each soldier is supposed to drink 14 litres of water during a day-long operation .
these migrants walk in the desert for four days , sometimes with just a litre or two of water , so that they can keep the weight down .
the next body we came across lay with his wrist across his forehead , like he was wiping away the sweat .
he looked about 18 .
his jeans had been torn around the left calf , probably by a jackal , and the flesh was torn away down to the bone .
nearby , there was another empty water bottle .
it is a story that has come to dominate my life for the last two years .
' we walked ' in 2007 , an extraordinary photograph in the morning papers set off my work on this story .
it was an aerial shot of a tuna net , in the middle of the mediterranean sea .
hanging from it were 27 men , clothed but with no sign of any boat .
it seemed they had fallen from outer space .
when i finally tracked them down , to a hostel in italy , it turned out they had been trying to cross the sea to europe when their boat had capsized .
they had clung onto the net for three days without proper food or water .
none of them could swim , and they were so unfamiliar with the sea , they believed the tuna in the net were man-eating fish .
" but how did you get the mediterranean in the first place ? "
i asked .
they looked at each other , puzzled .
" we walked across the sahara , " they said .
the youngest was a 19-year-old , from ghana , named justice amin .
as we talked i realised the journey he 'd taken , that they 'd all taken in the hope of reaching a " promised land " was of biblical proportions .
they had not just risked their lives crossing the sea , they had first risked them on that walk across the desert .
all of them had lost friends .
they had been reduced to drinking their own urine on the sahara , and drinking seawater on the mediterranean .
a quarter of those who attempt the journey each year end up dead .
justice 's story was particularly compelling .
he had been raised by a witchdoctor , who spoke in tongues and sacrificed chickens on a clay idol outside their hut .
yet he could still speak four languages , and quote lengthy tracts from both the koran and the bible .
he told me about the journey to europe - about the nomads who lead men into the desert and then abandon them without water , the people smugglers who trick migrants onto boats without enough petrol to reach the other side and the libyan border patrols who dress " like ninjas " and capture migrants on the dunes .
i wrote a book about him , called " i am justice " , and now here i was , on the sahara , with the very patrols he had tried to evade .
we were back in the air-conditioned jeep when the radio message came through .
they 'd just spotted 21 migrants walking across the sand a couple of miles away .
if caught they would be thrown into a libyan prison .
but if they were not stopped , they might just make it to the mediterranean and the next step on this deadly journey .
or , they might end up as corpses propped against saharan rocks , arms reaching out for empty bottles .

advertisement paul kenyon joins libyan border police patrolling the sahara the man from the libyan security services held a black beret over his nose .
we had been walking in the heat for more than an hour across the dunes .
along the way we had seen discarded t-shirts and jeans , the occasional rucksack , and now this .
the body was fresh , around two weeks old .
it was that of a young man , clothed in a chocolate-brown t-shirt and faded jeans .
there was no visible injury , no blood .
he was lying on his back , propped awkwardly against the hot saharan rocks .
i crouched beside an outstretched arm and saw something had fallen from his grip .
it was a plastic water bottle , empty and half submerged in the sand .
the guard pointed back up the path .
" many more this way , many more , " he said .
our trip to this remote part of libya took place three weeks before the celebrations for colonel gaddafi 's 40 years in power .
while the rest of the world 's press struggled to get entry visas , and news of the pending release of the lockerbie bomber from a scottish prison not yet broken , we were embedded with libya 's security services in the sahara desert .
the migrant route takes in ghana , burkina faso and niger we were not looking for al-qaeda , even though its followers are known to operate close to here on the algerian border , we were looking for african migrants .
every year , around 40,000 of them cross the sahara on their way to europe .
we found ourselves in the middle of the most dangerous migration route in the world .
most of those who attempt to cross here are economic migrants , but some are political refugees , fleeing conflict and persecution in places like sudan , eritrea and somalia .
we had air-conditioned vehicles and huge tanks of water , but the migrants cross this part of the desert on foot .
when the british army patrol in similar conditions in afghanistan , each soldier is supposed to drink 14 litres of water during a day-long operation .
these migrants walk in the desert for four days , sometimes with just a litre or two of water , so that they can keep the weight down .
the next body we came across lay with his wrist across his forehead , like he was wiping away the sweat .
he looked about 18 .
his jeans had been torn around the left calf , probably by a jackal , and the flesh was torn away down to the bone .
nearby , there was another empty water bottle .
it is a story that has come to dominate my life for the last two years .
' we walked ' in 2007 , an extraordinary photograph in the morning papers set off my work on this story .
it was an aerial shot of a tuna net , in the middle of the mediterranean sea .
hanging from it were 27 men , clothed but with no sign of any boat .
it seemed they had fallen from outer space .
when i finally tracked them down , to a hostel in italy , it turned out they had been trying to cross the sea to europe when their boat had capsized .
they had clung onto the net for three days without proper food or water .
none of them could swim , and they were so unfamiliar with the sea , they believed the tuna in the net were man-eating fish .
" but how did you get the mediterranean in the first place ? "
i asked .
they looked at each other , puzzled .
" we walked across the sahara , " they said .
the youngest was a 19-year-old , from ghana , named justice amin .
as we talked i realised the journey he 'd taken , that they 'd all taken in the hope of reaching a " promised land " was of biblical proportions .
they had not just risked their lives crossing the sea , they had first risked them on that walk across the desert .
all of them had lost friends .
they had been reduced to drinking their own urine on the sahara , and drinking seawater on the mediterranean .
a quarter of those who attempt the journey each year end up dead .
justice amin finds life in naples difficult and warns others not to follow justice 's story was particularly compelling .
he had been raised by a witchdoctor , who spoke in tongues and sacrificed chickens on a clay idol outside their hut .
yet he could still speak four languages , and quote lengthy tracts from both the koran and the bible .
he told me about the journey to europe - about the nomads who lead men into the desert and then abandon them without water , the people smugglers who trick migrants onto boats without enough petrol to reach the other side and the libyan border patrols who dress " like ninjas " and capture migrants on the dunes .
i wrote a book about him , called " i am justice " , and now here i was , on the sahara , with the very patrols he had tried to evade .
we were back in the air-conditioned jeep when the radio message came through .
they 'd just spotted 21 migrants walking across the sand a couple of miles away .
if caught they would be thrown into a libyan prison .
but if they were not stopped , they might just make it to the mediterranean and the next step on this deadly journey .
or , they might end up as corpses propped against saharan rocks , arms reaching out for empty bottles .
