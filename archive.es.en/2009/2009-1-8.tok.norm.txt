he said a new role should be created for governments and moral values . " either we re-found capitalism or we destroy it , " sarkozy said as he called for an economic system based on the value of work rather than finance . " purely financial capitalism has perverted the logic of capitalism , " the french president said .
" financial capitalism is a system of irresponsibility and ... is amoral .
it is a system where the logic of the market excuses everything . " the french leader said the structure of a new system of regulation should be agreed on before april 's g20 summit in london . sarkozy : us dominance at an end bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world leaders are hopeful obama will come to the table sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel collectively used the summit to urge the us not to stand in the way of tighter controls on world financial markets . " i 've always in my political life been a supporter of a close alliance with the united states but let 's be clear : in the 21st century , a single nation can no longer say what we must do or what we must think , " sarkozy said . " we 'll take our decisions on april 2 in london , " he added .
" perhaps the united states will join us in this change .
i hope so with all my heart because a new president will bring his intelligence , dynamism and his open mind and we will change the world with the united states . " but we will not accept the status quo , we will not accept stagnation . " merkel said : " no country can act alone in this day and age ... even the united states , however powerful they may be . " merkel : politicians must remain vigilant bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says reforms must persist after the crisis is resolved merkel called for the establishment of a " charter for a long-term reasonable economy " similar to the united nations charter . " our response -lrb- to the economic crisis -rrb- must be more than a few rules , " merkel said .
" the crisis is an opportunity to create an international architecture of institutions . " " it is possible that alongside the -lrb- un -rrb- security council , we could also have an economic council that would have a different role from ecosoc , " merkel said , referring to the united nations economic and social council . she singled out the us budget deficit and china 's current account surplus as bones of contention and also called on politicians to remain firm even after the crisis has been resolved . " there is a risk that when everything is functioning normally again that the financial institutions will tell politicians not to meddle , " she cautioned .
" we must remain determined . " blair : no turning back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair says the financial crisis is still evolving former british prime minister tony blair , who is one of the co-sponsors of the symposium with sarkozy , told participants that investment patterns must be changed . " this economic crisis is the biggest , most complex , most delicate economic challenge of our lifetime .
it is the most tricky intellectual challenge of any kind i have ever encountered and it is still evolving , " blair said . " what is plain is that the financial system has altered in its fundamentals and can never be the same again . " what is unavoidable in the longer term is a recasting of the system of international supervision . " we must invest in the future , " blair said , calling for funds to be put into renewable energy , science , innovation and education . the symposium was downgraded from a summit because few world leaders chose to attend .
in addition to sarkozy and merkel , only liberian president ellen johnson-sirleaf was present on thursday . other participants at the two-day conference include economics nobel prize winners amartya sen and joseph stiglitz , world trade organization head pascal lamy and the president of the european central bank , jean-claude trichet . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" " it is possible that alongside the -lrb- un -rrb- security council , we could also have an economic council that would have a different role from ecosoc , " merkel said , referring to the united nations economic and social council . she singled out the us budget deficit and china 's current account surplus as bones of contention and also called on politicians to remain firm even after the crisis has been resolved . " there is a risk that when everything is functioning normally again that the financial institutions will tell politicians not to meddle , " she cautioned .
" we must remain determined . " blair : no turning back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair says the financial crisis is still evolving former british prime minister tony blair , who is one of the co-sponsors of the symposium with sarkozy , told participants that investment patterns must be changed . " this economic crisis is the biggest , most complex , most delicate economic challenge of our lifetime .
it is the most tricky intellectual challenge of any kind i have ever encountered and it is still evolving , " blair said . " what is plain is that the financial system has altered in its fundamentals and can never be the same again . " what is unavoidable in the longer term is a recasting of the system of international supervision . " we must invest in the future , " blair said , calling for funds to be put into renewable energy , science , innovation and education . the symposium was downgraded from a summit because few world leaders chose to attend .
in addition to sarkozy and merkel , only liberian president ellen johnson-sirleaf was present on thursday . other participants at the two-day conference include economics nobel prize winners amartya sen and joseph stiglitz , world trade organization head pascal lamy and the president of the european central bank , jean-claude trichet . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

8 that its car sales exceeded one million in 2008 , the 13th consecutive year-on-year increase .
the record results go against the current downward trend in the car industry . the carmaker sold just over one million vehicles worldwide in 2008 , up 4.1 percent over 2007 .
december sales rose over 17.4 percent compared to the same month the previous year , at a time when its rivals have been badly hit by the global economic downturn . audi head rupert stadler said that his firm aims to become " the most attractive premium brand worldwide " in the car market .
he added that audi intends to build on its success by introducing new products in 2009 . company officials noted that 2008 was the first time that audi has broken the one million mark in sales .
the managers attributed much of the gain to the introduction of 12 new models , including the a4 saloon car and the q5 sports utility vehicle . the ingolstadt-based carmaker is bucking a trend in germany as well as elsewhere in the world .

in an interview with the german daily general anzeiger , the head of the christian democrats in the german parliament , volker kauder , said that the assistance in the form of guarantees is designed for companies struggling to secure funding from banks or are unable to raise capital on the financial markets .
" as long as banks are not increasing their appetite to award loans , the public powers must make investments possible for our economy by making loans available , " he said according to the interview published thursday .
observers have criticized the rescue package .
german newsmagazine spiegel 's web site posted a warning from economists roland doehrn and christoph m. schmidt of the economic research institute in essen , who said there could be negative consequences .
they said political pressure could hold up the decision on which companies deserve help .
they also warned that unless the 400-billion-euro rescue package for the nation 's banking sector was properly applied , there was no hope of ever ending the credit crisis .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . i do not agree with germany 's stance in support of support israel .
the same old mistakes are being made .
violence is fought with violence and that by a military power which is much much stronger to wipe out the weaker opponent .
transformation can only happen through love and compassion .
i would have thought that jews would have more compassion for the underdog considering their own past sufferring .
each side will have to learn to live with each other in the same land . - reiner schmitt , australia i feel very saddened that the government of germany has chosen to support both the us and israel on this inhuman conflict waged against people already in a very bad situation .
i would prefer to see the government seek to resolve the terrible conditions that palestinians have to bear .
if they were able to live in peace as well as isreali citizens do with the same freedoms , there would be no conflicts or extremism . - carol lee murphy , canada germany is still too shy to speak independantly from the us due its guilt because of the holocaust .
germany needs to find the courage to confront the situation like it is , regardless of who is the perpetrator .
israel policy of bombs versus rockets will not bring peace to palestine .
only by solving the future of a palestinian state and the role of jerusalem between two states will the situation be solved .
but the hardliners in israel do not give the palestinians the same right they want for themselves , the right to exist . - rolf brulez .
australia i am a mother of two very young children and i simply ca n't imagine how one human can do this to another .
even with all these images of innocent people dying and wounded , the rest of the world seems to be sleeping .
i pray togod and appeal to anyone who has a heart to stop the blood shed right now . - huma chaudhry , pakistan hamas was elected in a massive majority by the palestinian people .
the eu was there during elections with a full complement of election monitors and testified that the elections were " clean " and only minor problems were reported at the polling stations .
just because some western political leaders do n't like the policies of hamas , does n't mean they were not democratically-elected .
therefore , they are the legally permitted and elected representatives of the palestinian people . - john brian shannon , canada almost everyone is demanding that israel stop it 's " aggression " in gaza .
who is blaming iran and syria for their original financing and arranging the arms flow to hamas in gaza ? - charles akselrad , us i support the german government decision to support israel concerning the attacks on gaza . - dennis young , us if the eu wants to have a role in resolving the conflict between israel and gaza , the eu should seek to discover the gazans who do not support hamas and give them some media exposure .
the eu should also be supporting israel , which is confronting islamic terrorism instead of seeking ways to placate islamic terrorists and their agent provocateurs . - charles smyth , great britain compiled by dw staff -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

are things about to get very cold in germany ?
hans-joachim ziesing : i think there is a bit of a difference between some european countries and germany .
i believe in germany it is n't going to get cold anytime soon , though if the interruption lasts longer then there will certainly be problems here .
but we need to ensure that we have other supply sources - like the netherlands and norway - and that we keep our reserves full .
we 'll certainly be able to deal with the interruption for the time being , but not if it lasts for more than a couple of weeks .
then we 'll definitely have problems . can russia still be considered a dependable partner when it comes to gas supplies ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-joachim ziesing what i find completely unacceptable is that the dispute between russia and ukraine is being pushed on to the backs of other nations .
both russia and the ukraine should really be careful that other nations do n't begin to doubt their dependability .
what does this mean for the european union ?
what consequences can we expect ?
what the consequences will be is n't easy to say , because we certainly ca n't live without russian gas in the foreseeable future .
it is currently that largest gas supply sustaining us .
of course we need to diversify our gas supplies , and tap into other sources .
there are already a couple of lng -lrb- liquid natural gas -rrb- reserves that we can fall back on , which would also help us be more energy efficient .
i think that using less gas and replacing some of the gas we use with other sources is something we urgently need to do in order to be able to avoid situations like these .
but that is something we can do in the future .
what could help in the short term ?
there is n't a lot that can help in the short term .
we can fall back on the other sources .
we 'll have to use our gas reserves to get through this bottleneck .
especially since we are experiencing such cold temperatures right now , and this is going to raise the amount of gas needed to warm people 's houses .
i think we need to try and reduce our usage where we can .
that would certainly help . interview : sandra berndt -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

i would have thought that jews would have more compassion for the underdog considering their own past sufferring .
each side will have to learn to live with each other in the same land . - reiner schmitt , australia i feel very saddened that the government of germany has chosen to support both the us and israel on this inhuman conflict waged against people already in a very bad situation .
i would prefer to see the government seek to resolve the terrible conditions that palestinians have to bear .
if they were able to live in peace as well as isreali citizens do with the same freedoms , there would be no conflicts or extremism . - carol lee murphy , canada germany is still too shy to speak independantly from the us due its guilt because of the holocaust .
germany needs to find the courage to confront the situation like it is , regardless of who is the perpetrator .
israel policy of bombs versus rockets will not bring peace to palestine .
only by solving the future of a palestinian state and the role of jerusalem between two states will the situation be solved .
but the hardliners in israel do not give the palestinians the same right they want for themselves , the right to exist . - rolf brulez .
australia i am a mother of two very young children and i simply ca n't imagine how one human can do this to another .
even with all these images of innocent people dying and wounded , the rest of the world seems to be sleeping .

the eu was there during elections with a full complement of election monitors and testified that the elections were " clean " and only minor problems were reported at the polling stations .
just because some western political leaders do n't like the policies of hamas , does n't mean they were not democratically-elected .
therefore , they are the legally permitted and elected representatives of the palestinian people . - john brian shannon , canada almost everyone is demanding that israel stop it 's " aggression " in gaza .
who is blaming iran and syria for their original financing and arranging the arms flow to hamas in gaza ? - charles akselrad , us i support the german government decision to support israel concerning the attacks on gaza . - dennis young , us if the eu wants to have a role in resolving the conflict between israel and gaza , the eu should seek to discover the gazans who do not support hamas and give them some media exposure .

thursday , russian and ukrainian officials held a surprise meeting before talks in brussels . the unexpected meeting in moscow of the heads of the russian and ukrainian gas companies at the heart of the dispute was called to discuss the gas crisis .
no details have been released of the meeting 's outcomes . the meeting was unexpected because russian gas supplier gazprom 's alexei miller and ukraine 's naftogaz 's oleh dubina were expected to meet eu officials thursday in brussels for talks . miller earlier repeated his company 's accusation that ukraine was stealing some of the russian gas transiting its pipelines for delivery to the rest of europe . " the volume of theft of russian gas on ukrainian territory rises every day , " miller told afp news agency . delivery suspension " according to the latest estimates , ukraine is stealing nearly 15 percent of gas delivered to the border between russia and ukraine , " he said . on jan .

" obviously there is a political dimension to this problem , " topolanek said in prague ahead of a meeting with the eu 's executive , the european commission . officials in brussels declined to elaborate on the substance of the eu threat , but experts believe some leverage may lie in the fact that ukraine has expressed strong interest in joining the eu , while both countries trade heavily with the bloc . damaged reputations ? prior to his arrival in prague , eu commission president jose manuel barroso accused the sides of holding the eu 's gas supply " hostage " because of their dispute over unpaid bills . " now the two countries ' reputation as reliable partners to the eu is at stake , " barroso told russian president vladimir putin and ukrainian prime minister yulia tymoshenko over the phone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gas enters germany through a pipeline at the czech border much of europe was forced to tap into its gas reserves while some countries began taking emergency steps after russia cut all supplies to the continent via ukraine early wednesday . hungary , germany , italy , austria , slovakia , greece , turkey and most of the balkan nations were among the hardest hit by the drop in russian gas , which has coincided with one of the coldest winters in decades , heightening fears of possible shortages over the coming days or weeks . in brussels , the european commission proposed sending observers to monitor russian gas flows through the ukraine as a way of helping resolve the standoff .
the offer was immediately taken up by ukrainian president viktor yushchenko . pain across europe in a letter to barroso , yushchenko suggested eu technicians could independently evaluate the volume of russian natural gas entering ukraine .
moscow has repeatedly accused kyiv of siphoning off gas destined to europe - a claim strongly denied by the ukrainians . meanwhile , hungary became one of the first european countries to impose restrictions on industrial gas use as underground reserves were being tapped at maximum capacity . serbia 's reserves were virtually depleted while bulgaria , which is 100 percent dependant on russian gas , was considering re-opening one of its soviet-era nuclear reactors - shut down for safety reasons when it joined the eu - in order to meet its energy needs . emergency measures were also triggered in slovakia , while poland was compensating for a complete cut-off by boosting supplies via neighboring belarus . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

if they were able to live in peace as well as isreali citizens do with the same freedoms , there would be no conflicts or extremism . - carol lee murphy , canada germany is still too shy to speak independantly from the us due its guilt because of the holocaust .
germany needs to find the courage to confront the situation like it is , regardless of who is the perpetrator .
israel policy of bombs versus rockets will not bring peace to palestine .
only by solving the future of a palestinian state and the role of jerusalem between two states will the situation be solved .
but the hardliners in israel do not give the palestinians the same right they want for themselves , the right to exist . - rolf brulez .
australia i am a mother of two very young children and i simply ca n't imagine how one human can do this to another .
even with all these images of innocent people dying and wounded , the rest of the world seems to be sleeping .
i pray togod and appeal to anyone who has a heart to stop the blood shed right now . - huma chaudhry , pakistan hamas was elected in a massive majority by the palestinian people .
the eu was there during elections with a full complement of election monitors and testified that the elections were " clean " and only minor problems were reported at the polling stations .
just because some western political leaders do n't like the policies of hamas , does n't mean they were not democratically-elected .
therefore , they are the legally permitted and elected representatives of the palestinian people . - john brian shannon , canada almost everyone is demanding that israel stop it 's " aggression " in gaza .
who is blaming iran and syria for their original financing and arranging the arms flow to hamas in gaza ? - charles akselrad , us i support the german government decision to support israel concerning the attacks on gaza . - dennis young , us if the eu wants to have a role in resolving the conflict between israel and gaza , the eu should seek to discover the gazans who do not support hamas and give them some media exposure .
the eu should also be supporting israel , which is confronting islamic terrorism instead of seeking ways to placate islamic terrorists and their agent provocateurs . - charles smyth , great britain compiled by dw staff -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

8 that its car sales exceeded one million in 2008 , the 13th consecutive year-on-year increase .
the record results go against the current downward trend in the car industry . the carmaker sold just over one million vehicles worldwide in 2008 , up 4.1 percent over 2007 .
december sales rose over 17.4 percent compared to the same month the previous year , at a time when its rivals have been badly hit by the global economic downturn . audi head rupert stadler said that his firm aims to become " the most attractive premium brand worldwide " in the car market .
he added that audi intends to build on its success by introducing new products in 2009 . company officials noted that 2008 was the first time that audi has broken the one million mark in sales .
the managers attributed much of the gain to the introduction of 12 new models , including the a4 saloon car and the q5 sports utility vehicle . the ingolstadt-based carmaker is bucking a trend in germany as well as elsewhere in the world .
car sales in germany , which is western europe 's biggest market , fell 6.6 percent in december .
in 2008 as a whole , german new car registrations were down by 1.9 percent over 2007 to 3.09 million .
audi is a subsidiary of volkswagen , germany 's biggest car manufacturer . kpmg consultants released a survey on january 8 , suggesting that senior german auto industry executives feel the situation will stay bleak through 2013 .
the study of 200 companies showed that respondents expect wildly fluctuating earnings during that period .
some respondents said that they are not in a position to make a reliable estimate of their companies ' profitability . dw staff -lrb- pgm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche welle : how serious is the situation ?

hans-joachim ziesing : i think there is a bit of a difference between some european countries and germany .
i believe in germany it is n't going to get cold anytime soon , though if the interruption lasts longer then there will certainly be problems here .
but we need to ensure that we have other supply sources - like the netherlands and norway - and that we keep our reserves full .
we 'll certainly be able to deal with the interruption for the time being , but not if it lasts for more than a couple of weeks .
then we 'll definitely have problems . can russia still be considered a dependable partner when it comes to gas supplies ?

what does this mean for the european union ?
what consequences can we expect ?
what the consequences will be is n't easy to say , because we certainly ca n't live without russian gas in the foreseeable future .
it is currently that largest gas supply sustaining us .
of course we need to diversify our gas supplies , and tap into other sources .
there are already a couple of lng -lrb- liquid natural gas -rrb- reserves that we can fall back on , which would also help us be more energy efficient .

there is n't a lot that can help in the short term .
we can fall back on the other sources .
we 'll have to use our gas reserves to get through this bottleneck .

no details have been released of the meeting 's outcomes . the meeting was unexpected because russian gas supplier gazprom 's alexei miller and ukraine 's naftogaz 's oleh dubina were expected to meet eu officials thursday in brussels for talks . miller earlier repeated his company 's accusation that ukraine was stealing some of the russian gas transiting its pipelines for delivery to the rest of europe .

the offer was immediately taken up by ukrainian president viktor yushchenko . pain across europe in a letter to barroso , yushchenko suggested eu technicians could independently evaluate the volume of russian natural gas entering ukraine .

" i 'm negotiating with cologne .
next week i 'll resume discussions and i think we 'll come to some kind of agreement before the end of the month , " hoeness told television channel dsf from dubai where the club are at a training camp .
cologne earlier offered bayern 7.5 million euros for the 23-year-old podolski , but that offer was rejected .
bayern , who paid 10 million for podolski in 2006 , are hoping to recoup at least that much .
bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge was reported as saying that cologne had moved closer to meeting bayern estimation for the striker on thursday .
" everything is looking good .
i am confident it will work out , " rummenigge wasquoted as saying in the daily tz newspaper . podolski would like to return to his former club after failing to establish a first-team place at the german champions . " the player only wants to go to cologne .
they will have to offer a bit more but there is no longer much difference between what they are offering and what we want , " rummenigge said . bayern would like the podolski transfer settled by the end of january for a move at the end of the season . a number of other clubs are reportedly showing an interest in the germany international , and some media reports have also linked him with sv hamburg . bayern general manager uli hoeness said wednesday in dubai , where bayern are in training during the winter break , that podolski would not be sold at a bargain price . cologne would benefit from a lower price as they had sold the player to bayern , but " we would demand more from other clubs , " he said . cologne manager michael meier was quoted in the koelner stadtanzeiger newspaper just before christmas as saying that there was no chance that podolski , who started his professional career with cologne , would return to the club . " it would be a wonderful christmas story , but it will not happen , " he said .
" my offer to bayern was as high as i could go .
if i had gone further , i would have gone beyond the club mandate . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . i do not agree with germany 's stance in support of support israel .
the same old mistakes are being made .
violence is fought with violence and that by a military power which is much much stronger to wipe out the weaker opponent .
transformation can only happen through love and compassion .
i would have thought that jews would have more compassion for the underdog considering their own past sufferring .
each side will have to learn to live with each other in the same land . - reiner schmitt , australia i feel very saddened that the government of germany has chosen to support both the us and israel on this inhuman conflict waged against people already in a very bad situation .
i would prefer to see the government seek to resolve the terrible conditions that palestinians have to bear .
if they were able to live in peace as well as isreali citizens do with the same freedoms , there would be no conflicts or extremism . - carol lee murphy , canada germany is still too shy to speak independantly from the us due its guilt because of the holocaust .
germany needs to find the courage to confront the situation like it is , regardless of who is the perpetrator .
israel policy of bombs versus rockets will not bring peace to palestine .
only by solving the future of a palestinian state and the role of jerusalem between two states will the situation be solved .
but the hardliners in israel do not give the palestinians the same right they want for themselves , the right to exist . - rolf brulez .
australia i am a mother of two very young children and i simply ca n't imagine how one human can do this to another .
even with all these images of innocent people dying and wounded , the rest of the world seems to be sleeping .
i pray togod and appeal to anyone who has a heart to stop the blood shed right now . - huma chaudhry , pakistan hamas was elected in a massive majority by the palestinian people .
the eu was there during elections with a full complement of election monitors and testified that the elections were " clean " and only minor problems were reported at the polling stations .
just because some western political leaders do n't like the policies of hamas , does n't mean they were not democratically-elected .
therefore , they are the legally permitted and elected representatives of the palestinian people . - john brian shannon , canada almost everyone is demanding that israel stop it 's " aggression " in gaza .
who is blaming iran and syria for their original financing and arranging the arms flow to hamas in gaza ? - charles akselrad , us i support the german government decision to support israel concerning the attacks on gaza . - dennis young , us if the eu wants to have a role in resolving the conflict between israel and gaza , the eu should seek to discover the gazans who do not support hamas and give them some media exposure .
the eu should also be supporting israel , which is confronting islamic terrorism instead of seeking ways to placate islamic terrorists and their agent provocateurs . - charles smyth , great britain compiled by dw staff -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de rockets from lebanon hit israel as gaza offensive continues rockets from southern lebanon were fired into northern israel early thursday , prompting israeli forces to return fire , officials said as the israeli military pressed on with its air and ground assault on the gaza strip .

their trial began thursday , jan .
8 . the men have dismissed the charges as unfounded , saying that their contacts with batasuna were part of efforts by prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero to find a negotiated solution to the long-standing basque problem .
ibarretxe told a preliminary hearing in 2008 that he is committed to " talk to everyone " to find a end to a problem that has bedeviled spanish politics for decades . lopez said that he is " absolutely convinced " there will be no convictions , arguing that " no court will say that politics should not be used to move on the road to peace .

he said a new role should be created for governments and moral values . " either we re-found capitalism or we destroy it , " sarkozy said as he called for an economic system based on the value of work rather than finance . " purely financial capitalism has perverted the logic of capitalism , " the french president said .
" financial capitalism is a system of irresponsibility and ... is amoral .
it is a system where the logic of the market excuses everything . " the french leader said the structure of a new system of regulation should be agreed on before april 's g20 summit in london . sarkozy : us dominance at an end bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world leaders are hopeful obama will come to the table sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel collectively used the summit to urge the us not to stand in the way of tighter controls on world financial markets . " i 've always in my political life been a supporter of a close alliance with the united states but let 's be clear : in the 21st century , a single nation can no longer say what we must do or what we must think , " sarkozy said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 08.01.2009 top basque leaders on trial over eta contacts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : batasuna 's otegi -lrb- right -rrb- criticized the trial two leading basque politicians are on trial in bilbao on charges that they held talks in mid-2006 with leaders of batasuna , the political wing of the banned separatist group eta . the head of the basque government , juan jose ibarretxe of the basque nationalist party -lrb- pnv -rrb- , and the regional leader of the opposition socialist party , patxi lopez , face possible jail terms and bans on political activity amid preparations for regional elections on march 1 .
their trial began thursday , jan .
8 . the men have dismissed the charges as unfounded , saying that their contacts with batasuna were part of efforts by prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero to find a negotiated solution to the long-standing basque problem .
ibarretxe told a preliminary hearing in 2008 that he is committed to " talk to everyone " to find a end to a problem that has bedeviled spanish politics for decades . lopez said that he is " absolutely convinced " there will be no convictions , arguing that " no court will say that politics should not be used to move on the road to peace . " prosecutors have called for the charges to be dropped .
they said that the negotiations were part of the men 's legitimate " political activities " and were aimed at " finding a solution to the basque conflict . " socialist legislator rodolfo ares is also on trial , as are four senior members of batasuna .
arnaldo otegi , who is a former batasuna spokesman , stressed that " this will be the only case in europe where the participants in talks will be in the dock for having tried to find solutions . " basque judge alfonso gonzalez guija said " it would be very healthy for democracy not to criminalize political life . " judge says the issue is crime bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basque regional president ibarretxe has to answer to the court but judge roberto saiz of the basque criminal court disagrees .
he has argued that there are " indications of a crime " and insisted in october 2007 that the trial go ahead . the charges were brought by two organizations , dignity and justice and the forum ermua .
the latter wants the accused to face prison terms of up to four years and bans on political activity .
the two groups say that the talks were part of an effort to " legitimize " batasuna . critics argue that the charges are aimed at discrediting zapatero and his policies .
during the july 2006 talks , ares appeared before television cameras with otegi , whom he urged to " leave the field of violence , " enter political life , and " take part in a round table of political parties . " the four separatist politicians are charged with defying a court order to dissolve batasuna , which was banned in 2003 for refusing to break with eta , and to condemn violence .

deutsche welle : how serious is the situation ?
are things about to get very cold in germany ?
hans-joachim ziesing : i think there is a bit of a difference between some european countries and germany .
i believe in germany it is n't going to get cold anytime soon , though if the interruption lasts longer then there will certainly be problems here .
but we need to ensure that we have other supply sources - like the netherlands and norway - and that we keep our reserves full .
we 'll certainly be able to deal with the interruption for the time being , but not if it lasts for more than a couple of weeks .
then we 'll definitely have problems . can russia still be considered a dependable partner when it comes to gas supplies ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-joachim ziesing what i find completely unacceptable is that the dispute between russia and ukraine is being pushed on to the backs of other nations .
both russia and the ukraine should really be careful that other nations do n't begin to doubt their dependability .
what does this mean for the european union ?
what consequences can we expect ?
what the consequences will be is n't easy to say , because we certainly ca n't live without russian gas in the foreseeable future .
it is currently that largest gas supply sustaining us .
of course we need to diversify our gas supplies , and tap into other sources .
there are already a couple of lng -lrb- liquid natural gas -rrb- reserves that we can fall back on , which would also help us be more energy efficient .
i think that using less gas and replacing some of the gas we use with other sources is something we urgently need to do in order to be able to avoid situations like these .
but that is something we can do in the future .
what could help in the short term ?
there is n't a lot that can help in the short term .
we can fall back on the other sources .
we 'll have to use our gas reserves to get through this bottleneck .
especially since we are experiencing such cold temperatures right now , and this is going to raise the amount of gas needed to warm people 's houses .
i think we need to try and reduce our usage where we can .
that would certainly help . interview : sandra berndt -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

no details have been released of the meeting 's outcomes . the meeting was unexpected because russian gas supplier gazprom 's alexei miller and ukraine 's naftogaz 's oleh dubina were expected to meet eu officials thursday in brussels for talks . miller earlier repeated his company 's accusation that ukraine was stealing some of the russian gas transiting its pipelines for delivery to the rest of europe .

" obviously there is a political dimension to this problem , " topolanek said in prague ahead of a meeting with the eu 's executive , the european commission . officials in brussels declined to elaborate on the substance of the eu threat , but experts believe some leverage may lie in the fact that ukraine has expressed strong interest in joining the eu , while both countries trade heavily with the bloc . damaged reputations ? prior to his arrival in prague , eu commission president jose manuel barroso accused the sides of holding the eu 's gas supply " hostage " because of their dispute over unpaid bills .

in an interview with the german daily general anzeiger , the head of the christian democrats in the german parliament , volker kauder , said that the assistance in the form of guarantees is designed for companies struggling to secure funding from banks or are unable to raise capital on the financial markets .
" as long as banks are not increasing their appetite to award loans , the public powers must make investments possible for our economy by making loans available , " he said according to the interview published thursday .
observers have criticized the rescue package .
german newsmagazine spiegel 's web site posted a warning from economists roland doehrn and christoph m. schmidt of the economic research institute in essen , who said there could be negative consequences .
they said political pressure could hold up the decision on which companies deserve help .
they also warned that unless the 400-billion-euro rescue package for the nation 's banking sector was properly applied , there was no hope of ever ending the credit crisis .

their trial began thursday , jan .
8 . the men have dismissed the charges as unfounded , saying that their contacts with batasuna were part of efforts by prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero to find a negotiated solution to the long-standing basque problem .
ibarretxe told a preliminary hearing in 2008 that he is committed to " talk to everyone " to find a end to a problem that has bedeviled spanish politics for decades . lopez said that he is " absolutely convinced " there will be no convictions , arguing that " no court will say that politics should not be used to move on the road to peace . " prosecutors have called for the charges to be dropped .
they said that the negotiations were part of the men 's legitimate " political activities " and were aimed at " finding a solution to the basque conflict . " socialist legislator rodolfo ares is also on trial , as are four senior members of batasuna .
arnaldo otegi , who is a former batasuna spokesman , stressed that " this will be the only case in europe where the participants in talks will be in the dock for having tried to find solutions . " basque judge alfonso gonzalez guija said " it would be very healthy for democracy not to criminalize political life .

the latter wants the accused to face prison terms of up to four years and bans on political activity .
the two groups say that the talks were part of an effort to " legitimize " batasuna . critics argue that the charges are aimed at discrediting zapatero and his policies .
during the july 2006 talks , ares appeared before television cameras with otegi , whom he urged to " leave the field of violence , " enter political life , and " take part in a round table of political parties . " the four separatist politicians are charged with defying a court order to dissolve batasuna , which was banned in 2003 for refusing to break with eta , and to condemn violence .
eta has killed 825 people in a 40-year effort aimed at securing basque independence .
zapatero has taken a tougher approach toward eta since at least june 2007 , when it ended a 15-month ceasefire and refused to resume talks . the court may ask for written responses to its questions from zapatero and from his two predecessors , jose maria aznar and felipe gonzalez .

he said a new role should be created for governments and moral values . " either we re-found capitalism or we destroy it , " sarkozy said as he called for an economic system based on the value of work rather than finance . " purely financial capitalism has perverted the logic of capitalism , " the french president said .
" financial capitalism is a system of irresponsibility and ... is amoral .
it is a system where the logic of the market excuses everything . " the french leader said the structure of a new system of regulation should be agreed on before april 's g20 summit in london . sarkozy : us dominance at an end bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world leaders are hopeful obama will come to the table sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel collectively used the summit to urge the us not to stand in the way of tighter controls on world financial markets . " i 've always in my political life been a supporter of a close alliance with the united states but let 's be clear : in the 21st century , a single nation can no longer say what we must do or what we must think , " sarkozy said . " we 'll take our decisions on april 2 in london , " he added .
" perhaps the united states will join us in this change .
i hope so with all my heart because a new president will bring his intelligence , dynamism and his open mind and we will change the world with the united states . " but we will not accept the status quo , we will not accept stagnation . " merkel said : " no country can act alone in this day and age ... even the united states , however powerful they may be . " merkel : politicians must remain vigilant bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says reforms must persist after the crisis is resolved merkel called for the establishment of a " charter for a long-term reasonable economy " similar to the united nations charter . " our response -lrb- to the economic crisis -rrb- must be more than a few rules , " merkel said .
" the crisis is an opportunity to create an international architecture of institutions . " " it is possible that alongside the -lrb- un -rrb- security council , we could also have an economic council that would have a different role from ecosoc , " merkel said , referring to the united nations economic and social council . she singled out the us budget deficit and china 's current account surplus as bones of contention and also called on politicians to remain firm even after the crisis has been resolved . " there is a risk that when everything is functioning normally again that the financial institutions will tell politicians not to meddle , " she cautioned .
" we must remain determined . " blair : no turning back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair says the financial crisis is still evolving former british prime minister tony blair , who is one of the co-sponsors of the symposium with sarkozy , told participants that investment patterns must be changed . " this economic crisis is the biggest , most complex , most delicate economic challenge of our lifetime .
it is the most tricky intellectual challenge of any kind i have ever encountered and it is still evolving , " blair said . " what is plain is that the financial system has altered in its fundamentals and can never be the same again . " what is unavoidable in the longer term is a recasting of the system of international supervision . " we must invest in the future , " blair said , calling for funds to be put into renewable energy , science , innovation and education . the symposium was downgraded from a summit because few world leaders chose to attend .
in addition to sarkozy and merkel , only liberian president ellen johnson-sirleaf was present on thursday . other participants at the two-day conference include economics nobel prize winners amartya sen and joseph stiglitz , world trade organization head pascal lamy and the president of the european central bank , jean-claude trichet . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

8 that its car sales exceeded one million in 2008 , the 13th consecutive year-on-year increase .
the record results go against the current downward trend in the car industry . the carmaker sold just over one million vehicles worldwide in 2008 , up 4.1 percent over 2007 .
december sales rose over 17.4 percent compared to the same month the previous year , at a time when its rivals have been badly hit by the global economic downturn . audi head rupert stadler said that his firm aims to become " the most attractive premium brand worldwide " in the car market .
he added that audi intends to build on its success by introducing new products in 2009 . company officials noted that 2008 was the first time that audi has broken the one million mark in sales .
the managers attributed much of the gain to the introduction of 12 new models , including the a4 saloon car and the q5 sports utility vehicle . the ingolstadt-based carmaker is bucking a trend in germany as well as elsewhere in the world .
car sales in germany , which is western europe 's biggest market , fell 6.6 percent in december .
in 2008 as a whole , german new car registrations were down by 1.9 percent over 2007 to 3.09 million .
audi is a subsidiary of volkswagen , germany 's biggest car manufacturer . kpmg consultants released a survey on january 8 , suggesting that senior german auto industry executives feel the situation will stay bleak through 2013 .
the study of 200 companies showed that respondents expect wildly fluctuating earnings during that period .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . i do not agree with germany 's stance in support of support israel .
the same old mistakes are being made .
violence is fought with violence and that by a military power which is much much stronger to wipe out the weaker opponent .
transformation can only happen through love and compassion .
i would have thought that jews would have more compassion for the underdog considering their own past sufferring .
each side will have to learn to live with each other in the same land . - reiner schmitt , australia i feel very saddened that the government of germany has chosen to support both the us and israel on this inhuman conflict waged against people already in a very bad situation .
i would prefer to see the government seek to resolve the terrible conditions that palestinians have to bear .
if they were able to live in peace as well as isreali citizens do with the same freedoms , there would be no conflicts or extremism . - carol lee murphy , canada germany is still too shy to speak independantly from the us due its guilt because of the holocaust .
germany needs to find the courage to confront the situation like it is , regardless of who is the perpetrator .
israel policy of bombs versus rockets will not bring peace to palestine .
only by solving the future of a palestinian state and the role of jerusalem between two states will the situation be solved .
but the hardliners in israel do not give the palestinians the same right they want for themselves , the right to exist . - rolf brulez .
australia i am a mother of two very young children and i simply ca n't imagine how one human can do this to another .
even with all these images of innocent people dying and wounded , the rest of the world seems to be sleeping .
i pray togod and appeal to anyone who has a heart to stop the blood shed right now . - huma chaudhry , pakistan hamas was elected in a massive majority by the palestinian people .
the eu was there during elections with a full complement of election monitors and testified that the elections were " clean " and only minor problems were reported at the polling stations .
just because some western political leaders do n't like the policies of hamas , does n't mean they were not democratically-elected .
therefore , they are the legally permitted and elected representatives of the palestinian people . - john brian shannon , canada almost everyone is demanding that israel stop it 's " aggression " in gaza .
who is blaming iran and syria for their original financing and arranging the arms flow to hamas in gaza ? - charles akselrad , us i support the german government decision to support israel concerning the attacks on gaza . - dennis young , us if the eu wants to have a role in resolving the conflict between israel and gaza , the eu should seek to discover the gazans who do not support hamas and give them some media exposure .
the eu should also be supporting israel , which is confronting islamic terrorism instead of seeking ways to placate islamic terrorists and their agent provocateurs . - charles smyth , great britain compiled by dw staff -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

7 it obtained a bridging loan of 400 million euros -lrb- $ 545 million -rrb- from a consortium of about 30 lenders in a deal that the billionaire owner concluded before his death two days earlier . the agreement requires vem to sell its drug company ratiopharm and for merckle 's son ludwig to leave that firm , which employs 5,400 people and had 1.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.5 billion -rrb- in sales in 2008 . the sale of ratiopharm is aimed at ending a liquidity crisis in vem , which has about 100,000 employees altogether .
only ratiopharm is mentioned in the deal with the banks , and an administrator will be appointed to manage the transition . german media reports say the sale is unlikely to take place before the end of 2009 .
one reason for the delay is that it will take time to work out details of a plan to put the company 's affairs in order . a second issue is reportedly the assumption among those involved in the deal that international markets will be less volitile in one year , which would supposedly make it easier to secure a better price for ratiopharm . the company is one of the central elements of vem .
other major components of merckle 's empire are heidelbergcement and the drug wholesaler phoenix . merckle -lrb- 74 -rrb- was germany 's fifth wealthiest man and ranked 94th on forbes list of the world 's richest people .
he said in a recent interview that he had lived through many stock market crashes but was not prepared for " a banking and financial crisis on the scale " of the present one .
his family said after his death that the impact of the crisis on his traditional , family-run business he built up in the course of his lifetime left him " a broken man .

their trial began thursday , jan .
8 . the men have dismissed the charges as unfounded , saying that their contacts with batasuna were part of efforts by prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero to find a negotiated solution to the long-standing basque problem .
ibarretxe told a preliminary hearing in 2008 that he is committed to " talk to everyone " to find a end to a problem that has bedeviled spanish politics for decades . lopez said that he is " absolutely convinced " there will be no convictions , arguing that " no court will say that politics should not be used to move on the road to peace . " prosecutors have called for the charges to be dropped .
they said that the negotiations were part of the men 's legitimate " political activities " and were aimed at " finding a solution to the basque conflict . " socialist legislator rodolfo ares is also on trial , as are four senior members of batasuna .
arnaldo otegi , who is a former batasuna spokesman , stressed that " this will be the only case in europe where the participants in talks will be in the dock for having tried to find solutions . " basque judge alfonso gonzalez guija said " it would be very healthy for democracy not to criminalize political life .

he has argued that there are " indications of a crime " and insisted in october 2007 that the trial go ahead . the charges were brought by two organizations , dignity and justice and the forum ermua .
the latter wants the accused to face prison terms of up to four years and bans on political activity .
the two groups say that the talks were part of an effort to " legitimize " batasuna . critics argue that the charges are aimed at discrediting zapatero and his policies .
during the july 2006 talks , ares appeared before television cameras with otegi , whom he urged to " leave the field of violence , " enter political life , and " take part in a round table of political parties . " the four separatist politicians are charged with defying a court order to dissolve batasuna , which was banned in 2003 for refusing to break with eta , and to condemn violence .
eta has killed 825 people in a 40-year effort aimed at securing basque independence .
zapatero has taken a tougher approach toward eta since at least june 2007 , when it ended a 15-month ceasefire and refused to resume talks . the court may ask for written responses to its questions from zapatero and from his two predecessors , jose maria aznar and felipe gonzalez .

" i 'm negotiating with cologne .
next week i 'll resume discussions and i think we 'll come to some kind of agreement before the end of the month , " hoeness told television channel dsf from dubai where the club are at a training camp .
cologne earlier offered bayern 7.5 million euros for the 23-year-old podolski , but that offer was rejected .
bayern , who paid 10 million for podolski in 2006 , are hoping to recoup at least that much .
bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge was reported as saying that cologne had moved closer to meeting bayern estimation for the striker on thursday .
" everything is looking good .
i am confident it will work out , " rummenigge wasquoted as saying in the daily tz newspaper . podolski would like to return to his former club after failing to establish a first-team place at the german champions . " the player only wants to go to cologne .
they will have to offer a bit more but there is no longer much difference between what they are offering and what we want , " rummenigge said . bayern would like the podolski transfer settled by the end of january for a move at the end of the season . a number of other clubs are reportedly showing an interest in the germany international , and some media reports have also linked him with sv hamburg . bayern general manager uli hoeness said wednesday in dubai , where bayern are in training during the winter break , that podolski would not be sold at a bargain price . cologne would benefit from a lower price as they had sold the player to bayern , but " we would demand more from other clubs , " he said . cologne manager michael meier was quoted in the koelner stadtanzeiger newspaper just before christmas as saying that there was no chance that podolski , who started his professional career with cologne , would return to the club . " it would be a wonderful christmas story , but it will not happen , " he said .
" my offer to bayern was as high as i could go .

thursday , russian and ukrainian officials held a surprise meeting before talks in brussels . the unexpected meeting in moscow of the heads of the russian and ukrainian gas companies at the heart of the dispute was called to discuss the gas crisis .
no details have been released of the meeting 's outcomes . the meeting was unexpected because russian gas supplier gazprom 's alexei miller and ukraine 's naftogaz 's oleh dubina were expected to meet eu officials thursday in brussels for talks . miller earlier repeated his company 's accusation that ukraine was stealing some of the russian gas transiting its pipelines for delivery to the rest of europe . " the volume of theft of russian gas on ukrainian territory rises every day , " miller told afp news agency . delivery suspension " according to the latest estimates , ukraine is stealing nearly 15 percent of gas delivered to the border between russia and ukraine , " he said . on jan .
1 , russia suspended delivery of gas for use by ukraine after the two countries failed to agree a rate for 2009 and on the amount kyiv owed for previous deliveries . the subsequent gas supply problems , which each country has blamed on the other , have begun to be felt in several european union countries , reaching as far west as italy and france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom ceo miller says ukraine has been siphoning approximately 80 percent of russia 's gas exports to europe pass through ukraine . ultimatum from eu on wednesday , jan .
7 , the eu gave russia and ukraine 24 hours to resolve their commercial dispute and resume gas deliveries to europe or face unspecified political consequences . " if supplies are not restored tomorrow , we will have to see a strong intervention by the eu , " said czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country holds the bloc 's rotating presidency . " obviously there is a political dimension to this problem , " topolanek said in prague ahead of a meeting with the eu 's executive , the european commission . officials in brussels declined to elaborate on the substance of the eu threat , but experts believe some leverage may lie in the fact that ukraine has expressed strong interest in joining the eu , while both countries trade heavily with the bloc . damaged reputations ? prior to his arrival in prague , eu commission president jose manuel barroso accused the sides of holding the eu 's gas supply " hostage " because of their dispute over unpaid bills . " now the two countries ' reputation as reliable partners to the eu is at stake , " barroso told russian president vladimir putin and ukrainian prime minister yulia tymoshenko over the phone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gas enters germany through a pipeline at the czech border much of europe was forced to tap into its gas reserves while some countries began taking emergency steps after russia cut all supplies to the continent via ukraine early wednesday . hungary , germany , italy , austria , slovakia , greece , turkey and most of the balkan nations were among the hardest hit by the drop in russian gas , which has coincided with one of the coldest winters in decades , heightening fears of possible shortages over the coming days or weeks . in brussels , the european commission proposed sending observers to monitor russian gas flows through the ukraine as a way of helping resolve the standoff .
the offer was immediately taken up by ukrainian president viktor yushchenko . pain across europe in a letter to barroso , yushchenko suggested eu technicians could independently evaluate the volume of russian natural gas entering ukraine .
moscow has repeatedly accused kyiv of siphoning off gas destined to europe - a claim strongly denied by the ukrainians . meanwhile , hungary became one of the first european countries to impose restrictions on industrial gas use as underground reserves were being tapped at maximum capacity . serbia 's reserves were virtually depleted while bulgaria , which is 100 percent dependant on russian gas , was considering re-opening one of its soviet-era nuclear reactors - shut down for safety reasons when it joined the eu - in order to meet its energy needs . emergency measures were also triggered in slovakia , while poland was compensating for a complete cut-off by boosting supplies via neighboring belarus . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

talks in brussels between gazprom and eu officials have given rise to hopes that a breakthrough will soon be reached in the european gas supply crisis .
but some conditions must be met first . the head of russian gas giant gazprom said he was willing to reopen supplies to the european union as quickly as possible , on condition that the eu monitors the flow of gas through ukraine . " as soon as the eu observers are in ukraine and have access to the gas pipelines , the gas supplies should be restored as soon as possible , " alexei miller said after a meeting in brussels with the president of the european parliament , hans-gert poettering . ukrainian officials also said they hoped for a quick agreement . " we could possibly sign the contracts in moscow this evening : " i hope it will come to that , " bogdan sokolovski , energy envoy to ukrainian president viktor yushchenko , said . eu seeks guarantees on deliveries but eu officials insisted that there would only be a point in despatching the mission if both russia and ukraine guaranteed to restart deliveries to europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu parliament president poettering met the parties " we do not want to send observers just to check that the situation is not changing .
we want to send observers to make sure that the situation is changing , that supply and transit is resumed , " european commission spokesman johannes laitenberger said . the official statements came hours after eu spokesmen confirmed that the bloc was ready to send a mission of gas experts to ukraine to make sure that any russian gas entering the country bound for european clients actually made it to its destination . a european commission energy director told reuters news service that eu observers would be ready in two days . moscow , kyiv trade accusations gazprom has repeatedly accused ukraine of siphoning off gas for european clients to meet its own needs , after the russian company shut off direct deliveries to ukraine in a row over contract terms . on tuesday , jan .
5 , gazprom stopped all deliveries of gas through ukraine to europe , saying that this was the only way to prevent such " thefts , " in a major escalation of the conflict which provoked outrage in europe . on thursday , jan 8 , both miller and his ukrainian counterpart , oleh dubyna , visited brussels to lobby for eu support in the row , which comes as temperatures across europe plunged to record lows . the eu refused to take sides , instead demanding that the gas be turned back on instantly . suppliers ' reputation ' at risk ' " in the short run the problem is with those who do n't receive the gas .

it fully suspended supplies of transit gas towards ukraine on wednesday , saying there was no longer any point delivering the gas because kyiiv had shut down the pipelines . ukraine said russia was deliberately starving europe of gas . southeast europe has borne the brunt of the disruption , but it has affected supplies as far west as france and germany as europe faced freezing mid-winter temperatures . europe is weathering the storm " a key point here , is that industrial stoppages are only now beginning to occur -lrb- mainly in gas intensive industries -rrb- , but would spread relatively rapidly if gas supplies remain limited , " martin blum , an economist at unicredit in vienna , told reuters news agency . based on gas use and reliance on russia as a source of gas , blum said hungary and slovakia looked most at risk from the halt in supplies .

talks in brussels between gazprom and eu officials have given rise to hopes that a breakthrough will soon be reached in the european gas supply crisis .
but some conditions must be met first . the head of russian gas giant gazprom said he was willing to reopen supplies to the european union as quickly as possible , on condition that the eu monitors the flow of gas through ukraine . " as soon as the eu observers are in ukraine and have access to the gas pipelines , the gas supplies should be restored as soon as possible , " alexei miller said after a meeting in brussels with the president of the european parliament , hans-gert poettering . ukrainian officials also said they hoped for a quick agreement . " we could possibly sign the contracts in moscow this evening : " i hope it will come to that , " bogdan sokolovski , energy envoy to ukrainian president viktor yushchenko , said . eu seeks guarantees on deliveries but eu officials insisted that there would only be a point in despatching the mission if both russia and ukraine guaranteed to restart deliveries to europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu parliament president poettering met the parties " we do not want to send observers just to check that the situation is not changing .
we want to send observers to make sure that the situation is changing , that supply and transit is resumed , " european commission spokesman johannes laitenberger said . the official statements came hours after eu spokesmen confirmed that the bloc was ready to send a mission of gas experts to ukraine to make sure that any russian gas entering the country bound for european clients actually made it to its destination . a european commission energy director told reuters news service that eu observers would be ready in two days . moscow , kyiv trade accusations gazprom has repeatedly accused ukraine of siphoning off gas for european clients to meet its own needs , after the russian company shut off direct deliveries to ukraine in a row over contract terms . on tuesday , jan .
5 , gazprom stopped all deliveries of gas through ukraine to europe , saying that this was the only way to prevent such " thefts , " in a major escalation of the conflict which provoked outrage in europe . on thursday , jan 8 , both miller and his ukrainian counterpart , oleh dubyna , visited brussels to lobby for eu support in the row , which comes as temperatures across europe plunged to record lows . the eu refused to take sides , instead demanding that the gas be turned back on instantly . suppliers ' reputation ' at risk ' " in the short run the problem is with those who do n't receive the gas .
but in the medium and long term the problem is with those that do not appear as reliable suppliers and transit suppliers .
at this point in time this reputation is at risk , " laitenberger said . bildunterschrift : a cold front in europe has added to the urgency russia is the eu 's largest supplier of natural gas , accounting for some 25 percent of the bloc 's total consumption .
eighty percent of that gas passes through ukrainian pipelines . however , the current crisis , which is a near-perfect repeat of a row in 2006 , has sparked an impassioned debate across europe on the need to reduce the bloc 's reliance on both its former-soviet neighbors . this time around , the gas cut-offs have left hundreds of thousands of people in the balkans without gas , forced factories to shut down and disrupted deliveries as far west as france and germany . france and germany said russia had to honor its gas contracts with europe regardless of the dispute , but they also warned ukraine not to forget its own obligations . history of tensions " we expect the talks between ukraine and russia to yield quick results , " german chancellor angela merkel said in paris after talks with french president nicolas sarkozy . the dispute between kyiv and its former soviet master in moscow follows tensions over ukraine 's efforts to join nato , a move bitterly opposed by moscow and viewed with wariness even by european members of the alliance and by investors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom 's miller lobbied in brussels for support russia cut off gas for ukraine 's domestic consumption on new year 's day after disagreements over gas prices and debts owed by ukraine .
it fully suspended supplies of transit gas towards ukraine on wednesday , saying there was no longer any point delivering the gas because kyiiv had shut down the pipelines . ukraine said russia was deliberately starving europe of gas . southeast europe has borne the brunt of the disruption , but it has affected supplies as far west as france and germany as europe faced freezing mid-winter temperatures . europe is weathering the storm " a key point here , is that industrial stoppages are only now beginning to occur -lrb- mainly in gas intensive industries -rrb- , but would spread relatively rapidly if gas supplies remain limited , " martin blum , an economist at unicredit in vienna , told reuters news agency . based on gas use and reliance on russia as a source of gas , blum said hungary and slovakia looked most at risk from the halt in supplies .
bulgaria , serbia and croatia all had reserves reportedly below 10 days of average consumption , he added . the euro zone 's major economies have escaped significant economic repercussions , but france has reported a drop in supplies and an italian industry ministry spokesman said italy has begun tapping its stockpiles of natural gas . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

eighty percent of that gas passes through ukrainian pipelines . however , the current crisis , which is a near-perfect repeat of a row in 2006 , has sparked an impassioned debate across europe on the need to reduce the bloc 's reliance on both its former-soviet neighbors . this time around , the gas cut-offs have left hundreds of thousands of people in the balkans without gas , forced factories to shut down and disrupted deliveries as far west as france and germany . france and germany said russia had to honor its gas contracts with europe regardless of the dispute , but they also warned ukraine not to forget its own obligations . history of tensions " we expect the talks between ukraine and russia to yield quick results , " german chancellor angela merkel said in paris after talks with french president nicolas sarkozy . the dispute between kyiv and its former soviet master in moscow follows tensions over ukraine 's efforts to join nato , a move bitterly opposed by moscow and viewed with wariness even by european members of the alliance and by investors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom 's miller lobbied in brussels for support russia cut off gas for ukraine 's domestic consumption on new year 's day after disagreements over gas prices and debts owed by ukraine .
it fully suspended supplies of transit gas towards ukraine on wednesday , saying there was no longer any point delivering the gas because kyiiv had shut down the pipelines . ukraine said russia was deliberately starving europe of gas . southeast europe has borne the brunt of the disruption , but it has affected supplies as far west as france and germany as europe faced freezing mid-winter temperatures . europe is weathering the storm " a key point here , is that industrial stoppages are only now beginning to occur -lrb- mainly in gas intensive industries -rrb- , but would spread relatively rapidly if gas supplies remain limited , " martin blum , an economist at unicredit in vienna , told reuters news agency . based on gas use and reliance on russia as a source of gas , blum said hungary and slovakia looked most at risk from the halt in supplies .
bulgaria , serbia and croatia all had reserves reportedly below 10 days of average consumption , he added . the euro zone 's major economies have escaped significant economic repercussions , but france has reported a drop in supplies and an italian industry ministry spokesman said italy has begun tapping its stockpiles of natural gas . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she would not say what type of weaponry the army used . it was unclear whether thursday morning 's rocket fire was an isolated incident , or whether it marks the opening of another front in the violence between israel and islamist militants . meanwhile , residents in the southern gaza border town of rafah reported overnight heavy shelling by the israeli military .
the military said israel had bombed another 15 smuggling tunnels running under the border with egypt , as well as a house allegedly used by a militant commander who oversaw rocket attacks from the rafah area aimed at nearby israeli targets . some 5,000 residents of rafah fled to two un schools that had turned into shelters , after israeli helicopters had dropped leaflets warning them to leave their homes along the gaza-egypt border , saying hamas was using houses in the area to hide the entrances to tunnels used to smuggle weapons . british muslims : uk must pressure us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anger at the israeli offensive has been widespread in the muslim world meanwhile , a group of leading british muslims said british prime minister gordon brown must do more to pressure the us into condemning israel 's offensive on the gaza strip . representatives of muslim organizations that have been addressing extremism in the uk wrote in an open letter to brown that the 13-day siege of gaza by the israeli military would empower extremists and increase anger in muslim communities in western nations . the letter urged brown to " make concerted and successful efforts to convince the us administration of the dangers of its approach and to ensure the incoming obama administration forges a more enlightened direction . " as you are aware , the anger within uk muslim communities has reached acute levels of intensity , " said the letter from usama hasan , imam of al-tawhid mosque in london , and the islamic foundation 's dilwar hussain , among others . " the israeli government 's use of disproportionate force ... has revived extremist groups and empowered their message of violence and perennial conflict . " for muslims in the uk and abroad , we run the risk of potentially creating a loss of faith in the political process . " we also believe the uk - bilaterally and as part of the eu - has an important role to demonstrate to israel that the threshold of acceptable behavior has been perilously transgressed , " the letter said . israel wants us border presence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel wants the us to shore up its border with egypt the pleas came as israel pressed on with both its air and ground offensive in gaza on thursday , as government officials were due to travel to cairo to discuss truce proposals tabled by french president nicolas sarkozy and his egyptian counterpart hosni mubarak . the israeli delegation has said it wants to discuss the possibility of a permanent us presence along the gaza-egypt border , as part of the " guarantees " it is seeking from the egyptians and the international community that the smuggling of further rockets and parts into gaza will stop , israeli media reported . israel said wednesday it viewed egyptian-french attempts to reach a diplomatic solution to the gaza crisis " positively , " but it also threatened to expand its ground offensive if the diplomatic attempts failed . " israel welcomes the -lrb- franco-egyptian -rrb- initiative and is working on it and is interested in its success , " israeli government spokesman mark regev said .
israel insists on a halt to all rockets launched by hamas from the gaza strip and a weapons embargo to be imposed on the islamist movement , he said . hamas would ' consider peace proposal ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas says it would consider laying down its arms hamas politburo member mussa abu marzuk told al-arabiya tv it would " respect and consider any proposal that calls for ending the -lrb- israeli -rrb- aggression and for the withdrawal of the -lrb- israeli -rrb- army . " hamas also opposed any possibility of international troops coming to the gaza strip to reinforce a truce , he said .
germany has expressed its willingness to send troops , if either side wanted such a force . the israeli cabinet authorized wednesday a continuation of the gaza offensive . the israeli delegation to cairo includes amos gilad , the head of the israeli defense ministry 's diplomatic-security bureau and prime minister ehud olmert 's foreign policy adviser shalom turgeman . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

7 it obtained a bridging loan of 400 million euros -lrb- $ 545 million -rrb- from a consortium of about 30 lenders in a deal that the billionaire owner concluded before his death two days earlier . the agreement requires vem to sell its drug company ratiopharm and for merckle 's son ludwig to leave that firm , which employs 5,400 people and had 1.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.5 billion -rrb- in sales in 2008 . the sale of ratiopharm is aimed at ending a liquidity crisis in vem , which has about 100,000 employees altogether .
only ratiopharm is mentioned in the deal with the banks , and an administrator will be appointed to manage the transition . german media reports say the sale is unlikely to take place before the end of 2009 .
one reason for the delay is that it will take time to work out details of a plan to put the company 's affairs in order . a second issue is reportedly the assumption among those involved in the deal that international markets will be less volitile in one year , which would supposedly make it easier to secure a better price for ratiopharm . the company is one of the central elements of vem .
other major components of merckle 's empire are heidelbergcement and the drug wholesaler phoenix . merckle -lrb- 74 -rrb- was germany 's fifth wealthiest man and ranked 94th on forbes list of the world 's richest people .
he said in a recent interview that he had lived through many stock market crashes but was not prepared for " a banking and financial crisis on the scale " of the present one .
his family said after his death that the impact of the crisis on his traditional , family-run business he built up in the course of his lifetime left him " a broken man .

" purely financial capitalism has perverted the logic of capitalism , " the french president said .

i hope so with all my heart because a new president will bring his intelligence , dynamism and his open mind and we will change the world with the united states .

" " it is possible that alongside the -lrb- un -rrb- security council , we could also have an economic council that would have a different role from ecosoc , " merkel said , referring to the united nations economic and social council . she singled out the us budget deficit and china 's current account surplus as bones of contention and also called on politicians to remain firm even after the crisis has been resolved .

deutsche welle : how serious is the situation ?
are things about to get very cold in germany ?
hans-joachim ziesing : i think there is a bit of a difference between some european countries and germany .
i believe in germany it is n't going to get cold anytime soon , though if the interruption lasts longer then there will certainly be problems here .
but we need to ensure that we have other supply sources - like the netherlands and norway - and that we keep our reserves full .
we 'll certainly be able to deal with the interruption for the time being , but not if it lasts for more than a couple of weeks .
then we 'll definitely have problems . can russia still be considered a dependable partner when it comes to gas supplies ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-joachim ziesing what i find completely unacceptable is that the dispute between russia and ukraine is being pushed on to the backs of other nations .
both russia and the ukraine should really be careful that other nations do n't begin to doubt their dependability .
what does this mean for the european union ?
what consequences can we expect ?
what the consequences will be is n't easy to say , because we certainly ca n't live without russian gas in the foreseeable future .
it is currently that largest gas supply sustaining us .
of course we need to diversify our gas supplies , and tap into other sources .
there are already a couple of lng -lrb- liquid natural gas -rrb- reserves that we can fall back on , which would also help us be more energy efficient .
i think that using less gas and replacing some of the gas we use with other sources is something we urgently need to do in order to be able to avoid situations like these .
but that is something we can do in the future .
what could help in the short term ?
there is n't a lot that can help in the short term .
we can fall back on the other sources .
we 'll have to use our gas reserves to get through this bottleneck .
especially since we are experiencing such cold temperatures right now , and this is going to raise the amount of gas needed to warm people 's houses .
i think we need to try and reduce our usage where we can .
that would certainly help . interview : sandra berndt -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . i do not agree with germany 's stance in support of support israel .
the same old mistakes are being made .
violence is fought with violence and that by a military power which is much much stronger to wipe out the weaker opponent .
transformation can only happen through love and compassion .
i would have thought that jews would have more compassion for the underdog considering their own past sufferring .
each side will have to learn to live with each other in the same land . - reiner schmitt , australia i feel very saddened that the government of germany has chosen to support both the us and israel on this inhuman conflict waged against people already in a very bad situation .
i would prefer to see the government seek to resolve the terrible conditions that palestinians have to bear .
if they were able to live in peace as well as isreali citizens do with the same freedoms , there would be no conflicts or extremism . - carol lee murphy , canada germany is still too shy to speak independantly from the us due its guilt because of the holocaust .
germany needs to find the courage to confront the situation like it is , regardless of who is the perpetrator .
israel policy of bombs versus rockets will not bring peace to palestine .
only by solving the future of a palestinian state and the role of jerusalem between two states will the situation be solved .
but the hardliners in israel do not give the palestinians the same right they want for themselves , the right to exist . - rolf brulez .
australia i am a mother of two very young children and i simply ca n't imagine how one human can do this to another .
even with all these images of innocent people dying and wounded , the rest of the world seems to be sleeping .
i pray togod and appeal to anyone who has a heart to stop the blood shed right now . - huma chaudhry , pakistan hamas was elected in a massive majority by the palestinian people .
the eu was there during elections with a full complement of election monitors and testified that the elections were " clean " and only minor problems were reported at the polling stations .
just because some western political leaders do n't like the policies of hamas , does n't mean they were not democratically-elected .
therefore , they are the legally permitted and elected representatives of the palestinian people . - john brian shannon , canada almost everyone is demanding that israel stop it 's " aggression " in gaza .
who is blaming iran and syria for their original financing and arranging the arms flow to hamas in gaza ? - charles akselrad , us i support the german government decision to support israel concerning the attacks on gaza . - dennis young , us if the eu wants to have a role in resolving the conflict between israel and gaza , the eu should seek to discover the gazans who do not support hamas and give them some media exposure .
the eu should also be supporting israel , which is confronting islamic terrorism instead of seeking ways to placate islamic terrorists and their agent provocateurs . - charles smyth , great britain compiled by dw staff -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she would not say what type of weaponry the army used . it was unclear whether thursday morning 's rocket fire was an isolated incident , or whether it marks the opening of another front in the violence between israel and islamist militants . meanwhile , residents in the southern gaza border town of rafah reported overnight heavy shelling by the israeli military .
the military said israel had bombed another 15 smuggling tunnels running under the border with egypt , as well as a house allegedly used by a militant commander who oversaw rocket attacks from the rafah area aimed at nearby israeli targets . some 5,000 residents of rafah fled to two un schools that had turned into shelters , after israeli helicopters had dropped leaflets warning them to leave their homes along the gaza-egypt border , saying hamas was using houses in the area to hide the entrances to tunnels used to smuggle weapons . british muslims : uk must pressure us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anger at the israeli offensive has been widespread in the muslim world meanwhile , a group of leading british muslims said british prime minister gordon brown must do more to pressure the us into condemning israel 's offensive on the gaza strip . representatives of muslim organizations that have been addressing extremism in the uk wrote in an open letter to brown that the 13-day siege of gaza by the israeli military would empower extremists and increase anger in muslim communities in western nations . the letter urged brown to " make concerted and successful efforts to convince the us administration of the dangers of its approach and to ensure the incoming obama administration forges a more enlightened direction . " as you are aware , the anger within uk muslim communities has reached acute levels of intensity , " said the letter from usama hasan , imam of al-tawhid mosque in london , and the islamic foundation 's dilwar hussain , among others . " the israeli government 's use of disproportionate force ... has revived extremist groups and empowered their message of violence and perennial conflict . " for muslims in the uk and abroad , we run the risk of potentially creating a loss of faith in the political process . " we also believe the uk - bilaterally and as part of the eu - has an important role to demonstrate to israel that the threshold of acceptable behavior has been perilously transgressed , " the letter said . israel wants us border presence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel wants the us to shore up its border with egypt the pleas came as israel pressed on with both its air and ground offensive in gaza on thursday , as government officials were due to travel to cairo to discuss truce proposals tabled by french president nicolas sarkozy and his egyptian counterpart hosni mubarak . the israeli delegation has said it wants to discuss the possibility of a permanent us presence along the gaza-egypt border , as part of the " guarantees " it is seeking from the egyptians and the international community that the smuggling of further rockets and parts into gaza will stop , israeli media reported . israel said wednesday it viewed egyptian-french attempts to reach a diplomatic solution to the gaza crisis " positively , " but it also threatened to expand its ground offensive if the diplomatic attempts failed . " israel welcomes the -lrb- franco-egyptian -rrb- initiative and is working on it and is interested in its success , " israeli government spokesman mark regev said .
israel insists on a halt to all rockets launched by hamas from the gaza strip and a weapons embargo to be imposed on the islamist movement , he said . hamas would ' consider peace proposal ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas says it would consider laying down its arms hamas politburo member mussa abu marzuk told al-arabiya tv it would " respect and consider any proposal that calls for ending the -lrb- israeli -rrb- aggression and for the withdrawal of the -lrb- israeli -rrb- army .

deutsche welle : how serious is the situation ?
are things about to get very cold in germany ?
hans-joachim ziesing : i think there is a bit of a difference between some european countries and germany .
i believe in germany it is n't going to get cold anytime soon , though if the interruption lasts longer then there will certainly be problems here .
but we need to ensure that we have other supply sources - like the netherlands and norway - and that we keep our reserves full .
we 'll certainly be able to deal with the interruption for the time being , but not if it lasts for more than a couple of weeks .
then we 'll definitely have problems . can russia still be considered a dependable partner when it comes to gas supplies ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-joachim ziesing what i find completely unacceptable is that the dispute between russia and ukraine is being pushed on to the backs of other nations .
both russia and the ukraine should really be careful that other nations do n't begin to doubt their dependability .
what does this mean for the european union ?
what consequences can we expect ?
what the consequences will be is n't easy to say , because we certainly ca n't live without russian gas in the foreseeable future .
it is currently that largest gas supply sustaining us .
of course we need to diversify our gas supplies , and tap into other sources .
there are already a couple of lng -lrb- liquid natural gas -rrb- reserves that we can fall back on , which would also help us be more energy efficient .
i think that using less gas and replacing some of the gas we use with other sources is something we urgently need to do in order to be able to avoid situations like these .
but that is something we can do in the future .
what could help in the short term ?
there is n't a lot that can help in the short term .
we can fall back on the other sources .
we 'll have to use our gas reserves to get through this bottleneck .
especially since we are experiencing such cold temperatures right now , and this is going to raise the amount of gas needed to warm people 's houses .

he said a new role should be created for governments and moral values . " either we re-found capitalism or we destroy it , " sarkozy said as he called for an economic system based on the value of work rather than finance . " purely financial capitalism has perverted the logic of capitalism , " the french president said .
" financial capitalism is a system of irresponsibility and ... is amoral .
it is a system where the logic of the market excuses everything . " the french leader said the structure of a new system of regulation should be agreed on before april 's g20 summit in london . sarkozy : us dominance at an end bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world leaders are hopeful obama will come to the table sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel collectively used the summit to urge the us not to stand in the way of tighter controls on world financial markets . " i 've always in my political life been a supporter of a close alliance with the united states but let 's be clear : in the 21st century , a single nation can no longer say what we must do or what we must think , " sarkozy said . " we 'll take our decisions on april 2 in london , " he added .
" perhaps the united states will join us in this change .
i hope so with all my heart because a new president will bring his intelligence , dynamism and his open mind and we will change the world with the united states . " but we will not accept the status quo , we will not accept stagnation . " merkel said : " no country can act alone in this day and age ... even the united states , however powerful they may be . " merkel : politicians must remain vigilant bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says reforms must persist after the crisis is resolved merkel called for the establishment of a " charter for a long-term reasonable economy " similar to the united nations charter . " our response -lrb- to the economic crisis -rrb- must be more than a few rules , " merkel said .
" the crisis is an opportunity to create an international architecture of institutions . " " it is possible that alongside the -lrb- un -rrb- security council , we could also have an economic council that would have a different role from ecosoc , " merkel said , referring to the united nations economic and social council . she singled out the us budget deficit and china 's current account surplus as bones of contention and also called on politicians to remain firm even after the crisis has been resolved . " there is a risk that when everything is functioning normally again that the financial institutions will tell politicians not to meddle , " she cautioned .
" we must remain determined . " blair : no turning back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair says the financial crisis is still evolving former british prime minister tony blair , who is one of the co-sponsors of the symposium with sarkozy , told participants that investment patterns must be changed . " this economic crisis is the biggest , most complex , most delicate economic challenge of our lifetime .
it is the most tricky intellectual challenge of any kind i have ever encountered and it is still evolving , " blair said . " what is plain is that the financial system has altered in its fundamentals and can never be the same again . " what is unavoidable in the longer term is a recasting of the system of international supervision . " we must invest in the future , " blair said , calling for funds to be put into renewable energy , science , innovation and education . the symposium was downgraded from a summit because few world leaders chose to attend .
in addition to sarkozy and merkel , only liberian president ellen johnson-sirleaf was present on thursday . other participants at the two-day conference include economics nobel prize winners amartya sen and joseph stiglitz , world trade organization head pascal lamy and the president of the european central bank , jean-claude trichet . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she would not say what type of weaponry the army used . it was unclear whether thursday morning 's rocket fire was an isolated incident , or whether it marks the opening of another front in the violence between israel and islamist militants . meanwhile , residents in the southern gaza border town of rafah reported overnight heavy shelling by the israeli military .
the military said israel had bombed another 15 smuggling tunnels running under the border with egypt , as well as a house allegedly used by a militant commander who oversaw rocket attacks from the rafah area aimed at nearby israeli targets . some 5,000 residents of rafah fled to two un schools that had turned into shelters , after israeli helicopters had dropped leaflets warning them to leave their homes along the gaza-egypt border , saying hamas was using houses in the area to hide the entrances to tunnels used to smuggle weapons . british muslims : uk must pressure us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anger at the israeli offensive has been widespread in the muslim world meanwhile , a group of leading british muslims said british prime minister gordon brown must do more to pressure the us into condemning israel 's offensive on the gaza strip . representatives of muslim organizations that have been addressing extremism in the uk wrote in an open letter to brown that the 13-day siege of gaza by the israeli military would empower extremists and increase anger in muslim communities in western nations . the letter urged brown to " make concerted and successful efforts to convince the us administration of the dangers of its approach and to ensure the incoming obama administration forges a more enlightened direction . " as you are aware , the anger within uk muslim communities has reached acute levels of intensity , " said the letter from usama hasan , imam of al-tawhid mosque in london , and the islamic foundation 's dilwar hussain , among others . " the israeli government 's use of disproportionate force ... has revived extremist groups and empowered their message of violence and perennial conflict . " for muslims in the uk and abroad , we run the risk of potentially creating a loss of faith in the political process . " we also believe the uk - bilaterally and as part of the eu - has an important role to demonstrate to israel that the threshold of acceptable behavior has been perilously transgressed , " the letter said . israel wants us border presence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel wants the us to shore up its border with egypt the pleas came as israel pressed on with both its air and ground offensive in gaza on thursday , as government officials were due to travel to cairo to discuss truce proposals tabled by french president nicolas sarkozy and his egyptian counterpart hosni mubarak . the israeli delegation has said it wants to discuss the possibility of a permanent us presence along the gaza-egypt border , as part of the " guarantees " it is seeking from the egyptians and the international community that the smuggling of further rockets and parts into gaza will stop , israeli media reported . israel said wednesday it viewed egyptian-french attempts to reach a diplomatic solution to the gaza crisis " positively , " but it also threatened to expand its ground offensive if the diplomatic attempts failed . " israel welcomes the -lrb- franco-egyptian -rrb- initiative and is working on it and is interested in its success , " israeli government spokesman mark regev said .
israel insists on a halt to all rockets launched by hamas from the gaza strip and a weapons embargo to be imposed on the islamist movement , he said . hamas would ' consider peace proposal ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas says it would consider laying down its arms hamas politburo member mussa abu marzuk told al-arabiya tv it would " respect and consider any proposal that calls for ending the -lrb- israeli -rrb- aggression and for the withdrawal of the -lrb- israeli -rrb- army . " hamas also opposed any possibility of international troops coming to the gaza strip to reinforce a truce , he said .
germany has expressed its willingness to send troops , if either side wanted such a force . the israeli cabinet authorized wednesday a continuation of the gaza offensive . the israeli delegation to cairo includes amos gilad , the head of the israeli defense ministry 's diplomatic-security bureau and prime minister ehud olmert 's foreign policy adviser shalom turgeman . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in an interview with the german daily general anzeiger , the head of the christian democrats in the german parliament , volker kauder , said that the assistance in the form of guarantees is designed for companies struggling to secure funding from banks or are unable to raise capital on the financial markets .

observers have criticized the rescue package .

talks in brussels between gazprom and eu officials have given rise to hopes that a breakthrough will soon be reached in the european gas supply crisis .
but some conditions must be met first . the head of russian gas giant gazprom said he was willing to reopen supplies to the european union as quickly as possible , on condition that the eu monitors the flow of gas through ukraine . " as soon as the eu observers are in ukraine and have access to the gas pipelines , the gas supplies should be restored as soon as possible , " alexei miller said after a meeting in brussels with the president of the european parliament , hans-gert poettering . ukrainian officials also said they hoped for a quick agreement . " we could possibly sign the contracts in moscow this evening : " i hope it will come to that , " bogdan sokolovski , energy envoy to ukrainian president viktor yushchenko , said . eu seeks guarantees on deliveries but eu officials insisted that there would only be a point in despatching the mission if both russia and ukraine guaranteed to restart deliveries to europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu parliament president poettering met the parties " we do not want to send observers just to check that the situation is not changing .
we want to send observers to make sure that the situation is changing , that supply and transit is resumed , " european commission spokesman johannes laitenberger said . the official statements came hours after eu spokesmen confirmed that the bloc was ready to send a mission of gas experts to ukraine to make sure that any russian gas entering the country bound for european clients actually made it to its destination . a european commission energy director told reuters news service that eu observers would be ready in two days . moscow , kyiv trade accusations gazprom has repeatedly accused ukraine of siphoning off gas for european clients to meet its own needs , after the russian company shut off direct deliveries to ukraine in a row over contract terms . on tuesday , jan .
5 , gazprom stopped all deliveries of gas through ukraine to europe , saying that this was the only way to prevent such " thefts , " in a major escalation of the conflict which provoked outrage in europe . on thursday , jan 8 , both miller and his ukrainian counterpart , oleh dubyna , visited brussels to lobby for eu support in the row , which comes as temperatures across europe plunged to record lows . the eu refused to take sides , instead demanding that the gas be turned back on instantly . suppliers ' reputation ' at risk ' " in the short run the problem is with those who do n't receive the gas .
but in the medium and long term the problem is with those that do not appear as reliable suppliers and transit suppliers .
at this point in time this reputation is at risk , " laitenberger said . bildunterschrift : a cold front in europe has added to the urgency russia is the eu 's largest supplier of natural gas , accounting for some 25 percent of the bloc 's total consumption .
eighty percent of that gas passes through ukrainian pipelines . however , the current crisis , which is a near-perfect repeat of a row in 2006 , has sparked an impassioned debate across europe on the need to reduce the bloc 's reliance on both its former-soviet neighbors . this time around , the gas cut-offs have left hundreds of thousands of people in the balkans without gas , forced factories to shut down and disrupted deliveries as far west as france and germany . france and germany said russia had to honor its gas contracts with europe regardless of the dispute , but they also warned ukraine not to forget its own obligations . history of tensions " we expect the talks between ukraine and russia to yield quick results , " german chancellor angela merkel said in paris after talks with french president nicolas sarkozy . the dispute between kyiv and its former soviet master in moscow follows tensions over ukraine 's efforts to join nato , a move bitterly opposed by moscow and viewed with wariness even by european members of the alliance and by investors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom 's miller lobbied in brussels for support russia cut off gas for ukraine 's domestic consumption on new year 's day after disagreements over gas prices and debts owed by ukraine .
it fully suspended supplies of transit gas towards ukraine on wednesday , saying there was no longer any point delivering the gas because kyiiv had shut down the pipelines . ukraine said russia was deliberately starving europe of gas . southeast europe has borne the brunt of the disruption , but it has affected supplies as far west as france and germany as europe faced freezing mid-winter temperatures . europe is weathering the storm " a key point here , is that industrial stoppages are only now beginning to occur -lrb- mainly in gas intensive industries -rrb- , but would spread relatively rapidly if gas supplies remain limited , " martin blum , an economist at unicredit in vienna , told reuters news agency . based on gas use and reliance on russia as a source of gas , blum said hungary and slovakia looked most at risk from the halt in supplies .
bulgaria , serbia and croatia all had reserves reportedly below 10 days of average consumption , he added . the euro zone 's major economies have escaped significant economic repercussions , but france has reported a drop in supplies and an italian industry ministry spokesman said italy has begun tapping its stockpiles of natural gas . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she would not say what type of weaponry the army used . it was unclear whether thursday morning 's rocket fire was an isolated incident , or whether it marks the opening of another front in the violence between israel and islamist militants . meanwhile , residents in the southern gaza border town of rafah reported overnight heavy shelling by the israeli military .
the military said israel had bombed another 15 smuggling tunnels running under the border with egypt , as well as a house allegedly used by a militant commander who oversaw rocket attacks from the rafah area aimed at nearby israeli targets . some 5,000 residents of rafah fled to two un schools that had turned into shelters , after israeli helicopters had dropped leaflets warning them to leave their homes along the gaza-egypt border , saying hamas was using houses in the area to hide the entrances to tunnels used to smuggle weapons . british muslims : uk must pressure us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anger at the israeli offensive has been widespread in the muslim world meanwhile , a group of leading british muslims said british prime minister gordon brown must do more to pressure the us into condemning israel 's offensive on the gaza strip . representatives of muslim organizations that have been addressing extremism in the uk wrote in an open letter to brown that the 13-day siege of gaza by the israeli military would empower extremists and increase anger in muslim communities in western nations . the letter urged brown to " make concerted and successful efforts to convince the us administration of the dangers of its approach and to ensure the incoming obama administration forges a more enlightened direction . " as you are aware , the anger within uk muslim communities has reached acute levels of intensity , " said the letter from usama hasan , imam of al-tawhid mosque in london , and the islamic foundation 's dilwar hussain , among others . " the israeli government 's use of disproportionate force ... has revived extremist groups and empowered their message of violence and perennial conflict . " for muslims in the uk and abroad , we run the risk of potentially creating a loss of faith in the political process . " we also believe the uk - bilaterally and as part of the eu - has an important role to demonstrate to israel that the threshold of acceptable behavior has been perilously transgressed , " the letter said . israel wants us border presence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel wants the us to shore up its border with egypt the pleas came as israel pressed on with both its air and ground offensive in gaza on thursday , as government officials were due to travel to cairo to discuss truce proposals tabled by french president nicolas sarkozy and his egyptian counterpart hosni mubarak . the israeli delegation has said it wants to discuss the possibility of a permanent us presence along the gaza-egypt border , as part of the " guarantees " it is seeking from the egyptians and the international community that the smuggling of further rockets and parts into gaza will stop , israeli media reported . israel said wednesday it viewed egyptian-french attempts to reach a diplomatic solution to the gaza crisis " positively , " but it also threatened to expand its ground offensive if the diplomatic attempts failed . " israel welcomes the -lrb- franco-egyptian -rrb- initiative and is working on it and is interested in its success , " israeli government spokesman mark regev said .
israel insists on a halt to all rockets launched by hamas from the gaza strip and a weapons embargo to be imposed on the islamist movement , he said . hamas would ' consider peace proposal ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas says it would consider laying down its arms hamas politburo member mussa abu marzuk told al-arabiya tv it would " respect and consider any proposal that calls for ending the -lrb- israeli -rrb- aggression and for the withdrawal of the -lrb- israeli -rrb- army . " hamas also opposed any possibility of international troops coming to the gaza strip to reinforce a truce , he said .
germany has expressed its willingness to send troops , if either side wanted such a force . the israeli cabinet authorized wednesday a continuation of the gaza offensive . the israeli delegation to cairo includes amos gilad , the head of the israeli defense ministry 's diplomatic-security bureau and prime minister ehud olmert 's foreign policy adviser shalom turgeman . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

their trial began thursday , jan .
8 . the men have dismissed the charges as unfounded , saying that their contacts with batasuna were part of efforts by prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero to find a negotiated solution to the long-standing basque problem .
ibarretxe told a preliminary hearing in 2008 that he is committed to " talk to everyone " to find a end to a problem that has bedeviled spanish politics for decades . lopez said that he is " absolutely convinced " there will be no convictions , arguing that " no court will say that politics should not be used to move on the road to peace . " prosecutors have called for the charges to be dropped .
they said that the negotiations were part of the men 's legitimate " political activities " and were aimed at " finding a solution to the basque conflict . " socialist legislator rodolfo ares is also on trial , as are four senior members of batasuna .
arnaldo otegi , who is a former batasuna spokesman , stressed that " this will be the only case in europe where the participants in talks will be in the dock for having tried to find solutions . " basque judge alfonso gonzalez guija said " it would be very healthy for democracy not to criminalize political life . " judge says the issue is crime bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basque regional president ibarretxe has to answer to the court but judge roberto saiz of the basque criminal court disagrees .
he has argued that there are " indications of a crime " and insisted in october 2007 that the trial go ahead . the charges were brought by two organizations , dignity and justice and the forum ermua .
the latter wants the accused to face prison terms of up to four years and bans on political activity .
the two groups say that the talks were part of an effort to " legitimize " batasuna . critics argue that the charges are aimed at discrediting zapatero and his policies .
during the july 2006 talks , ares appeared before television cameras with otegi , whom he urged to " leave the field of violence , " enter political life , and " take part in a round table of political parties . " the four separatist politicians are charged with defying a court order to dissolve batasuna , which was banned in 2003 for refusing to break with eta , and to condemn violence .
eta has killed 825 people in a 40-year effort aimed at securing basque independence .
zapatero has taken a tougher approach toward eta since at least june 2007 , when it ended a 15-month ceasefire and refused to resume talks . the court may ask for written responses to its questions from zapatero and from his two predecessors , jose maria aznar and felipe gonzalez .

deutsche welle : how serious is the situation ?
are things about to get very cold in germany ?
hans-joachim ziesing : i think there is a bit of a difference between some european countries and germany .
i believe in germany it is n't going to get cold anytime soon , though if the interruption lasts longer then there will certainly be problems here .
but we need to ensure that we have other supply sources - like the netherlands and norway - and that we keep our reserves full .
we 'll certainly be able to deal with the interruption for the time being , but not if it lasts for more than a couple of weeks .
then we 'll definitely have problems . can russia still be considered a dependable partner when it comes to gas supplies ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-joachim ziesing what i find completely unacceptable is that the dispute between russia and ukraine is being pushed on to the backs of other nations .
both russia and the ukraine should really be careful that other nations do n't begin to doubt their dependability .
what does this mean for the european union ?
what consequences can we expect ?
what the consequences will be is n't easy to say , because we certainly ca n't live without russian gas in the foreseeable future .
it is currently that largest gas supply sustaining us .
of course we need to diversify our gas supplies , and tap into other sources .
there are already a couple of lng -lrb- liquid natural gas -rrb- reserves that we can fall back on , which would also help us be more energy efficient .
i think that using less gas and replacing some of the gas we use with other sources is something we urgently need to do in order to be able to avoid situations like these .
but that is something we can do in the future .
what could help in the short term ?
there is n't a lot that can help in the short term .
we can fall back on the other sources .
we 'll have to use our gas reserves to get through this bottleneck .
especially since we are experiencing such cold temperatures right now , and this is going to raise the amount of gas needed to warm people 's houses .
i think we need to try and reduce our usage where we can .

it is currently that largest gas supply sustaining us .
of course we need to diversify our gas supplies , and tap into other sources .
there are already a couple of lng -lrb- liquid natural gas -rrb- reserves that we can fall back on , which would also help us be more energy efficient .
i think that using less gas and replacing some of the gas we use with other sources is something we urgently need to do in order to be able to avoid situations like these .
but that is something we can do in the future .
what could help in the short term ?
there is n't a lot that can help in the short term .
we can fall back on the other sources .
we 'll have to use our gas reserves to get through this bottleneck .
especially since we are experiencing such cold temperatures right now , and this is going to raise the amount of gas needed to warm people 's houses .
i think we need to try and reduce our usage where we can .
that would certainly help . interview : sandra berndt -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i 'm negotiating with cologne .
next week i 'll resume discussions and i think we 'll come to some kind of agreement before the end of the month , " hoeness told television channel dsf from dubai where the club are at a training camp .
cologne earlier offered bayern 7.5 million euros for the 23-year-old podolski , but that offer was rejected .
bayern , who paid 10 million for podolski in 2006 , are hoping to recoup at least that much .
bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge was reported as saying that cologne had moved closer to meeting bayern estimation for the striker on thursday .
" everything is looking good .
i am confident it will work out , " rummenigge wasquoted as saying in the daily tz newspaper . podolski would like to return to his former club after failing to establish a first-team place at the german champions . " the player only wants to go to cologne .
they will have to offer a bit more but there is no longer much difference between what they are offering and what we want , " rummenigge said . bayern would like the podolski transfer settled by the end of january for a move at the end of the season . a number of other clubs are reportedly showing an interest in the germany international , and some media reports have also linked him with sv hamburg . bayern general manager uli hoeness said wednesday in dubai , where bayern are in training during the winter break , that podolski would not be sold at a bargain price . cologne would benefit from a lower price as they had sold the player to bayern , but " we would demand more from other clubs , " he said . cologne manager michael meier was quoted in the koelner stadtanzeiger newspaper just before christmas as saying that there was no chance that podolski , who started his professional career with cologne , would return to the club . " it would be a wonderful christmas story , but it will not happen , " he said .
" my offer to bayern was as high as i could go .
if i had gone further , i would have gone beyond the club mandate . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she would not say what type of weaponry the army used . it was unclear whether thursday morning 's rocket fire was an isolated incident , or whether it marks the opening of another front in the violence between israel and islamist militants . meanwhile , residents in the southern gaza border town of rafah reported overnight heavy shelling by the israeli military .
the military said israel had bombed another 15 smuggling tunnels running under the border with egypt , as well as a house allegedly used by a militant commander who oversaw rocket attacks from the rafah area aimed at nearby israeli targets . some 5,000 residents of rafah fled to two un schools that had turned into shelters , after israeli helicopters had dropped leaflets warning them to leave their homes along the gaza-egypt border , saying hamas was using houses in the area to hide the entrances to tunnels used to smuggle weapons . british muslims : uk must pressure us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anger at the israeli offensive has been widespread in the muslim world meanwhile , a group of leading british muslims said british prime minister gordon brown must do more to pressure the us into condemning israel 's offensive on the gaza strip . representatives of muslim organizations that have been addressing extremism in the uk wrote in an open letter to brown that the 13-day siege of gaza by the israeli military would empower extremists and increase anger in muslim communities in western nations . the letter urged brown to " make concerted and successful efforts to convince the us administration of the dangers of its approach and to ensure the incoming obama administration forges a more enlightened direction . " as you are aware , the anger within uk muslim communities has reached acute levels of intensity , " said the letter from usama hasan , imam of al-tawhid mosque in london , and the islamic foundation 's dilwar hussain , among others . " the israeli government 's use of disproportionate force ... has revived extremist groups and empowered their message of violence and perennial conflict . " for muslims in the uk and abroad , we run the risk of potentially creating a loss of faith in the political process . " we also believe the uk - bilaterally and as part of the eu - has an important role to demonstrate to israel that the threshold of acceptable behavior has been perilously transgressed , " the letter said . israel wants us border presence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel wants the us to shore up its border with egypt the pleas came as israel pressed on with both its air and ground offensive in gaza on thursday , as government officials were due to travel to cairo to discuss truce proposals tabled by french president nicolas sarkozy and his egyptian counterpart hosni mubarak . the israeli delegation has said it wants to discuss the possibility of a permanent us presence along the gaza-egypt border , as part of the " guarantees " it is seeking from the egyptians and the international community that the smuggling of further rockets and parts into gaza will stop , israeli media reported . israel said wednesday it viewed egyptian-french attempts to reach a diplomatic solution to the gaza crisis " positively , " but it also threatened to expand its ground offensive if the diplomatic attempts failed . " israel welcomes the -lrb- franco-egyptian -rrb- initiative and is working on it and is interested in its success , " israeli government spokesman mark regev said .
israel insists on a halt to all rockets launched by hamas from the gaza strip and a weapons embargo to be imposed on the islamist movement , he said . hamas would ' consider peace proposal ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas says it would consider laying down its arms hamas politburo member mussa abu marzuk told al-arabiya tv it would " respect and consider any proposal that calls for ending the -lrb- israeli -rrb- aggression and for the withdrawal of the -lrb- israeli -rrb- army . " hamas also opposed any possibility of international troops coming to the gaza strip to reinforce a truce , he said .
germany has expressed its willingness to send troops , if either side wanted such a force . the israeli cabinet authorized wednesday a continuation of the gaza offensive . the israeli delegation to cairo includes amos gilad , the head of the israeli defense ministry 's diplomatic-security bureau and prime minister ehud olmert 's foreign policy adviser shalom turgeman . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

cologne earlier offered bayern 7.5 million euros for the 23-year-old podolski , but that offer was rejected .
bayern , who paid 10 million for podolski in 2006 , are hoping to recoup at least that much .
bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge was reported as saying that cologne had moved closer to meeting bayern estimation for the striker on thursday .
" everything is looking good .
i am confident it will work out , " rummenigge wasquoted as saying in the daily tz newspaper . podolski would like to return to his former club after failing to establish a first-team place at the german champions . " the player only wants to go to cologne .
they will have to offer a bit more but there is no longer much difference between what they are offering and what we want , " rummenigge said . bayern would like the podolski transfer settled by the end of january for a move at the end of the season . a number of other clubs are reportedly showing an interest in the germany international , and some media reports have also linked him with sv hamburg . bayern general manager uli hoeness said wednesday in dubai , where bayern are in training during the winter break , that podolski would not be sold at a bargain price . cologne would benefit from a lower price as they had sold the player to bayern , but " we would demand more from other clubs , " he said . cologne manager michael meier was quoted in the koelner stadtanzeiger newspaper just before christmas as saying that there was no chance that podolski , who started his professional career with cologne , would return to the club . " it would be a wonderful christmas story , but it will not happen , " he said .
" my offer to bayern was as high as i could go .
if i had gone further , i would have gone beyond the club mandate . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . i do not agree with germany 's stance in support of support israel .
the same old mistakes are being made .
violence is fought with violence and that by a military power which is much much stronger to wipe out the weaker opponent .
transformation can only happen through love and compassion .
i would have thought that jews would have more compassion for the underdog considering their own past sufferring .
each side will have to learn to live with each other in the same land . - reiner schmitt , australia i feel very saddened that the government of germany has chosen to support both the us and israel on this inhuman conflict waged against people already in a very bad situation .
i would prefer to see the government seek to resolve the terrible conditions that palestinians have to bear .
if they were able to live in peace as well as isreali citizens do with the same freedoms , there would be no conflicts or extremism . - carol lee murphy , canada germany is still too shy to speak independantly from the us due its guilt because of the holocaust .
germany needs to find the courage to confront the situation like it is , regardless of who is the perpetrator .
israel policy of bombs versus rockets will not bring peace to palestine .
only by solving the future of a palestinian state and the role of jerusalem between two states will the situation be solved .
but the hardliners in israel do not give the palestinians the same right they want for themselves , the right to exist . - rolf brulez .
australia i am a mother of two very young children and i simply ca n't imagine how one human can do this to another .
even with all these images of innocent people dying and wounded , the rest of the world seems to be sleeping .
i pray togod and appeal to anyone who has a heart to stop the blood shed right now . - huma chaudhry , pakistan hamas was elected in a massive majority by the palestinian people .
the eu was there during elections with a full complement of election monitors and testified that the elections were " clean " and only minor problems were reported at the polling stations .
just because some western political leaders do n't like the policies of hamas , does n't mean they were not democratically-elected .
therefore , they are the legally permitted and elected representatives of the palestinian people . - john brian shannon , canada almost everyone is demanding that israel stop it 's " aggression " in gaza .
who is blaming iran and syria for their original financing and arranging the arms flow to hamas in gaza ? - charles akselrad , us i support the german government decision to support israel concerning the attacks on gaza . - dennis young , us if the eu wants to have a role in resolving the conflict between israel and gaza , the eu should seek to discover the gazans who do not support hamas and give them some media exposure .
the eu should also be supporting israel , which is confronting islamic terrorism instead of seeking ways to placate islamic terrorists and their agent provocateurs . - charles smyth , great britain compiled by dw staff -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . i do not agree with germany 's stance in support of support israel .
the same old mistakes are being made .
violence is fought with violence and that by a military power which is much much stronger to wipe out the weaker opponent .
transformation can only happen through love and compassion .
i would have thought that jews would have more compassion for the underdog considering their own past sufferring .
each side will have to learn to live with each other in the same land . - reiner schmitt , australia i feel very saddened that the government of germany has chosen to support both the us and israel on this inhuman conflict waged against people already in a very bad situation .
i would prefer to see the government seek to resolve the terrible conditions that palestinians have to bear .
if they were able to live in peace as well as isreali citizens do with the same freedoms , there would be no conflicts or extremism . - carol lee murphy , canada germany is still too shy to speak independantly from the us due its guilt because of the holocaust .
germany needs to find the courage to confront the situation like it is , regardless of who is the perpetrator .
israel policy of bombs versus rockets will not bring peace to palestine .
only by solving the future of a palestinian state and the role of jerusalem between two states will the situation be solved .
but the hardliners in israel do not give the palestinians the same right they want for themselves , the right to exist . - rolf brulez .
australia i am a mother of two very young children and i simply ca n't imagine how one human can do this to another .
even with all these images of innocent people dying and wounded , the rest of the world seems to be sleeping .
i pray togod and appeal to anyone who has a heart to stop the blood shed right now . - huma chaudhry , pakistan hamas was elected in a massive majority by the palestinian people .
the eu was there during elections with a full complement of election monitors and testified that the elections were " clean " and only minor problems were reported at the polling stations .
just because some western political leaders do n't like the policies of hamas , does n't mean they were not democratically-elected .
therefore , they are the legally permitted and elected representatives of the palestinian people . - john brian shannon , canada almost everyone is demanding that israel stop it 's " aggression " in gaza .
who is blaming iran and syria for their original financing and arranging the arms flow to hamas in gaza ? - charles akselrad , us i support the german government decision to support israel concerning the attacks on gaza . - dennis young , us if the eu wants to have a role in resolving the conflict between israel and gaza , the eu should seek to discover the gazans who do not support hamas and give them some media exposure .
the eu should also be supporting israel , which is confronting islamic terrorism instead of seeking ways to placate islamic terrorists and their agent provocateurs . - charles smyth , great britain compiled by dw staff -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

talks in brussels between gazprom and eu officials have given rise to hopes that a breakthrough will soon be reached in the european gas supply crisis .
but some conditions must be met first . the head of russian gas giant gazprom said he was willing to reopen supplies to the european union as quickly as possible , on condition that the eu monitors the flow of gas through ukraine . " as soon as the eu observers are in ukraine and have access to the gas pipelines , the gas supplies should be restored as soon as possible , " alexei miller said after a meeting in brussels with the president of the european parliament , hans-gert poettering . ukrainian officials also said they hoped for a quick agreement . " we could possibly sign the contracts in moscow this evening : " i hope it will come to that , " bogdan sokolovski , energy envoy to ukrainian president viktor yushchenko , said . eu seeks guarantees on deliveries but eu officials insisted that there would only be a point in despatching the mission if both russia and ukraine guaranteed to restart deliveries to europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu parliament president poettering met the parties " we do not want to send observers just to check that the situation is not changing .
we want to send observers to make sure that the situation is changing , that supply and transit is resumed , " european commission spokesman johannes laitenberger said . the official statements came hours after eu spokesmen confirmed that the bloc was ready to send a mission of gas experts to ukraine to make sure that any russian gas entering the country bound for european clients actually made it to its destination . a european commission energy director told reuters news service that eu observers would be ready in two days . moscow , kyiv trade accusations gazprom has repeatedly accused ukraine of siphoning off gas for european clients to meet its own needs , after the russian company shut off direct deliveries to ukraine in a row over contract terms . on tuesday , jan .
5 , gazprom stopped all deliveries of gas through ukraine to europe , saying that this was the only way to prevent such " thefts , " in a major escalation of the conflict which provoked outrage in europe . on thursday , jan 8 , both miller and his ukrainian counterpart , oleh dubyna , visited brussels to lobby for eu support in the row , which comes as temperatures across europe plunged to record lows . the eu refused to take sides , instead demanding that the gas be turned back on instantly . suppliers ' reputation ' at risk ' " in the short run the problem is with those who do n't receive the gas .
but in the medium and long term the problem is with those that do not appear as reliable suppliers and transit suppliers .
at this point in time this reputation is at risk , " laitenberger said . bildunterschrift : a cold front in europe has added to the urgency russia is the eu 's largest supplier of natural gas , accounting for some 25 percent of the bloc 's total consumption .
eighty percent of that gas passes through ukrainian pipelines . however , the current crisis , which is a near-perfect repeat of a row in 2006 , has sparked an impassioned debate across europe on the need to reduce the bloc 's reliance on both its former-soviet neighbors . this time around , the gas cut-offs have left hundreds of thousands of people in the balkans without gas , forced factories to shut down and disrupted deliveries as far west as france and germany . france and germany said russia had to honor its gas contracts with europe regardless of the dispute , but they also warned ukraine not to forget its own obligations . history of tensions " we expect the talks between ukraine and russia to yield quick results , " german chancellor angela merkel said in paris after talks with french president nicolas sarkozy . the dispute between kyiv and its former soviet master in moscow follows tensions over ukraine 's efforts to join nato , a move bitterly opposed by moscow and viewed with wariness even by european members of the alliance and by investors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom 's miller lobbied in brussels for support russia cut off gas for ukraine 's domestic consumption on new year 's day after disagreements over gas prices and debts owed by ukraine .
it fully suspended supplies of transit gas towards ukraine on wednesday , saying there was no longer any point delivering the gas because kyiiv had shut down the pipelines . ukraine said russia was deliberately starving europe of gas . southeast europe has borne the brunt of the disruption , but it has affected supplies as far west as france and germany as europe faced freezing mid-winter temperatures . europe is weathering the storm " a key point here , is that industrial stoppages are only now beginning to occur -lrb- mainly in gas intensive industries -rrb- , but would spread relatively rapidly if gas supplies remain limited , " martin blum , an economist at unicredit in vienna , told reuters news agency . based on gas use and reliance on russia as a source of gas , blum said hungary and slovakia looked most at risk from the halt in supplies .
bulgaria , serbia and croatia all had reserves reportedly below 10 days of average consumption , he added . the euro zone 's major economies have escaped significant economic repercussions , but france has reported a drop in supplies and an italian industry ministry spokesman said italy has begun tapping its stockpiles of natural gas . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

talks in brussels between gazprom and eu officials have given rise to hopes that a breakthrough will soon be reached in the european gas supply crisis .
but some conditions must be met first . the head of russian gas giant gazprom said he was willing to reopen supplies to the european union as quickly as possible , on condition that the eu monitors the flow of gas through ukraine . " as soon as the eu observers are in ukraine and have access to the gas pipelines , the gas supplies should be restored as soon as possible , " alexei miller said after a meeting in brussels with the president of the european parliament , hans-gert poettering . ukrainian officials also said they hoped for a quick agreement . " we could possibly sign the contracts in moscow this evening : " i hope it will come to that , " bogdan sokolovski , energy envoy to ukrainian president viktor yushchenko , said . eu seeks guarantees on deliveries but eu officials insisted that there would only be a point in despatching the mission if both russia and ukraine guaranteed to restart deliveries to europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu parliament president poettering met the parties " we do not want to send observers just to check that the situation is not changing .
we want to send observers to make sure that the situation is changing , that supply and transit is resumed , " european commission spokesman johannes laitenberger said . the official statements came hours after eu spokesmen confirmed that the bloc was ready to send a mission of gas experts to ukraine to make sure that any russian gas entering the country bound for european clients actually made it to its destination . a european commission energy director told reuters news service that eu observers would be ready in two days . moscow , kyiv trade accusations gazprom has repeatedly accused ukraine of siphoning off gas for european clients to meet its own needs , after the russian company shut off direct deliveries to ukraine in a row over contract terms . on tuesday , jan .
5 , gazprom stopped all deliveries of gas through ukraine to europe , saying that this was the only way to prevent such " thefts , " in a major escalation of the conflict which provoked outrage in europe . on thursday , jan 8 , both miller and his ukrainian counterpart , oleh dubyna , visited brussels to lobby for eu support in the row , which comes as temperatures across europe plunged to record lows . the eu refused to take sides , instead demanding that the gas be turned back on instantly . suppliers ' reputation ' at risk ' " in the short run the problem is with those who do n't receive the gas .
but in the medium and long term the problem is with those that do not appear as reliable suppliers and transit suppliers .
at this point in time this reputation is at risk , " laitenberger said . bildunterschrift : a cold front in europe has added to the urgency russia is the eu 's largest supplier of natural gas , accounting for some 25 percent of the bloc 's total consumption .
eighty percent of that gas passes through ukrainian pipelines . however , the current crisis , which is a near-perfect repeat of a row in 2006 , has sparked an impassioned debate across europe on the need to reduce the bloc 's reliance on both its former-soviet neighbors . this time around , the gas cut-offs have left hundreds of thousands of people in the balkans without gas , forced factories to shut down and disrupted deliveries as far west as france and germany . france and germany said russia had to honor its gas contracts with europe regardless of the dispute , but they also warned ukraine not to forget its own obligations . history of tensions " we expect the talks between ukraine and russia to yield quick results , " german chancellor angela merkel said in paris after talks with french president nicolas sarkozy . the dispute between kyiv and its former soviet master in moscow follows tensions over ukraine 's efforts to join nato , a move bitterly opposed by moscow and viewed with wariness even by european members of the alliance and by investors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom 's miller lobbied in brussels for support russia cut off gas for ukraine 's domestic consumption on new year 's day after disagreements over gas prices and debts owed by ukraine .
it fully suspended supplies of transit gas towards ukraine on wednesday , saying there was no longer any point delivering the gas because kyiiv had shut down the pipelines . ukraine said russia was deliberately starving europe of gas . southeast europe has borne the brunt of the disruption , but it has affected supplies as far west as france and germany as europe faced freezing mid-winter temperatures . europe is weathering the storm " a key point here , is that industrial stoppages are only now beginning to occur -lrb- mainly in gas intensive industries -rrb- , but would spread relatively rapidly if gas supplies remain limited , " martin blum , an economist at unicredit in vienna , told reuters news agency . based on gas use and reliance on russia as a source of gas , blum said hungary and slovakia looked most at risk from the halt in supplies .
bulgaria , serbia and croatia all had reserves reportedly below 10 days of average consumption , he added . the euro zone 's major economies have escaped significant economic repercussions , but france has reported a drop in supplies and an italian industry ministry spokesman said italy has begun tapping its stockpiles of natural gas . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

talks in brussels between gazprom and eu officials have given rise to hopes that a breakthrough will soon be reached in the european gas supply crisis .
but some conditions must be met first . the head of russian gas giant gazprom said he was willing to reopen supplies to the european union as quickly as possible , on condition that the eu monitors the flow of gas through ukraine . " as soon as the eu observers are in ukraine and have access to the gas pipelines , the gas supplies should be restored as soon as possible , " alexei miller said after a meeting in brussels with the president of the european parliament , hans-gert poettering . ukrainian officials also said they hoped for a quick agreement . " we could possibly sign the contracts in moscow this evening : " i hope it will come to that , " bogdan sokolovski , energy envoy to ukrainian president viktor yushchenko , said . eu seeks guarantees on deliveries but eu officials insisted that there would only be a point in despatching the mission if both russia and ukraine guaranteed to restart deliveries to europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu parliament president poettering met the parties " we do not want to send observers just to check that the situation is not changing .
we want to send observers to make sure that the situation is changing , that supply and transit is resumed , " european commission spokesman johannes laitenberger said . the official statements came hours after eu spokesmen confirmed that the bloc was ready to send a mission of gas experts to ukraine to make sure that any russian gas entering the country bound for european clients actually made it to its destination . a european commission energy director told reuters news service that eu observers would be ready in two days . moscow , kyiv trade accusations gazprom has repeatedly accused ukraine of siphoning off gas for european clients to meet its own needs , after the russian company shut off direct deliveries to ukraine in a row over contract terms . on tuesday , jan .
5 , gazprom stopped all deliveries of gas through ukraine to europe , saying that this was the only way to prevent such " thefts , " in a major escalation of the conflict which provoked outrage in europe . on thursday , jan 8 , both miller and his ukrainian counterpart , oleh dubyna , visited brussels to lobby for eu support in the row , which comes as temperatures across europe plunged to record lows . the eu refused to take sides , instead demanding that the gas be turned back on instantly . suppliers ' reputation ' at risk ' " in the short run the problem is with those who do n't receive the gas .
but in the medium and long term the problem is with those that do not appear as reliable suppliers and transit suppliers .
at this point in time this reputation is at risk , " laitenberger said . bildunterschrift : a cold front in europe has added to the urgency russia is the eu 's largest supplier of natural gas , accounting for some 25 percent of the bloc 's total consumption .
eighty percent of that gas passes through ukrainian pipelines . however , the current crisis , which is a near-perfect repeat of a row in 2006 , has sparked an impassioned debate across europe on the need to reduce the bloc 's reliance on both its former-soviet neighbors . this time around , the gas cut-offs have left hundreds of thousands of people in the balkans without gas , forced factories to shut down and disrupted deliveries as far west as france and germany . france and germany said russia had to honor its gas contracts with europe regardless of the dispute , but they also warned ukraine not to forget its own obligations . history of tensions " we expect the talks between ukraine and russia to yield quick results , " german chancellor angela merkel said in paris after talks with french president nicolas sarkozy . the dispute between kyiv and its former soviet master in moscow follows tensions over ukraine 's efforts to join nato , a move bitterly opposed by moscow and viewed with wariness even by european members of the alliance and by investors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom 's miller lobbied in brussels for support russia cut off gas for ukraine 's domestic consumption on new year 's day after disagreements over gas prices and debts owed by ukraine .
it fully suspended supplies of transit gas towards ukraine on wednesday , saying there was no longer any point delivering the gas because kyiiv had shut down the pipelines . ukraine said russia was deliberately starving europe of gas . southeast europe has borne the brunt of the disruption , but it has affected supplies as far west as france and germany as europe faced freezing mid-winter temperatures . europe is weathering the storm " a key point here , is that industrial stoppages are only now beginning to occur -lrb- mainly in gas intensive industries -rrb- , but would spread relatively rapidly if gas supplies remain limited , " martin blum , an economist at unicredit in vienna , told reuters news agency . based on gas use and reliance on russia as a source of gas , blum said hungary and slovakia looked most at risk from the halt in supplies .
bulgaria , serbia and croatia all had reserves reportedly below 10 days of average consumption , he added . the euro zone 's major economies have escaped significant economic repercussions , but france has reported a drop in supplies and an italian industry ministry spokesman said italy has begun tapping its stockpiles of natural gas . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the record results go against the current downward trend in the car industry . the carmaker sold just over one million vehicles worldwide in 2008 , up 4.1 percent over 2007 .
december sales rose over 17.4 percent compared to the same month the previous year , at a time when its rivals have been badly hit by the global economic downturn . audi head rupert stadler said that his firm aims to become " the most attractive premium brand worldwide " in the car market .
he added that audi intends to build on its success by introducing new products in 2009 . company officials noted that 2008 was the first time that audi has broken the one million mark in sales .
the managers attributed much of the gain to the introduction of 12 new models , including the a4 saloon car and the q5 sports utility vehicle . the ingolstadt-based carmaker is bucking a trend in germany as well as elsewhere in the world .
car sales in germany , which is western europe 's biggest market , fell 6.6 percent in december .
in 2008 as a whole , german new car registrations were down by 1.9 percent over 2007 to 3.09 million .
audi is a subsidiary of volkswagen , germany 's biggest car manufacturer . kpmg consultants released a survey on january 8 , suggesting that senior german auto industry executives feel the situation will stay bleak through 2013 .

deutsche welle : how serious is the situation ?
are things about to get very cold in germany ?
hans-joachim ziesing : i think there is a bit of a difference between some european countries and germany .
i believe in germany it is n't going to get cold anytime soon , though if the interruption lasts longer then there will certainly be problems here .
but we need to ensure that we have other supply sources - like the netherlands and norway - and that we keep our reserves full .
we 'll certainly be able to deal with the interruption for the time being , but not if it lasts for more than a couple of weeks .
then we 'll definitely have problems . can russia still be considered a dependable partner when it comes to gas supplies ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-joachim ziesing what i find completely unacceptable is that the dispute between russia and ukraine is being pushed on to the backs of other nations .
both russia and the ukraine should really be careful that other nations do n't begin to doubt their dependability .
what does this mean for the european union ?
what consequences can we expect ?
what the consequences will be is n't easy to say , because we certainly ca n't live without russian gas in the foreseeable future .
it is currently that largest gas supply sustaining us .
of course we need to diversify our gas supplies , and tap into other sources .
there are already a couple of lng -lrb- liquid natural gas -rrb- reserves that we can fall back on , which would also help us be more energy efficient .
i think that using less gas and replacing some of the gas we use with other sources is something we urgently need to do in order to be able to avoid situations like these .
but that is something we can do in the future .
what could help in the short term ?
there is n't a lot that can help in the short term .
we can fall back on the other sources .
we 'll have to use our gas reserves to get through this bottleneck .
especially since we are experiencing such cold temperatures right now , and this is going to raise the amount of gas needed to warm people 's houses .
i think we need to try and reduce our usage where we can .

deutsche welle : how serious is the situation ?
are things about to get very cold in germany ?
hans-joachim ziesing : i think there is a bit of a difference between some european countries and germany .
i believe in germany it is n't going to get cold anytime soon , though if the interruption lasts longer then there will certainly be problems here .
but we need to ensure that we have other supply sources - like the netherlands and norway - and that we keep our reserves full .
we 'll certainly be able to deal with the interruption for the time being , but not if it lasts for more than a couple of weeks .
then we 'll definitely have problems . can russia still be considered a dependable partner when it comes to gas supplies ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-joachim ziesing what i find completely unacceptable is that the dispute between russia and ukraine is being pushed on to the backs of other nations .
both russia and the ukraine should really be careful that other nations do n't begin to doubt their dependability .
what does this mean for the european union ?
what consequences can we expect ?
what the consequences will be is n't easy to say , because we certainly ca n't live without russian gas in the foreseeable future .
it is currently that largest gas supply sustaining us .
of course we need to diversify our gas supplies , and tap into other sources .
there are already a couple of lng -lrb- liquid natural gas -rrb- reserves that we can fall back on , which would also help us be more energy efficient .
i think that using less gas and replacing some of the gas we use with other sources is something we urgently need to do in order to be able to avoid situations like these .
but that is something we can do in the future .
what could help in the short term ?
there is n't a lot that can help in the short term .
we can fall back on the other sources .
we 'll have to use our gas reserves to get through this bottleneck .
especially since we are experiencing such cold temperatures right now , and this is going to raise the amount of gas needed to warm people 's houses .
i think we need to try and reduce our usage where we can .

their trial began thursday , jan .
8 . the men have dismissed the charges as unfounded , saying that their contacts with batasuna were part of efforts by prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero to find a negotiated solution to the long-standing basque problem .
ibarretxe told a preliminary hearing in 2008 that he is committed to " talk to everyone " to find a end to a problem that has bedeviled spanish politics for decades . lopez said that he is " absolutely convinced " there will be no convictions , arguing that " no court will say that politics should not be used to move on the road to peace . " prosecutors have called for the charges to be dropped .
they said that the negotiations were part of the men 's legitimate " political activities " and were aimed at " finding a solution to the basque conflict . " socialist legislator rodolfo ares is also on trial , as are four senior members of batasuna .
arnaldo otegi , who is a former batasuna spokesman , stressed that " this will be the only case in europe where the participants in talks will be in the dock for having tried to find solutions . " basque judge alfonso gonzalez guija said " it would be very healthy for democracy not to criminalize political life . " judge says the issue is crime bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basque regional president ibarretxe has to answer to the court but judge roberto saiz of the basque criminal court disagrees .
he has argued that there are " indications of a crime " and insisted in october 2007 that the trial go ahead . the charges were brought by two organizations , dignity and justice and the forum ermua .
the latter wants the accused to face prison terms of up to four years and bans on political activity .
the two groups say that the talks were part of an effort to " legitimize " batasuna . critics argue that the charges are aimed at discrediting zapatero and his policies .
during the july 2006 talks , ares appeared before television cameras with otegi , whom he urged to " leave the field of violence , " enter political life , and " take part in a round table of political parties . " the four separatist politicians are charged with defying a court order to dissolve batasuna , which was banned in 2003 for refusing to break with eta , and to condemn violence .
eta has killed 825 people in a 40-year effort aimed at securing basque independence .
zapatero has taken a tougher approach toward eta since at least june 2007 , when it ended a 15-month ceasefire and refused to resume talks . the court may ask for written responses to its questions from zapatero and from his two predecessors , jose maria aznar and felipe gonzalez .

thursday , russian and ukrainian officials held a surprise meeting before talks in brussels . the unexpected meeting in moscow of the heads of the russian and ukrainian gas companies at the heart of the dispute was called to discuss the gas crisis .
no details have been released of the meeting 's outcomes . the meeting was unexpected because russian gas supplier gazprom 's alexei miller and ukraine 's naftogaz 's oleh dubina were expected to meet eu officials thursday in brussels for talks . miller earlier repeated his company 's accusation that ukraine was stealing some of the russian gas transiting its pipelines for delivery to the rest of europe .

7 , the eu gave russia and ukraine 24 hours to resolve their commercial dispute and resume gas deliveries to europe or face unspecified political consequences . " if supplies are not restored tomorrow , we will have to see a strong intervention by the eu , " said czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country holds the bloc 's rotating presidency . " obviously there is a political dimension to this problem , " topolanek said in prague ahead of a meeting with the eu 's executive , the european commission . officials in brussels declined to elaborate on the substance of the eu threat , but experts believe some leverage may lie in the fact that ukraine has expressed strong interest in joining the eu , while both countries trade heavily with the bloc . damaged reputations ? prior to his arrival in prague , eu commission president jose manuel barroso accused the sides of holding the eu 's gas supply " hostage " because of their dispute over unpaid bills .

the offer was immediately taken up by ukrainian president viktor yushchenko . pain across europe in a letter to barroso , yushchenko suggested eu technicians could independently evaluate the volume of russian natural gas entering ukraine .
moscow has repeatedly accused kyiv of siphoning off gas destined to europe - a claim strongly denied by the ukrainians . meanwhile , hungary became one of the first european countries to impose restrictions on industrial gas use as underground reserves were being tapped at maximum capacity . serbia 's reserves were virtually depleted while bulgaria , which is 100 percent dependant on russian gas , was considering re-opening one of its soviet-era nuclear reactors - shut down for safety reasons when it joined the eu - in order to meet its energy needs . emergency measures were also triggered in slovakia , while poland was compensating for a complete cut-off by boosting supplies via neighboring belarus . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he said a new role should be created for governments and moral values . " either we re-found capitalism or we destroy it , " sarkozy said as he called for an economic system based on the value of work rather than finance . " purely financial capitalism has perverted the logic of capitalism , " the french president said .
" financial capitalism is a system of irresponsibility and ... is amoral .
it is a system where the logic of the market excuses everything . " the french leader said the structure of a new system of regulation should be agreed on before april 's g20 summit in london . sarkozy : us dominance at an end bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world leaders are hopeful obama will come to the table sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel collectively used the summit to urge the us not to stand in the way of tighter controls on world financial markets . " i 've always in my political life been a supporter of a close alliance with the united states but let 's be clear : in the 21st century , a single nation can no longer say what we must do or what we must think , " sarkozy said . " we 'll take our decisions on april 2 in london , " he added .
" perhaps the united states will join us in this change .
i hope so with all my heart because a new president will bring his intelligence , dynamism and his open mind and we will change the world with the united states . " but we will not accept the status quo , we will not accept stagnation . " merkel said : " no country can act alone in this day and age ... even the united states , however powerful they may be . " merkel : politicians must remain vigilant bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says reforms must persist after the crisis is resolved merkel called for the establishment of a " charter for a long-term reasonable economy " similar to the united nations charter . " our response -lrb- to the economic crisis -rrb- must be more than a few rules , " merkel said .
" the crisis is an opportunity to create an international architecture of institutions . " " it is possible that alongside the -lrb- un -rrb- security council , we could also have an economic council that would have a different role from ecosoc , " merkel said , referring to the united nations economic and social council . she singled out the us budget deficit and china 's current account surplus as bones of contention and also called on politicians to remain firm even after the crisis has been resolved . " there is a risk that when everything is functioning normally again that the financial institutions will tell politicians not to meddle , " she cautioned .
" we must remain determined . " blair : no turning back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair says the financial crisis is still evolving former british prime minister tony blair , who is one of the co-sponsors of the symposium with sarkozy , told participants that investment patterns must be changed . " this economic crisis is the biggest , most complex , most delicate economic challenge of our lifetime .
it is the most tricky intellectual challenge of any kind i have ever encountered and it is still evolving , " blair said . " what is plain is that the financial system has altered in its fundamentals and can never be the same again . " what is unavoidable in the longer term is a recasting of the system of international supervision . " we must invest in the future , " blair said , calling for funds to be put into renewable energy , science , innovation and education . the symposium was downgraded from a summit because few world leaders chose to attend .
in addition to sarkozy and merkel , only liberian president ellen johnson-sirleaf was present on thursday . other participants at the two-day conference include economics nobel prize winners amartya sen and joseph stiglitz , world trade organization head pascal lamy and the president of the european central bank , jean-claude trichet . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

7 it obtained a bridging loan of 400 million euros -lrb- $ 545 million -rrb- from a consortium of about 30 lenders in a deal that the billionaire owner concluded before his death two days earlier . the agreement requires vem to sell its drug company ratiopharm and for merckle 's son ludwig to leave that firm , which employs 5,400 people and had 1.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.5 billion -rrb- in sales in 2008 . the sale of ratiopharm is aimed at ending a liquidity crisis in vem , which has about 100,000 employees altogether .
only ratiopharm is mentioned in the deal with the banks , and an administrator will be appointed to manage the transition . german media reports say the sale is unlikely to take place before the end of 2009 .
one reason for the delay is that it will take time to work out details of a plan to put the company 's affairs in order . a second issue is reportedly the assumption among those involved in the deal that international markets will be less volitile in one year , which would supposedly make it easier to secure a better price for ratiopharm . the company is one of the central elements of vem .
other major components of merckle 's empire are heidelbergcement and the drug wholesaler phoenix . merckle -lrb- 74 -rrb- was germany 's fifth wealthiest man and ranked 94th on forbes list of the world 's richest people .
he said in a recent interview that he had lived through many stock market crashes but was not prepared for " a banking and financial crisis on the scale " of the present one .
his family said after his death that the impact of the crisis on his traditional , family-run business he built up in the course of his lifetime left him " a broken man .

deutsche welle : how serious is the situation ?
are things about to get very cold in germany ?
hans-joachim ziesing : i think there is a bit of a difference between some european countries and germany .
i believe in germany it is n't going to get cold anytime soon , though if the interruption lasts longer then there will certainly be problems here .
but we need to ensure that we have other supply sources - like the netherlands and norway - and that we keep our reserves full .
we 'll certainly be able to deal with the interruption for the time being , but not if it lasts for more than a couple of weeks .
then we 'll definitely have problems . can russia still be considered a dependable partner when it comes to gas supplies ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-joachim ziesing what i find completely unacceptable is that the dispute between russia and ukraine is being pushed on to the backs of other nations .
both russia and the ukraine should really be careful that other nations do n't begin to doubt their dependability .
what does this mean for the european union ?
what consequences can we expect ?
what the consequences will be is n't easy to say , because we certainly ca n't live without russian gas in the foreseeable future .
it is currently that largest gas supply sustaining us .
of course we need to diversify our gas supplies , and tap into other sources .
there are already a couple of lng -lrb- liquid natural gas -rrb- reserves that we can fall back on , which would also help us be more energy efficient .
i think that using less gas and replacing some of the gas we use with other sources is something we urgently need to do in order to be able to avoid situations like these .
but that is something we can do in the future .
what could help in the short term ?
there is n't a lot that can help in the short term .
we can fall back on the other sources .
we 'll have to use our gas reserves to get through this bottleneck .
especially since we are experiencing such cold temperatures right now , and this is going to raise the amount of gas needed to warm people 's houses .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-joachim ziesing what i find completely unacceptable is that the dispute between russia and ukraine is being pushed on to the backs of other nations .
both russia and the ukraine should really be careful that other nations do n't begin to doubt their dependability .
what does this mean for the european union ?
what consequences can we expect ?
what the consequences will be is n't easy to say , because we certainly ca n't live without russian gas in the foreseeable future .
it is currently that largest gas supply sustaining us .
of course we need to diversify our gas supplies , and tap into other sources .
there are already a couple of lng -lrb- liquid natural gas -rrb- reserves that we can fall back on , which would also help us be more energy efficient .
i think that using less gas and replacing some of the gas we use with other sources is something we urgently need to do in order to be able to avoid situations like these .
but that is something we can do in the future .
what could help in the short term ?
there is n't a lot that can help in the short term .
we can fall back on the other sources .
we 'll have to use our gas reserves to get through this bottleneck .
especially since we are experiencing such cold temperatures right now , and this is going to raise the amount of gas needed to warm people 's houses .
i think we need to try and reduce our usage where we can .

talks in brussels between gazprom and eu officials have given rise to hopes that a breakthrough will soon be reached in the european gas supply crisis .
but some conditions must be met first . the head of russian gas giant gazprom said he was willing to reopen supplies to the european union as quickly as possible , on condition that the eu monitors the flow of gas through ukraine . " as soon as the eu observers are in ukraine and have access to the gas pipelines , the gas supplies should be restored as soon as possible , " alexei miller said after a meeting in brussels with the president of the european parliament , hans-gert poettering . ukrainian officials also said they hoped for a quick agreement . " we could possibly sign the contracts in moscow this evening : " i hope it will come to that , " bogdan sokolovski , energy envoy to ukrainian president viktor yushchenko , said . eu seeks guarantees on deliveries but eu officials insisted that there would only be a point in despatching the mission if both russia and ukraine guaranteed to restart deliveries to europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu parliament president poettering met the parties " we do not want to send observers just to check that the situation is not changing .
we want to send observers to make sure that the situation is changing , that supply and transit is resumed , " european commission spokesman johannes laitenberger said . the official statements came hours after eu spokesmen confirmed that the bloc was ready to send a mission of gas experts to ukraine to make sure that any russian gas entering the country bound for european clients actually made it to its destination . a european commission energy director told reuters news service that eu observers would be ready in two days . moscow , kyiv trade accusations gazprom has repeatedly accused ukraine of siphoning off gas for european clients to meet its own needs , after the russian company shut off direct deliveries to ukraine in a row over contract terms . on tuesday , jan .
5 , gazprom stopped all deliveries of gas through ukraine to europe , saying that this was the only way to prevent such " thefts , " in a major escalation of the conflict which provoked outrage in europe . on thursday , jan 8 , both miller and his ukrainian counterpart , oleh dubyna , visited brussels to lobby for eu support in the row , which comes as temperatures across europe plunged to record lows . the eu refused to take sides , instead demanding that the gas be turned back on instantly . suppliers ' reputation ' at risk ' " in the short run the problem is with those who do n't receive the gas .
but in the medium and long term the problem is with those that do not appear as reliable suppliers and transit suppliers .
at this point in time this reputation is at risk , " laitenberger said . bildunterschrift : a cold front in europe has added to the urgency russia is the eu 's largest supplier of natural gas , accounting for some 25 percent of the bloc 's total consumption .
eighty percent of that gas passes through ukrainian pipelines . however , the current crisis , which is a near-perfect repeat of a row in 2006 , has sparked an impassioned debate across europe on the need to reduce the bloc 's reliance on both its former-soviet neighbors . this time around , the gas cut-offs have left hundreds of thousands of people in the balkans without gas , forced factories to shut down and disrupted deliveries as far west as france and germany . france and germany said russia had to honor its gas contracts with europe regardless of the dispute , but they also warned ukraine not to forget its own obligations . history of tensions " we expect the talks between ukraine and russia to yield quick results , " german chancellor angela merkel said in paris after talks with french president nicolas sarkozy . the dispute between kyiv and its former soviet master in moscow follows tensions over ukraine 's efforts to join nato , a move bitterly opposed by moscow and viewed with wariness even by european members of the alliance and by investors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom 's miller lobbied in brussels for support russia cut off gas for ukraine 's domestic consumption on new year 's day after disagreements over gas prices and debts owed by ukraine .
it fully suspended supplies of transit gas towards ukraine on wednesday , saying there was no longer any point delivering the gas because kyiiv had shut down the pipelines . ukraine said russia was deliberately starving europe of gas . southeast europe has borne the brunt of the disruption , but it has affected supplies as far west as france and germany as europe faced freezing mid-winter temperatures . europe is weathering the storm " a key point here , is that industrial stoppages are only now beginning to occur -lrb- mainly in gas intensive industries -rrb- , but would spread relatively rapidly if gas supplies remain limited , " martin blum , an economist at unicredit in vienna , told reuters news agency . based on gas use and reliance on russia as a source of gas , blum said hungary and slovakia looked most at risk from the halt in supplies .
bulgaria , serbia and croatia all had reserves reportedly below 10 days of average consumption , he added . the euro zone 's major economies have escaped significant economic repercussions , but france has reported a drop in supplies and an italian industry ministry spokesman said italy has begun tapping its stockpiles of natural gas . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

talks in brussels between gazprom and eu officials have given rise to hopes that a breakthrough will soon be reached in the european gas supply crisis .
but some conditions must be met first . the head of russian gas giant gazprom said he was willing to reopen supplies to the european union as quickly as possible , on condition that the eu monitors the flow of gas through ukraine . " as soon as the eu observers are in ukraine and have access to the gas pipelines , the gas supplies should be restored as soon as possible , " alexei miller said after a meeting in brussels with the president of the european parliament , hans-gert poettering . ukrainian officials also said they hoped for a quick agreement . " we could possibly sign the contracts in moscow this evening : " i hope it will come to that , " bogdan sokolovski , energy envoy to ukrainian president viktor yushchenko , said . eu seeks guarantees on deliveries but eu officials insisted that there would only be a point in despatching the mission if both russia and ukraine guaranteed to restart deliveries to europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu parliament president poettering met the parties " we do not want to send observers just to check that the situation is not changing .
we want to send observers to make sure that the situation is changing , that supply and transit is resumed , " european commission spokesman johannes laitenberger said . the official statements came hours after eu spokesmen confirmed that the bloc was ready to send a mission of gas experts to ukraine to make sure that any russian gas entering the country bound for european clients actually made it to its destination . a european commission energy director told reuters news service that eu observers would be ready in two days . moscow , kyiv trade accusations gazprom has repeatedly accused ukraine of siphoning off gas for european clients to meet its own needs , after the russian company shut off direct deliveries to ukraine in a row over contract terms . on tuesday , jan .
5 , gazprom stopped all deliveries of gas through ukraine to europe , saying that this was the only way to prevent such " thefts , " in a major escalation of the conflict which provoked outrage in europe . on thursday , jan 8 , both miller and his ukrainian counterpart , oleh dubyna , visited brussels to lobby for eu support in the row , which comes as temperatures across europe plunged to record lows . the eu refused to take sides , instead demanding that the gas be turned back on instantly . suppliers ' reputation ' at risk ' " in the short run the problem is with those who do n't receive the gas .
but in the medium and long term the problem is with those that do not appear as reliable suppliers and transit suppliers .
at this point in time this reputation is at risk , " laitenberger said . bildunterschrift : a cold front in europe has added to the urgency russia is the eu 's largest supplier of natural gas , accounting for some 25 percent of the bloc 's total consumption .
eighty percent of that gas passes through ukrainian pipelines . however , the current crisis , which is a near-perfect repeat of a row in 2006 , has sparked an impassioned debate across europe on the need to reduce the bloc 's reliance on both its former-soviet neighbors . this time around , the gas cut-offs have left hundreds of thousands of people in the balkans without gas , forced factories to shut down and disrupted deliveries as far west as france and germany . france and germany said russia had to honor its gas contracts with europe regardless of the dispute , but they also warned ukraine not to forget its own obligations . history of tensions " we expect the talks between ukraine and russia to yield quick results , " german chancellor angela merkel said in paris after talks with french president nicolas sarkozy . the dispute between kyiv and its former soviet master in moscow follows tensions over ukraine 's efforts to join nato , a move bitterly opposed by moscow and viewed with wariness even by european members of the alliance and by investors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom 's miller lobbied in brussels for support russia cut off gas for ukraine 's domestic consumption on new year 's day after disagreements over gas prices and debts owed by ukraine .
it fully suspended supplies of transit gas towards ukraine on wednesday , saying there was no longer any point delivering the gas because kyiiv had shut down the pipelines . ukraine said russia was deliberately starving europe of gas . southeast europe has borne the brunt of the disruption , but it has affected supplies as far west as france and germany as europe faced freezing mid-winter temperatures . europe is weathering the storm " a key point here , is that industrial stoppages are only now beginning to occur -lrb- mainly in gas intensive industries -rrb- , but would spread relatively rapidly if gas supplies remain limited , " martin blum , an economist at unicredit in vienna , told reuters news agency . based on gas use and reliance on russia as a source of gas , blum said hungary and slovakia looked most at risk from the halt in supplies .
bulgaria , serbia and croatia all had reserves reportedly below 10 days of average consumption , he added . the euro zone 's major economies have escaped significant economic repercussions , but france has reported a drop in supplies and an italian industry ministry spokesman said italy has begun tapping its stockpiles of natural gas . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

7 it obtained a bridging loan of 400 million euros -lrb- $ 545 million -rrb- from a consortium of about 30 lenders in a deal that the billionaire owner concluded before his death two days earlier . the agreement requires vem to sell its drug company ratiopharm and for merckle 's son ludwig to leave that firm , which employs 5,400 people and had 1.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.5 billion -rrb- in sales in 2008 . the sale of ratiopharm is aimed at ending a liquidity crisis in vem , which has about 100,000 employees altogether .
only ratiopharm is mentioned in the deal with the banks , and an administrator will be appointed to manage the transition . german media reports say the sale is unlikely to take place before the end of 2009 .
one reason for the delay is that it will take time to work out details of a plan to put the company 's affairs in order . a second issue is reportedly the assumption among those involved in the deal that international markets will be less volitile in one year , which would supposedly make it easier to secure a better price for ratiopharm . the company is one of the central elements of vem .
other major components of merckle 's empire are heidelbergcement and the drug wholesaler phoenix . merckle -lrb- 74 -rrb- was germany 's fifth wealthiest man and ranked 94th on forbes list of the world 's richest people .
he said in a recent interview that he had lived through many stock market crashes but was not prepared for " a banking and financial crisis on the scale " of the present one .
his family said after his death that the impact of the crisis on his traditional , family-run business he built up in the course of his lifetime left him " a broken man .

he said a new role should be created for governments and moral values . " either we re-found capitalism or we destroy it , " sarkozy said as he called for an economic system based on the value of work rather than finance . " purely financial capitalism has perverted the logic of capitalism , " the french president said .
" financial capitalism is a system of irresponsibility and ... is amoral .
it is a system where the logic of the market excuses everything . " the french leader said the structure of a new system of regulation should be agreed on before april 's g20 summit in london . sarkozy : us dominance at an end bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world leaders are hopeful obama will come to the table sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel collectively used the summit to urge the us not to stand in the way of tighter controls on world financial markets . " i 've always in my political life been a supporter of a close alliance with the united states but let 's be clear : in the 21st century , a single nation can no longer say what we must do or what we must think , " sarkozy said . " we 'll take our decisions on april 2 in london , " he added .
" perhaps the united states will join us in this change .
i hope so with all my heart because a new president will bring his intelligence , dynamism and his open mind and we will change the world with the united states . " but we will not accept the status quo , we will not accept stagnation . " merkel said : " no country can act alone in this day and age ... even the united states , however powerful they may be . " merkel : politicians must remain vigilant bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says reforms must persist after the crisis is resolved merkel called for the establishment of a " charter for a long-term reasonable economy " similar to the united nations charter . " our response -lrb- to the economic crisis -rrb- must be more than a few rules , " merkel said .
" the crisis is an opportunity to create an international architecture of institutions . " " it is possible that alongside the -lrb- un -rrb- security council , we could also have an economic council that would have a different role from ecosoc , " merkel said , referring to the united nations economic and social council . she singled out the us budget deficit and china 's current account surplus as bones of contention and also called on politicians to remain firm even after the crisis has been resolved . " there is a risk that when everything is functioning normally again that the financial institutions will tell politicians not to meddle , " she cautioned .
" we must remain determined . " blair : no turning back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair says the financial crisis is still evolving former british prime minister tony blair , who is one of the co-sponsors of the symposium with sarkozy , told participants that investment patterns must be changed . " this economic crisis is the biggest , most complex , most delicate economic challenge of our lifetime .
it is the most tricky intellectual challenge of any kind i have ever encountered and it is still evolving , " blair said . " what is plain is that the financial system has altered in its fundamentals and can never be the same again . " what is unavoidable in the longer term is a recasting of the system of international supervision . " we must invest in the future , " blair said , calling for funds to be put into renewable energy , science , innovation and education . the symposium was downgraded from a summit because few world leaders chose to attend .
in addition to sarkozy and merkel , only liberian president ellen johnson-sirleaf was present on thursday . other participants at the two-day conference include economics nobel prize winners amartya sen and joseph stiglitz , world trade organization head pascal lamy and the president of the european central bank , jean-claude trichet . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he said a new role should be created for governments and moral values . " either we re-found capitalism or we destroy it , " sarkozy said as he called for an economic system based on the value of work rather than finance . " purely financial capitalism has perverted the logic of capitalism , " the french president said .
" financial capitalism is a system of irresponsibility and ... is amoral .
it is a system where the logic of the market excuses everything . " the french leader said the structure of a new system of regulation should be agreed on before april 's g20 summit in london . sarkozy : us dominance at an end bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world leaders are hopeful obama will come to the table sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel collectively used the summit to urge the us not to stand in the way of tighter controls on world financial markets . " i 've always in my political life been a supporter of a close alliance with the united states but let 's be clear : in the 21st century , a single nation can no longer say what we must do or what we must think , " sarkozy said . " we 'll take our decisions on april 2 in london , " he added .
" perhaps the united states will join us in this change .
i hope so with all my heart because a new president will bring his intelligence , dynamism and his open mind and we will change the world with the united states . " but we will not accept the status quo , we will not accept stagnation . " merkel said : " no country can act alone in this day and age ... even the united states , however powerful they may be .

talks in brussels between gazprom and eu officials have given rise to hopes that a breakthrough will soon be reached in the european gas supply crisis .
but some conditions must be met first . the head of russian gas giant gazprom said he was willing to reopen supplies to the european union as quickly as possible , on condition that the eu monitors the flow of gas through ukraine . " as soon as the eu observers are in ukraine and have access to the gas pipelines , the gas supplies should be restored as soon as possible , " alexei miller said after a meeting in brussels with the president of the european parliament , hans-gert poettering . ukrainian officials also said they hoped for a quick agreement . " we could possibly sign the contracts in moscow this evening : " i hope it will come to that , " bogdan sokolovski , energy envoy to ukrainian president viktor yushchenko , said . eu seeks guarantees on deliveries but eu officials insisted that there would only be a point in despatching the mission if both russia and ukraine guaranteed to restart deliveries to europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu parliament president poettering met the parties " we do not want to send observers just to check that the situation is not changing .
we want to send observers to make sure that the situation is changing , that supply and transit is resumed , " european commission spokesman johannes laitenberger said . the official statements came hours after eu spokesmen confirmed that the bloc was ready to send a mission of gas experts to ukraine to make sure that any russian gas entering the country bound for european clients actually made it to its destination . a european commission energy director told reuters news service that eu observers would be ready in two days . moscow , kyiv trade accusations gazprom has repeatedly accused ukraine of siphoning off gas for european clients to meet its own needs , after the russian company shut off direct deliveries to ukraine in a row over contract terms . on tuesday , jan .
5 , gazprom stopped all deliveries of gas through ukraine to europe , saying that this was the only way to prevent such " thefts , " in a major escalation of the conflict which provoked outrage in europe . on thursday , jan 8 , both miller and his ukrainian counterpart , oleh dubyna , visited brussels to lobby for eu support in the row , which comes as temperatures across europe plunged to record lows . the eu refused to take sides , instead demanding that the gas be turned back on instantly . suppliers ' reputation ' at risk ' " in the short run the problem is with those who do n't receive the gas .
but in the medium and long term the problem is with those that do not appear as reliable suppliers and transit suppliers .
at this point in time this reputation is at risk , " laitenberger said . bildunterschrift : a cold front in europe has added to the urgency russia is the eu 's largest supplier of natural gas , accounting for some 25 percent of the bloc 's total consumption .
eighty percent of that gas passes through ukrainian pipelines . however , the current crisis , which is a near-perfect repeat of a row in 2006 , has sparked an impassioned debate across europe on the need to reduce the bloc 's reliance on both its former-soviet neighbors . this time around , the gas cut-offs have left hundreds of thousands of people in the balkans without gas , forced factories to shut down and disrupted deliveries as far west as france and germany . france and germany said russia had to honor its gas contracts with europe regardless of the dispute , but they also warned ukraine not to forget its own obligations . history of tensions " we expect the talks between ukraine and russia to yield quick results , " german chancellor angela merkel said in paris after talks with french president nicolas sarkozy . the dispute between kyiv and its former soviet master in moscow follows tensions over ukraine 's efforts to join nato , a move bitterly opposed by moscow and viewed with wariness even by european members of the alliance and by investors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom 's miller lobbied in brussels for support russia cut off gas for ukraine 's domestic consumption on new year 's day after disagreements over gas prices and debts owed by ukraine .
it fully suspended supplies of transit gas towards ukraine on wednesday , saying there was no longer any point delivering the gas because kyiiv had shut down the pipelines . ukraine said russia was deliberately starving europe of gas . southeast europe has borne the brunt of the disruption , but it has affected supplies as far west as france and germany as europe faced freezing mid-winter temperatures . europe is weathering the storm " a key point here , is that industrial stoppages are only now beginning to occur -lrb- mainly in gas intensive industries -rrb- , but would spread relatively rapidly if gas supplies remain limited , " martin blum , an economist at unicredit in vienna , told reuters news agency . based on gas use and reliance on russia as a source of gas , blum said hungary and slovakia looked most at risk from the halt in supplies .
bulgaria , serbia and croatia all had reserves reportedly below 10 days of average consumption , he added . the euro zone 's major economies have escaped significant economic repercussions , but france has reported a drop in supplies and an italian industry ministry spokesman said italy has begun tapping its stockpiles of natural gas . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

their trial began thursday , jan .
8 . the men have dismissed the charges as unfounded , saying that their contacts with batasuna were part of efforts by prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero to find a negotiated solution to the long-standing basque problem .
ibarretxe told a preliminary hearing in 2008 that he is committed to " talk to everyone " to find a end to a problem that has bedeviled spanish politics for decades . lopez said that he is " absolutely convinced " there will be no convictions , arguing that " no court will say that politics should not be used to move on the road to peace . " prosecutors have called for the charges to be dropped .
they said that the negotiations were part of the men 's legitimate " political activities " and were aimed at " finding a solution to the basque conflict . " socialist legislator rodolfo ares is also on trial , as are four senior members of batasuna .
arnaldo otegi , who is a former batasuna spokesman , stressed that " this will be the only case in europe where the participants in talks will be in the dock for having tried to find solutions . " basque judge alfonso gonzalez guija said " it would be very healthy for democracy not to criminalize political life . " judge says the issue is crime bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basque regional president ibarretxe has to answer to the court but judge roberto saiz of the basque criminal court disagrees .
he has argued that there are " indications of a crime " and insisted in october 2007 that the trial go ahead . the charges were brought by two organizations , dignity and justice and the forum ermua .
the latter wants the accused to face prison terms of up to four years and bans on political activity .
the two groups say that the talks were part of an effort to " legitimize " batasuna . critics argue that the charges are aimed at discrediting zapatero and his policies .
during the july 2006 talks , ares appeared before television cameras with otegi , whom he urged to " leave the field of violence , " enter political life , and " take part in a round table of political parties . " the four separatist politicians are charged with defying a court order to dissolve batasuna , which was banned in 2003 for refusing to break with eta , and to condemn violence .
eta has killed 825 people in a 40-year effort aimed at securing basque independence .
zapatero has taken a tougher approach toward eta since at least june 2007 , when it ended a 15-month ceasefire and refused to resume talks . the court may ask for written responses to its questions from zapatero and from his two predecessors , jose maria aznar and felipe gonzalez .
the trial is expected to last three weeks . dw staff -lrb- pgm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

7 it obtained a bridging loan of 400 million euros -lrb- $ 545 million -rrb- from a consortium of about 30 lenders in a deal that the billionaire owner concluded before his death two days earlier . the agreement requires vem to sell its drug company ratiopharm and for merckle 's son ludwig to leave that firm , which employs 5,400 people and had 1.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.5 billion -rrb- in sales in 2008 . the sale of ratiopharm is aimed at ending a liquidity crisis in vem , which has about 100,000 employees altogether .
only ratiopharm is mentioned in the deal with the banks , and an administrator will be appointed to manage the transition . german media reports say the sale is unlikely to take place before the end of 2009 .
one reason for the delay is that it will take time to work out details of a plan to put the company 's affairs in order . a second issue is reportedly the assumption among those involved in the deal that international markets will be less volitile in one year , which would supposedly make it easier to secure a better price for ratiopharm . the company is one of the central elements of vem .

their trial began thursday , jan .
8 . the men have dismissed the charges as unfounded , saying that their contacts with batasuna were part of efforts by prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero to find a negotiated solution to the long-standing basque problem .
ibarretxe told a preliminary hearing in 2008 that he is committed to " talk to everyone " to find a end to a problem that has bedeviled spanish politics for decades . lopez said that he is " absolutely convinced " there will be no convictions , arguing that " no court will say that politics should not be used to move on the road to peace . " prosecutors have called for the charges to be dropped .
they said that the negotiations were part of the men 's legitimate " political activities " and were aimed at " finding a solution to the basque conflict . " socialist legislator rodolfo ares is also on trial , as are four senior members of batasuna .
arnaldo otegi , who is a former batasuna spokesman , stressed that " this will be the only case in europe where the participants in talks will be in the dock for having tried to find solutions . " basque judge alfonso gonzalez guija said " it would be very healthy for democracy not to criminalize political life . " judge says the issue is crime bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basque regional president ibarretxe has to answer to the court but judge roberto saiz of the basque criminal court disagrees .
he has argued that there are " indications of a crime " and insisted in october 2007 that the trial go ahead . the charges were brought by two organizations , dignity and justice and the forum ermua .
the latter wants the accused to face prison terms of up to four years and bans on political activity .
the two groups say that the talks were part of an effort to " legitimize " batasuna . critics argue that the charges are aimed at discrediting zapatero and his policies .
during the july 2006 talks , ares appeared before television cameras with otegi , whom he urged to " leave the field of violence , " enter political life , and " take part in a round table of political parties . " the four separatist politicians are charged with defying a court order to dissolve batasuna , which was banned in 2003 for refusing to break with eta , and to condemn violence .
eta has killed 825 people in a 40-year effort aimed at securing basque independence .
zapatero has taken a tougher approach toward eta since at least june 2007 , when it ended a 15-month ceasefire and refused to resume talks . the court may ask for written responses to its questions from zapatero and from his two predecessors , jose maria aznar and felipe gonzalez .
the trial is expected to last three weeks . dw staff -lrb- pgm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche welle : how serious is the situation ?
are things about to get very cold in germany ?
hans-joachim ziesing : i think there is a bit of a difference between some european countries and germany .
i believe in germany it is n't going to get cold anytime soon , though if the interruption lasts longer then there will certainly be problems here .
but we need to ensure that we have other supply sources - like the netherlands and norway - and that we keep our reserves full .
we 'll certainly be able to deal with the interruption for the time being , but not if it lasts for more than a couple of weeks .
then we 'll definitely have problems . can russia still be considered a dependable partner when it comes to gas supplies ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-joachim ziesing what i find completely unacceptable is that the dispute between russia and ukraine is being pushed on to the backs of other nations .
both russia and the ukraine should really be careful that other nations do n't begin to doubt their dependability .
what does this mean for the european union ?
what consequences can we expect ?
what the consequences will be is n't easy to say , because we certainly ca n't live without russian gas in the foreseeable future .
it is currently that largest gas supply sustaining us .
of course we need to diversify our gas supplies , and tap into other sources .
there are already a couple of lng -lrb- liquid natural gas -rrb- reserves that we can fall back on , which would also help us be more energy efficient .
i think that using less gas and replacing some of the gas we use with other sources is something we urgently need to do in order to be able to avoid situations like these .
but that is something we can do in the future .
what could help in the short term ?
there is n't a lot that can help in the short term .
we can fall back on the other sources .
we 'll have to use our gas reserves to get through this bottleneck .
especially since we are experiencing such cold temperatures right now , and this is going to raise the amount of gas needed to warm people 's houses .
i think we need to try and reduce our usage where we can .
that would certainly help . interview : sandra berndt -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

i believe in germany it is n't going to get cold anytime soon , though if the interruption lasts longer then there will certainly be problems here .
but we need to ensure that we have other supply sources - like the netherlands and norway - and that we keep our reserves full .
we 'll certainly be able to deal with the interruption for the time being , but not if it lasts for more than a couple of weeks .
then we 'll definitely have problems . can russia still be considered a dependable partner when it comes to gas supplies ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-joachim ziesing what i find completely unacceptable is that the dispute between russia and ukraine is being pushed on to the backs of other nations .
both russia and the ukraine should really be careful that other nations do n't begin to doubt their dependability .
what does this mean for the european union ?
what consequences can we expect ?
what the consequences will be is n't easy to say , because we certainly ca n't live without russian gas in the foreseeable future .
it is currently that largest gas supply sustaining us .
of course we need to diversify our gas supplies , and tap into other sources .
there are already a couple of lng -lrb- liquid natural gas -rrb- reserves that we can fall back on , which would also help us be more energy efficient .
i think that using less gas and replacing some of the gas we use with other sources is something we urgently need to do in order to be able to avoid situations like these .
but that is something we can do in the future .
what could help in the short term ?
there is n't a lot that can help in the short term .
we can fall back on the other sources .
we 'll have to use our gas reserves to get through this bottleneck .
especially since we are experiencing such cold temperatures right now , and this is going to raise the amount of gas needed to warm people 's houses .
i think we need to try and reduce our usage where we can .
that would certainly help . interview : sandra berndt -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . i do not agree with germany 's stance in support of support israel .
the same old mistakes are being made .
violence is fought with violence and that by a military power which is much much stronger to wipe out the weaker opponent .
transformation can only happen through love and compassion .
i would have thought that jews would have more compassion for the underdog considering their own past sufferring .
each side will have to learn to live with each other in the same land . - reiner schmitt , australia i feel very saddened that the government of germany has chosen to support both the us and israel on this inhuman conflict waged against people already in a very bad situation .
i would prefer to see the government seek to resolve the terrible conditions that palestinians have to bear .
if they were able to live in peace as well as isreali citizens do with the same freedoms , there would be no conflicts or extremism . - carol lee murphy , canada germany is still too shy to speak independantly from the us due its guilt because of the holocaust .
germany needs to find the courage to confront the situation like it is , regardless of who is the perpetrator .
israel policy of bombs versus rockets will not bring peace to palestine .
only by solving the future of a palestinian state and the role of jerusalem between two states will the situation be solved .
but the hardliners in israel do not give the palestinians the same right they want for themselves , the right to exist . - rolf brulez .
australia i am a mother of two very young children and i simply ca n't imagine how one human can do this to another .
even with all these images of innocent people dying and wounded , the rest of the world seems to be sleeping .
i pray togod and appeal to anyone who has a heart to stop the blood shed right now . - huma chaudhry , pakistan hamas was elected in a massive majority by the palestinian people .
the eu was there during elections with a full complement of election monitors and testified that the elections were " clean " and only minor problems were reported at the polling stations .
just because some western political leaders do n't like the policies of hamas , does n't mean they were not democratically-elected .
therefore , they are the legally permitted and elected representatives of the palestinian people . - john brian shannon , canada almost everyone is demanding that israel stop it 's " aggression " in gaza .
who is blaming iran and syria for their original financing and arranging the arms flow to hamas in gaza ? - charles akselrad , us i support the german government decision to support israel concerning the attacks on gaza . - dennis young , us if the eu wants to have a role in resolving the conflict between israel and gaza , the eu should seek to discover the gazans who do not support hamas and give them some media exposure .

8 that its car sales exceeded one million in 2008 , the 13th consecutive year-on-year increase .
the record results go against the current downward trend in the car industry . the carmaker sold just over one million vehicles worldwide in 2008 , up 4.1 percent over 2007 .
december sales rose over 17.4 percent compared to the same month the previous year , at a time when its rivals have been badly hit by the global economic downturn . audi head rupert stadler said that his firm aims to become " the most attractive premium brand worldwide " in the car market .
he added that audi intends to build on its success by introducing new products in 2009 . company officials noted that 2008 was the first time that audi has broken the one million mark in sales .
the managers attributed much of the gain to the introduction of 12 new models , including the a4 saloon car and the q5 sports utility vehicle . the ingolstadt-based carmaker is bucking a trend in germany as well as elsewhere in the world .
car sales in germany , which is western europe 's biggest market , fell 6.6 percent in december .
in 2008 as a whole , german new car registrations were down by 1.9 percent over 2007 to 3.09 million .
audi is a subsidiary of volkswagen , germany 's biggest car manufacturer . kpmg consultants released a survey on january 8 , suggesting that senior german auto industry executives feel the situation will stay bleak through 2013 .
the study of 200 companies showed that respondents expect wildly fluctuating earnings during that period .
some respondents said that they are not in a position to make a reliable estimate of their companies ' profitability . dw staff -lrb- pgm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he said a new role should be created for governments and moral values . " either we re-found capitalism or we destroy it , " sarkozy said as he called for an economic system based on the value of work rather than finance . " purely financial capitalism has perverted the logic of capitalism , " the french president said .
" financial capitalism is a system of irresponsibility and ... is amoral .
it is a system where the logic of the market excuses everything . " the french leader said the structure of a new system of regulation should be agreed on before april 's g20 summit in london . sarkozy : us dominance at an end bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world leaders are hopeful obama will come to the table sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel collectively used the summit to urge the us not to stand in the way of tighter controls on world financial markets . " i 've always in my political life been a supporter of a close alliance with the united states but let 's be clear : in the 21st century , a single nation can no longer say what we must do or what we must think , " sarkozy said . " we 'll take our decisions on april 2 in london , " he added .
" perhaps the united states will join us in this change .
i hope so with all my heart because a new president will bring his intelligence , dynamism and his open mind and we will change the world with the united states . " but we will not accept the status quo , we will not accept stagnation . " merkel said : " no country can act alone in this day and age ... even the united states , however powerful they may be . " merkel : politicians must remain vigilant bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says reforms must persist after the crisis is resolved merkel called for the establishment of a " charter for a long-term reasonable economy " similar to the united nations charter . " our response -lrb- to the economic crisis -rrb- must be more than a few rules , " merkel said .
" the crisis is an opportunity to create an international architecture of institutions . " " it is possible that alongside the -lrb- un -rrb- security council , we could also have an economic council that would have a different role from ecosoc , " merkel said , referring to the united nations economic and social council . she singled out the us budget deficit and china 's current account surplus as bones of contention and also called on politicians to remain firm even after the crisis has been resolved . " there is a risk that when everything is functioning normally again that the financial institutions will tell politicians not to meddle , " she cautioned .
" we must remain determined . " blair : no turning back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair says the financial crisis is still evolving former british prime minister tony blair , who is one of the co-sponsors of the symposium with sarkozy , told participants that investment patterns must be changed . " this economic crisis is the biggest , most complex , most delicate economic challenge of our lifetime .
it is the most tricky intellectual challenge of any kind i have ever encountered and it is still evolving , " blair said . " what is plain is that the financial system has altered in its fundamentals and can never be the same again . " what is unavoidable in the longer term is a recasting of the system of international supervision . " we must invest in the future , " blair said , calling for funds to be put into renewable energy , science , innovation and education . the symposium was downgraded from a summit because few world leaders chose to attend .
in addition to sarkozy and merkel , only liberian president ellen johnson-sirleaf was present on thursday . other participants at the two-day conference include economics nobel prize winners amartya sen and joseph stiglitz , world trade organization head pascal lamy and the president of the european central bank , jean-claude trichet . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . i do not agree with germany 's stance in support of support israel .
the same old mistakes are being made .
violence is fought with violence and that by a military power which is much much stronger to wipe out the weaker opponent .
transformation can only happen through love and compassion .
i would have thought that jews would have more compassion for the underdog considering their own past sufferring .
each side will have to learn to live with each other in the same land . - reiner schmitt , australia i feel very saddened that the government of germany has chosen to support both the us and israel on this inhuman conflict waged against people already in a very bad situation .
i would prefer to see the government seek to resolve the terrible conditions that palestinians have to bear .
if they were able to live in peace as well as isreali citizens do with the same freedoms , there would be no conflicts or extremism . - carol lee murphy , canada germany is still too shy to speak independantly from the us due its guilt because of the holocaust .
germany needs to find the courage to confront the situation like it is , regardless of who is the perpetrator .
israel policy of bombs versus rockets will not bring peace to palestine .
only by solving the future of a palestinian state and the role of jerusalem between two states will the situation be solved .
but the hardliners in israel do not give the palestinians the same right they want for themselves , the right to exist . - rolf brulez .
australia i am a mother of two very young children and i simply ca n't imagine how one human can do this to another .
even with all these images of innocent people dying and wounded , the rest of the world seems to be sleeping .

talks in brussels between gazprom and eu officials have given rise to hopes that a breakthrough will soon be reached in the european gas supply crisis .
but some conditions must be met first . the head of russian gas giant gazprom said he was willing to reopen supplies to the european union as quickly as possible , on condition that the eu monitors the flow of gas through ukraine . " as soon as the eu observers are in ukraine and have access to the gas pipelines , the gas supplies should be restored as soon as possible , " alexei miller said after a meeting in brussels with the president of the european parliament , hans-gert poettering . ukrainian officials also said they hoped for a quick agreement . " we could possibly sign the contracts in moscow this evening : " i hope it will come to that , " bogdan sokolovski , energy envoy to ukrainian president viktor yushchenko , said . eu seeks guarantees on deliveries but eu officials insisted that there would only be a point in despatching the mission if both russia and ukraine guaranteed to restart deliveries to europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu parliament president poettering met the parties " we do not want to send observers just to check that the situation is not changing .
we want to send observers to make sure that the situation is changing , that supply and transit is resumed , " european commission spokesman johannes laitenberger said . the official statements came hours after eu spokesmen confirmed that the bloc was ready to send a mission of gas experts to ukraine to make sure that any russian gas entering the country bound for european clients actually made it to its destination . a european commission energy director told reuters news service that eu observers would be ready in two days . moscow , kyiv trade accusations gazprom has repeatedly accused ukraine of siphoning off gas for european clients to meet its own needs , after the russian company shut off direct deliveries to ukraine in a row over contract terms . on tuesday , jan .
5 , gazprom stopped all deliveries of gas through ukraine to europe , saying that this was the only way to prevent such " thefts , " in a major escalation of the conflict which provoked outrage in europe . on thursday , jan 8 , both miller and his ukrainian counterpart , oleh dubyna , visited brussels to lobby for eu support in the row , which comes as temperatures across europe plunged to record lows . the eu refused to take sides , instead demanding that the gas be turned back on instantly . suppliers ' reputation ' at risk ' " in the short run the problem is with those who do n't receive the gas .
but in the medium and long term the problem is with those that do not appear as reliable suppliers and transit suppliers .
at this point in time this reputation is at risk , " laitenberger said . bildunterschrift : a cold front in europe has added to the urgency russia is the eu 's largest supplier of natural gas , accounting for some 25 percent of the bloc 's total consumption .
eighty percent of that gas passes through ukrainian pipelines . however , the current crisis , which is a near-perfect repeat of a row in 2006 , has sparked an impassioned debate across europe on the need to reduce the bloc 's reliance on both its former-soviet neighbors . this time around , the gas cut-offs have left hundreds of thousands of people in the balkans without gas , forced factories to shut down and disrupted deliveries as far west as france and germany . france and germany said russia had to honor its gas contracts with europe regardless of the dispute , but they also warned ukraine not to forget its own obligations . history of tensions " we expect the talks between ukraine and russia to yield quick results , " german chancellor angela merkel said in paris after talks with french president nicolas sarkozy . the dispute between kyiv and its former soviet master in moscow follows tensions over ukraine 's efforts to join nato , a move bitterly opposed by moscow and viewed with wariness even by european members of the alliance and by investors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom 's miller lobbied in brussels for support russia cut off gas for ukraine 's domestic consumption on new year 's day after disagreements over gas prices and debts owed by ukraine .
it fully suspended supplies of transit gas towards ukraine on wednesday , saying there was no longer any point delivering the gas because kyiiv had shut down the pipelines . ukraine said russia was deliberately starving europe of gas . southeast europe has borne the brunt of the disruption , but it has affected supplies as far west as france and germany as europe faced freezing mid-winter temperatures . europe is weathering the storm " a key point here , is that industrial stoppages are only now beginning to occur -lrb- mainly in gas intensive industries -rrb- , but would spread relatively rapidly if gas supplies remain limited , " martin blum , an economist at unicredit in vienna , told reuters news agency . based on gas use and reliance on russia as a source of gas , blum said hungary and slovakia looked most at risk from the halt in supplies .
bulgaria , serbia and croatia all had reserves reportedly below 10 days of average consumption , he added . the euro zone 's major economies have escaped significant economic repercussions , but france has reported a drop in supplies and an italian industry ministry spokesman said italy has begun tapping its stockpiles of natural gas . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it is the most tricky intellectual challenge of any kind i have ever encountered and it is still evolving , " blair said . " what is plain is that the financial system has altered in its fundamentals and can never be the same again . " what is unavoidable in the longer term is a recasting of the system of international supervision . " we must invest in the future , " blair said , calling for funds to be put into renewable energy , science , innovation and education . the symposium was downgraded from a summit because few world leaders chose to attend .
in addition to sarkozy and merkel , only liberian president ellen johnson-sirleaf was present on thursday . other participants at the two-day conference include economics nobel prize winners amartya sen and joseph stiglitz , world trade organization head pascal lamy and the president of the european central bank , jean-claude trichet . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . i do not agree with germany 's stance in support of support israel .
the same old mistakes are being made .
violence is fought with violence and that by a military power which is much much stronger to wipe out the weaker opponent .
transformation can only happen through love and compassion .
i would have thought that jews would have more compassion for the underdog considering their own past sufferring .
each side will have to learn to live with each other in the same land . - reiner schmitt , australia i feel very saddened that the government of germany has chosen to support both the us and israel on this inhuman conflict waged against people already in a very bad situation .
i would prefer to see the government seek to resolve the terrible conditions that palestinians have to bear .
if they were able to live in peace as well as isreali citizens do with the same freedoms , there would be no conflicts or extremism . - carol lee murphy , canada germany is still too shy to speak independantly from the us due its guilt because of the holocaust .
germany needs to find the courage to confront the situation like it is , regardless of who is the perpetrator .
israel policy of bombs versus rockets will not bring peace to palestine .
only by solving the future of a palestinian state and the role of jerusalem between two states will the situation be solved .
but the hardliners in israel do not give the palestinians the same right they want for themselves , the right to exist . - rolf brulez .
australia i am a mother of two very young children and i simply ca n't imagine how one human can do this to another .
even with all these images of innocent people dying and wounded , the rest of the world seems to be sleeping .
i pray togod and appeal to anyone who has a heart to stop the blood shed right now . - huma chaudhry , pakistan hamas was elected in a massive majority by the palestinian people .
the eu was there during elections with a full complement of election monitors and testified that the elections were " clean " and only minor problems were reported at the polling stations .
just because some western political leaders do n't like the policies of hamas , does n't mean they were not democratically-elected .
therefore , they are the legally permitted and elected representatives of the palestinian people . - john brian shannon , canada almost everyone is demanding that israel stop it 's " aggression " in gaza .
who is blaming iran and syria for their original financing and arranging the arms flow to hamas in gaza ? - charles akselrad , us i support the german government decision to support israel concerning the attacks on gaza . - dennis young , us if the eu wants to have a role in resolving the conflict between israel and gaza , the eu should seek to discover the gazans who do not support hamas and give them some media exposure .
the eu should also be supporting israel , which is confronting islamic terrorism instead of seeking ways to placate islamic terrorists and their agent provocateurs . - charles smyth , great britain compiled by dw staff -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it fully suspended supplies of transit gas towards ukraine on wednesday , saying there was no longer any point delivering the gas because kyiiv had shut down the pipelines . ukraine said russia was deliberately starving europe of gas . southeast europe has borne the brunt of the disruption , but it has affected supplies as far west as france and germany as europe faced freezing mid-winter temperatures . europe is weathering the storm " a key point here , is that industrial stoppages are only now beginning to occur -lrb- mainly in gas intensive industries -rrb- , but would spread relatively rapidly if gas supplies remain limited , " martin blum , an economist at unicredit in vienna , told reuters news agency . based on gas use and reliance on russia as a source of gas , blum said hungary and slovakia looked most at risk from the halt in supplies .
bulgaria , serbia and croatia all had reserves reportedly below 10 days of average consumption , he added . the euro zone 's major economies have escaped significant economic repercussions , but france has reported a drop in supplies and an italian industry ministry spokesman said italy has begun tapping its stockpiles of natural gas . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

their trial began thursday , jan .
8 . the men have dismissed the charges as unfounded , saying that their contacts with batasuna were part of efforts by prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero to find a negotiated solution to the long-standing basque problem .
ibarretxe told a preliminary hearing in 2008 that he is committed to " talk to everyone " to find a end to a problem that has bedeviled spanish politics for decades . lopez said that he is " absolutely convinced " there will be no convictions , arguing that " no court will say that politics should not be used to move on the road to peace . " prosecutors have called for the charges to be dropped .
they said that the negotiations were part of the men 's legitimate " political activities " and were aimed at " finding a solution to the basque conflict . " socialist legislator rodolfo ares is also on trial , as are four senior members of batasuna .
arnaldo otegi , who is a former batasuna spokesman , stressed that " this will be the only case in europe where the participants in talks will be in the dock for having tried to find solutions . " basque judge alfonso gonzalez guija said " it would be very healthy for democracy not to criminalize political life . " judge says the issue is crime bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basque regional president ibarretxe has to answer to the court but judge roberto saiz of the basque criminal court disagrees .
he has argued that there are " indications of a crime " and insisted in october 2007 that the trial go ahead . the charges were brought by two organizations , dignity and justice and the forum ermua .
the latter wants the accused to face prison terms of up to four years and bans on political activity .
the two groups say that the talks were part of an effort to " legitimize " batasuna . critics argue that the charges are aimed at discrediting zapatero and his policies .
during the july 2006 talks , ares appeared before television cameras with otegi , whom he urged to " leave the field of violence , " enter political life , and " take part in a round table of political parties . " the four separatist politicians are charged with defying a court order to dissolve batasuna , which was banned in 2003 for refusing to break with eta , and to condemn violence .
eta has killed 825 people in a 40-year effort aimed at securing basque independence .
zapatero has taken a tougher approach toward eta since at least june 2007 , when it ended a 15-month ceasefire and refused to resume talks . the court may ask for written responses to its questions from zapatero and from his two predecessors , jose maria aznar and felipe gonzalez .

7 it obtained a bridging loan of 400 million euros -lrb- $ 545 million -rrb- from a consortium of about 30 lenders in a deal that the billionaire owner concluded before his death two days earlier . the agreement requires vem to sell its drug company ratiopharm and for merckle 's son ludwig to leave that firm , which employs 5,400 people and had 1.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.5 billion -rrb- in sales in 2008 . the sale of ratiopharm is aimed at ending a liquidity crisis in vem , which has about 100,000 employees altogether .
only ratiopharm is mentioned in the deal with the banks , and an administrator will be appointed to manage the transition . german media reports say the sale is unlikely to take place before the end of 2009 .
one reason for the delay is that it will take time to work out details of a plan to put the company 's affairs in order . a second issue is reportedly the assumption among those involved in the deal that international markets will be less volitile in one year , which would supposedly make it easier to secure a better price for ratiopharm . the company is one of the central elements of vem .
other major components of merckle 's empire are heidelbergcement and the drug wholesaler phoenix . merckle -lrb- 74 -rrb- was germany 's fifth wealthiest man and ranked 94th on forbes list of the world 's richest people .

their trial began thursday , jan .
8 . the men have dismissed the charges as unfounded , saying that their contacts with batasuna were part of efforts by prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero to find a negotiated solution to the long-standing basque problem .
ibarretxe told a preliminary hearing in 2008 that he is committed to " talk to everyone " to find a end to a problem that has bedeviled spanish politics for decades . lopez said that he is " absolutely convinced " there will be no convictions , arguing that " no court will say that politics should not be used to move on the road to peace . " prosecutors have called for the charges to be dropped .
they said that the negotiations were part of the men 's legitimate " political activities " and were aimed at " finding a solution to the basque conflict . " socialist legislator rodolfo ares is also on trial , as are four senior members of batasuna .
arnaldo otegi , who is a former batasuna spokesman , stressed that " this will be the only case in europe where the participants in talks will be in the dock for having tried to find solutions . " basque judge alfonso gonzalez guija said " it would be very healthy for democracy not to criminalize political life . " judge says the issue is crime bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basque regional president ibarretxe has to answer to the court but judge roberto saiz of the basque criminal court disagrees .
he has argued that there are " indications of a crime " and insisted in october 2007 that the trial go ahead . the charges were brought by two organizations , dignity and justice and the forum ermua .
the latter wants the accused to face prison terms of up to four years and bans on political activity .
the two groups say that the talks were part of an effort to " legitimize " batasuna . critics argue that the charges are aimed at discrediting zapatero and his policies .
during the july 2006 talks , ares appeared before television cameras with otegi , whom he urged to " leave the field of violence , " enter political life , and " take part in a round table of political parties . " the four separatist politicians are charged with defying a court order to dissolve batasuna , which was banned in 2003 for refusing to break with eta , and to condemn violence .
eta has killed 825 people in a 40-year effort aimed at securing basque independence .
zapatero has taken a tougher approach toward eta since at least june 2007 , when it ended a 15-month ceasefire and refused to resume talks . the court may ask for written responses to its questions from zapatero and from his two predecessors , jose maria aznar and felipe gonzalez .
the trial is expected to last three weeks . dw staff -lrb- pgm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she would not say what type of weaponry the army used . it was unclear whether thursday morning 's rocket fire was an isolated incident , or whether it marks the opening of another front in the violence between israel and islamist militants . meanwhile , residents in the southern gaza border town of rafah reported overnight heavy shelling by the israeli military .
the military said israel had bombed another 15 smuggling tunnels running under the border with egypt , as well as a house allegedly used by a militant commander who oversaw rocket attacks from the rafah area aimed at nearby israeli targets . some 5,000 residents of rafah fled to two un schools that had turned into shelters , after israeli helicopters had dropped leaflets warning them to leave their homes along the gaza-egypt border , saying hamas was using houses in the area to hide the entrances to tunnels used to smuggle weapons . british muslims : uk must pressure us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anger at the israeli offensive has been widespread in the muslim world meanwhile , a group of leading british muslims said british prime minister gordon brown must do more to pressure the us into condemning israel 's offensive on the gaza strip . representatives of muslim organizations that have been addressing extremism in the uk wrote in an open letter to brown that the 13-day siege of gaza by the israeli military would empower extremists and increase anger in muslim communities in western nations . the letter urged brown to " make concerted and successful efforts to convince the us administration of the dangers of its approach and to ensure the incoming obama administration forges a more enlightened direction .

deutsche welle : how serious is the situation ?
are things about to get very cold in germany ?
hans-joachim ziesing : i think there is a bit of a difference between some european countries and germany .
i believe in germany it is n't going to get cold anytime soon , though if the interruption lasts longer then there will certainly be problems here .
but we need to ensure that we have other supply sources - like the netherlands and norway - and that we keep our reserves full .
we 'll certainly be able to deal with the interruption for the time being , but not if it lasts for more than a couple of weeks .
then we 'll definitely have problems . can russia still be considered a dependable partner when it comes to gas supplies ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-joachim ziesing what i find completely unacceptable is that the dispute between russia and ukraine is being pushed on to the backs of other nations .
both russia and the ukraine should really be careful that other nations do n't begin to doubt their dependability .

what the consequences will be is n't easy to say , because we certainly ca n't live without russian gas in the foreseeable future .
it is currently that largest gas supply sustaining us .
of course we need to diversify our gas supplies , and tap into other sources .
there are already a couple of lng -lrb- liquid natural gas -rrb- reserves that we can fall back on , which would also help us be more energy efficient .
i think that using less gas and replacing some of the gas we use with other sources is something we urgently need to do in order to be able to avoid situations like these .
but that is something we can do in the future .
what could help in the short term ?
there is n't a lot that can help in the short term .
we can fall back on the other sources .
we 'll have to use our gas reserves to get through this bottleneck .

their trial began thursday , jan .
8 . the men have dismissed the charges as unfounded , saying that their contacts with batasuna were part of efforts by prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero to find a negotiated solution to the long-standing basque problem .
ibarretxe told a preliminary hearing in 2008 that he is committed to " talk to everyone " to find a end to a problem that has bedeviled spanish politics for decades . lopez said that he is " absolutely convinced " there will be no convictions , arguing that " no court will say that politics should not be used to move on the road to peace . " prosecutors have called for the charges to be dropped .
they said that the negotiations were part of the men 's legitimate " political activities " and were aimed at " finding a solution to the basque conflict . " socialist legislator rodolfo ares is also on trial , as are four senior members of batasuna .
arnaldo otegi , who is a former batasuna spokesman , stressed that " this will be the only case in europe where the participants in talks will be in the dock for having tried to find solutions .

the latter wants the accused to face prison terms of up to four years and bans on political activity .
the two groups say that the talks were part of an effort to " legitimize " batasuna . critics argue that the charges are aimed at discrediting zapatero and his policies .
during the july 2006 talks , ares appeared before television cameras with otegi , whom he urged to " leave the field of violence , " enter political life , and " take part in a round table of political parties . " the four separatist politicians are charged with defying a court order to dissolve batasuna , which was banned in 2003 for refusing to break with eta , and to condemn violence .
eta has killed 825 people in a 40-year effort aimed at securing basque independence .
zapatero has taken a tougher approach toward eta since at least june 2007 , when it ended a 15-month ceasefire and refused to resume talks . the court may ask for written responses to its questions from zapatero and from his two predecessors , jose maria aznar and felipe gonzalez .

she would not say what type of weaponry the army used . it was unclear whether thursday morning 's rocket fire was an isolated incident , or whether it marks the opening of another front in the violence between israel and islamist militants . meanwhile , residents in the southern gaza border town of rafah reported overnight heavy shelling by the israeli military .
the military said israel had bombed another 15 smuggling tunnels running under the border with egypt , as well as a house allegedly used by a militant commander who oversaw rocket attacks from the rafah area aimed at nearby israeli targets . some 5,000 residents of rafah fled to two un schools that had turned into shelters , after israeli helicopters had dropped leaflets warning them to leave their homes along the gaza-egypt border , saying hamas was using houses in the area to hide the entrances to tunnels used to smuggle weapons . british muslims : uk must pressure us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anger at the israeli offensive has been widespread in the muslim world meanwhile , a group of leading british muslims said british prime minister gordon brown must do more to pressure the us into condemning israel 's offensive on the gaza strip . representatives of muslim organizations that have been addressing extremism in the uk wrote in an open letter to brown that the 13-day siege of gaza by the israeli military would empower extremists and increase anger in muslim communities in western nations . the letter urged brown to " make concerted and successful efforts to convince the us administration of the dangers of its approach and to ensure the incoming obama administration forges a more enlightened direction . " as you are aware , the anger within uk muslim communities has reached acute levels of intensity , " said the letter from usama hasan , imam of al-tawhid mosque in london , and the islamic foundation 's dilwar hussain , among others . " the israeli government 's use of disproportionate force ... has revived extremist groups and empowered their message of violence and perennial conflict . " for muslims in the uk and abroad , we run the risk of potentially creating a loss of faith in the political process . " we also believe the uk - bilaterally and as part of the eu - has an important role to demonstrate to israel that the threshold of acceptable behavior has been perilously transgressed , " the letter said . israel wants us border presence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel wants the us to shore up its border with egypt the pleas came as israel pressed on with both its air and ground offensive in gaza on thursday , as government officials were due to travel to cairo to discuss truce proposals tabled by french president nicolas sarkozy and his egyptian counterpart hosni mubarak . the israeli delegation has said it wants to discuss the possibility of a permanent us presence along the gaza-egypt border , as part of the " guarantees " it is seeking from the egyptians and the international community that the smuggling of further rockets and parts into gaza will stop , israeli media reported . israel said wednesday it viewed egyptian-french attempts to reach a diplomatic solution to the gaza crisis " positively , " but it also threatened to expand its ground offensive if the diplomatic attempts failed . " israel welcomes the -lrb- franco-egyptian -rrb- initiative and is working on it and is interested in its success , " israeli government spokesman mark regev said .
israel insists on a halt to all rockets launched by hamas from the gaza strip and a weapons embargo to be imposed on the islamist movement , he said . hamas would ' consider peace proposal ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas says it would consider laying down its arms hamas politburo member mussa abu marzuk told al-arabiya tv it would " respect and consider any proposal that calls for ending the -lrb- israeli -rrb- aggression and for the withdrawal of the -lrb- israeli -rrb- army . " hamas also opposed any possibility of international troops coming to the gaza strip to reinforce a truce , he said .
germany has expressed its willingness to send troops , if either side wanted such a force . the israeli cabinet authorized wednesday a continuation of the gaza offensive . the israeli delegation to cairo includes amos gilad , the head of the israeli defense ministry 's diplomatic-security bureau and prime minister ehud olmert 's foreign policy adviser shalom turgeman . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche welle : how serious is the situation ?
are things about to get very cold in germany ?
hans-joachim ziesing : i think there is a bit of a difference between some european countries and germany .
i believe in germany it is n't going to get cold anytime soon , though if the interruption lasts longer then there will certainly be problems here .
but we need to ensure that we have other supply sources - like the netherlands and norway - and that we keep our reserves full .
we 'll certainly be able to deal with the interruption for the time being , but not if it lasts for more than a couple of weeks .
then we 'll definitely have problems . can russia still be considered a dependable partner when it comes to gas supplies ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-joachim ziesing what i find completely unacceptable is that the dispute between russia and ukraine is being pushed on to the backs of other nations .
both russia and the ukraine should really be careful that other nations do n't begin to doubt their dependability .
what does this mean for the european union ?
what consequences can we expect ?
what the consequences will be is n't easy to say , because we certainly ca n't live without russian gas in the foreseeable future .
it is currently that largest gas supply sustaining us .
of course we need to diversify our gas supplies , and tap into other sources .
there are already a couple of lng -lrb- liquid natural gas -rrb- reserves that we can fall back on , which would also help us be more energy efficient .
i think that using less gas and replacing some of the gas we use with other sources is something we urgently need to do in order to be able to avoid situations like these .
but that is something we can do in the future .
what could help in the short term ?
there is n't a lot that can help in the short term .
we can fall back on the other sources .
we 'll have to use our gas reserves to get through this bottleneck .
especially since we are experiencing such cold temperatures right now , and this is going to raise the amount of gas needed to warm people 's houses .
i think we need to try and reduce our usage where we can .
that would certainly help . interview : sandra berndt -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

8 that its car sales exceeded one million in 2008 , the 13th consecutive year-on-year increase .
the record results go against the current downward trend in the car industry . the carmaker sold just over one million vehicles worldwide in 2008 , up 4.1 percent over 2007 .
december sales rose over 17.4 percent compared to the same month the previous year , at a time when its rivals have been badly hit by the global economic downturn . audi head rupert stadler said that his firm aims to become " the most attractive premium brand worldwide " in the car market .
he added that audi intends to build on its success by introducing new products in 2009 . company officials noted that 2008 was the first time that audi has broken the one million mark in sales .
the managers attributed much of the gain to the introduction of 12 new models , including the a4 saloon car and the q5 sports utility vehicle . the ingolstadt-based carmaker is bucking a trend in germany as well as elsewhere in the world .
car sales in germany , which is western europe 's biggest market , fell 6.6 percent in december .
in 2008 as a whole , german new car registrations were down by 1.9 percent over 2007 to 3.09 million .
audi is a subsidiary of volkswagen , germany 's biggest car manufacturer . kpmg consultants released a survey on january 8 , suggesting that senior german auto industry executives feel the situation will stay bleak through 2013 .
the study of 200 companies showed that respondents expect wildly fluctuating earnings during that period .

" i just feel so lucky that i , just by pure chance , survived it . "
demons another survivor , chris thompson , had the opportunity to visit the remains of the plane in farnborough .

" it really put everything into perspective . "
a report by the uk air accidents investigation branch after the crash found that the engine had failed due to a fractured fan blade .

yoni is not allowed to say where he is now her son yoni , 21 , is a paramedic in an elite unit in the israeli military .
his usual daily phone calls stopped the day after the israeli ground offensive in gaza began .
all she has heard from him since is an sms message , on tuesday , that read : " do n't worry , i 'm fine .
i love you . "
yoni is not allowed to say where he is .
she assumes he is in gaza .
her other son , michael , 24 , was called up as a reservist at 2330 on saturday night , and gone by 0500 the next morning .
" i 'm not doing so well , " she says , when asked how she is coping .
" as a mother i wish it stopped yesterday , but i know that there 's a job that needs to be done . "
' heavily-supported war ' like the majority of israelis , according to opinion polls , ms schwartz fully supports israel 's operation in gaza .
rachel says support for the war is " unanimous " in israel six israeli soldiers and , according to palestinian medics , more than 650 palestinians , have died in the fighting , in which israel is attempting to vastly reduce the palestinian militant group 's capacity to fire rockets into southern israel .
" this is one of the few wars that i think is unanimous - i 've never seen the people come together , the right-wing and the left , in this way and agree that this had to be done , " she says .
professor asher arian , a veteran israeli pollster , says it is a " text book case " of a " heavily-supported war " .
but , he points out , support was also soaring at the start of the 2006 war in lebanon , which ended with intense recriminations and plummeting poll ratings for prime minister ehud olmert .
a few days before israeli tanks moved into gaza , 52 % of people asked backed the air offensive , and another 19 % wanted to see it expanded with ground forces .
i think the war 's stupid , it 's useless - there would have been a better way meytal pessing israeli voices : when to stop but the transition to a ground war is a critical moment , in a country where most young people serve in the military and empathy for mothers like ms schwartz runs deep .
" with a ground war , everybody knows a neighbour or a cousin or a son of a friend who 's involved , and that gives it a much more far reaching effect , " says prof arian .
time to ' get out ' in one of jerusalem 's largest malls , the view among people sipping coffee in cafes and popping in and out of shops is generally consistent .
hava elemelech says the war must continue until hamas ' rockets stop salesman moti bohm , 30 , backs the operation completely .
" no country can allow itself to be under attack without responding .
hamas is not a country , it 's just a mob of bandits , " he says .
" we must continue , until the rockets stop , " says hava elemelech , 45 , a kindergarten teacher from beersheva , one of the towns recently reached for the first time by palestinian rockets .
" even if israelis have to die , " she says .
" you ca n't make an omelette without breaking an egg . "
but there are those , like housewife galit yeshyhu , 35 , who echo concerns in israel 's left-leaning media that the troops will become bogged down , casualties will rise , and the rockets will keep coming .
" i think now is the time to get out .
we have done enough .
the longer we stay , the more lives will be lost . "
a minority oppose the war outright .
some of those are left-wingers who have held demonstrations under slogans such as " stop the massacre in gaza !
stop the bloodshed and destruction ! "
but there are others too , like meytal pessing , 25 , who describes herself as " in the centre " politically .
" i think the war 's stupid , it 's useless - there would have been a better way . "
ratings ' war ' with the operation coming just over a month before elections scheduled for 10 february , domestic politics also plays a part .
when casualties start rising , there could be an erosion of public support the israeli operation was launched by the government of scandal-hit mr olmert 's centre-right kadima party , now led by foreign minister tzipi livni , and defence minister ehud barak , head of kadima 's largest coalition party , labour .
kadima has been struggling to hold onto voters disillusioned with its founding agenda of unilateral withdrawals from occupied palestinian areas , and particularly with the ascendance of hamas in gaza after the withdrawal of israeli settlers and soldiers in 2005 .
avraham diskin , professor of political science at jerusalem 's hebrew university says that the operation in gaza has boosted mr barak 's previously languishing poll ratings at the expense of centre-right opposition leader binyamin netanyahu .
but it has not , most pollsters say , completely wiped out the lead mr netanyahu has held over ms livni in recent months .
however , to some voters , labour and kadima now do not seem " as impotent as they looked before , " says prof diskin says .
for example , prison warder sivan abuhatzira , 24 , says " maybe " she will switch her allegiance from mr netanyahu to ms livni or mr barak in february .
" i did n't like them before , but they made a good decision , " she says .
high stakes but there is a more cynical interpretation .
" they did this just before the election because they want to be popular - i think it 's necessary , but i think it 's their strategy , " says psychologist leah cohen , 45 , who considers herself on the political right .
however , the election is still a month away - unless it is postponed because of the fighting .
and prof arian says everything depends on the war " endgame " - both on the ground and in the diplomatic sphere as some kind of truce is negotiated .
" if the final agreement is perceived as being premature , if -lsb- kidnapped israeli soldier gilad -rsb- shalit is not part of the agreement , if arms start flowing back into the gaza strip , if rockets start falling again - then obviously there 'll be an erosion of support and a politicising of the end of the war , " he says .
" and when casualties start rising , inevitably questions about the wisdom of the decision , the timing of the decision and the preparation of the forces start arising .
" it all depends on what happens , " prof arian says .

when casualties start rising , there could be an erosion of public support the israeli operation was launched by the government of scandal-hit mr olmert 's centre-right kadima party , now led by foreign minister tzipi livni , and defence minister ehud barak , head of kadima 's largest coalition party , labour .
kadima has been struggling to hold onto voters disillusioned with its founding agenda of unilateral withdrawals from occupied palestinian areas , and particularly with the ascendance of hamas in gaza after the withdrawal of israeli settlers and soldiers in 2005 .
avraham diskin , professor of political science at jerusalem 's hebrew university says that the operation in gaza has boosted mr barak 's previously languishing poll ratings at the expense of centre-right opposition leader binyamin netanyahu .
but it has not , most pollsters say , completely wiped out the lead mr netanyahu has held over ms livni in recent months .
however , to some voters , labour and kadima now do not seem " as impotent as they looked before , " says prof diskin says .
for example , prison warder sivan abuhatzira , 24 , says " maybe " she will switch her allegiance from mr netanyahu to ms livni or mr barak in february .
" i did n't like them before , but they made a good decision , " she says .
high stakes but there is a more cynical interpretation .
" they did this just before the election because they want to be popular - i think it 's necessary , but i think it 's their strategy , " says psychologist leah cohen , 45 , who considers herself on the political right .
however , the election is still a month away - unless it is postponed because of the fighting .
and prof arian says everything depends on the war " endgame " - both on the ground and in the diplomatic sphere as some kind of truce is negotiated .
" if the final agreement is perceived as being premature , if -lsb- kidnapped israeli soldier gilad -rsb- shalit is not part of the agreement , if arms start flowing back into the gaza strip , if rockets start falling again - then obviously there 'll be an erosion of support and a politicising of the end of the war , " he says .
" and when casualties start rising , inevitably questions about the wisdom of the decision , the timing of the decision and the preparation of the forces start arising .
" it all depends on what happens , " prof arian says .

yoni is not allowed to say where he is now her son yoni , 21 , is a paramedic in an elite unit in the israeli military .
his usual daily phone calls stopped the day after the israeli ground offensive in gaza began .
all she has heard from him since is an sms message , on tuesday , that read : " do n't worry , i 'm fine .
i love you . "
yoni is not allowed to say where he is .
she assumes he is in gaza .
her other son , michael , 24 , was called up as a reservist at 2330 on saturday night , and gone by 0500 the next morning .
" i 'm not doing so well , " she says , when asked how she is coping .
" as a mother i wish it stopped yesterday , but i know that there 's a job that needs to be done . "
' heavily-supported war ' like the majority of israelis , according to opinion polls , ms schwartz fully supports israel 's operation in gaza .
rachel says support for the war is " unanimous " in israel six israeli soldiers and , according to palestinian medics , more than 650 palestinians , have died in the fighting , in which israel is attempting to vastly reduce the palestinian militant group 's capacity to fire rockets into southern israel .
" this is one of the few wars that i think is unanimous - i 've never seen the people come together , the right-wing and the left , in this way and agree that this had to be done , " she says .
professor asher arian , a veteran israeli pollster , says it is a " text book case " of a " heavily-supported war " .
but , he points out , support was also soaring at the start of the 2006 war in lebanon , which ended with intense recriminations and plummeting poll ratings for prime minister ehud olmert .
a few days before israeli tanks moved into gaza , 52 % of people asked backed the air offensive , and another 19 % wanted to see it expanded with ground forces .
i think the war 's stupid , it 's useless - there would have been a better way meytal pessing israeli voices : when to stop but the transition to a ground war is a critical moment , in a country where most young people serve in the military and empathy for mothers like ms schwartz runs deep .
" with a ground war , everybody knows a neighbour or a cousin or a son of a friend who 's involved , and that gives it a much more far reaching effect , " says prof arian .
time to ' get out ' in one of jerusalem 's largest malls , the view among people sipping coffee in cafes and popping in and out of shops is generally consistent .

yoni is not allowed to say where he is now her son yoni , 21 , is a paramedic in an elite unit in the israeli military .
his usual daily phone calls stopped the day after the israeli ground offensive in gaza began .
all she has heard from him since is an sms message , on tuesday , that read : " do n't worry , i 'm fine .
i love you . "
yoni is not allowed to say where he is .
she assumes he is in gaza .
her other son , michael , 24 , was called up as a reservist at 2330 on saturday night , and gone by 0500 the next morning .
" i 'm not doing so well , " she says , when asked how she is coping .
" as a mother i wish it stopped yesterday , but i know that there 's a job that needs to be done . "
' heavily-supported war ' like the majority of israelis , according to opinion polls , ms schwartz fully supports israel 's operation in gaza .
rachel says support for the war is " unanimous " in israel six israeli soldiers and , according to palestinian medics , more than 650 palestinians , have died in the fighting , in which israel is attempting to vastly reduce the palestinian militant group 's capacity to fire rockets into southern israel .
" this is one of the few wars that i think is unanimous - i 've never seen the people come together , the right-wing and the left , in this way and agree that this had to be done , " she says .
professor asher arian , a veteran israeli pollster , says it is a " text book case " of a " heavily-supported war " .
but , he points out , support was also soaring at the start of the 2006 war in lebanon , which ended with intense recriminations and plummeting poll ratings for prime minister ehud olmert .
a few days before israeli tanks moved into gaza , 52 % of people asked backed the air offensive , and another 19 % wanted to see it expanded with ground forces .
i think the war 's stupid , it 's useless - there would have been a better way meytal pessing israeli voices : when to stop but the transition to a ground war is a critical moment , in a country where most young people serve in the military and empathy for mothers like ms schwartz runs deep .
" with a ground war , everybody knows a neighbour or a cousin or a son of a friend who 's involved , and that gives it a much more far reaching effect , " says prof arian .
time to ' get out ' in one of jerusalem 's largest malls , the view among people sipping coffee in cafes and popping in and out of shops is generally consistent .
hava elemelech says the war must continue until hamas ' rockets stop salesman moti bohm , 30 , backs the operation completely .
" no country can allow itself to be under attack without responding .
hamas is not a country , it 's just a mob of bandits , " he says .
" we must continue , until the rockets stop , " says hava elemelech , 45 , a kindergarten teacher from beersheva , one of the towns recently reached for the first time by palestinian rockets .
" even if israelis have to die , " she says .
" you ca n't make an omelette without breaking an egg . "
but there are those , like housewife galit yeshyhu , 35 , who echo concerns in israel 's left-leaning media that the troops will become bogged down , casualties will rise , and the rockets will keep coming .
" i think now is the time to get out .
we have done enough .
the longer we stay , the more lives will be lost . "
a minority oppose the war outright .
some of those are left-wingers who have held demonstrations under slogans such as " stop the massacre in gaza !
stop the bloodshed and destruction ! "
but there are others too , like meytal pessing , 25 , who describes herself as " in the centre " politically .
" i think the war 's stupid , it 's useless - there would have been a better way . "
ratings ' war ' with the operation coming just over a month before elections scheduled for 10 february , domestic politics also plays a part .
when casualties start rising , there could be an erosion of public support the israeli operation was launched by the government of scandal-hit mr olmert 's centre-right kadima party , now led by foreign minister tzipi livni , and defence minister ehud barak , head of kadima 's largest coalition party , labour .
kadima has been struggling to hold onto voters disillusioned with its founding agenda of unilateral withdrawals from occupied palestinian areas , and particularly with the ascendance of hamas in gaza after the withdrawal of israeli settlers and soldiers in 2005 .
avraham diskin , professor of political science at jerusalem 's hebrew university says that the operation in gaza has boosted mr barak 's previously languishing poll ratings at the expense of centre-right opposition leader binyamin netanyahu .
but it has not , most pollsters say , completely wiped out the lead mr netanyahu has held over ms livni in recent months .
however , to some voters , labour and kadima now do not seem " as impotent as they looked before , " says prof diskin says .
for example , prison warder sivan abuhatzira , 24 , says " maybe " she will switch her allegiance from mr netanyahu to ms livni or mr barak in february .
" i did n't like them before , but they made a good decision , " she says .
high stakes but there is a more cynical interpretation .
" they did this just before the election because they want to be popular - i think it 's necessary , but i think it 's their strategy , " says psychologist leah cohen , 45 , who considers herself on the political right .
however , the election is still a month away - unless it is postponed because of the fighting .

one act from the top five is being unveiled every day this week , counting down to friday , when the number one will be revealed .
watch white lies in session on bbc 6 music while coldplay and arcade fire have been writing and recording albums in churches , white lies sound like they 've recently emerged from a crypt .
their doom-laden rock is full of references to plane crashes , murders , funerals , kidnappings and nervous breakdowns .
even their most romantic song - new single to lose my life - has the refrain : " let 's grow old together and die at the same time . "
and it 's taking a toll on the band ...
vocalist harry mcveigh says performing the group 's bleak songs in concert can be " pretty draining " .
" it 's not always the most uplifting , " agrees bassist and lyricist charles cave .
reviewers seem to agree , too .

advertisement watch white lies as they show you round their west london haunts by mark savage bbc news entertainment reporter london rock trio white lies have come second on the bbc 's sound of 2009 list , which features the best bands and singers to watch in the next 12 months .
one act from the top five is being unveiled every day this week , counting down to friday , when the number one will be revealed .
watch white lies in session on bbc 6 music while coldplay and arcade fire have been writing and recording albums in churches , white lies sound like they 've recently emerged from a crypt .
their doom-laden rock is full of references to plane crashes , murders , funerals , kidnappings and nervous breakdowns .
even their most romantic song - new single to lose my life - has the refrain : " let 's grow old together and die at the same time . "
and it 's taking a toll on the band ...
vocalist harry mcveigh says performing the group 's bleak songs in concert can be " pretty draining " .
" it 's not always the most uplifting , " agrees bassist and lyricist charles cave .
reviewers seem to agree , too .
last october , the guardian 's maddy costa said watching the band was like living through " a horror movie in which a pre-pubescent choirboy , radiating innocence , becomes possessed and starts singing in a rumbling bass dredged up from five fathoms deep " .

advertisement watch white lies as they show you round their west london haunts by mark savage bbc news entertainment reporter london rock trio white lies have come second on the bbc 's sound of 2009 list , which features the best bands and singers to watch in the next 12 months .
one act from the top five is being unveiled every day this week , counting down to friday , when the number one will be revealed .
watch white lies in session on bbc 6 music while coldplay and arcade fire have been writing and recording albums in churches , white lies sound like they 've recently emerged from a crypt .
their doom-laden rock is full of references to plane crashes , murders , funerals , kidnappings and nervous breakdowns .
even their most romantic song - new single to lose my life - has the refrain : " let 's grow old together and die at the same time . "
and it 's taking a toll on the band ...
vocalist harry mcveigh says performing the group 's bleak songs in concert can be " pretty draining " .
" it 's not always the most uplifting , " agrees bassist and lyricist charles cave .
reviewers seem to agree , too .
last october , the guardian 's maddy costa said watching the band was like living through " a horror movie in which a pre-pubescent choirboy , radiating innocence , becomes possessed and starts singing in a rumbling bass dredged up from five fathoms deep " .
but , counters cave , white lies are not " dark people " .
" it 's really important for us to maintain a level of humour on tour , " he says .
" because if we lived through the songs , we 'd be basket cases . "
indeed , the trio - completed by drummer jack lawrence-brown - are surprisingly upbeat in person , sharing a relaxed bonhomie that stems from having been childhood friends in west london .
the band hail from west london suburbs ealing and shepherd 's bush they finish one another 's sentences , correct each other 's mistakes and joke that cave should write a song called butt out to persuade mcveigh to give up smoking .
but there is no disguising the fact that white lies take being in a rock band very seriously indeed .
they killed off their previous art-rock incarnation fear of flying in 2006 and chose the name white lies because , like their new miserablist sound , it represented something " seemingly innocent " with " very dark undertones " .
their conversation is peppered with references to the " integrity " of their lyrics and the importance of " working in isolation " .
in fact , the group spent half a year labouring over their first five songs , and practiced for three months before their debut gig .
that sparked a record label bidding war , which eventually led to the band signing to fiction records - home to elbow and snow patrol .
we wo n't finish a song if we do n't think it 's going to be really good jack lawrence-brown almost inevitably , this sparked a backlash before the band had released so much as a guitar riff , with one blogger complaining the group were " contrived " as a " pr man 's dream " .
as a result , the group are now wary of being tipped as the next big thing .
" i do n't think there really should be lists that predict people 's success , " says cave .
" i think we 'd all rather turn up next year and win a bunch of awards for the album that we 've made . "
foreboding all the same , cave is " very confident " in the band 's debut -lrb- also called to lose my life -rrb- , which is a lean , muscular rock album full of stadium-sized guitar lines and deep , foreboding vocals .
it has already been compared to 1980s gloom rockers echo & the bunnymen , joy division and the teardrop explodes .
" i genuinely think that the only real similarity is a foreboding overall sound and the fact that harry sings in a baritone , " protests cave .
in any case , mcveigh believes the comparison is flawed " because in most of the songs the chorus is up an octave " .

watch the full video for white lies ' single to lose my life " there are some songs which i actually struggle to sing , because they 're so high .
but people pick up on the fact that a lot of the verses are very low and deep . "
if the band have a formula , it consists of dark , portentous verses which build slowly to a euphoric chorus .
but the music does not come easily .
" we wo n't finish a song if we do n't think it 's going to be really good , " says lawrence-brown .
" we never write for b-sides .
there 's only 10 tracks on the album . "
the band 's writing skills were severely tested when they were forced to come up with " five songs in three weeks " in order to finish their record .
have your say it 's great to see yet more home grown talent !
for a small island we punch well above our weight in the music industry peter h , uk send us your comments " it was really stressful , " says lawrence-brown .
" but the best songs on the album were written in that period .
" you can hear that nervous energy .
to lose my life , which is the next single , is really instant and that came together in a few hours , basically . "
the group reckon they became " more confident " as a result - but the experience has n't punctured their perfectionism .
" eventually , we 'll get to the point where we 're able to have a couple of months in the studio , " says mcveigh .
" i think that 'll probably be a massively creative time for us . "
white lies will be in session on bbc 6 music 's george lamb show between 1000-1300 on thursday .
more than 130 leading uk-based music writers , editors and broadcasters took part in sound of 2009 .
they named their three favourite new acts and their responses were used to compile the list .

a massive search effort has been carried out around the oundle home of gillian merrick but no trace of the 45-year-old has been found .
northamptonshire police have now appealed to people in east sussex to report any possible sightings .
mrs merrick lived in forest row , near east grinstead until three years ago .
a police spokesman said officers were making enquiries in sussex about the possibility she could have returned there .
officers have been contacting mrs merrick 's friends in east sussex to check if they have seen her or have any information about her whereabouts .
extensive search det ch insp andy cox , who is leading the investigation into the disappearance , said : " we are following up every possible line of enquiry that may lead us to gillian and we would like to hear from anyone who knows her from her time in east sussex and may be able to shed light on her whereabouts .
