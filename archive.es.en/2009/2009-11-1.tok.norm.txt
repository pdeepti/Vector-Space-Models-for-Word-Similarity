it 's a great honor for the chancellor , but equally great are the expectations of the obama administration . when chancellor merkel steps up to the lectern on tuesday inside the capitol building in washington , she will have achieved something that only one german post-war chancellor before her had done : to give an address before members of congress .
and actually , the speech which konrad adenauer , the first chancellor of the new federal republic , gave to congress on may 28 , 1957 was at a reception given by the house of representatives , not an address to a joint session of congress .
so according to official protocol , chancellor merkel 's speech on capitol hill is a first for a german head of government .
the fact that the recently re-elected chancellor is only the second foreign dignitary to speak before congress since president barack obama took office underlines the symbolic importance of the event .
the other leader granted this privilege was britain 's prime minister gordon brown .
" i think it is a big deal , " john hulsman , an american foreign policy expert based in germany , told deutsche welle .
" the us is a republic and a relatively new country , that does n't have a lot of symbolism .
to speak to a joint session of congress is about as big an honor as can be bestowed on a foreign leader . "
as nancy pelosi , speaker of the house of representatives and the official host of angela merkel said , the german chancellor was invited to commemorate the upcoming 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall .
respected leader and although not officially stated , merkel was also asked to speak to congress because she is highly respected in washington .
under president obama , merkel 's stature in the us capital has only increased - especially when compared to other european heads of governments .
" mrs. merkel as german chancellor is held in high esteem ; her competence and her standing is internationally recognized , " joerg himmelreich , senior trans-atlantic fellow at the german marshall fund in berlin , told deutsche welle .
" germany is definitely the european power washington needs to work with in order to conduct trans-atlantic relations and carry out the multilateral approach that - in contrast to his predecessor - is a goal for the obama administration , " he added .
while the future of german-american relations will play a major role in merkel 's address before congress , history will also be present .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gordon brown is the only other foreign leader invited to speak before congress under president obama " she will probably , and this is very important as a message to the american people as a whole , express her gratitude for the invaluable contribution the first president bush made to the fall of the berlin wall and therefore to german unity , " said himmelreich .
the chancellor is also expected to highlight the importance of german-american relations as a pillar of foreign policy for the new german government .
in addition , merkel will probably talk about international efforts in combating climate change , a sensitive topic to which president obama is more open than congress .
with a giant american flag draped behind her , framed by us vice president joe biden and house speaker nancy pelosi , merkel 's speech before congress will be saturated in symbolism .
but even more important than the official address itself could be the chancellor 's planned meeting with the president .
demand for discussions even though obama and merkel will probably only get together for either a lunch or a dinner , this could be the moment when important matters are addressed .
" i think that 's just the right amount of time to make specific , concrete demands off the record , " said hulsman .
" any longer you are going to get into bigger things , any shorter and it 's sound bites . "
there is an eagerness in the us to finally engage in serious talks with berlin .
the german election campaign put many important topics on ice until a new government was elected .
" washington and the new us administration gladly granted merkel this grace period , " said himmelreich .
" but now president obama would like to know what the new german government thinks about transatlantic relations and obama himself will surely also express his ideas and wishes . " his colleague hulsman put it more bluntly , calling it " put up or shut up time . "
after waiting patiently for the outcome of the german election , the obama administration now wants to know what to expect from berlin .
" beneath all the symbolism and niceness there is an insistent push that now it 's time for germany to step up to the plate , " he said .
afghan strategy high on the agenda for washington is the question of what the new german government wants to contribute in the future to the afghanistan mission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's contribution to afghanistan will be on the agenda the internal debate in the white house about the request by the us commander in afghanistan for additional troops is in the final stages and the experts expect that obama will let the chancellor in on his thinking about his upcoming decision .
merkel could be asked about how germany will provide concrete help in afghanistan if it does n't want to send more troops .
other topics such as iran , climate change and the economic crisis could then be discussed in a similar fashion - openly and not shying away from possible disagreements .
this kind of detailed and frank discussion with germany about foreign policy has been missing , noted hulsman .
instead of concrete policy solutions discussions often focused on grand strategic disagreements between the two countries .
policy solutions now when practical policies are key , obama ca n't find a more suitable partner than merkel , according to hulsman .
" mrs. merkel is not a great orator , she 's not flashy , but she 's incredibly effective in meetings , " he said , adding that with her grasp of policy detail she can not only hold her own against obama , but also put pressure on the president himself .
" she 's intellectually capable of having this nuts-and-bolts policy discussion that 's so desperately needed , " he said .
if the planned meeting between merkel and obama does in fact signal the start of a new phase of open and honest exchange between washington and berlin , than merkel 's trip will have been not only symbolic , but also a sustainable success .

with a giant american flag draped behind her , framed by us vice president joe biden and house speaker nancy pelosi , merkel 's speech before congress will be saturated in symbolism .
but even more important than the official address itself could be the chancellor 's planned meeting with the president .
demand for discussions even though obama and merkel will probably only get together for either a lunch or a dinner , this could be the moment when important matters are addressed .
" i think that 's just the right amount of time to make specific , concrete demands off the record , " said hulsman .
" any longer you are going to get into bigger things , any shorter and it 's sound bites . "
there is an eagerness in the us to finally engage in serious talks with berlin .
the german election campaign put many important topics on ice until a new government was elected .
" washington and the new us administration gladly granted merkel this grace period , " said himmelreich .
" but now president obama would like to know what the new german government thinks about transatlantic relations and obama himself will surely also express his ideas and wishes . " his colleague hulsman put it more bluntly , calling it " put up or shut up time . "
after waiting patiently for the outcome of the german election , the obama administration now wants to know what to expect from berlin .
" beneath all the symbolism and niceness there is an insistent push that now it 's time for germany to step up to the plate , " he said .
afghan strategy high on the agenda for washington is the question of what the new german government wants to contribute in the future to the afghanistan mission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's contribution to afghanistan will be on the agenda the internal debate in the white house about the request by the us commander in afghanistan for additional troops is in the final stages and the experts expect that obama will let the chancellor in on his thinking about his upcoming decision .
merkel could be asked about how germany will provide concrete help in afghanistan if it does n't want to send more troops .
other topics such as iran , climate change and the economic crisis could then be discussed in a similar fashion - openly and not shying away from possible disagreements .
this kind of detailed and frank discussion with germany about foreign policy has been missing , noted hulsman .
instead of concrete policy solutions discussions often focused on grand strategic disagreements between the two countries .
policy solutions now when practical policies are key , obama ca n't find a more suitable partner than merkel , according to hulsman .
" mrs. merkel is not a great orator , she 's not flashy , but she 's incredibly effective in meetings , " he said , adding that with her grasp of policy detail she can not only hold her own against obama , but also put pressure on the president himself .
" she 's intellectually capable of having this nuts-and-bolts policy discussion that 's so desperately needed , " he said .
if the planned meeting between merkel and obama does in fact signal the start of a new phase of open and honest exchange between washington and berlin , than merkel 's trip will have been not only symbolic , but also a sustainable success .

it 's a great honor for the chancellor , but equally great are the expectations of the obama administration . when chancellor merkel steps up to the lectern on tuesday inside the capitol building in washington , she will have achieved something that only one german post-war chancellor before her had done : to give an address before members of congress .
and actually , the speech which konrad adenauer , the first chancellor of the new federal republic , gave to congress on may 28 , 1957 was at a reception given by the house of representatives , not an address to a joint session of congress .
so according to official protocol , chancellor merkel 's speech on capitol hill is a first for a german head of government .
the fact that the recently re-elected chancellor is only the second foreign dignitary to speak before congress since president barack obama took office underlines the symbolic importance of the event .
the other leader granted this privilege was britain 's prime minister gordon brown .
" i think it is a big deal , " john hulsman , an american foreign policy expert based in germany , told deutsche welle .
" the us is a republic and a relatively new country , that does n't have a lot of symbolism .
to speak to a joint session of congress is about as big an honor as can be bestowed on a foreign leader . "
as nancy pelosi , speaker of the house of representatives and the official host of angela merkel said , the german chancellor was invited to commemorate the upcoming 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall .
respected leader and although not officially stated , merkel was also asked to speak to congress because she is highly respected in washington .
under president obama , merkel 's stature in the us capital has only increased - especially when compared to other european heads of governments .
" mrs. merkel as german chancellor is held in high esteem ; her competence and her standing is internationally recognized , " joerg himmelreich , senior trans-atlantic fellow at the german marshall fund in berlin , told deutsche welle .
" germany is definitely the european power washington needs to work with in order to conduct trans-atlantic relations and carry out the multilateral approach that - in contrast to his predecessor - is a goal for the obama administration , " he added .
while the future of german-american relations will play a major role in merkel 's address before congress , history will also be present .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gordon brown is the only other foreign leader invited to speak before congress under president obama " she will probably , and this is very important as a message to the american people as a whole , express her gratitude for the invaluable contribution the first president bush made to the fall of the berlin wall and therefore to german unity , " said himmelreich .
the chancellor is also expected to highlight the importance of german-american relations as a pillar of foreign policy for the new german government .

it 's a great honor for the chancellor , but equally great are the expectations of the obama administration . when chancellor merkel steps up to the lectern on tuesday inside the capitol building in washington , she will have achieved something that only one german post-war chancellor before her had done : to give an address before members of congress .
and actually , the speech which konrad adenauer , the first chancellor of the new federal republic , gave to congress on may 28 , 1957 was at a reception given by the house of representatives , not an address to a joint session of congress .
so according to official protocol , chancellor merkel 's speech on capitol hill is a first for a german head of government .
the fact that the recently re-elected chancellor is only the second foreign dignitary to speak before congress since president barack obama took office underlines the symbolic importance of the event .
the other leader granted this privilege was britain 's prime minister gordon brown .
" i think it is a big deal , " john hulsman , an american foreign policy expert based in germany , told deutsche welle .
" the us is a republic and a relatively new country , that does n't have a lot of symbolism .
to speak to a joint session of congress is about as big an honor as can be bestowed on a foreign leader . "
as nancy pelosi , speaker of the house of representatives and the official host of angela merkel said , the german chancellor was invited to commemorate the upcoming 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall .
respected leader and although not officially stated , merkel was also asked to speak to congress because she is highly respected in washington .
under president obama , merkel 's stature in the us capital has only increased - especially when compared to other european heads of governments .
" mrs. merkel as german chancellor is held in high esteem ; her competence and her standing is internationally recognized , " joerg himmelreich , senior trans-atlantic fellow at the german marshall fund in berlin , told deutsche welle .
" germany is definitely the european power washington needs to work with in order to conduct trans-atlantic relations and carry out the multilateral approach that - in contrast to his predecessor - is a goal for the obama administration , " he added .
while the future of german-american relations will play a major role in merkel 's address before congress , history will also be present .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gordon brown is the only other foreign leader invited to speak before congress under president obama " she will probably , and this is very important as a message to the american people as a whole , express her gratitude for the invaluable contribution the first president bush made to the fall of the berlin wall and therefore to german unity , " said himmelreich .
the chancellor is also expected to highlight the importance of german-american relations as a pillar of foreign policy for the new german government .
in addition , merkel will probably talk about international efforts in combating climate change , a sensitive topic to which president obama is more open than congress .
with a giant american flag draped behind her , framed by us vice president joe biden and house speaker nancy pelosi , merkel 's speech before congress will be saturated in symbolism .
but even more important than the official address itself could be the chancellor 's planned meeting with the president .
demand for discussions even though obama and merkel will probably only get together for either a lunch or a dinner , this could be the moment when important matters are addressed .
" i think that 's just the right amount of time to make specific , concrete demands off the record , " said hulsman .
" any longer you are going to get into bigger things , any shorter and it 's sound bites . "
there is an eagerness in the us to finally engage in serious talks with berlin .
the german election campaign put many important topics on ice until a new government was elected .
" washington and the new us administration gladly granted merkel this grace period , " said himmelreich .
" but now president obama would like to know what the new german government thinks about transatlantic relations and obama himself will surely also express his ideas and wishes . " his colleague hulsman put it more bluntly , calling it " put up or shut up time . "
after waiting patiently for the outcome of the german election , the obama administration now wants to know what to expect from berlin .
" beneath all the symbolism and niceness there is an insistent push that now it 's time for germany to step up to the plate , " he said .
afghan strategy high on the agenda for washington is the question of what the new german government wants to contribute in the future to the afghanistan mission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's contribution to afghanistan will be on the agenda the internal debate in the white house about the request by the us commander in afghanistan for additional troops is in the final stages and the experts expect that obama will let the chancellor in on his thinking about his upcoming decision .
merkel could be asked about how germany will provide concrete help in afghanistan if it does n't want to send more troops .
other topics such as iran , climate change and the economic crisis could then be discussed in a similar fashion - openly and not shying away from possible disagreements .
this kind of detailed and frank discussion with germany about foreign policy has been missing , noted hulsman .
instead of concrete policy solutions discussions often focused on grand strategic disagreements between the two countries .
policy solutions now when practical policies are key , obama ca n't find a more suitable partner than merkel , according to hulsman .
" mrs. merkel is not a great orator , she 's not flashy , but she 's incredibly effective in meetings , " he said , adding that with her grasp of policy detail she can not only hold her own against obama , but also put pressure on the president himself .
" she 's intellectually capable of having this nuts-and-bolts policy discussion that 's so desperately needed , " he said .
if the planned meeting between merkel and obama does in fact signal the start of a new phase of open and honest exchange between washington and berlin , than merkel 's trip will have been not only symbolic , but also a sustainable success .

it 's a great honor for the chancellor , but equally great are the expectations of the obama administration . when chancellor merkel steps up to the lectern on tuesday inside the capitol building in washington , she will have achieved something that only one german post-war chancellor before her had done : to give an address before members of congress .
and actually , the speech which konrad adenauer , the first chancellor of the new federal republic , gave to congress on may 28 , 1957 was at a reception given by the house of representatives , not an address to a joint session of congress .
so according to official protocol , chancellor merkel 's speech on capitol hill is a first for a german head of government .
the fact that the recently re-elected chancellor is only the second foreign dignitary to speak before congress since president barack obama took office underlines the symbolic importance of the event .
the other leader granted this privilege was britain 's prime minister gordon brown .
" i think it is a big deal , " john hulsman , an american foreign policy expert based in germany , told deutsche welle .
" the us is a republic and a relatively new country , that does n't have a lot of symbolism .
to speak to a joint session of congress is about as big an honor as can be bestowed on a foreign leader . "
as nancy pelosi , speaker of the house of representatives and the official host of angela merkel said , the german chancellor was invited to commemorate the upcoming 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall .
respected leader and although not officially stated , merkel was also asked to speak to congress because she is highly respected in washington .
under president obama , merkel 's stature in the us capital has only increased - especially when compared to other european heads of governments .
" mrs. merkel as german chancellor is held in high esteem ; her competence and her standing is internationally recognized , " joerg himmelreich , senior trans-atlantic fellow at the german marshall fund in berlin , told deutsche welle .
" germany is definitely the european power washington needs to work with in order to conduct trans-atlantic relations and carry out the multilateral approach that - in contrast to his predecessor - is a goal for the obama administration , " he added .
while the future of german-american relations will play a major role in merkel 's address before congress , history will also be present .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gordon brown is the only other foreign leader invited to speak before congress under president obama " she will probably , and this is very important as a message to the american people as a whole , express her gratitude for the invaluable contribution the first president bush made to the fall of the berlin wall and therefore to german unity , " said himmelreich .
the chancellor is also expected to highlight the importance of german-american relations as a pillar of foreign policy for the new german government .
in addition , merkel will probably talk about international efforts in combating climate change , a sensitive topic to which president obama is more open than congress .
with a giant american flag draped behind her , framed by us vice president joe biden and house speaker nancy pelosi , merkel 's speech before congress will be saturated in symbolism .
but even more important than the official address itself could be the chancellor 's planned meeting with the president .
demand for discussions even though obama and merkel will probably only get together for either a lunch or a dinner , this could be the moment when important matters are addressed .
" i think that 's just the right amount of time to make specific , concrete demands off the record , " said hulsman .
" any longer you are going to get into bigger things , any shorter and it 's sound bites . "
there is an eagerness in the us to finally engage in serious talks with berlin .
the german election campaign put many important topics on ice until a new government was elected .
" washington and the new us administration gladly granted merkel this grace period , " said himmelreich .
" but now president obama would like to know what the new german government thinks about transatlantic relations and obama himself will surely also express his ideas and wishes . " his colleague hulsman put it more bluntly , calling it " put up or shut up time . "
after waiting patiently for the outcome of the german election , the obama administration now wants to know what to expect from berlin .
" beneath all the symbolism and niceness there is an insistent push that now it 's time for germany to step up to the plate , " he said .
afghan strategy high on the agenda for washington is the question of what the new german government wants to contribute in the future to the afghanistan mission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's contribution to afghanistan will be on the agenda the internal debate in the white house about the request by the us commander in afghanistan for additional troops is in the final stages and the experts expect that obama will let the chancellor in on his thinking about his upcoming decision .
merkel could be asked about how germany will provide concrete help in afghanistan if it does n't want to send more troops .
other topics such as iran , climate change and the economic crisis could then be discussed in a similar fashion - openly and not shying away from possible disagreements .
this kind of detailed and frank discussion with germany about foreign policy has been missing , noted hulsman .
instead of concrete policy solutions discussions often focused on grand strategic disagreements between the two countries .
policy solutions now when practical policies are key , obama ca n't find a more suitable partner than merkel , according to hulsman .
" mrs. merkel is not a great orator , she 's not flashy , but she 's incredibly effective in meetings , " he said , adding that with her grasp of policy detail she can not only hold her own against obama , but also put pressure on the president himself .
" she 's intellectually capable of having this nuts-and-bolts policy discussion that 's so desperately needed , " he said .
if the planned meeting between merkel and obama does in fact signal the start of a new phase of open and honest exchange between washington and berlin , than merkel 's trip will have been not only symbolic , but also a sustainable success .

the chancellor is also expected to highlight the importance of german-american relations as a pillar of foreign policy for the new german government .
in addition , merkel will probably talk about international efforts in combating climate change , a sensitive topic to which president obama is more open than congress .
with a giant american flag draped behind her , framed by us vice president joe biden and house speaker nancy pelosi , merkel 's speech before congress will be saturated in symbolism .
but even more important than the official address itself could be the chancellor 's planned meeting with the president .
demand for discussions even though obama and merkel will probably only get together for either a lunch or a dinner , this could be the moment when important matters are addressed .
" i think that 's just the right amount of time to make specific , concrete demands off the record , " said hulsman .
" any longer you are going to get into bigger things , any shorter and it 's sound bites . "
there is an eagerness in the us to finally engage in serious talks with berlin .
the german election campaign put many important topics on ice until a new government was elected .
" washington and the new us administration gladly granted merkel this grace period , " said himmelreich .
" but now president obama would like to know what the new german government thinks about transatlantic relations and obama himself will surely also express his ideas and wishes . " his colleague hulsman put it more bluntly , calling it " put up or shut up time . "
after waiting patiently for the outcome of the german election , the obama administration now wants to know what to expect from berlin .
" beneath all the symbolism and niceness there is an insistent push that now it 's time for germany to step up to the plate , " he said .
afghan strategy high on the agenda for washington is the question of what the new german government wants to contribute in the future to the afghanistan mission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's contribution to afghanistan will be on the agenda the internal debate in the white house about the request by the us commander in afghanistan for additional troops is in the final stages and the experts expect that obama will let the chancellor in on his thinking about his upcoming decision .
merkel could be asked about how germany will provide concrete help in afghanistan if it does n't want to send more troops .
other topics such as iran , climate change and the economic crisis could then be discussed in a similar fashion - openly and not shying away from possible disagreements .
this kind of detailed and frank discussion with germany about foreign policy has been missing , noted hulsman .
instead of concrete policy solutions discussions often focused on grand strategic disagreements between the two countries .
policy solutions now when practical policies are key , obama ca n't find a more suitable partner than merkel , according to hulsman .
" mrs. merkel is not a great orator , she 's not flashy , but she 's incredibly effective in meetings , " he said , adding that with her grasp of policy detail she can not only hold her own against obama , but also put pressure on the president himself .
" she 's intellectually capable of having this nuts-and-bolts policy discussion that 's so desperately needed , " he said .
if the planned meeting between merkel and obama does in fact signal the start of a new phase of open and honest exchange between washington and berlin , than merkel 's trip will have been not only symbolic , but also a sustainable success .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 01.11.2009 report : german colonel made errors in afghan strike großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airstrike was ordered by colonel klein and carried out by us fighter jets a german magazine is reporting that a nato probe into a deadly airstrike in afghanistan that caused outrage in the region is more critical of the german commander who ordered it than the german army has admitted . the newsmagazine der spiegel said in an early release of its edition to be published on monday that a nato investigation into the september airstrike that killed dozens of afghan civilians showed the german commander who ordered it broke military procedure .
the september 4 strike on two fuel trucks in the northeastern kunduz province was the most deadly operation involving german troops since world war two .
the afghan government said the airstrike killed 69 taliban fighters and 30 civilians .
german forces said the bombing targeted the fuel tankers as they were hijacked by taliban insurgents and represented a danger .
in the immediate aftermath , berlin said around 50 militants were killed in the attack but that there were no civilian casualties .
witnesses , however , spoke of several civilian casualties , prompting critical reactions even from germany 's nato allies .
the report said that german authorities have put pressure on nato not to issue an outright condemnation of colonel georg klein because it could lead to legal problems .
this message was given to the nato commander in europe , admiral james stavridis , during a visit to berlin on october 15 .
backing for decision general wolfgang schneiderhan , general inspector of the german army , said on thursday that according to the report , colonel klein , had acted correctly in ordering the strike .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghans are becoming increasingly angry over rising civilian casualties " in light of the results of the report , i have no reason to doubt that german soldiers acted in the correct military fashion , given their mandate from the united nations and the difficult operational situation , " schneiderhan said .
he said the exact death toll in the attack could no longer be determined , adding that the report cited a range of between 17 and 142 casualties .
" the investigation is still under review and no other comment can be made at the moment , " a defense ministry spokesman said when asked about the report in der spiegel .
some eu condemnation the attack , carried out by a us f-5 fighter jet , was condemned by several european foreign ministers .
germany has maintained it was necessary to protect its troops from a possible suicide attack by taliban fighters who had hijacked the trucks .
the spiegel report said colonel klein broke standard operating procedure by ordering air support on the grounds that his troops had come into contact with the enemy , even though international forces were nowhere near the tankers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has 4,200 troops troops in afghanistan the magazine also said klein refused to allow the aircraft to conduct a low-altitude sweep of the area before launching its payload , adding that overcast skies also raised doubts about the appropriateness of ordering a strike while relying on a single human information source and video alone .
the report cited a source familiar with the nato report as saying it also addressed positive sides of klein 's leadership and that it could be used to either condemn or excuse him .
germans remain highly skeptical of military operations more than 60 years after the defeat of the nazis .
it was only a decade ago that german troops participated in their first foreign combat mission since the war .
opinion polls indicate a majority of germans want the over 4,000 german troops deployed in afghanistan as part of the six-year-old nato mission to come home. rb / afp / reuters editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the september 4 strike on two fuel trucks in the northeastern kunduz province was the most deadly operation involving german troops since world war two .
the afghan government said the airstrike killed 69 taliban fighters and 30 civilians .
german forces said the bombing targeted the fuel tankers as they were hijacked by taliban insurgents and represented a danger .
in the immediate aftermath , berlin said around 50 militants were killed in the attack but that there were no civilian casualties .
witnesses , however , spoke of several civilian casualties , prompting critical reactions even from germany 's nato allies .
the report said that german authorities have put pressure on nato not to issue an outright condemnation of colonel georg klein because it could lead to legal problems .
this message was given to the nato commander in europe , admiral james stavridis , during a visit to berlin on october 15 .

he said the exact death toll in the attack could no longer be determined , adding that the report cited a range of between 17 and 142 casualties .
" the investigation is still under review and no other comment can be made at the moment , " a defense ministry spokesman said when asked about the report in der spiegel .
some eu condemnation the attack , carried out by a us f-5 fighter jet , was condemned by several european foreign ministers .
germany has maintained it was necessary to protect its troops from a possible suicide attack by taliban fighters who had hijacked the trucks .
the spiegel report said colonel klein broke standard operating procedure by ordering air support on the grounds that his troops had come into contact with the enemy , even though international forces were nowhere near the tankers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 01.11.2009 germany " regrets " abdullah 's decision to withdraw from afghan run-off großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah pulled out after president karzai refused his demands for the run-off germany has lamented afghan opposition candidate abdullah abdullah 's withdrawal from the presidential run-off election .
the former foreign minister 's move could deepen the political crisis in the war-torn nation . germany 's new foreign minister , guido westerwelle , expressed disappointment with afghan opposition candidate abdullah abdullah 's withdrawal from the presidential run-off election .
in remarks at the national congress of young liberals on sunday in saarbruecken , westerwelle said the situation in afghanistan required a level-headed reaction and that now " the election process should be completed in accordance with law and order . "
meanwhile , british prime minister gordon brown said that abdullah had told him that his decision to pull out was " in the interests of national unity . "
brown said that afghan president hamid karzai had called him after abdullah 's announcement to say that he wanted to issue a " unity manifesto " for the afghan people .
he added that he could n't rule out abdullah 's inclusion in a unity government .
" i do n't think anything is being ruled out .
but i think what is more likely is once the decision has been made about the second round election , president karzai , or whoever is president , will want to unify the country , " brown said sunday .
abdullah abdullah told supporters in kabul on sunday that he was withdrawing from the november 7 contest to protest what he described as " misconduct " by the government and the country 's electoral commission .
he said he made the decision after his demands to avoid a repeat of massive first-round fraud were rejected by karzai .
" the decision … was not an easy one .
it was a decision that i have taken after wide-ranging consultations with the people of afghanistan , my supporters and influential leaders , " abdullah said in a lengthy address .
the former foreign minister went on to launch a scathing attack on karzai 's eight-year rule , dimming any hopes that the two rivals could yet agree on some form of power-sharing agreement .
" we have had eight years of lost opportunities because of the weakness of the government , " he said to applause from around 2,000 supporters .
demand to sack top officials following the widespread fraud in the first round on august 20 , abdullah demanded that karzai sack the head of the electoral commission , azizullah ludin , and suspend four ministers who campaigned for the incumbent .
the abdullah camp had set a deadline of saturday for karzai to yield to the demands , saying that he would not take part in a contest that would not be free and fair .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamid karzai reluctantly agreed to the run-off election however , his demands received short shrift , with electoral authorities saying ludin could only be dismissed by afghanistan 's supreme court , while karzai said abdullah had no right to interfere with ministerial positions .
" the election commission was not independent .
it was their job to ensure a credible election and we saw what happened , " abdullah said .
" the people were deprived of their democratic rights . "
" poll will be held " speaking on afghan television shortly before abdullah 's announcement , karzai 's campaign spokesman indicated that the election would still go ahead .
" the election law says that in the event of a second round , the candidates must participate , " the spokesman told a private television station .
" the conditions -lrb- set by abdullah -rrb- were impractical and had no basis in law .
these conditions were never received by us but only given to unama , " karzai 's spokesman added , referring to the un mission in afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai 's former foreign minister has become a formidable rival karzai 's share of the vote in the first round fell to 49.67 percent after a un-backed watchdog deemed around a quarter of all votes cast to be fraudulent .
insisting that the fraud had been overstated , karzai only agreed to a second round under extensive diplomatic pressure from washington .

the former foreign minister 's move could deepen the political crisis in the war-torn nation . germany 's new foreign minister , guido westerwelle , expressed disappointment with afghan opposition candidate abdullah abdullah 's withdrawal from the presidential run-off election .
in remarks at the national congress of young liberals on sunday in saarbruecken , westerwelle said the situation in afghanistan required a level-headed reaction and that now " the election process should be completed in accordance with law and order . "
meanwhile , british prime minister gordon brown said that abdullah had told him that his decision to pull out was " in the interests of national unity . "
brown said that afghan president hamid karzai had called him after abdullah 's announcement to say that he wanted to issue a " unity manifesto " for the afghan people .
he added that he could n't rule out abdullah 's inclusion in a unity government .
" i do n't think anything is being ruled out .
but i think what is more likely is once the decision has been made about the second round election , president karzai , or whoever is president , will want to unify the country , " brown said sunday .
abdullah abdullah told supporters in kabul on sunday that he was withdrawing from the november 7 contest to protest what he described as " misconduct " by the government and the country 's electoral commission .
he said he made the decision after his demands to avoid a repeat of massive first-round fraud were rejected by karzai .
" the decision … was not an easy one .
it was a decision that i have taken after wide-ranging consultations with the people of afghanistan , my supporters and influential leaders , " abdullah said in a lengthy address .
the former foreign minister went on to launch a scathing attack on karzai 's eight-year rule , dimming any hopes that the two rivals could yet agree on some form of power-sharing agreement .
" we have had eight years of lost opportunities because of the weakness of the government , " he said to applause from around 2,000 supporters .
demand to sack top officials following the widespread fraud in the first round on august 20 , abdullah demanded that karzai sack the head of the electoral commission , azizullah ludin , and suspend four ministers who campaigned for the incumbent .
the abdullah camp had set a deadline of saturday for karzai to yield to the demands , saying that he would not take part in a contest that would not be free and fair .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamid karzai reluctantly agreed to the run-off election however , his demands received short shrift , with electoral authorities saying ludin could only be dismissed by afghanistan 's supreme court , while karzai said abdullah had no right to interfere with ministerial positions .
" the election commission was not independent .
it was their job to ensure a credible election and we saw what happened , " abdullah said .
" the people were deprived of their democratic rights . "
" poll will be held " speaking on afghan television shortly before abdullah 's announcement , karzai 's campaign spokesman indicated that the election would still go ahead .
" the election law says that in the event of a second round , the candidates must participate , " the spokesman told a private television station .
" the conditions -lrb- set by abdullah -rrb- were impractical and had no basis in law .
these conditions were never received by us but only given to unama , " karzai 's spokesman added , referring to the un mission in afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai 's former foreign minister has become a formidable rival karzai 's share of the vote in the first round fell to 49.67 percent after a un-backed watchdog deemed around a quarter of all votes cast to be fraudulent .
insisting that the fraud had been overstated , karzai only agreed to a second round under extensive diplomatic pressure from washington .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 01.11.2009 honor , yes , but tough questions also await merkel in washington großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chemistry between chancellor and president is good angela merkel will be the first german head of government since konrad adenauer to speak before the us congress .
it 's a great honor for the chancellor , but equally great are the expectations of the obama administration . when chancellor merkel steps up to the lectern on tuesday inside the capitol building in washington , she will have achieved something that only one german post-war chancellor before her had done : to give an address before members of congress .
and actually , the speech which konrad adenauer , the first chancellor of the new federal republic , gave to congress on may 28 , 1957 was at a reception given by the house of representatives , not an address to a joint session of congress .
so according to official protocol , chancellor merkel 's speech on capitol hill is a first for a german head of government .
the fact that the recently re-elected chancellor is only the second foreign dignitary to speak before congress since president barack obama took office underlines the symbolic importance of the event .
the other leader granted this privilege was britain 's prime minister gordon brown .
" i think it is a big deal , " john hulsman , an american foreign policy expert based in germany , told deutsche welle .
" the us is a republic and a relatively new country , that does n't have a lot of symbolism .
to speak to a joint session of congress is about as big an honor as can be bestowed on a foreign leader . "
as nancy pelosi , speaker of the house of representatives and the official host of angela merkel said , the german chancellor was invited to commemorate the upcoming 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall .
respected leader and although not officially stated , merkel was also asked to speak to congress because she is highly respected in washington .
under president obama , merkel 's stature in the us capital has only increased - especially when compared to other european heads of governments .
" mrs. merkel as german chancellor is held in high esteem ; her competence and her standing is internationally recognized , " joerg himmelreich , senior trans-atlantic fellow at the german marshall fund in berlin , told deutsche welle .
" germany is definitely the european power washington needs to work with in order to conduct trans-atlantic relations and carry out the multilateral approach that - in contrast to his predecessor - is a goal for the obama administration , " he added .
while the future of german-american relations will play a major role in merkel 's address before congress , history will also be present .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gordon brown is the only other foreign leader invited to speak before congress under president obama " she will probably , and this is very important as a message to the american people as a whole , express her gratitude for the invaluable contribution the first president bush made to the fall of the berlin wall and therefore to german unity , " said himmelreich .
the chancellor is also expected to highlight the importance of german-american relations as a pillar of foreign policy for the new german government .
in addition , merkel will probably talk about international efforts in combating climate change , a sensitive topic to which president obama is more open than congress .
with a giant american flag draped behind her , framed by us vice president joe biden and house speaker nancy pelosi , merkel 's speech before congress will be saturated in symbolism .
but even more important than the official address itself could be the chancellor 's planned meeting with the president .
demand for discussions even though obama and merkel will probably only get together for either a lunch or a dinner , this could be the moment when important matters are addressed .
" i think that 's just the right amount of time to make specific , concrete demands off the record , " said hulsman .
" any longer you are going to get into bigger things , any shorter and it 's sound bites . "
there is an eagerness in the us to finally engage in serious talks with berlin .
the german election campaign put many important topics on ice until a new government was elected .
" washington and the new us administration gladly granted merkel this grace period , " said himmelreich .
" but now president obama would like to know what the new german government thinks about transatlantic relations and obama himself will surely also express his ideas and wishes . " his colleague hulsman put it more bluntly , calling it " put up or shut up time . "
after waiting patiently for the outcome of the german election , the obama administration now wants to know what to expect from berlin .
" beneath all the symbolism and niceness there is an insistent push that now it 's time for germany to step up to the plate , " he said .
afghan strategy high on the agenda for washington is the question of what the new german government wants to contribute in the future to the afghanistan mission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's contribution to afghanistan will be on the agenda the internal debate in the white house about the request by the us commander in afghanistan for additional troops is in the final stages and the experts expect that obama will let the chancellor in on his thinking about his upcoming decision .
merkel could be asked about how germany will provide concrete help in afghanistan if it does n't want to send more troops .
other topics such as iran , climate change and the economic crisis could then be discussed in a similar fashion - openly and not shying away from possible disagreements .
this kind of detailed and frank discussion with germany about foreign policy has been missing , noted hulsman .
instead of concrete policy solutions discussions often focused on grand strategic disagreements between the two countries .
policy solutions now when practical policies are key , obama ca n't find a more suitable partner than merkel , according to hulsman .
" mrs. merkel is not a great orator , she 's not flashy , but she 's incredibly effective in meetings , " he said , adding that with her grasp of policy detail she can not only hold her own against obama , but also put pressure on the president himself .
" she 's intellectually capable of having this nuts-and-bolts policy discussion that 's so desperately needed , " he said .
if the planned meeting between merkel and obama does in fact signal the start of a new phase of open and honest exchange between washington and berlin , than merkel 's trip will have been not only symbolic , but also a sustainable success .

dw-world.de opinion : from miss world to world leader ?

statistics over the past two years have shown a drop in robberies , rapes and murders but with around 50 people being killed every day across the country , concerns about safety remain high as the world cup approaches . but there is equal concern over the safety of the teams and support staff of countries appearing at the tournament , with some people suggesting beefed-up security operations will be needed to keep players from harm . a recent report in the german sport bild magazine suggested that the germany team would be protected by a full escort of armed security guards when the team leaves its base in pretoria and that the players will be required to wear bullet-proof vests . quotes attributed to guenter schnelle from baysecur , a private security firm which looks after the germany team at away games , suggest that the movement of players outside of their hotel should be kept to a minimum . the overall impression given by the sport bild article and the quotes – which schnelle later denied making – is that germany and the other teams at the world cup will be under siege . federation rejects vest suggestion germany 's dfb football federation spokesman harald stenger told deutsche welle that bullet-proof vests had not even been discussed as an option and that a security operation for the germany team while they are in south africa has not been finalized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach jogi loew 's only worry should be the performance of his team " the person and firm mentioned in the article have not spoken to the dfb about these security issues , " stenger said , saying that the dfb 's security officer is currently in south africa assessing the situation .
when he returns , stenger said , the organization will then determine if additional security is needed . " once the draw for the tournament is made on december 4 , we will again assess the situation and discuss and finalize our plans together with fifa and the south african authorities . " no drastic changes expected stenger said that he did n't expect any drastic change to the security operations that are usually in place when the germany team plays abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack and co. will be as secure as usual in south africa , the dfb says according to him , a private security firm with two to four security staff is employed to travel with the national team and its entourage .
in south africa , there may be additional security operatives deployed from the german federal police -lrb- bka -rrb- because of the location of a media center at the hotel where players will stay . " but we will not be making a big deal just because it is south africa , " he added .
" we are aware of the crime rate but we are not afraid .
there is crime everywhere when you travel with a national team . " dfb security boss helmut spahn told reporters before leaving for south africa that the federation is looking to recruit 20 extra security guards for the team 's stay at their five-star accommodation at the velmore grande hotel in the south african province of gauteng .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 01.11.2009 honor , yes , but tough questions also await merkel in washington großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chemistry between chancellor and president is good angela merkel will be the first german head of government since konrad adenauer to speak before the us congress .
it 's a great honor for the chancellor , but equally great are the expectations of the obama administration . when chancellor merkel steps up to the lectern on tuesday inside the capitol building in washington , she will have achieved something that only one german post-war chancellor before her had done : to give an address before members of congress .
and actually , the speech which konrad adenauer , the first chancellor of the new federal republic , gave to congress on may 28 , 1957 was at a reception given by the house of representatives , not an address to a joint session of congress .
so according to official protocol , chancellor merkel 's speech on capitol hill is a first for a german head of government .
the fact that the recently re-elected chancellor is only the second foreign dignitary to speak before congress since president barack obama took office underlines the symbolic importance of the event .
the other leader granted this privilege was britain 's prime minister gordon brown .
" i think it is a big deal , " john hulsman , an american foreign policy expert based in germany , told deutsche welle .
" the us is a republic and a relatively new country , that does n't have a lot of symbolism .
to speak to a joint session of congress is about as big an honor as can be bestowed on a foreign leader . "
as nancy pelosi , speaker of the house of representatives and the official host of angela merkel said , the german chancellor was invited to commemorate the upcoming 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall .
respected leader and although not officially stated , merkel was also asked to speak to congress because she is highly respected in washington .
under president obama , merkel 's stature in the us capital has only increased - especially when compared to other european heads of governments .
" mrs. merkel as german chancellor is held in high esteem ; her competence and her standing is internationally recognized , " joerg himmelreich , senior trans-atlantic fellow at the german marshall fund in berlin , told deutsche welle .
" germany is definitely the european power washington needs to work with in order to conduct trans-atlantic relations and carry out the multilateral approach that - in contrast to his predecessor - is a goal for the obama administration , " he added .
while the future of german-american relations will play a major role in merkel 's address before congress , history will also be present .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gordon brown is the only other foreign leader invited to speak before congress under president obama " she will probably , and this is very important as a message to the american people as a whole , express her gratitude for the invaluable contribution the first president bush made to the fall of the berlin wall and therefore to german unity , " said himmelreich .
the chancellor is also expected to highlight the importance of german-american relations as a pillar of foreign policy for the new german government .
in addition , merkel will probably talk about international efforts in combating climate change , a sensitive topic to which president obama is more open than congress .
with a giant american flag draped behind her , framed by us vice president joe biden and house speaker nancy pelosi , merkel 's speech before congress will be saturated in symbolism .
but even more important than the official address itself could be the chancellor 's planned meeting with the president .
demand for discussions even though obama and merkel will probably only get together for either a lunch or a dinner , this could be the moment when important matters are addressed .
" i think that 's just the right amount of time to make specific , concrete demands off the record , " said hulsman .
" any longer you are going to get into bigger things , any shorter and it 's sound bites . "
there is an eagerness in the us to finally engage in serious talks with berlin .
the german election campaign put many important topics on ice until a new government was elected .
" washington and the new us administration gladly granted merkel this grace period , " said himmelreich .
" but now president obama would like to know what the new german government thinks about transatlantic relations and obama himself will surely also express his ideas and wishes . " his colleague hulsman put it more bluntly , calling it " put up or shut up time . "
after waiting patiently for the outcome of the german election , the obama administration now wants to know what to expect from berlin .
" beneath all the symbolism and niceness there is an insistent push that now it 's time for germany to step up to the plate , " he said .
afghan strategy high on the agenda for washington is the question of what the new german government wants to contribute in the future to the afghanistan mission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's contribution to afghanistan will be on the agenda the internal debate in the white house about the request by the us commander in afghanistan for additional troops is in the final stages and the experts expect that obama will let the chancellor in on his thinking about his upcoming decision .
merkel could be asked about how germany will provide concrete help in afghanistan if it does n't want to send more troops .
other topics such as iran , climate change and the economic crisis could then be discussed in a similar fashion - openly and not shying away from possible disagreements .
this kind of detailed and frank discussion with germany about foreign policy has been missing , noted hulsman .
instead of concrete policy solutions discussions often focused on grand strategic disagreements between the two countries .
policy solutions now when practical policies are key , obama ca n't find a more suitable partner than merkel , according to hulsman .
" mrs. merkel is not a great orator , she 's not flashy , but she 's incredibly effective in meetings , " he said , adding that with her grasp of policy detail she can not only hold her own against obama , but also put pressure on the president himself .
" she 's intellectually capable of having this nuts-and-bolts policy discussion that 's so desperately needed , " he said .
if the planned meeting between merkel and obama does in fact signal the start of a new phase of open and honest exchange between washington and berlin , than merkel 's trip will have been not only symbolic , but also a sustainable success .

" but now president obama would like to know what the new german government thinks about transatlantic relations and obama himself will surely also express his ideas and wishes . " his colleague hulsman put it more bluntly , calling it " put up or shut up time . "
after waiting patiently for the outcome of the german election , the obama administration now wants to know what to expect from berlin .
" beneath all the symbolism and niceness there is an insistent push that now it 's time for germany to step up to the plate , " he said .
afghan strategy high on the agenda for washington is the question of what the new german government wants to contribute in the future to the afghanistan mission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's contribution to afghanistan will be on the agenda the internal debate in the white house about the request by the us commander in afghanistan for additional troops is in the final stages and the experts expect that obama will let the chancellor in on his thinking about his upcoming decision .
merkel could be asked about how germany will provide concrete help in afghanistan if it does n't want to send more troops .
other topics such as iran , climate change and the economic crisis could then be discussed in a similar fashion - openly and not shying away from possible disagreements .
this kind of detailed and frank discussion with germany about foreign policy has been missing , noted hulsman .
instead of concrete policy solutions discussions often focused on grand strategic disagreements between the two countries .
policy solutions now when practical policies are key , obama ca n't find a more suitable partner than merkel , according to hulsman .
" mrs. merkel is not a great orator , she 's not flashy , but she 's incredibly effective in meetings , " he said , adding that with her grasp of policy detail she can not only hold her own against obama , but also put pressure on the president himself .
" she 's intellectually capable of having this nuts-and-bolts policy discussion that 's so desperately needed , " he said .
if the planned meeting between merkel and obama does in fact signal the start of a new phase of open and honest exchange between washington and berlin , than merkel 's trip will have been not only symbolic , but also a sustainable success .

it 's a great honor for the chancellor , but equally great are the expectations of the obama administration . when chancellor merkel steps up to the lectern on tuesday inside the capitol building in washington , she will have achieved something that only one german post-war chancellor before her had done : to give an address before members of congress .
and actually , the speech which konrad adenauer , the first chancellor of the new federal republic , gave to congress on may 28 , 1957 was at a reception given by the house of representatives , not an address to a joint session of congress .
so according to official protocol , chancellor merkel 's speech on capitol hill is a first for a german head of government .
the fact that the recently re-elected chancellor is only the second foreign dignitary to speak before congress since president barack obama took office underlines the symbolic importance of the event .
the other leader granted this privilege was britain 's prime minister gordon brown .
" i think it is a big deal , " john hulsman , an american foreign policy expert based in germany , told deutsche welle .
" the us is a republic and a relatively new country , that does n't have a lot of symbolism .
to speak to a joint session of congress is about as big an honor as can be bestowed on a foreign leader . "
as nancy pelosi , speaker of the house of representatives and the official host of angela merkel said , the german chancellor was invited to commemorate the upcoming 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall .
respected leader and although not officially stated , merkel was also asked to speak to congress because she is highly respected in washington .
under president obama , merkel 's stature in the us capital has only increased - especially when compared to other european heads of governments .
" mrs. merkel as german chancellor is held in high esteem ; her competence and her standing is internationally recognized , " joerg himmelreich , senior trans-atlantic fellow at the german marshall fund in berlin , told deutsche welle .
" germany is definitely the european power washington needs to work with in order to conduct trans-atlantic relations and carry out the multilateral approach that - in contrast to his predecessor - is a goal for the obama administration , " he added .
while the future of german-american relations will play a major role in merkel 's address before congress , history will also be present .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gordon brown is the only other foreign leader invited to speak before congress under president obama " she will probably , and this is very important as a message to the american people as a whole , express her gratitude for the invaluable contribution the first president bush made to the fall of the berlin wall and therefore to german unity , " said himmelreich .
the chancellor is also expected to highlight the importance of german-american relations as a pillar of foreign policy for the new german government .
in addition , merkel will probably talk about international efforts in combating climate change , a sensitive topic to which president obama is more open than congress .
with a giant american flag draped behind her , framed by us vice president joe biden and house speaker nancy pelosi , merkel 's speech before congress will be saturated in symbolism .
but even more important than the official address itself could be the chancellor 's planned meeting with the president .
demand for discussions even though obama and merkel will probably only get together for either a lunch or a dinner , this could be the moment when important matters are addressed .
" i think that 's just the right amount of time to make specific , concrete demands off the record , " said hulsman .
" any longer you are going to get into bigger things , any shorter and it 's sound bites . "
there is an eagerness in the us to finally engage in serious talks with berlin .
the german election campaign put many important topics on ice until a new government was elected .
" washington and the new us administration gladly granted merkel this grace period , " said himmelreich .
" but now president obama would like to know what the new german government thinks about transatlantic relations and obama himself will surely also express his ideas and wishes . " his colleague hulsman put it more bluntly , calling it " put up or shut up time . "

statistics over the past two years have shown a drop in robberies , rapes and murders but with around 50 people being killed every day across the country , concerns about safety remain high as the world cup approaches . but there is equal concern over the safety of the teams and support staff of countries appearing at the tournament , with some people suggesting beefed-up security operations will be needed to keep players from harm . a recent report in the german sport bild magazine suggested that the germany team would be protected by a full escort of armed security guards when the team leaves its base in pretoria and that the players will be required to wear bullet-proof vests . quotes attributed to guenter schnelle from baysecur , a private security firm which looks after the germany team at away games , suggest that the movement of players outside of their hotel should be kept to a minimum . the overall impression given by the sport bild article and the quotes – which schnelle later denied making – is that germany and the other teams at the world cup will be under siege . federation rejects vest suggestion germany 's dfb football federation spokesman harald stenger told deutsche welle that bullet-proof vests had not even been discussed as an option and that a security operation for the germany team while they are in south africa has not been finalized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach jogi loew 's only worry should be the performance of his team " the person and firm mentioned in the article have not spoken to the dfb about these security issues , " stenger said , saying that the dfb 's security officer is currently in south africa assessing the situation .
when he returns , stenger said , the organization will then determine if additional security is needed . " once the draw for the tournament is made on december 4 , we will again assess the situation and discuss and finalize our plans together with fifa and the south african authorities . " no drastic changes expected stenger said that he did n't expect any drastic change to the security operations that are usually in place when the germany team plays abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack and co. will be as secure as usual in south africa , the dfb says according to him , a private security firm with two to four security staff is employed to travel with the national team and its entourage .
in south africa , there may be additional security operatives deployed from the german federal police -lrb- bka -rrb- because of the location of a media center at the hotel where players will stay . " but we will not be making a big deal just because it is south africa , " he added .
" we are aware of the crime rate but we are not afraid .
there is crime everywhere when you travel with a national team . " dfb security boss helmut spahn told reporters before leaving for south africa that the federation is looking to recruit 20 extra security guards for the team 's stay at their five-star accommodation at the velmore grande hotel in the south african province of gauteng .

the policy blueprint will see income taxes slashed by around 24 billion euros -lrb- $ 36 billion -rrb- , with a focus on reducing the tax burden on families with children and reforms to corporate and inheritance taxes .
but stanislav tillich , the cdu premier of the eastern german state of saxony , has taken a swipe at the plan , insisting the drop in revenue would cancel out his state 's budgetary surplus and negate recent measures taken to balance saxony 's books .
" it can not be that this money is now simply used to cover for a reduction in taxes , " he told the german newsmagazine der spiegel .
" these tax cuts are irresponsible . "
tillich added that plans for how the government would compensate for the drop in revenue remained " very cloudy . "
peter mueller , who heads the cdu government of the small southwestern state of saarland , said he agreed with the federal government 's goal of putting more money into the hands of german tax payers , but said plans for achieving this through sweeping tax cuts were unfounded .
" i believe we should stick with the proven linear-progressive tax plan , " he said .
court case ?
the state premiers said the tax cuts could lead to revenue shortfalls amounting to billions of euros , and threaten upgrades to kindergartens , schools and universities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 24-billion-euro tax cut would take money from schools , critics say saxony-anhalt premier wolfgang boehmer had previously threatened to bring a case before the country 's constitutional court if the federal government pushed ahead with its tax plans .
the new secretary-general of the cdu , hermann groehe , called on tillich and mueller to stand by their federal partners , highlighting that several state premiers who were involved in the coalition negotiations had given their full support to the tax cut plans .
" the party 's various bodies have unanimously approved the coalition deal , " he told german daily hamburger abendblatt . dfm / reuters / ap editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's a great honor for the chancellor , but equally great are the expectations of the obama administration . when chancellor merkel steps up to the lectern on tuesday inside the capitol building in washington , she will have achieved something that only one german post-war chancellor before her had done : to give an address before members of congress .
and actually , the speech which konrad adenauer , the first chancellor of the new federal republic , gave to congress on may 28 , 1957 was at a reception given by the house of representatives , not an address to a joint session of congress .
so according to official protocol , chancellor merkel 's speech on capitol hill is a first for a german head of government .
the fact that the recently re-elected chancellor is only the second foreign dignitary to speak before congress since president barack obama took office underlines the symbolic importance of the event .
the other leader granted this privilege was britain 's prime minister gordon brown .
" i think it is a big deal , " john hulsman , an american foreign policy expert based in germany , told deutsche welle .
" the us is a republic and a relatively new country , that does n't have a lot of symbolism .
to speak to a joint session of congress is about as big an honor as can be bestowed on a foreign leader . "
as nancy pelosi , speaker of the house of representatives and the official host of angela merkel said , the german chancellor was invited to commemorate the upcoming 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall .
respected leader and although not officially stated , merkel was also asked to speak to congress because she is highly respected in washington .
under president obama , merkel 's stature in the us capital has only increased - especially when compared to other european heads of governments .
" mrs. merkel as german chancellor is held in high esteem ; her competence and her standing is internationally recognized , " joerg himmelreich , senior trans-atlantic fellow at the german marshall fund in berlin , told deutsche welle .
" germany is definitely the european power washington needs to work with in order to conduct trans-atlantic relations and carry out the multilateral approach that - in contrast to his predecessor - is a goal for the obama administration , " he added .
while the future of german-american relations will play a major role in merkel 's address before congress , history will also be present .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gordon brown is the only other foreign leader invited to speak before congress under president obama " she will probably , and this is very important as a message to the american people as a whole , express her gratitude for the invaluable contribution the first president bush made to the fall of the berlin wall and therefore to german unity , " said himmelreich .
the chancellor is also expected to highlight the importance of german-american relations as a pillar of foreign policy for the new german government .
in addition , merkel will probably talk about international efforts in combating climate change , a sensitive topic to which president obama is more open than congress .
with a giant american flag draped behind her , framed by us vice president joe biden and house speaker nancy pelosi , merkel 's speech before congress will be saturated in symbolism .
but even more important than the official address itself could be the chancellor 's planned meeting with the president .
demand for discussions even though obama and merkel will probably only get together for either a lunch or a dinner , this could be the moment when important matters are addressed .
" i think that 's just the right amount of time to make specific , concrete demands off the record , " said hulsman .
" any longer you are going to get into bigger things , any shorter and it 's sound bites . "
there is an eagerness in the us to finally engage in serious talks with berlin .
the german election campaign put many important topics on ice until a new government was elected .
" washington and the new us administration gladly granted merkel this grace period , " said himmelreich .
" but now president obama would like to know what the new german government thinks about transatlantic relations and obama himself will surely also express his ideas and wishes . " his colleague hulsman put it more bluntly , calling it " put up or shut up time . "
after waiting patiently for the outcome of the german election , the obama administration now wants to know what to expect from berlin .
" beneath all the symbolism and niceness there is an insistent push that now it 's time for germany to step up to the plate , " he said .
afghan strategy high on the agenda for washington is the question of what the new german government wants to contribute in the future to the afghanistan mission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's contribution to afghanistan will be on the agenda the internal debate in the white house about the request by the us commander in afghanistan for additional troops is in the final stages and the experts expect that obama will let the chancellor in on his thinking about his upcoming decision .
merkel could be asked about how germany will provide concrete help in afghanistan if it does n't want to send more troops .
other topics such as iran , climate change and the economic crisis could then be discussed in a similar fashion - openly and not shying away from possible disagreements .
this kind of detailed and frank discussion with germany about foreign policy has been missing , noted hulsman .
instead of concrete policy solutions discussions often focused on grand strategic disagreements between the two countries .
policy solutions now when practical policies are key , obama ca n't find a more suitable partner than merkel , according to hulsman .
" mrs. merkel is not a great orator , she 's not flashy , but she 's incredibly effective in meetings , " he said , adding that with her grasp of policy detail she can not only hold her own against obama , but also put pressure on the president himself .
" she 's intellectually capable of having this nuts-and-bolts policy discussion that 's so desperately needed , " he said .
if the planned meeting between merkel and obama does in fact signal the start of a new phase of open and honest exchange between washington and berlin , than merkel 's trip will have been not only symbolic , but also a sustainable success .

it 's a great honor for the chancellor , but equally great are the expectations of the obama administration . when chancellor merkel steps up to the lectern on tuesday inside the capitol building in washington , she will have achieved something that only one german post-war chancellor before her had done : to give an address before members of congress .
and actually , the speech which konrad adenauer , the first chancellor of the new federal republic , gave to congress on may 28 , 1957 was at a reception given by the house of representatives , not an address to a joint session of congress .
so according to official protocol , chancellor merkel 's speech on capitol hill is a first for a german head of government .
the fact that the recently re-elected chancellor is only the second foreign dignitary to speak before congress since president barack obama took office underlines the symbolic importance of the event .
the other leader granted this privilege was britain 's prime minister gordon brown .
" i think it is a big deal , " john hulsman , an american foreign policy expert based in germany , told deutsche welle .
" the us is a republic and a relatively new country , that does n't have a lot of symbolism .
to speak to a joint session of congress is about as big an honor as can be bestowed on a foreign leader . "
as nancy pelosi , speaker of the house of representatives and the official host of angela merkel said , the german chancellor was invited to commemorate the upcoming 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall .
respected leader and although not officially stated , merkel was also asked to speak to congress because she is highly respected in washington .
under president obama , merkel 's stature in the us capital has only increased - especially when compared to other european heads of governments .
" mrs. merkel as german chancellor is held in high esteem ; her competence and her standing is internationally recognized , " joerg himmelreich , senior trans-atlantic fellow at the german marshall fund in berlin , told deutsche welle .
" germany is definitely the european power washington needs to work with in order to conduct trans-atlantic relations and carry out the multilateral approach that - in contrast to his predecessor - is a goal for the obama administration , " he added .
while the future of german-american relations will play a major role in merkel 's address before congress , history will also be present .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gordon brown is the only other foreign leader invited to speak before congress under president obama " she will probably , and this is very important as a message to the american people as a whole , express her gratitude for the invaluable contribution the first president bush made to the fall of the berlin wall and therefore to german unity , " said himmelreich .
the chancellor is also expected to highlight the importance of german-american relations as a pillar of foreign policy for the new german government .
in addition , merkel will probably talk about international efforts in combating climate change , a sensitive topic to which president obama is more open than congress .
with a giant american flag draped behind her , framed by us vice president joe biden and house speaker nancy pelosi , merkel 's speech before congress will be saturated in symbolism .
but even more important than the official address itself could be the chancellor 's planned meeting with the president .
demand for discussions even though obama and merkel will probably only get together for either a lunch or a dinner , this could be the moment when important matters are addressed .
" i think that 's just the right amount of time to make specific , concrete demands off the record , " said hulsman .
" any longer you are going to get into bigger things , any shorter and it 's sound bites . "
there is an eagerness in the us to finally engage in serious talks with berlin .
the german election campaign put many important topics on ice until a new government was elected .
" washington and the new us administration gladly granted merkel this grace period , " said himmelreich .
" but now president obama would like to know what the new german government thinks about transatlantic relations and obama himself will surely also express his ideas and wishes . " his colleague hulsman put it more bluntly , calling it " put up or shut up time . "
after waiting patiently for the outcome of the german election , the obama administration now wants to know what to expect from berlin .
" beneath all the symbolism and niceness there is an insistent push that now it 's time for germany to step up to the plate , " he said .
afghan strategy high on the agenda for washington is the question of what the new german government wants to contribute in the future to the afghanistan mission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's contribution to afghanistan will be on the agenda the internal debate in the white house about the request by the us commander in afghanistan for additional troops is in the final stages and the experts expect that obama will let the chancellor in on his thinking about his upcoming decision .
merkel could be asked about how germany will provide concrete help in afghanistan if it does n't want to send more troops .
other topics such as iran , climate change and the economic crisis could then be discussed in a similar fashion - openly and not shying away from possible disagreements .
this kind of detailed and frank discussion with germany about foreign policy has been missing , noted hulsman .
instead of concrete policy solutions discussions often focused on grand strategic disagreements between the two countries .
policy solutions now when practical policies are key , obama ca n't find a more suitable partner than merkel , according to hulsman .
" mrs. merkel is not a great orator , she 's not flashy , but she 's incredibly effective in meetings , " he said , adding that with her grasp of policy detail she can not only hold her own against obama , but also put pressure on the president himself .
" she 's intellectually capable of having this nuts-and-bolts policy discussion that 's so desperately needed , " he said .
if the planned meeting between merkel and obama does in fact signal the start of a new phase of open and honest exchange between washington and berlin , than merkel 's trip will have been not only symbolic , but also a sustainable success .

the former foreign minister 's move could deepen the political crisis in the war-torn nation . germany 's new foreign minister , guido westerwelle , expressed disappointment with afghan opposition candidate abdullah abdullah 's withdrawal from the presidential run-off election .
in remarks at the national congress of young liberals on sunday in saarbruecken , westerwelle said the situation in afghanistan required a level-headed reaction and that now " the election process should be completed in accordance with law and order . "
meanwhile , british prime minister gordon brown said that abdullah had told him that his decision to pull out was " in the interests of national unity . "
brown said that afghan president hamid karzai had called him after abdullah 's announcement to say that he wanted to issue a " unity manifesto " for the afghan people .
he added that he could n't rule out abdullah 's inclusion in a unity government .
" i do n't think anything is being ruled out .
but i think what is more likely is once the decision has been made about the second round election , president karzai , or whoever is president , will want to unify the country , " brown said sunday .
abdullah abdullah told supporters in kabul on sunday that he was withdrawing from the november 7 contest to protest what he described as " misconduct " by the government and the country 's electoral commission .
he said he made the decision after his demands to avoid a repeat of massive first-round fraud were rejected by karzai .
" the decision … was not an easy one .
it was a decision that i have taken after wide-ranging consultations with the people of afghanistan , my supporters and influential leaders , " abdullah said in a lengthy address .
the former foreign minister went on to launch a scathing attack on karzai 's eight-year rule , dimming any hopes that the two rivals could yet agree on some form of power-sharing agreement .
" we have had eight years of lost opportunities because of the weakness of the government , " he said to applause from around 2,000 supporters .
demand to sack top officials following the widespread fraud in the first round on august 20 , abdullah demanded that karzai sack the head of the electoral commission , azizullah ludin , and suspend four ministers who campaigned for the incumbent .
the abdullah camp had set a deadline of saturday for karzai to yield to the demands , saying that he would not take part in a contest that would not be free and fair .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamid karzai reluctantly agreed to the run-off election however , his demands received short shrift , with electoral authorities saying ludin could only be dismissed by afghanistan 's supreme court , while karzai said abdullah had no right to interfere with ministerial positions .
" the election commission was not independent .
it was their job to ensure a credible election and we saw what happened , " abdullah said .
" the people were deprived of their democratic rights . "
" poll will be held " speaking on afghan television shortly before abdullah 's announcement , karzai 's campaign spokesman indicated that the election would still go ahead .
" the election law says that in the event of a second round , the candidates must participate , " the spokesman told a private television station .
" the conditions -lrb- set by abdullah -rrb- were impractical and had no basis in law .
these conditions were never received by us but only given to unama , " karzai 's spokesman added , referring to the un mission in afghanistan .

abdullah won just over 30 percent of the vote in the first round , prompting some observers to point out that it would have been a colossal feat for karzai 's lone remaining challenger to win the race .
afghanistan has been wracked by weeks of political uncertainty and security remains a major concern after a resurgent taliban vowed to disrupt the presidential run-off .

the september 4 strike on two fuel trucks in the northeastern kunduz province was the most deadly operation involving german troops since world war two .

german forces said the bombing targeted the fuel tankers as they were hijacked by taliban insurgents and represented a danger .
in the immediate aftermath , berlin said around 50 militants were killed in the attack but that there were no civilian casualties .

the september 4 strike on two fuel trucks in the northeastern kunduz province was the most deadly operation involving german troops since world war two .
the afghan government said the airstrike killed 69 taliban fighters and 30 civilians .
german forces said the bombing targeted the fuel tankers as they were hijacked by taliban insurgents and represented a danger .
in the immediate aftermath , berlin said around 50 militants were killed in the attack but that there were no civilian casualties .
witnesses , however , spoke of several civilian casualties , prompting critical reactions even from germany 's nato allies .
the report said that german authorities have put pressure on nato not to issue an outright condemnation of colonel georg klein because it could lead to legal problems .
this message was given to the nato commander in europe , admiral james stavridis , during a visit to berlin on october 15 .
backing for decision general wolfgang schneiderhan , general inspector of the german army , said on thursday that according to the report , colonel klein , had acted correctly in ordering the strike .

he said the exact death toll in the attack could no longer be determined , adding that the report cited a range of between 17 and 142 casualties .
" the investigation is still under review and no other comment can be made at the moment , " a defense ministry spokesman said when asked about the report in der spiegel .
some eu condemnation the attack , carried out by a us f-5 fighter jet , was condemned by several european foreign ministers .
germany has maintained it was necessary to protect its troops from a possible suicide attack by taliban fighters who had hijacked the trucks .
the spiegel report said colonel klein broke standard operating procedure by ordering air support on the grounds that his troops had come into contact with the enemy , even though international forces were nowhere near the tankers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has 4,200 troops troops in afghanistan the magazine also said klein refused to allow the aircraft to conduct a low-altitude sweep of the area before launching its payload , adding that overcast skies also raised doubts about the appropriateness of ordering a strike while relying on a single human information source and video alone .

samuel k. , an 88-year-old man who lives near bonn , had given descriptions of his time as a guard to investigators in 1969 , 1975 , 1980 and again this past june .
" it was clear to us that jews were killed there and were later burned , too .
we could smell it every day , " the magazine quotes k. as saying .
like demjanjuk , k. was a ukrainian soldier taken prisoner by the nazis .
german authorities say the men volunteered or were recruited to serve as guards in concentration camps .
demjanjuk allegedly served in sobibor and is accused of being an accessory to the murder of 27,900 people , mostly jews .
spiegel said that k. fully acknowledged serving as a guard in the belzec death camp .
but , unlike demjanjuk , who had emigrated to the united states , k. obtained german citizenship and has lived in germany for the last 60 years .
demjanjuk was extradited to germany in september .
his trial is scheduled to begin november 30 in munich. svs / afp / dpa editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 01.11.2009 germany " regrets " abdullah 's decision to withdraw from afghan run-off großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah pulled out after president karzai refused his demands for the run-off germany has lamented afghan opposition candidate abdullah abdullah 's withdrawal from the presidential run-off election .
the former foreign minister 's move could deepen the political crisis in the war-torn nation . germany 's new foreign minister , guido westerwelle , expressed disappointment with afghan opposition candidate abdullah abdullah 's withdrawal from the presidential run-off election .
in remarks at the national congress of young liberals on sunday in saarbruecken , westerwelle said the situation in afghanistan required a level-headed reaction and that now " the election process should be completed in accordance with law and order . "
meanwhile , british prime minister gordon brown said that abdullah had told him that his decision to pull out was " in the interests of national unity . "
brown said that afghan president hamid karzai had called him after abdullah 's announcement to say that he wanted to issue a " unity manifesto " for the afghan people .
he added that he could n't rule out abdullah 's inclusion in a unity government .
" i do n't think anything is being ruled out .
but i think what is more likely is once the decision has been made about the second round election , president karzai , or whoever is president , will want to unify the country , " brown said sunday .
abdullah abdullah told supporters in kabul on sunday that he was withdrawing from the november 7 contest to protest what he described as " misconduct " by the government and the country 's electoral commission .
he said he made the decision after his demands to avoid a repeat of massive first-round fraud were rejected by karzai .
" the decision … was not an easy one .
it was a decision that i have taken after wide-ranging consultations with the people of afghanistan , my supporters and influential leaders , " abdullah said in a lengthy address .
the former foreign minister went on to launch a scathing attack on karzai 's eight-year rule , dimming any hopes that the two rivals could yet agree on some form of power-sharing agreement .
" we have had eight years of lost opportunities because of the weakness of the government , " he said to applause from around 2,000 supporters .
demand to sack top officials following the widespread fraud in the first round on august 20 , abdullah demanded that karzai sack the head of the electoral commission , azizullah ludin , and suspend four ministers who campaigned for the incumbent .
the abdullah camp had set a deadline of saturday for karzai to yield to the demands , saying that he would not take part in a contest that would not be free and fair .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamid karzai reluctantly agreed to the run-off election however , his demands received short shrift , with electoral authorities saying ludin could only be dismissed by afghanistan 's supreme court , while karzai said abdullah had no right to interfere with ministerial positions .
" the election commission was not independent .
it was their job to ensure a credible election and we saw what happened , " abdullah said .
" the people were deprived of their democratic rights . "
" poll will be held " speaking on afghan television shortly before abdullah 's announcement , karzai 's campaign spokesman indicated that the election would still go ahead .
" the election law says that in the event of a second round , the candidates must participate , " the spokesman told a private television station .
" the conditions -lrb- set by abdullah -rrb- were impractical and had no basis in law .
these conditions were never received by us but only given to unama , " karzai 's spokesman added , referring to the un mission in afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai 's former foreign minister has become a formidable rival karzai 's share of the vote in the first round fell to 49.67 percent after a un-backed watchdog deemed around a quarter of all votes cast to be fraudulent .
insisting that the fraud had been overstated , karzai only agreed to a second round under extensive diplomatic pressure from washington .
abdullah won just over 30 percent of the vote in the first round , prompting some observers to point out that it would have been a colossal feat for karzai 's lone remaining challenger to win the race .
afghanistan has been wracked by weeks of political uncertainty and security remains a major concern after a resurgent taliban vowed to disrupt the presidential run-off .
ahead of sunday 's announcement , some analysts and diplomats had suggested that abdullah 's withdrawal from the contest - as part of a power-sharing deal in return for a key government post in the next government - would spare the country further political turmoil. svs / rb / afp / reuters editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

brown said that afghan president hamid karzai had called him after abdullah 's announcement to say that he wanted to issue a " unity manifesto " for the afghan people .
he added that he could n't rule out abdullah 's inclusion in a unity government .
" i do n't think anything is being ruled out .
but i think what is more likely is once the decision has been made about the second round election , president karzai , or whoever is president , will want to unify the country , " brown said sunday .
abdullah abdullah told supporters in kabul on sunday that he was withdrawing from the november 7 contest to protest what he described as " misconduct " by the government and the country 's electoral commission .
he said he made the decision after his demands to avoid a repeat of massive first-round fraud were rejected by karzai .
" the decision … was not an easy one .
it was a decision that i have taken after wide-ranging consultations with the people of afghanistan , my supporters and influential leaders , " abdullah said in a lengthy address .
the former foreign minister went on to launch a scathing attack on karzai 's eight-year rule , dimming any hopes that the two rivals could yet agree on some form of power-sharing agreement .
" we have had eight years of lost opportunities because of the weakness of the government , " he said to applause from around 2,000 supporters .
demand to sack top officials following the widespread fraud in the first round on august 20 , abdullah demanded that karzai sack the head of the electoral commission , azizullah ludin , and suspend four ministers who campaigned for the incumbent .
the abdullah camp had set a deadline of saturday for karzai to yield to the demands , saying that he would not take part in a contest that would not be free and fair .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamid karzai reluctantly agreed to the run-off election however , his demands received short shrift , with electoral authorities saying ludin could only be dismissed by afghanistan 's supreme court , while karzai said abdullah had no right to interfere with ministerial positions .
" the election commission was not independent .
it was their job to ensure a credible election and we saw what happened , " abdullah said .
" the people were deprived of their democratic rights . "
" poll will be held " speaking on afghan television shortly before abdullah 's announcement , karzai 's campaign spokesman indicated that the election would still go ahead .
" the election law says that in the event of a second round , the candidates must participate , " the spokesman told a private television station .
" the conditions -lrb- set by abdullah -rrb- were impractical and had no basis in law .
these conditions were never received by us but only given to unama , " karzai 's spokesman added , referring to the un mission in afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai 's former foreign minister has become a formidable rival karzai 's share of the vote in the first round fell to 49.67 percent after a un-backed watchdog deemed around a quarter of all votes cast to be fraudulent .
insisting that the fraud had been overstated , karzai only agreed to a second round under extensive diplomatic pressure from washington .
abdullah won just over 30 percent of the vote in the first round , prompting some observers to point out that it would have been a colossal feat for karzai 's lone remaining challenger to win the race .
afghanistan has been wracked by weeks of political uncertainty and security remains a major concern after a resurgent taliban vowed to disrupt the presidential run-off .
ahead of sunday 's announcement , some analysts and diplomats had suggested that abdullah 's withdrawal from the contest - as part of a power-sharing deal in return for a key government post in the next government - would spare the country further political turmoil. svs / rb / afp / reuters editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but stanislav tillich , the cdu premier of the eastern german state of saxony , has taken a swipe at the plan , insisting the drop in revenue would cancel out his state 's budgetary surplus and negate recent measures taken to balance saxony 's books .
" it can not be that this money is now simply used to cover for a reduction in taxes , " he told the german newsmagazine der spiegel .
" these tax cuts are irresponsible . "
tillich added that plans for how the government would compensate for the drop in revenue remained " very cloudy . "
peter mueller , who heads the cdu government of the small southwestern state of saarland , said he agreed with the federal government 's goal of putting more money into the hands of german tax payers , but said plans for achieving this through sweeping tax cuts were unfounded .

the former foreign minister 's move could deepen the political crisis in the war-torn nation . germany 's new foreign minister , guido westerwelle , expressed disappointment with afghan opposition candidate abdullah abdullah 's withdrawal from the presidential run-off election .
in remarks at the national congress of young liberals on sunday in saarbruecken , westerwelle said the situation in afghanistan required a level-headed reaction and that now " the election process should be completed in accordance with law and order . "
meanwhile , british prime minister gordon brown said that abdullah had told him that his decision to pull out was " in the interests of national unity . "
brown said that afghan president hamid karzai had called him after abdullah 's announcement to say that he wanted to issue a " unity manifesto " for the afghan people .
he added that he could n't rule out abdullah 's inclusion in a unity government .
" i do n't think anything is being ruled out .
but i think what is more likely is once the decision has been made about the second round election , president karzai , or whoever is president , will want to unify the country , " brown said sunday .
abdullah abdullah told supporters in kabul on sunday that he was withdrawing from the november 7 contest to protest what he described as " misconduct " by the government and the country 's electoral commission .
he said he made the decision after his demands to avoid a repeat of massive first-round fraud were rejected by karzai .
" the decision … was not an easy one .
it was a decision that i have taken after wide-ranging consultations with the people of afghanistan , my supporters and influential leaders , " abdullah said in a lengthy address .
the former foreign minister went on to launch a scathing attack on karzai 's eight-year rule , dimming any hopes that the two rivals could yet agree on some form of power-sharing agreement .
" we have had eight years of lost opportunities because of the weakness of the government , " he said to applause from around 2,000 supporters .
demand to sack top officials following the widespread fraud in the first round on august 20 , abdullah demanded that karzai sack the head of the electoral commission , azizullah ludin , and suspend four ministers who campaigned for the incumbent .
the abdullah camp had set a deadline of saturday for karzai to yield to the demands , saying that he would not take part in a contest that would not be free and fair .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamid karzai reluctantly agreed to the run-off election however , his demands received short shrift , with electoral authorities saying ludin could only be dismissed by afghanistan 's supreme court , while karzai said abdullah had no right to interfere with ministerial positions .
" the election commission was not independent .
it was their job to ensure a credible election and we saw what happened , " abdullah said .
" the people were deprived of their democratic rights . "
" poll will be held " speaking on afghan television shortly before abdullah 's announcement , karzai 's campaign spokesman indicated that the election would still go ahead .
" the election law says that in the event of a second round , the candidates must participate , " the spokesman told a private television station .
" the conditions -lrb- set by abdullah -rrb- were impractical and had no basis in law .
these conditions were never received by us but only given to unama , " karzai 's spokesman added , referring to the un mission in afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai 's former foreign minister has become a formidable rival karzai 's share of the vote in the first round fell to 49.67 percent after a un-backed watchdog deemed around a quarter of all votes cast to be fraudulent .
insisting that the fraud had been overstated , karzai only agreed to a second round under extensive diplomatic pressure from washington .
abdullah won just over 30 percent of the vote in the first round , prompting some observers to point out that it would have been a colossal feat for karzai 's lone remaining challenger to win the race .
afghanistan has been wracked by weeks of political uncertainty and security remains a major concern after a resurgent taliban vowed to disrupt the presidential run-off .
ahead of sunday 's announcement , some analysts and diplomats had suggested that abdullah 's withdrawal from the contest - as part of a power-sharing deal in return for a key government post in the next government - would spare the country further political turmoil. svs / rb / afp / reuters editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the former foreign minister 's move could deepen the political crisis in the war-torn nation . germany 's new foreign minister , guido westerwelle , expressed disappointment with afghan opposition candidate abdullah abdullah 's withdrawal from the presidential run-off election .
in remarks at the national congress of young liberals on sunday in saarbruecken , westerwelle said the situation in afghanistan required a level-headed reaction and that now " the election process should be completed in accordance with law and order . "
meanwhile , british prime minister gordon brown said that abdullah had told him that his decision to pull out was " in the interests of national unity . "
brown said that afghan president hamid karzai had called him after abdullah 's announcement to say that he wanted to issue a " unity manifesto " for the afghan people .
he added that he could n't rule out abdullah 's inclusion in a unity government .
" i do n't think anything is being ruled out .
but i think what is more likely is once the decision has been made about the second round election , president karzai , or whoever is president , will want to unify the country , " brown said sunday .
abdullah abdullah told supporters in kabul on sunday that he was withdrawing from the november 7 contest to protest what he described as " misconduct " by the government and the country 's electoral commission .
he said he made the decision after his demands to avoid a repeat of massive first-round fraud were rejected by karzai .
" the decision … was not an easy one .
it was a decision that i have taken after wide-ranging consultations with the people of afghanistan , my supporters and influential leaders , " abdullah said in a lengthy address .
the former foreign minister went on to launch a scathing attack on karzai 's eight-year rule , dimming any hopes that the two rivals could yet agree on some form of power-sharing agreement .
" we have had eight years of lost opportunities because of the weakness of the government , " he said to applause from around 2,000 supporters .
demand to sack top officials following the widespread fraud in the first round on august 20 , abdullah demanded that karzai sack the head of the electoral commission , azizullah ludin , and suspend four ministers who campaigned for the incumbent .
the abdullah camp had set a deadline of saturday for karzai to yield to the demands , saying that he would not take part in a contest that would not be free and fair .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamid karzai reluctantly agreed to the run-off election however , his demands received short shrift , with electoral authorities saying ludin could only be dismissed by afghanistan 's supreme court , while karzai said abdullah had no right to interfere with ministerial positions .
" the election commission was not independent .
it was their job to ensure a credible election and we saw what happened , " abdullah said .
" the people were deprived of their democratic rights . "
" poll will be held " speaking on afghan television shortly before abdullah 's announcement , karzai 's campaign spokesman indicated that the election would still go ahead .
" the election law says that in the event of a second round , the candidates must participate , " the spokesman told a private television station .
" the conditions -lrb- set by abdullah -rrb- were impractical and had no basis in law .
these conditions were never received by us but only given to unama , " karzai 's spokesman added , referring to the un mission in afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai 's former foreign minister has become a formidable rival karzai 's share of the vote in the first round fell to 49.67 percent after a un-backed watchdog deemed around a quarter of all votes cast to be fraudulent .
insisting that the fraud had been overstated , karzai only agreed to a second round under extensive diplomatic pressure from washington .
abdullah won just over 30 percent of the vote in the first round , prompting some observers to point out that it would have been a colossal feat for karzai 's lone remaining challenger to win the race .
afghanistan has been wracked by weeks of political uncertainty and security remains a major concern after a resurgent taliban vowed to disrupt the presidential run-off .
ahead of sunday 's announcement , some analysts and diplomats had suggested that abdullah 's withdrawal from the contest - as part of a power-sharing deal in return for a key government post in the next government - would spare the country further political turmoil. svs / rb / afp / reuters editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the september 4 strike on two fuel trucks in the northeastern kunduz province was the most deadly operation involving german troops since world war two .
the afghan government said the airstrike killed 69 taliban fighters and 30 civilians .
german forces said the bombing targeted the fuel tankers as they were hijacked by taliban insurgents and represented a danger .
in the immediate aftermath , berlin said around 50 militants were killed in the attack but that there were no civilian casualties .
witnesses , however , spoke of several civilian casualties , prompting critical reactions even from germany 's nato allies .
the report said that german authorities have put pressure on nato not to issue an outright condemnation of colonel georg klein because it could lead to legal problems .
this message was given to the nato commander in europe , admiral james stavridis , during a visit to berlin on october 15 .
backing for decision general wolfgang schneiderhan , general inspector of the german army , said on thursday that according to the report , colonel klein , had acted correctly in ordering the strike .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghans are becoming increasingly angry over rising civilian casualties " in light of the results of the report , i have no reason to doubt that german soldiers acted in the correct military fashion , given their mandate from the united nations and the difficult operational situation , " schneiderhan said .
he said the exact death toll in the attack could no longer be determined , adding that the report cited a range of between 17 and 142 casualties .
" the investigation is still under review and no other comment can be made at the moment , " a defense ministry spokesman said when asked about the report in der spiegel .
some eu condemnation the attack , carried out by a us f-5 fighter jet , was condemned by several european foreign ministers .
germany has maintained it was necessary to protect its troops from a possible suicide attack by taliban fighters who had hijacked the trucks .
the spiegel report said colonel klein broke standard operating procedure by ordering air support on the grounds that his troops had come into contact with the enemy , even though international forces were nowhere near the tankers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has 4,200 troops troops in afghanistan the magazine also said klein refused to allow the aircraft to conduct a low-altitude sweep of the area before launching its payload , adding that overcast skies also raised doubts about the appropriateness of ordering a strike while relying on a single human information source and video alone .
the report cited a source familiar with the nato report as saying it also addressed positive sides of klein 's leadership and that it could be used to either condemn or excuse him .
germans remain highly skeptical of military operations more than 60 years after the defeat of the nazis .
it was only a decade ago that german troops participated in their first foreign combat mission since the war .
opinion polls indicate a majority of germans want the over 4,000 german troops deployed in afghanistan as part of the six-year-old nato mission to come home. rb / afp / reuters editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 01.11.2009 report : german colonel made errors in afghan strike großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airstrike was ordered by colonel klein and carried out by us fighter jets a german magazine is reporting that a nato probe into a deadly airstrike in afghanistan that caused outrage in the region is more critical of the german commander who ordered it than the german army has admitted . the newsmagazine der spiegel said in an early release of its edition to be published on monday that a nato investigation into the september airstrike that killed dozens of afghan civilians showed the german commander who ordered it broke military procedure .
the september 4 strike on two fuel trucks in the northeastern kunduz province was the most deadly operation involving german troops since world war two .
the afghan government said the airstrike killed 69 taliban fighters and 30 civilians .
german forces said the bombing targeted the fuel tankers as they were hijacked by taliban insurgents and represented a danger .
in the immediate aftermath , berlin said around 50 militants were killed in the attack but that there were no civilian casualties .
witnesses , however , spoke of several civilian casualties , prompting critical reactions even from germany 's nato allies .
the report said that german authorities have put pressure on nato not to issue an outright condemnation of colonel georg klein because it could lead to legal problems .
this message was given to the nato commander in europe , admiral james stavridis , during a visit to berlin on october 15 .
backing for decision general wolfgang schneiderhan , general inspector of the german army , said on thursday that according to the report , colonel klein , had acted correctly in ordering the strike .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghans are becoming increasingly angry over rising civilian casualties " in light of the results of the report , i have no reason to doubt that german soldiers acted in the correct military fashion , given their mandate from the united nations and the difficult operational situation , " schneiderhan said .
he said the exact death toll in the attack could no longer be determined , adding that the report cited a range of between 17 and 142 casualties .
" the investigation is still under review and no other comment can be made at the moment , " a defense ministry spokesman said when asked about the report in der spiegel .
some eu condemnation the attack , carried out by a us f-5 fighter jet , was condemned by several european foreign ministers .
germany has maintained it was necessary to protect its troops from a possible suicide attack by taliban fighters who had hijacked the trucks .
the spiegel report said colonel klein broke standard operating procedure by ordering air support on the grounds that his troops had come into contact with the enemy , even though international forces were nowhere near the tankers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has 4,200 troops troops in afghanistan the magazine also said klein refused to allow the aircraft to conduct a low-altitude sweep of the area before launching its payload , adding that overcast skies also raised doubts about the appropriateness of ordering a strike while relying on a single human information source and video alone .
the report cited a source familiar with the nato report as saying it also addressed positive sides of klein 's leadership and that it could be used to either condemn or excuse him .
germans remain highly skeptical of military operations more than 60 years after the defeat of the nazis .
it was only a decade ago that german troops participated in their first foreign combat mission since the war .
opinion polls indicate a majority of germans want the over 4,000 german troops deployed in afghanistan as part of the six-year-old nato mission to come home. rb / afp / reuters editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the former foreign minister 's move could deepen the political crisis in the war-torn nation . germany 's new foreign minister , guido westerwelle , expressed disappointment with afghan opposition candidate abdullah abdullah 's withdrawal from the presidential run-off election .
in remarks at the national congress of young liberals on sunday in saarbruecken , westerwelle said the situation in afghanistan required a level-headed reaction and that now " the election process should be completed in accordance with law and order . "
meanwhile , british prime minister gordon brown said that abdullah had told him that his decision to pull out was " in the interests of national unity . "
brown said that afghan president hamid karzai had called him after abdullah 's announcement to say that he wanted to issue a " unity manifesto " for the afghan people .
he added that he could n't rule out abdullah 's inclusion in a unity government .
" i do n't think anything is being ruled out .
but i think what is more likely is once the decision has been made about the second round election , president karzai , or whoever is president , will want to unify the country , " brown said sunday .
abdullah abdullah told supporters in kabul on sunday that he was withdrawing from the november 7 contest to protest what he described as " misconduct " by the government and the country 's electoral commission .
he said he made the decision after his demands to avoid a repeat of massive first-round fraud were rejected by karzai .
" the decision … was not an easy one .
it was a decision that i have taken after wide-ranging consultations with the people of afghanistan , my supporters and influential leaders , " abdullah said in a lengthy address .
the former foreign minister went on to launch a scathing attack on karzai 's eight-year rule , dimming any hopes that the two rivals could yet agree on some form of power-sharing agreement .
" we have had eight years of lost opportunities because of the weakness of the government , " he said to applause from around 2,000 supporters .
demand to sack top officials following the widespread fraud in the first round on august 20 , abdullah demanded that karzai sack the head of the electoral commission , azizullah ludin , and suspend four ministers who campaigned for the incumbent .
the abdullah camp had set a deadline of saturday for karzai to yield to the demands , saying that he would not take part in a contest that would not be free and fair .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamid karzai reluctantly agreed to the run-off election however , his demands received short shrift , with electoral authorities saying ludin could only be dismissed by afghanistan 's supreme court , while karzai said abdullah had no right to interfere with ministerial positions .
" the election commission was not independent .
it was their job to ensure a credible election and we saw what happened , " abdullah said .
" the people were deprived of their democratic rights . "
" poll will be held " speaking on afghan television shortly before abdullah 's announcement , karzai 's campaign spokesman indicated that the election would still go ahead .
" the election law says that in the event of a second round , the candidates must participate , " the spokesman told a private television station .
" the conditions -lrb- set by abdullah -rrb- were impractical and had no basis in law .
these conditions were never received by us but only given to unama , " karzai 's spokesman added , referring to the un mission in afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai 's former foreign minister has become a formidable rival karzai 's share of the vote in the first round fell to 49.67 percent after a un-backed watchdog deemed around a quarter of all votes cast to be fraudulent .
insisting that the fraud had been overstated , karzai only agreed to a second round under extensive diplomatic pressure from washington .
abdullah won just over 30 percent of the vote in the first round , prompting some observers to point out that it would have been a colossal feat for karzai 's lone remaining challenger to win the race .
afghanistan has been wracked by weeks of political uncertainty and security remains a major concern after a resurgent taliban vowed to disrupt the presidential run-off .
ahead of sunday 's announcement , some analysts and diplomats had suggested that abdullah 's withdrawal from the contest - as part of a power-sharing deal in return for a key government post in the next government - would spare the country further political turmoil. svs / rb / afp / reuters editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the former foreign minister 's move could deepen the political crisis in the war-torn nation . germany 's new foreign minister , guido westerwelle , expressed disappointment with afghan opposition candidate abdullah abdullah 's withdrawal from the presidential run-off election .
in remarks at the national congress of young liberals on sunday in saarbruecken , westerwelle said the situation in afghanistan required a level-headed reaction and that now " the election process should be completed in accordance with law and order . "
meanwhile , british prime minister gordon brown said that abdullah had told him that his decision to pull out was " in the interests of national unity . "
brown said that afghan president hamid karzai had called him after abdullah 's announcement to say that he wanted to issue a " unity manifesto " for the afghan people .
he added that he could n't rule out abdullah 's inclusion in a unity government .

samuel k. , an 88-year-old man who lives near bonn , had given descriptions of his time as a guard to investigators in 1969 , 1975 , 1980 and again this past june .
" it was clear to us that jews were killed there and were later burned , too .
we could smell it every day , " the magazine quotes k. as saying .
like demjanjuk , k. was a ukrainian soldier taken prisoner by the nazis .
german authorities say the men volunteered or were recruited to serve as guards in concentration camps .
demjanjuk allegedly served in sobibor and is accused of being an accessory to the murder of 27,900 people , mostly jews .
spiegel said that k. fully acknowledged serving as a guard in the belzec death camp .
but , unlike demjanjuk , who had emigrated to the united states , k. obtained german citizenship and has lived in germany for the last 60 years .
demjanjuk was extradited to germany in september .
his trial is scheduled to begin november 30 in munich. svs / afp / dpa editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the september 4 strike on two fuel trucks in the northeastern kunduz province was the most deadly operation involving german troops since world war two .
the afghan government said the airstrike killed 69 taliban fighters and 30 civilians .
german forces said the bombing targeted the fuel tankers as they were hijacked by taliban insurgents and represented a danger .
in the immediate aftermath , berlin said around 50 militants were killed in the attack but that there were no civilian casualties .
witnesses , however , spoke of several civilian casualties , prompting critical reactions even from germany 's nato allies .
the report said that german authorities have put pressure on nato not to issue an outright condemnation of colonel georg klein because it could lead to legal problems .
this message was given to the nato commander in europe , admiral james stavridis , during a visit to berlin on october 15 .
backing for decision general wolfgang schneiderhan , general inspector of the german army , said on thursday that according to the report , colonel klein , had acted correctly in ordering the strike .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghans are becoming increasingly angry over rising civilian casualties " in light of the results of the report , i have no reason to doubt that german soldiers acted in the correct military fashion , given their mandate from the united nations and the difficult operational situation , " schneiderhan said .
he said the exact death toll in the attack could no longer be determined , adding that the report cited a range of between 17 and 142 casualties .
" the investigation is still under review and no other comment can be made at the moment , " a defense ministry spokesman said when asked about the report in der spiegel .
some eu condemnation the attack , carried out by a us f-5 fighter jet , was condemned by several european foreign ministers .
germany has maintained it was necessary to protect its troops from a possible suicide attack by taliban fighters who had hijacked the trucks .
the spiegel report said colonel klein broke standard operating procedure by ordering air support on the grounds that his troops had come into contact with the enemy , even though international forces were nowhere near the tankers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has 4,200 troops troops in afghanistan the magazine also said klein refused to allow the aircraft to conduct a low-altitude sweep of the area before launching its payload , adding that overcast skies also raised doubts about the appropriateness of ordering a strike while relying on a single human information source and video alone .
the report cited a source familiar with the nato report as saying it also addressed positive sides of klein 's leadership and that it could be used to either condemn or excuse him .
germans remain highly skeptical of military operations more than 60 years after the defeat of the nazis .
it was only a decade ago that german troops participated in their first foreign combat mission since the war .
opinion polls indicate a majority of germans want the over 4,000 german troops deployed in afghanistan as part of the six-year-old nato mission to come home. rb / afp / reuters editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in remarks at the national congress of young liberals on sunday in saarbruecken , westerwelle said the situation in afghanistan required a level-headed reaction and that now " the election process should be completed in accordance with law and order . "
meanwhile , british prime minister gordon brown said that abdullah had told him that his decision to pull out was " in the interests of national unity . "
brown said that afghan president hamid karzai had called him after abdullah 's announcement to say that he wanted to issue a " unity manifesto " for the afghan people .
he added that he could n't rule out abdullah 's inclusion in a unity government .
" i do n't think anything is being ruled out .
but i think what is more likely is once the decision has been made about the second round election , president karzai , or whoever is president , will want to unify the country , " brown said sunday .
abdullah abdullah told supporters in kabul on sunday that he was withdrawing from the november 7 contest to protest what he described as " misconduct " by the government and the country 's electoral commission .
he said he made the decision after his demands to avoid a repeat of massive first-round fraud were rejected by karzai .
" the decision … was not an easy one .
it was a decision that i have taken after wide-ranging consultations with the people of afghanistan , my supporters and influential leaders , " abdullah said in a lengthy address .
the former foreign minister went on to launch a scathing attack on karzai 's eight-year rule , dimming any hopes that the two rivals could yet agree on some form of power-sharing agreement .
" we have had eight years of lost opportunities because of the weakness of the government , " he said to applause from around 2,000 supporters .
demand to sack top officials following the widespread fraud in the first round on august 20 , abdullah demanded that karzai sack the head of the electoral commission , azizullah ludin , and suspend four ministers who campaigned for the incumbent .
the abdullah camp had set a deadline of saturday for karzai to yield to the demands , saying that he would not take part in a contest that would not be free and fair .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamid karzai reluctantly agreed to the run-off election however , his demands received short shrift , with electoral authorities saying ludin could only be dismissed by afghanistan 's supreme court , while karzai said abdullah had no right to interfere with ministerial positions .
" the election commission was not independent .
it was their job to ensure a credible election and we saw what happened , " abdullah said .
" the people were deprived of their democratic rights . "
" poll will be held " speaking on afghan television shortly before abdullah 's announcement , karzai 's campaign spokesman indicated that the election would still go ahead .
" the election law says that in the event of a second round , the candidates must participate , " the spokesman told a private television station .
" the conditions -lrb- set by abdullah -rrb- were impractical and had no basis in law .
these conditions were never received by us but only given to unama , " karzai 's spokesman added , referring to the un mission in afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai 's former foreign minister has become a formidable rival karzai 's share of the vote in the first round fell to 49.67 percent after a un-backed watchdog deemed around a quarter of all votes cast to be fraudulent .
insisting that the fraud had been overstated , karzai only agreed to a second round under extensive diplomatic pressure from washington .
abdullah won just over 30 percent of the vote in the first round , prompting some observers to point out that it would have been a colossal feat for karzai 's lone remaining challenger to win the race .
afghanistan has been wracked by weeks of political uncertainty and security remains a major concern after a resurgent taliban vowed to disrupt the presidential run-off .
ahead of sunday 's announcement , some analysts and diplomats had suggested that abdullah 's withdrawal from the contest - as part of a power-sharing deal in return for a key government post in the next government - would spare the country further political turmoil. svs / rb / afp / reuters editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the september 4 strike on two fuel trucks in the northeastern kunduz province was the most deadly operation involving german troops since world war two .
the afghan government said the airstrike killed 69 taliban fighters and 30 civilians .
german forces said the bombing targeted the fuel tankers as they were hijacked by taliban insurgents and represented a danger .
in the immediate aftermath , berlin said around 50 militants were killed in the attack but that there were no civilian casualties .
witnesses , however , spoke of several civilian casualties , prompting critical reactions even from germany 's nato allies .
the report said that german authorities have put pressure on nato not to issue an outright condemnation of colonel georg klein because it could lead to legal problems .
this message was given to the nato commander in europe , admiral james stavridis , during a visit to berlin on october 15 .

he said the exact death toll in the attack could no longer be determined , adding that the report cited a range of between 17 and 142 casualties .
" the investigation is still under review and no other comment can be made at the moment , " a defense ministry spokesman said when asked about the report in der spiegel .
some eu condemnation the attack , carried out by a us f-5 fighter jet , was condemned by several european foreign ministers .
germany has maintained it was necessary to protect its troops from a possible suicide attack by taliban fighters who had hijacked the trucks .

the policy blueprint will see income taxes slashed by around 24 billion euros -lrb- $ 36 billion -rrb- , with a focus on reducing the tax burden on families with children and reforms to corporate and inheritance taxes .
but stanislav tillich , the cdu premier of the eastern german state of saxony , has taken a swipe at the plan , insisting the drop in revenue would cancel out his state 's budgetary surplus and negate recent measures taken to balance saxony 's books .
" it can not be that this money is now simply used to cover for a reduction in taxes , " he told the german newsmagazine der spiegel .
" these tax cuts are irresponsible . "
tillich added that plans for how the government would compensate for the drop in revenue remained " very cloudy . "
peter mueller , who heads the cdu government of the small southwestern state of saarland , said he agreed with the federal government 's goal of putting more money into the hands of german tax payers , but said plans for achieving this through sweeping tax cuts were unfounded .
" i believe we should stick with the proven linear-progressive tax plan , " he said .
court case ?
the state premiers said the tax cuts could lead to revenue shortfalls amounting to billions of euros , and threaten upgrades to kindergartens , schools and universities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 24-billion-euro tax cut would take money from schools , critics say saxony-anhalt premier wolfgang boehmer had previously threatened to bring a case before the country 's constitutional court if the federal government pushed ahead with its tax plans .
the new secretary-general of the cdu , hermann groehe , called on tillich and mueller to stand by their federal partners , highlighting that several state premiers who were involved in the coalition negotiations had given their full support to the tax cut plans .
" the party 's various bodies have unanimously approved the coalition deal , " he told german daily hamburger abendblatt . dfm / reuters / ap editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

samuel k. , an 88-year-old man who lives near bonn , had given descriptions of his time as a guard to investigators in 1969 , 1975 , 1980 and again this past june .
" it was clear to us that jews were killed there and were later burned , too .
we could smell it every day , " the magazine quotes k. as saying .
like demjanjuk , k. was a ukrainian soldier taken prisoner by the nazis .
german authorities say the men volunteered or were recruited to serve as guards in concentration camps .
demjanjuk allegedly served in sobibor and is accused of being an accessory to the murder of 27,900 people , mostly jews .
spiegel said that k. fully acknowledged serving as a guard in the belzec death camp .
but , unlike demjanjuk , who had emigrated to the united states , k. obtained german citizenship and has lived in germany for the last 60 years .
demjanjuk was extradited to germany in september .
his trial is scheduled to begin november 30 in munich. svs / afp / dpa editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de interior affairs -pipe- 01.11.2009 tensions surface between states and berlin over tax cut plans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tillich says the tax cuts are irresponsible tensions between germany ’ s federal and state governments are rising after two christian democrat state leaders heavily criticized plans by their own party at the national level to deal out hefty tax cuts . the tax breaks form the centerpiece of a coalition deal agreed between chancellor angela merkel 's conservative union bloc - the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- - and their new federal partners , the pro-business free democrats , following national elections last month .
the policy blueprint will see income taxes slashed by around 24 billion euros -lrb- $ 36 billion -rrb- , with a focus on reducing the tax burden on families with children and reforms to corporate and inheritance taxes .
but stanislav tillich , the cdu premier of the eastern german state of saxony , has taken a swipe at the plan , insisting the drop in revenue would cancel out his state 's budgetary surplus and negate recent measures taken to balance saxony 's books .
" it can not be that this money is now simply used to cover for a reduction in taxes , " he told the german newsmagazine der spiegel .
" these tax cuts are irresponsible . "
tillich added that plans for how the government would compensate for the drop in revenue remained " very cloudy . "
peter mueller , who heads the cdu government of the small southwestern state of saarland , said he agreed with the federal government 's goal of putting more money into the hands of german tax payers , but said plans for achieving this through sweeping tax cuts were unfounded .
" i believe we should stick with the proven linear-progressive tax plan , " he said .
court case ?
the state premiers said the tax cuts could lead to revenue shortfalls amounting to billions of euros , and threaten upgrades to kindergartens , schools and universities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 24-billion-euro tax cut would take money from schools , critics say saxony-anhalt premier wolfgang boehmer had previously threatened to bring a case before the country 's constitutional court if the federal government pushed ahead with its tax plans .
the new secretary-general of the cdu , hermann groehe , called on tillich and mueller to stand by their federal partners , highlighting that several state premiers who were involved in the coalition negotiations had given their full support to the tax cut plans .
" the party 's various bodies have unanimously approved the coalition deal , " he told german daily hamburger abendblatt . dfm / reuters / ap editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's a great honor for the chancellor , but equally great are the expectations of the obama administration . when chancellor merkel steps up to the lectern on tuesday inside the capitol building in washington , she will have achieved something that only one german post-war chancellor before her had done : to give an address before members of congress .
and actually , the speech which konrad adenauer , the first chancellor of the new federal republic , gave to congress on may 28 , 1957 was at a reception given by the house of representatives , not an address to a joint session of congress .
so according to official protocol , chancellor merkel 's speech on capitol hill is a first for a german head of government .
the fact that the recently re-elected chancellor is only the second foreign dignitary to speak before congress since president barack obama took office underlines the symbolic importance of the event .
the other leader granted this privilege was britain 's prime minister gordon brown .
" i think it is a big deal , " john hulsman , an american foreign policy expert based in germany , told deutsche welle .
" the us is a republic and a relatively new country , that does n't have a lot of symbolism .
to speak to a joint session of congress is about as big an honor as can be bestowed on a foreign leader . "
as nancy pelosi , speaker of the house of representatives and the official host of angela merkel said , the german chancellor was invited to commemorate the upcoming 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall .
respected leader and although not officially stated , merkel was also asked to speak to congress because she is highly respected in washington .
under president obama , merkel 's stature in the us capital has only increased - especially when compared to other european heads of governments .
" mrs. merkel as german chancellor is held in high esteem ; her competence and her standing is internationally recognized , " joerg himmelreich , senior trans-atlantic fellow at the german marshall fund in berlin , told deutsche welle .
" germany is definitely the european power washington needs to work with in order to conduct trans-atlantic relations and carry out the multilateral approach that - in contrast to his predecessor - is a goal for the obama administration , " he added .
while the future of german-american relations will play a major role in merkel 's address before congress , history will also be present .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gordon brown is the only other foreign leader invited to speak before congress under president obama " she will probably , and this is very important as a message to the american people as a whole , express her gratitude for the invaluable contribution the first president bush made to the fall of the berlin wall and therefore to german unity , " said himmelreich .
the chancellor is also expected to highlight the importance of german-american relations as a pillar of foreign policy for the new german government .
in addition , merkel will probably talk about international efforts in combating climate change , a sensitive topic to which president obama is more open than congress .
with a giant american flag draped behind her , framed by us vice president joe biden and house speaker nancy pelosi , merkel 's speech before congress will be saturated in symbolism .
but even more important than the official address itself could be the chancellor 's planned meeting with the president .
demand for discussions even though obama and merkel will probably only get together for either a lunch or a dinner , this could be the moment when important matters are addressed .
" i think that 's just the right amount of time to make specific , concrete demands off the record , " said hulsman .
" any longer you are going to get into bigger things , any shorter and it 's sound bites . "
there is an eagerness in the us to finally engage in serious talks with berlin .
the german election campaign put many important topics on ice until a new government was elected .
" washington and the new us administration gladly granted merkel this grace period , " said himmelreich .
" but now president obama would like to know what the new german government thinks about transatlantic relations and obama himself will surely also express his ideas and wishes . " his colleague hulsman put it more bluntly , calling it " put up or shut up time . "
after waiting patiently for the outcome of the german election , the obama administration now wants to know what to expect from berlin .
" beneath all the symbolism and niceness there is an insistent push that now it 's time for germany to step up to the plate , " he said .
afghan strategy high on the agenda for washington is the question of what the new german government wants to contribute in the future to the afghanistan mission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's contribution to afghanistan will be on the agenda the internal debate in the white house about the request by the us commander in afghanistan for additional troops is in the final stages and the experts expect that obama will let the chancellor in on his thinking about his upcoming decision .
merkel could be asked about how germany will provide concrete help in afghanistan if it does n't want to send more troops .
other topics such as iran , climate change and the economic crisis could then be discussed in a similar fashion - openly and not shying away from possible disagreements .
this kind of detailed and frank discussion with germany about foreign policy has been missing , noted hulsman .
instead of concrete policy solutions discussions often focused on grand strategic disagreements between the two countries .
policy solutions now when practical policies are key , obama ca n't find a more suitable partner than merkel , according to hulsman .
" mrs. merkel is not a great orator , she 's not flashy , but she 's incredibly effective in meetings , " he said , adding that with her grasp of policy detail she can not only hold her own against obama , but also put pressure on the president himself .
" she 's intellectually capable of having this nuts-and-bolts policy discussion that 's so desperately needed , " he said .
if the planned meeting between merkel and obama does in fact signal the start of a new phase of open and honest exchange between washington and berlin , than merkel 's trip will have been not only symbolic , but also a sustainable success .

merkel could be asked about how germany will provide concrete help in afghanistan if it does n't want to send more troops .
other topics such as iran , climate change and the economic crisis could then be discussed in a similar fashion - openly and not shying away from possible disagreements .
this kind of detailed and frank discussion with germany about foreign policy has been missing , noted hulsman .

" mrs. merkel is not a great orator , she 's not flashy , but she 's incredibly effective in meetings , " he said , adding that with her grasp of policy detail she can not only hold her own against obama , but also put pressure on the president himself .
" she 's intellectually capable of having this nuts-and-bolts policy discussion that 's so desperately needed , " he said .
if the planned meeting between merkel and obama does in fact signal the start of a new phase of open and honest exchange between washington and berlin , than merkel 's trip will have been not only symbolic , but also a sustainable success .

it 's a great honor for the chancellor , but equally great are the expectations of the obama administration . when chancellor merkel steps up to the lectern on tuesday inside the capitol building in washington , she will have achieved something that only one german post-war chancellor before her had done : to give an address before members of congress .
and actually , the speech which konrad adenauer , the first chancellor of the new federal republic , gave to congress on may 28 , 1957 was at a reception given by the house of representatives , not an address to a joint session of congress .
so according to official protocol , chancellor merkel 's speech on capitol hill is a first for a german head of government .
the fact that the recently re-elected chancellor is only the second foreign dignitary to speak before congress since president barack obama took office underlines the symbolic importance of the event .
the other leader granted this privilege was britain 's prime minister gordon brown .
" i think it is a big deal , " john hulsman , an american foreign policy expert based in germany , told deutsche welle .
" the us is a republic and a relatively new country , that does n't have a lot of symbolism .
to speak to a joint session of congress is about as big an honor as can be bestowed on a foreign leader . "
as nancy pelosi , speaker of the house of representatives and the official host of angela merkel said , the german chancellor was invited to commemorate the upcoming 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall .
respected leader and although not officially stated , merkel was also asked to speak to congress because she is highly respected in washington .
under president obama , merkel 's stature in the us capital has only increased - especially when compared to other european heads of governments .
" mrs. merkel as german chancellor is held in high esteem ; her competence and her standing is internationally recognized , " joerg himmelreich , senior trans-atlantic fellow at the german marshall fund in berlin , told deutsche welle .
" germany is definitely the european power washington needs to work with in order to conduct trans-atlantic relations and carry out the multilateral approach that - in contrast to his predecessor - is a goal for the obama administration , " he added .
while the future of german-american relations will play a major role in merkel 's address before congress , history will also be present .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gordon brown is the only other foreign leader invited to speak before congress under president obama " she will probably , and this is very important as a message to the american people as a whole , express her gratitude for the invaluable contribution the first president bush made to the fall of the berlin wall and therefore to german unity , " said himmelreich .

it 's a great honor for the chancellor , but equally great are the expectations of the obama administration . when chancellor merkel steps up to the lectern on tuesday inside the capitol building in washington , she will have achieved something that only one german post-war chancellor before her had done : to give an address before members of congress .
and actually , the speech which konrad adenauer , the first chancellor of the new federal republic , gave to congress on may 28 , 1957 was at a reception given by the house of representatives , not an address to a joint session of congress .
so according to official protocol , chancellor merkel 's speech on capitol hill is a first for a german head of government .
the fact that the recently re-elected chancellor is only the second foreign dignitary to speak before congress since president barack obama took office underlines the symbolic importance of the event .
the other leader granted this privilege was britain 's prime minister gordon brown .
" i think it is a big deal , " john hulsman , an american foreign policy expert based in germany , told deutsche welle .
" the us is a republic and a relatively new country , that does n't have a lot of symbolism .
to speak to a joint session of congress is about as big an honor as can be bestowed on a foreign leader . "
as nancy pelosi , speaker of the house of representatives and the official host of angela merkel said , the german chancellor was invited to commemorate the upcoming 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall .
respected leader and although not officially stated , merkel was also asked to speak to congress because she is highly respected in washington .
under president obama , merkel 's stature in the us capital has only increased - especially when compared to other european heads of governments .
" mrs. merkel as german chancellor is held in high esteem ; her competence and her standing is internationally recognized , " joerg himmelreich , senior trans-atlantic fellow at the german marshall fund in berlin , told deutsche welle .
" germany is definitely the european power washington needs to work with in order to conduct trans-atlantic relations and carry out the multilateral approach that - in contrast to his predecessor - is a goal for the obama administration , " he added .
while the future of german-american relations will play a major role in merkel 's address before congress , history will also be present .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gordon brown is the only other foreign leader invited to speak before congress under president obama " she will probably , and this is very important as a message to the american people as a whole , express her gratitude for the invaluable contribution the first president bush made to the fall of the berlin wall and therefore to german unity , " said himmelreich .
the chancellor is also expected to highlight the importance of german-american relations as a pillar of foreign policy for the new german government .
in addition , merkel will probably talk about international efforts in combating climate change , a sensitive topic to which president obama is more open than congress .
with a giant american flag draped behind her , framed by us vice president joe biden and house speaker nancy pelosi , merkel 's speech before congress will be saturated in symbolism .
but even more important than the official address itself could be the chancellor 's planned meeting with the president .
demand for discussions even though obama and merkel will probably only get together for either a lunch or a dinner , this could be the moment when important matters are addressed .
" i think that 's just the right amount of time to make specific , concrete demands off the record , " said hulsman .
" any longer you are going to get into bigger things , any shorter and it 's sound bites . "
there is an eagerness in the us to finally engage in serious talks with berlin .
the german election campaign put many important topics on ice until a new government was elected .
" washington and the new us administration gladly granted merkel this grace period , " said himmelreich .
" but now president obama would like to know what the new german government thinks about transatlantic relations and obama himself will surely also express his ideas and wishes . " his colleague hulsman put it more bluntly , calling it " put up or shut up time . "
after waiting patiently for the outcome of the german election , the obama administration now wants to know what to expect from berlin .
" beneath all the symbolism and niceness there is an insistent push that now it 's time for germany to step up to the plate , " he said .
afghan strategy high on the agenda for washington is the question of what the new german government wants to contribute in the future to the afghanistan mission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's contribution to afghanistan will be on the agenda the internal debate in the white house about the request by the us commander in afghanistan for additional troops is in the final stages and the experts expect that obama will let the chancellor in on his thinking about his upcoming decision .
merkel could be asked about how germany will provide concrete help in afghanistan if it does n't want to send more troops .
other topics such as iran , climate change and the economic crisis could then be discussed in a similar fashion - openly and not shying away from possible disagreements .
this kind of detailed and frank discussion with germany about foreign policy has been missing , noted hulsman .
instead of concrete policy solutions discussions often focused on grand strategic disagreements between the two countries .
policy solutions now when practical policies are key , obama ca n't find a more suitable partner than merkel , according to hulsman .
" mrs. merkel is not a great orator , she 's not flashy , but she 's incredibly effective in meetings , " he said , adding that with her grasp of policy detail she can not only hold her own against obama , but also put pressure on the president himself .
" she 's intellectually capable of having this nuts-and-bolts policy discussion that 's so desperately needed , " he said .
if the planned meeting between merkel and obama does in fact signal the start of a new phase of open and honest exchange between washington and berlin , than merkel 's trip will have been not only symbolic , but also a sustainable success .

the chancellor is also expected to highlight the importance of german-american relations as a pillar of foreign policy for the new german government .
in addition , merkel will probably talk about international efforts in combating climate change , a sensitive topic to which president obama is more open than congress .
with a giant american flag draped behind her , framed by us vice president joe biden and house speaker nancy pelosi , merkel 's speech before congress will be saturated in symbolism .
but even more important than the official address itself could be the chancellor 's planned meeting with the president .
demand for discussions even though obama and merkel will probably only get together for either a lunch or a dinner , this could be the moment when important matters are addressed .
" i think that 's just the right amount of time to make specific , concrete demands off the record , " said hulsman .
" any longer you are going to get into bigger things , any shorter and it 's sound bites . "
there is an eagerness in the us to finally engage in serious talks with berlin .
the german election campaign put many important topics on ice until a new government was elected .
" washington and the new us administration gladly granted merkel this grace period , " said himmelreich .
" but now president obama would like to know what the new german government thinks about transatlantic relations and obama himself will surely also express his ideas and wishes . " his colleague hulsman put it more bluntly , calling it " put up or shut up time . "
after waiting patiently for the outcome of the german election , the obama administration now wants to know what to expect from berlin .
" beneath all the symbolism and niceness there is an insistent push that now it 's time for germany to step up to the plate , " he said .
afghan strategy high on the agenda for washington is the question of what the new german government wants to contribute in the future to the afghanistan mission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's contribution to afghanistan will be on the agenda the internal debate in the white house about the request by the us commander in afghanistan for additional troops is in the final stages and the experts expect that obama will let the chancellor in on his thinking about his upcoming decision .
merkel could be asked about how germany will provide concrete help in afghanistan if it does n't want to send more troops .
other topics such as iran , climate change and the economic crisis could then be discussed in a similar fashion - openly and not shying away from possible disagreements .
this kind of detailed and frank discussion with germany about foreign policy has been missing , noted hulsman .
instead of concrete policy solutions discussions often focused on grand strategic disagreements between the two countries .
policy solutions now when practical policies are key , obama ca n't find a more suitable partner than merkel , according to hulsman .
" mrs. merkel is not a great orator , she 's not flashy , but she 's incredibly effective in meetings , " he said , adding that with her grasp of policy detail she can not only hold her own against obama , but also put pressure on the president himself .
" she 's intellectually capable of having this nuts-and-bolts policy discussion that 's so desperately needed , " he said .
if the planned meeting between merkel and obama does in fact signal the start of a new phase of open and honest exchange between washington and berlin , than merkel 's trip will have been not only symbolic , but also a sustainable success .

samuel k. , an 88-year-old man who lives near bonn , had given descriptions of his time as a guard to investigators in 1969 , 1975 , 1980 and again this past june .
" it was clear to us that jews were killed there and were later burned , too .
we could smell it every day , " the magazine quotes k. as saying .
like demjanjuk , k. was a ukrainian soldier taken prisoner by the nazis .
german authorities say the men volunteered or were recruited to serve as guards in concentration camps .
demjanjuk allegedly served in sobibor and is accused of being an accessory to the murder of 27,900 people , mostly jews .
spiegel said that k. fully acknowledged serving as a guard in the belzec death camp .
but , unlike demjanjuk , who had emigrated to the united states , k. obtained german citizenship and has lived in germany for the last 60 years .
demjanjuk was extradited to germany in september .

it 's a great honor for the chancellor , but equally great are the expectations of the obama administration . when chancellor merkel steps up to the lectern on tuesday inside the capitol building in washington , she will have achieved something that only one german post-war chancellor before her had done : to give an address before members of congress .
and actually , the speech which konrad adenauer , the first chancellor of the new federal republic , gave to congress on may 28 , 1957 was at a reception given by the house of representatives , not an address to a joint session of congress .
so according to official protocol , chancellor merkel 's speech on capitol hill is a first for a german head of government .
the fact that the recently re-elected chancellor is only the second foreign dignitary to speak before congress since president barack obama took office underlines the symbolic importance of the event .
the other leader granted this privilege was britain 's prime minister gordon brown .
" i think it is a big deal , " john hulsman , an american foreign policy expert based in germany , told deutsche welle .
" the us is a republic and a relatively new country , that does n't have a lot of symbolism .
to speak to a joint session of congress is about as big an honor as can be bestowed on a foreign leader . "
as nancy pelosi , speaker of the house of representatives and the official host of angela merkel said , the german chancellor was invited to commemorate the upcoming 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall .
respected leader and although not officially stated , merkel was also asked to speak to congress because she is highly respected in washington .
under president obama , merkel 's stature in the us capital has only increased - especially when compared to other european heads of governments .
" mrs. merkel as german chancellor is held in high esteem ; her competence and her standing is internationally recognized , " joerg himmelreich , senior trans-atlantic fellow at the german marshall fund in berlin , told deutsche welle .
" germany is definitely the european power washington needs to work with in order to conduct trans-atlantic relations and carry out the multilateral approach that - in contrast to his predecessor - is a goal for the obama administration , " he added .
while the future of german-american relations will play a major role in merkel 's address before congress , history will also be present .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gordon brown is the only other foreign leader invited to speak before congress under president obama " she will probably , and this is very important as a message to the american people as a whole , express her gratitude for the invaluable contribution the first president bush made to the fall of the berlin wall and therefore to german unity , " said himmelreich .
the chancellor is also expected to highlight the importance of german-american relations as a pillar of foreign policy for the new german government .
in addition , merkel will probably talk about international efforts in combating climate change , a sensitive topic to which president obama is more open than congress .
with a giant american flag draped behind her , framed by us vice president joe biden and house speaker nancy pelosi , merkel 's speech before congress will be saturated in symbolism .
but even more important than the official address itself could be the chancellor 's planned meeting with the president .
demand for discussions even though obama and merkel will probably only get together for either a lunch or a dinner , this could be the moment when important matters are addressed .
" i think that 's just the right amount of time to make specific , concrete demands off the record , " said hulsman .
" any longer you are going to get into bigger things , any shorter and it 's sound bites . "
there is an eagerness in the us to finally engage in serious talks with berlin .
the german election campaign put many important topics on ice until a new government was elected .
" washington and the new us administration gladly granted merkel this grace period , " said himmelreich .
" but now president obama would like to know what the new german government thinks about transatlantic relations and obama himself will surely also express his ideas and wishes . " his colleague hulsman put it more bluntly , calling it " put up or shut up time . "
after waiting patiently for the outcome of the german election , the obama administration now wants to know what to expect from berlin .
" beneath all the symbolism and niceness there is an insistent push that now it 's time for germany to step up to the plate , " he said .
afghan strategy high on the agenda for washington is the question of what the new german government wants to contribute in the future to the afghanistan mission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's contribution to afghanistan will be on the agenda the internal debate in the white house about the request by the us commander in afghanistan for additional troops is in the final stages and the experts expect that obama will let the chancellor in on his thinking about his upcoming decision .
merkel could be asked about how germany will provide concrete help in afghanistan if it does n't want to send more troops .
other topics such as iran , climate change and the economic crisis could then be discussed in a similar fashion - openly and not shying away from possible disagreements .
this kind of detailed and frank discussion with germany about foreign policy has been missing , noted hulsman .
instead of concrete policy solutions discussions often focused on grand strategic disagreements between the two countries .
policy solutions now when practical policies are key , obama ca n't find a more suitable partner than merkel , according to hulsman .
" mrs. merkel is not a great orator , she 's not flashy , but she 's incredibly effective in meetings , " he said , adding that with her grasp of policy detail she can not only hold her own against obama , but also put pressure on the president himself .
" she 's intellectually capable of having this nuts-and-bolts policy discussion that 's so desperately needed , " he said .
if the planned meeting between merkel and obama does in fact signal the start of a new phase of open and honest exchange between washington and berlin , than merkel 's trip will have been not only symbolic , but also a sustainable success .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 01.11.2009 honor , yes , but tough questions also await merkel in washington großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chemistry between chancellor and president is good angela merkel will be the first german head of government since konrad adenauer to speak before the us congress .
it 's a great honor for the chancellor , but equally great are the expectations of the obama administration . when chancellor merkel steps up to the lectern on tuesday inside the capitol building in washington , she will have achieved something that only one german post-war chancellor before her had done : to give an address before members of congress .
and actually , the speech which konrad adenauer , the first chancellor of the new federal republic , gave to congress on may 28 , 1957 was at a reception given by the house of representatives , not an address to a joint session of congress .
so according to official protocol , chancellor merkel 's speech on capitol hill is a first for a german head of government .
the fact that the recently re-elected chancellor is only the second foreign dignitary to speak before congress since president barack obama took office underlines the symbolic importance of the event .
the other leader granted this privilege was britain 's prime minister gordon brown .
" i think it is a big deal , " john hulsman , an american foreign policy expert based in germany , told deutsche welle .
" the us is a republic and a relatively new country , that does n't have a lot of symbolism .
to speak to a joint session of congress is about as big an honor as can be bestowed on a foreign leader . "
as nancy pelosi , speaker of the house of representatives and the official host of angela merkel said , the german chancellor was invited to commemorate the upcoming 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall .
respected leader and although not officially stated , merkel was also asked to speak to congress because she is highly respected in washington .
under president obama , merkel 's stature in the us capital has only increased - especially when compared to other european heads of governments .
" mrs. merkel as german chancellor is held in high esteem ; her competence and her standing is internationally recognized , " joerg himmelreich , senior trans-atlantic fellow at the german marshall fund in berlin , told deutsche welle .
" germany is definitely the european power washington needs to work with in order to conduct trans-atlantic relations and carry out the multilateral approach that - in contrast to his predecessor - is a goal for the obama administration , " he added .
while the future of german-american relations will play a major role in merkel 's address before congress , history will also be present .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gordon brown is the only other foreign leader invited to speak before congress under president obama " she will probably , and this is very important as a message to the american people as a whole , express her gratitude for the invaluable contribution the first president bush made to the fall of the berlin wall and therefore to german unity , " said himmelreich .
the chancellor is also expected to highlight the importance of german-american relations as a pillar of foreign policy for the new german government .
in addition , merkel will probably talk about international efforts in combating climate change , a sensitive topic to which president obama is more open than congress .
with a giant american flag draped behind her , framed by us vice president joe biden and house speaker nancy pelosi , merkel 's speech before congress will be saturated in symbolism .
but even more important than the official address itself could be the chancellor 's planned meeting with the president .
demand for discussions even though obama and merkel will probably only get together for either a lunch or a dinner , this could be the moment when important matters are addressed .
" i think that 's just the right amount of time to make specific , concrete demands off the record , " said hulsman .
" any longer you are going to get into bigger things , any shorter and it 's sound bites . "
there is an eagerness in the us to finally engage in serious talks with berlin .
the german election campaign put many important topics on ice until a new government was elected .
" washington and the new us administration gladly granted merkel this grace period , " said himmelreich .
" but now president obama would like to know what the new german government thinks about transatlantic relations and obama himself will surely also express his ideas and wishes . " his colleague hulsman put it more bluntly , calling it " put up or shut up time . "
after waiting patiently for the outcome of the german election , the obama administration now wants to know what to expect from berlin .
" beneath all the symbolism and niceness there is an insistent push that now it 's time for germany to step up to the plate , " he said .
afghan strategy high on the agenda for washington is the question of what the new german government wants to contribute in the future to the afghanistan mission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's contribution to afghanistan will be on the agenda the internal debate in the white house about the request by the us commander in afghanistan for additional troops is in the final stages and the experts expect that obama will let the chancellor in on his thinking about his upcoming decision .
merkel could be asked about how germany will provide concrete help in afghanistan if it does n't want to send more troops .
other topics such as iran , climate change and the economic crisis could then be discussed in a similar fashion - openly and not shying away from possible disagreements .
this kind of detailed and frank discussion with germany about foreign policy has been missing , noted hulsman .
instead of concrete policy solutions discussions often focused on grand strategic disagreements between the two countries .
policy solutions now when practical policies are key , obama ca n't find a more suitable partner than merkel , according to hulsman .
" mrs. merkel is not a great orator , she 's not flashy , but she 's incredibly effective in meetings , " he said , adding that with her grasp of policy detail she can not only hold her own against obama , but also put pressure on the president himself .
" she 's intellectually capable of having this nuts-and-bolts policy discussion that 's so desperately needed , " he said .
if the planned meeting between merkel and obama does in fact signal the start of a new phase of open and honest exchange between washington and berlin , than merkel 's trip will have been not only symbolic , but also a sustainable success .

it 's a great honor for the chancellor , but equally great are the expectations of the obama administration . when chancellor merkel steps up to the lectern on tuesday inside the capitol building in washington , she will have achieved something that only one german post-war chancellor before her had done : to give an address before members of congress .
and actually , the speech which konrad adenauer , the first chancellor of the new federal republic , gave to congress on may 28 , 1957 was at a reception given by the house of representatives , not an address to a joint session of congress .
so according to official protocol , chancellor merkel 's speech on capitol hill is a first for a german head of government .
the fact that the recently re-elected chancellor is only the second foreign dignitary to speak before congress since president barack obama took office underlines the symbolic importance of the event .
the other leader granted this privilege was britain 's prime minister gordon brown .
" i think it is a big deal , " john hulsman , an american foreign policy expert based in germany , told deutsche welle .
" the us is a republic and a relatively new country , that does n't have a lot of symbolism .
to speak to a joint session of congress is about as big an honor as can be bestowed on a foreign leader . "
as nancy pelosi , speaker of the house of representatives and the official host of angela merkel said , the german chancellor was invited to commemorate the upcoming 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall .
respected leader and although not officially stated , merkel was also asked to speak to congress because she is highly respected in washington .
under president obama , merkel 's stature in the us capital has only increased - especially when compared to other european heads of governments .
" mrs. merkel as german chancellor is held in high esteem ; her competence and her standing is internationally recognized , " joerg himmelreich , senior trans-atlantic fellow at the german marshall fund in berlin , told deutsche welle .
" germany is definitely the european power washington needs to work with in order to conduct trans-atlantic relations and carry out the multilateral approach that - in contrast to his predecessor - is a goal for the obama administration , " he added .
while the future of german-american relations will play a major role in merkel 's address before congress , history will also be present .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gordon brown is the only other foreign leader invited to speak before congress under president obama " she will probably , and this is very important as a message to the american people as a whole , express her gratitude for the invaluable contribution the first president bush made to the fall of the berlin wall and therefore to german unity , " said himmelreich .
the chancellor is also expected to highlight the importance of german-american relations as a pillar of foreign policy for the new german government .
in addition , merkel will probably talk about international efforts in combating climate change , a sensitive topic to which president obama is more open than congress .
with a giant american flag draped behind her , framed by us vice president joe biden and house speaker nancy pelosi , merkel 's speech before congress will be saturated in symbolism .
but even more important than the official address itself could be the chancellor 's planned meeting with the president .
demand for discussions even though obama and merkel will probably only get together for either a lunch or a dinner , this could be the moment when important matters are addressed .
" i think that 's just the right amount of time to make specific , concrete demands off the record , " said hulsman .
" any longer you are going to get into bigger things , any shorter and it 's sound bites . "
there is an eagerness in the us to finally engage in serious talks with berlin .
the german election campaign put many important topics on ice until a new government was elected .
" washington and the new us administration gladly granted merkel this grace period , " said himmelreich .
" but now president obama would like to know what the new german government thinks about transatlantic relations and obama himself will surely also express his ideas and wishes . " his colleague hulsman put it more bluntly , calling it " put up or shut up time . "
after waiting patiently for the outcome of the german election , the obama administration now wants to know what to expect from berlin .
" beneath all the symbolism and niceness there is an insistent push that now it 's time for germany to step up to the plate , " he said .
afghan strategy high on the agenda for washington is the question of what the new german government wants to contribute in the future to the afghanistan mission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's contribution to afghanistan will be on the agenda the internal debate in the white house about the request by the us commander in afghanistan for additional troops is in the final stages and the experts expect that obama will let the chancellor in on his thinking about his upcoming decision .
merkel could be asked about how germany will provide concrete help in afghanistan if it does n't want to send more troops .
other topics such as iran , climate change and the economic crisis could then be discussed in a similar fashion - openly and not shying away from possible disagreements .
this kind of detailed and frank discussion with germany about foreign policy has been missing , noted hulsman .
instead of concrete policy solutions discussions often focused on grand strategic disagreements between the two countries .
policy solutions now when practical policies are key , obama ca n't find a more suitable partner than merkel , according to hulsman .
" mrs. merkel is not a great orator , she 's not flashy , but she 's incredibly effective in meetings , " he said , adding that with her grasp of policy detail she can not only hold her own against obama , but also put pressure on the president himself .
" she 's intellectually capable of having this nuts-and-bolts policy discussion that 's so desperately needed , " he said .
if the planned meeting between merkel and obama does in fact signal the start of a new phase of open and honest exchange between washington and berlin , than merkel 's trip will have been not only symbolic , but also a sustainable success .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 01.11.2009 germany " regrets " abdullah 's decision to withdraw from afghan run-off großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah pulled out after president karzai refused his demands for the run-off germany has lamented afghan opposition candidate abdullah abdullah 's withdrawal from the presidential run-off election .
the former foreign minister 's move could deepen the political crisis in the war-torn nation . germany 's new foreign minister , guido westerwelle , expressed disappointment with afghan opposition candidate abdullah abdullah 's withdrawal from the presidential run-off election .
in remarks at the national congress of young liberals on sunday in saarbruecken , westerwelle said the situation in afghanistan required a level-headed reaction and that now " the election process should be completed in accordance with law and order . "
meanwhile , british prime minister gordon brown said that abdullah had told him that his decision to pull out was " in the interests of national unity . "
brown said that afghan president hamid karzai had called him after abdullah 's announcement to say that he wanted to issue a " unity manifesto " for the afghan people .
he added that he could n't rule out abdullah 's inclusion in a unity government .
" i do n't think anything is being ruled out .
but i think what is more likely is once the decision has been made about the second round election , president karzai , or whoever is president , will want to unify the country , " brown said sunday .
abdullah abdullah told supporters in kabul on sunday that he was withdrawing from the november 7 contest to protest what he described as " misconduct " by the government and the country 's electoral commission .
he said he made the decision after his demands to avoid a repeat of massive first-round fraud were rejected by karzai .
" the decision … was not an easy one .
it was a decision that i have taken after wide-ranging consultations with the people of afghanistan , my supporters and influential leaders , " abdullah said in a lengthy address .
the former foreign minister went on to launch a scathing attack on karzai 's eight-year rule , dimming any hopes that the two rivals could yet agree on some form of power-sharing agreement .
" we have had eight years of lost opportunities because of the weakness of the government , " he said to applause from around 2,000 supporters .
demand to sack top officials following the widespread fraud in the first round on august 20 , abdullah demanded that karzai sack the head of the electoral commission , azizullah ludin , and suspend four ministers who campaigned for the incumbent .
the abdullah camp had set a deadline of saturday for karzai to yield to the demands , saying that he would not take part in a contest that would not be free and fair .

the former foreign minister 's move could deepen the political crisis in the war-torn nation . germany 's new foreign minister , guido westerwelle , expressed disappointment with afghan opposition candidate abdullah abdullah 's withdrawal from the presidential run-off election .
in remarks at the national congress of young liberals on sunday in saarbruecken , westerwelle said the situation in afghanistan required a level-headed reaction and that now " the election process should be completed in accordance with law and order . "
meanwhile , british prime minister gordon brown said that abdullah had told him that his decision to pull out was " in the interests of national unity . "
brown said that afghan president hamid karzai had called him after abdullah 's announcement to say that he wanted to issue a " unity manifesto " for the afghan people .
he added that he could n't rule out abdullah 's inclusion in a unity government .
" i do n't think anything is being ruled out .
but i think what is more likely is once the decision has been made about the second round election , president karzai , or whoever is president , will want to unify the country , " brown said sunday .
abdullah abdullah told supporters in kabul on sunday that he was withdrawing from the november 7 contest to protest what he described as " misconduct " by the government and the country 's electoral commission .
he said he made the decision after his demands to avoid a repeat of massive first-round fraud were rejected by karzai .
" the decision … was not an easy one .
it was a decision that i have taken after wide-ranging consultations with the people of afghanistan , my supporters and influential leaders , " abdullah said in a lengthy address .
the former foreign minister went on to launch a scathing attack on karzai 's eight-year rule , dimming any hopes that the two rivals could yet agree on some form of power-sharing agreement .
" we have had eight years of lost opportunities because of the weakness of the government , " he said to applause from around 2,000 supporters .
demand to sack top officials following the widespread fraud in the first round on august 20 , abdullah demanded that karzai sack the head of the electoral commission , azizullah ludin , and suspend four ministers who campaigned for the incumbent .
the abdullah camp had set a deadline of saturday for karzai to yield to the demands , saying that he would not take part in a contest that would not be free and fair .

the september 4 strike on two fuel trucks in the northeastern kunduz province was the most deadly operation involving german troops since world war two .
the afghan government said the airstrike killed 69 taliban fighters and 30 civilians .
german forces said the bombing targeted the fuel tankers as they were hijacked by taliban insurgents and represented a danger .
in the immediate aftermath , berlin said around 50 militants were killed in the attack but that there were no civilian casualties .
witnesses , however , spoke of several civilian casualties , prompting critical reactions even from germany 's nato allies .
the report said that german authorities have put pressure on nato not to issue an outright condemnation of colonel georg klein because it could lead to legal problems .
this message was given to the nato commander in europe , admiral james stavridis , during a visit to berlin on october 15 .
backing for decision general wolfgang schneiderhan , general inspector of the german army , said on thursday that according to the report , colonel klein , had acted correctly in ordering the strike .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghans are becoming increasingly angry over rising civilian casualties " in light of the results of the report , i have no reason to doubt that german soldiers acted in the correct military fashion , given their mandate from the united nations and the difficult operational situation , " schneiderhan said .
he said the exact death toll in the attack could no longer be determined , adding that the report cited a range of between 17 and 142 casualties .
" the investigation is still under review and no other comment can be made at the moment , " a defense ministry spokesman said when asked about the report in der spiegel .
some eu condemnation the attack , carried out by a us f-5 fighter jet , was condemned by several european foreign ministers .
germany has maintained it was necessary to protect its troops from a possible suicide attack by taliban fighters who had hijacked the trucks .
the spiegel report said colonel klein broke standard operating procedure by ordering air support on the grounds that his troops had come into contact with the enemy , even though international forces were nowhere near the tankers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has 4,200 troops troops in afghanistan the magazine also said klein refused to allow the aircraft to conduct a low-altitude sweep of the area before launching its payload , adding that overcast skies also raised doubts about the appropriateness of ordering a strike while relying on a single human information source and video alone .
the report cited a source familiar with the nato report as saying it also addressed positive sides of klein 's leadership and that it could be used to either condemn or excuse him .
germans remain highly skeptical of military operations more than 60 years after the defeat of the nazis .

the september 4 strike on two fuel trucks in the northeastern kunduz province was the most deadly operation involving german troops since world war two .

german forces said the bombing targeted the fuel tankers as they were hijacked by taliban insurgents and represented a danger .
in the immediate aftermath , berlin said around 50 militants were killed in the attack but that there were no civilian casualties .
witnesses , however , spoke of several civilian casualties , prompting critical reactions even from germany 's nato allies .

the policy blueprint will see income taxes slashed by around 24 billion euros -lrb- $ 36 billion -rrb- , with a focus on reducing the tax burden on families with children and reforms to corporate and inheritance taxes .
but stanislav tillich , the cdu premier of the eastern german state of saxony , has taken a swipe at the plan , insisting the drop in revenue would cancel out his state 's budgetary surplus and negate recent measures taken to balance saxony 's books .
" it can not be that this money is now simply used to cover for a reduction in taxes , " he told the german newsmagazine der spiegel .
" these tax cuts are irresponsible . "
tillich added that plans for how the government would compensate for the drop in revenue remained " very cloudy . "
peter mueller , who heads the cdu government of the small southwestern state of saarland , said he agreed with the federal government 's goal of putting more money into the hands of german tax payers , but said plans for achieving this through sweeping tax cuts were unfounded .
" i believe we should stick with the proven linear-progressive tax plan , " he said .
court case ?
the state premiers said the tax cuts could lead to revenue shortfalls amounting to billions of euros , and threaten upgrades to kindergartens , schools and universities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 24-billion-euro tax cut would take money from schools , critics say saxony-anhalt premier wolfgang boehmer had previously threatened to bring a case before the country 's constitutional court if the federal government pushed ahead with its tax plans .
the new secretary-general of the cdu , hermann groehe , called on tillich and mueller to stand by their federal partners , highlighting that several state premiers who were involved in the coalition negotiations had given their full support to the tax cut plans .
" the party 's various bodies have unanimously approved the coalition deal , " he told german daily hamburger abendblatt . dfm / reuters / ap editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the former foreign minister 's move could deepen the political crisis in the war-torn nation . germany 's new foreign minister , guido westerwelle , expressed disappointment with afghan opposition candidate abdullah abdullah 's withdrawal from the presidential run-off election .
in remarks at the national congress of young liberals on sunday in saarbruecken , westerwelle said the situation in afghanistan required a level-headed reaction and that now " the election process should be completed in accordance with law and order . "
meanwhile , british prime minister gordon brown said that abdullah had told him that his decision to pull out was " in the interests of national unity . "
brown said that afghan president hamid karzai had called him after abdullah 's announcement to say that he wanted to issue a " unity manifesto " for the afghan people .
he added that he could n't rule out abdullah 's inclusion in a unity government .
" i do n't think anything is being ruled out .
but i think what is more likely is once the decision has been made about the second round election , president karzai , or whoever is president , will want to unify the country , " brown said sunday .
abdullah abdullah told supporters in kabul on sunday that he was withdrawing from the november 7 contest to protest what he described as " misconduct " by the government and the country 's electoral commission .
he said he made the decision after his demands to avoid a repeat of massive first-round fraud were rejected by karzai .
" the decision … was not an easy one .
it was a decision that i have taken after wide-ranging consultations with the people of afghanistan , my supporters and influential leaders , " abdullah said in a lengthy address .
the former foreign minister went on to launch a scathing attack on karzai 's eight-year rule , dimming any hopes that the two rivals could yet agree on some form of power-sharing agreement .
" we have had eight years of lost opportunities because of the weakness of the government , " he said to applause from around 2,000 supporters .
demand to sack top officials following the widespread fraud in the first round on august 20 , abdullah demanded that karzai sack the head of the electoral commission , azizullah ludin , and suspend four ministers who campaigned for the incumbent .
the abdullah camp had set a deadline of saturday for karzai to yield to the demands , saying that he would not take part in a contest that would not be free and fair .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamid karzai reluctantly agreed to the run-off election however , his demands received short shrift , with electoral authorities saying ludin could only be dismissed by afghanistan 's supreme court , while karzai said abdullah had no right to interfere with ministerial positions .
" the election commission was not independent .
it was their job to ensure a credible election and we saw what happened , " abdullah said .
" the people were deprived of their democratic rights . "
" poll will be held " speaking on afghan television shortly before abdullah 's announcement , karzai 's campaign spokesman indicated that the election would still go ahead .
" the election law says that in the event of a second round , the candidates must participate , " the spokesman told a private television station .
" the conditions -lrb- set by abdullah -rrb- were impractical and had no basis in law .
these conditions were never received by us but only given to unama , " karzai 's spokesman added , referring to the un mission in afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai 's former foreign minister has become a formidable rival karzai 's share of the vote in the first round fell to 49.67 percent after a un-backed watchdog deemed around a quarter of all votes cast to be fraudulent .
insisting that the fraud had been overstated , karzai only agreed to a second round under extensive diplomatic pressure from washington .
abdullah won just over 30 percent of the vote in the first round , prompting some observers to point out that it would have been a colossal feat for karzai 's lone remaining challenger to win the race .
afghanistan has been wracked by weeks of political uncertainty and security remains a major concern after a resurgent taliban vowed to disrupt the presidential run-off .
ahead of sunday 's announcement , some analysts and diplomats had suggested that abdullah 's withdrawal from the contest - as part of a power-sharing deal in return for a key government post in the next government - would spare the country further political turmoil. svs / rb / afp / reuters editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we have had eight years of lost opportunities because of the weakness of the government , " he said to applause from around 2,000 supporters .
demand to sack top officials following the widespread fraud in the first round on august 20 , abdullah demanded that karzai sack the head of the electoral commission , azizullah ludin , and suspend four ministers who campaigned for the incumbent .
the abdullah camp had set a deadline of saturday for karzai to yield to the demands , saying that he would not take part in a contest that would not be free and fair .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamid karzai reluctantly agreed to the run-off election however , his demands received short shrift , with electoral authorities saying ludin could only be dismissed by afghanistan 's supreme court , while karzai said abdullah had no right to interfere with ministerial positions .
" the election commission was not independent .
it was their job to ensure a credible election and we saw what happened , " abdullah said .
" the people were deprived of their democratic rights . "
" poll will be held " speaking on afghan television shortly before abdullah 's announcement , karzai 's campaign spokesman indicated that the election would still go ahead .
" the election law says that in the event of a second round , the candidates must participate , " the spokesman told a private television station .
" the conditions -lrb- set by abdullah -rrb- were impractical and had no basis in law .
these conditions were never received by us but only given to unama , " karzai 's spokesman added , referring to the un mission in afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai 's former foreign minister has become a formidable rival karzai 's share of the vote in the first round fell to 49.67 percent after a un-backed watchdog deemed around a quarter of all votes cast to be fraudulent .
insisting that the fraud had been overstated , karzai only agreed to a second round under extensive diplomatic pressure from washington .
abdullah won just over 30 percent of the vote in the first round , prompting some observers to point out that it would have been a colossal feat for karzai 's lone remaining challenger to win the race .
afghanistan has been wracked by weeks of political uncertainty and security remains a major concern after a resurgent taliban vowed to disrupt the presidential run-off .
ahead of sunday 's announcement , some analysts and diplomats had suggested that abdullah 's withdrawal from the contest - as part of a power-sharing deal in return for a key government post in the next government - would spare the country further political turmoil. svs / rb / afp / reuters editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's a great honor for the chancellor , but equally great are the expectations of the obama administration . when chancellor merkel steps up to the lectern on tuesday inside the capitol building in washington , she will have achieved something that only one german post-war chancellor before her had done : to give an address before members of congress .
and actually , the speech which konrad adenauer , the first chancellor of the new federal republic , gave to congress on may 28 , 1957 was at a reception given by the house of representatives , not an address to a joint session of congress .
so according to official protocol , chancellor merkel 's speech on capitol hill is a first for a german head of government .
the fact that the recently re-elected chancellor is only the second foreign dignitary to speak before congress since president barack obama took office underlines the symbolic importance of the event .
the other leader granted this privilege was britain 's prime minister gordon brown .
" i think it is a big deal , " john hulsman , an american foreign policy expert based in germany , told deutsche welle .
" the us is a republic and a relatively new country , that does n't have a lot of symbolism .
to speak to a joint session of congress is about as big an honor as can be bestowed on a foreign leader . "
as nancy pelosi , speaker of the house of representatives and the official host of angela merkel said , the german chancellor was invited to commemorate the upcoming 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall .
respected leader and although not officially stated , merkel was also asked to speak to congress because she is highly respected in washington .
under president obama , merkel 's stature in the us capital has only increased - especially when compared to other european heads of governments .
" mrs. merkel as german chancellor is held in high esteem ; her competence and her standing is internationally recognized , " joerg himmelreich , senior trans-atlantic fellow at the german marshall fund in berlin , told deutsche welle .
" germany is definitely the european power washington needs to work with in order to conduct trans-atlantic relations and carry out the multilateral approach that - in contrast to his predecessor - is a goal for the obama administration , " he added .
while the future of german-american relations will play a major role in merkel 's address before congress , history will also be present .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gordon brown is the only other foreign leader invited to speak before congress under president obama " she will probably , and this is very important as a message to the american people as a whole , express her gratitude for the invaluable contribution the first president bush made to the fall of the berlin wall and therefore to german unity , " said himmelreich .
the chancellor is also expected to highlight the importance of german-american relations as a pillar of foreign policy for the new german government .
in addition , merkel will probably talk about international efforts in combating climate change , a sensitive topic to which president obama is more open than congress .
with a giant american flag draped behind her , framed by us vice president joe biden and house speaker nancy pelosi , merkel 's speech before congress will be saturated in symbolism .
but even more important than the official address itself could be the chancellor 's planned meeting with the president .
demand for discussions even though obama and merkel will probably only get together for either a lunch or a dinner , this could be the moment when important matters are addressed .
" i think that 's just the right amount of time to make specific , concrete demands off the record , " said hulsman .
" any longer you are going to get into bigger things , any shorter and it 's sound bites . "
there is an eagerness in the us to finally engage in serious talks with berlin .
the german election campaign put many important topics on ice until a new government was elected .
" washington and the new us administration gladly granted merkel this grace period , " said himmelreich .
" but now president obama would like to know what the new german government thinks about transatlantic relations and obama himself will surely also express his ideas and wishes . " his colleague hulsman put it more bluntly , calling it " put up or shut up time . "
after waiting patiently for the outcome of the german election , the obama administration now wants to know what to expect from berlin .
" beneath all the symbolism and niceness there is an insistent push that now it 's time for germany to step up to the plate , " he said .
afghan strategy high on the agenda for washington is the question of what the new german government wants to contribute in the future to the afghanistan mission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's contribution to afghanistan will be on the agenda the internal debate in the white house about the request by the us commander in afghanistan for additional troops is in the final stages and the experts expect that obama will let the chancellor in on his thinking about his upcoming decision .
merkel could be asked about how germany will provide concrete help in afghanistan if it does n't want to send more troops .
other topics such as iran , climate change and the economic crisis could then be discussed in a similar fashion - openly and not shying away from possible disagreements .
this kind of detailed and frank discussion with germany about foreign policy has been missing , noted hulsman .
instead of concrete policy solutions discussions often focused on grand strategic disagreements between the two countries .
policy solutions now when practical policies are key , obama ca n't find a more suitable partner than merkel , according to hulsman .
" mrs. merkel is not a great orator , she 's not flashy , but she 's incredibly effective in meetings , " he said , adding that with her grasp of policy detail she can not only hold her own against obama , but also put pressure on the president himself .
" she 's intellectually capable of having this nuts-and-bolts policy discussion that 's so desperately needed , " he said .
if the planned meeting between merkel and obama does in fact signal the start of a new phase of open and honest exchange between washington and berlin , than merkel 's trip will have been not only symbolic , but also a sustainable success .

the september 4 strike on two fuel trucks in the northeastern kunduz province was the most deadly operation involving german troops since world war two .
the afghan government said the airstrike killed 69 taliban fighters and 30 civilians .
german forces said the bombing targeted the fuel tankers as they were hijacked by taliban insurgents and represented a danger .
in the immediate aftermath , berlin said around 50 militants were killed in the attack but that there were no civilian casualties .
witnesses , however , spoke of several civilian casualties , prompting critical reactions even from germany 's nato allies .
the report said that german authorities have put pressure on nato not to issue an outright condemnation of colonel georg klein because it could lead to legal problems .
this message was given to the nato commander in europe , admiral james stavridis , during a visit to berlin on october 15 .
backing for decision general wolfgang schneiderhan , general inspector of the german army , said on thursday that according to the report , colonel klein , had acted correctly in ordering the strike .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghans are becoming increasingly angry over rising civilian casualties " in light of the results of the report , i have no reason to doubt that german soldiers acted in the correct military fashion , given their mandate from the united nations and the difficult operational situation , " schneiderhan said .
he said the exact death toll in the attack could no longer be determined , adding that the report cited a range of between 17 and 142 casualties .
" the investigation is still under review and no other comment can be made at the moment , " a defense ministry spokesman said when asked about the report in der spiegel .
some eu condemnation the attack , carried out by a us f-5 fighter jet , was condemned by several european foreign ministers .
germany has maintained it was necessary to protect its troops from a possible suicide attack by taliban fighters who had hijacked the trucks .
the spiegel report said colonel klein broke standard operating procedure by ordering air support on the grounds that his troops had come into contact with the enemy , even though international forces were nowhere near the tankers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has 4,200 troops troops in afghanistan the magazine also said klein refused to allow the aircraft to conduct a low-altitude sweep of the area before launching its payload , adding that overcast skies also raised doubts about the appropriateness of ordering a strike while relying on a single human information source and video alone .
the report cited a source familiar with the nato report as saying it also addressed positive sides of klein 's leadership and that it could be used to either condemn or excuse him .
germans remain highly skeptical of military operations more than 60 years after the defeat of the nazis .
it was only a decade ago that german troops participated in their first foreign combat mission since the war .
opinion polls indicate a majority of germans want the over 4,000 german troops deployed in afghanistan as part of the six-year-old nato mission to come home. rb / afp / reuters editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de interior affairs -pipe- 01.11.2009 tensions surface between states and berlin over tax cut plans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tillich says the tax cuts are irresponsible tensions between germany ’ s federal and state governments are rising after two christian democrat state leaders heavily criticized plans by their own party at the national level to deal out hefty tax cuts . the tax breaks form the centerpiece of a coalition deal agreed between chancellor angela merkel 's conservative union bloc - the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- - and their new federal partners , the pro-business free democrats , following national elections last month .
the policy blueprint will see income taxes slashed by around 24 billion euros -lrb- $ 36 billion -rrb- , with a focus on reducing the tax burden on families with children and reforms to corporate and inheritance taxes .
but stanislav tillich , the cdu premier of the eastern german state of saxony , has taken a swipe at the plan , insisting the drop in revenue would cancel out his state 's budgetary surplus and negate recent measures taken to balance saxony 's books .
" it can not be that this money is now simply used to cover for a reduction in taxes , " he told the german newsmagazine der spiegel .
" these tax cuts are irresponsible . "
tillich added that plans for how the government would compensate for the drop in revenue remained " very cloudy . "
peter mueller , who heads the cdu government of the small southwestern state of saarland , said he agreed with the federal government 's goal of putting more money into the hands of german tax payers , but said plans for achieving this through sweeping tax cuts were unfounded .
" i believe we should stick with the proven linear-progressive tax plan , " he said .
court case ?

but stanislav tillich , the cdu premier of the eastern german state of saxony , has taken a swipe at the plan , insisting the drop in revenue would cancel out his state 's budgetary surplus and negate recent measures taken to balance saxony 's books .

" these tax cuts are irresponsible . "
tillich added that plans for how the government would compensate for the drop in revenue remained " very cloudy . "

the september 4 strike on two fuel trucks in the northeastern kunduz province was the most deadly operation involving german troops since world war two .
the afghan government said the airstrike killed 69 taliban fighters and 30 civilians .
german forces said the bombing targeted the fuel tankers as they were hijacked by taliban insurgents and represented a danger .
in the immediate aftermath , berlin said around 50 militants were killed in the attack but that there were no civilian casualties .
witnesses , however , spoke of several civilian casualties , prompting critical reactions even from germany 's nato allies .
the report said that german authorities have put pressure on nato not to issue an outright condemnation of colonel georg klein because it could lead to legal problems .
this message was given to the nato commander in europe , admiral james stavridis , during a visit to berlin on october 15 .
backing for decision general wolfgang schneiderhan , general inspector of the german army , said on thursday that according to the report , colonel klein , had acted correctly in ordering the strike .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghans are becoming increasingly angry over rising civilian casualties " in light of the results of the report , i have no reason to doubt that german soldiers acted in the correct military fashion , given their mandate from the united nations and the difficult operational situation , " schneiderhan said .
he said the exact death toll in the attack could no longer be determined , adding that the report cited a range of between 17 and 142 casualties .
" the investigation is still under review and no other comment can be made at the moment , " a defense ministry spokesman said when asked about the report in der spiegel .
some eu condemnation the attack , carried out by a us f-5 fighter jet , was condemned by several european foreign ministers .
germany has maintained it was necessary to protect its troops from a possible suicide attack by taliban fighters who had hijacked the trucks .
the spiegel report said colonel klein broke standard operating procedure by ordering air support on the grounds that his troops had come into contact with the enemy , even though international forces were nowhere near the tankers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has 4,200 troops troops in afghanistan the magazine also said klein refused to allow the aircraft to conduct a low-altitude sweep of the area before launching its payload , adding that overcast skies also raised doubts about the appropriateness of ordering a strike while relying on a single human information source and video alone .
the report cited a source familiar with the nato report as saying it also addressed positive sides of klein 's leadership and that it could be used to either condemn or excuse him .
germans remain highly skeptical of military operations more than 60 years after the defeat of the nazis .
it was only a decade ago that german troops participated in their first foreign combat mission since the war .

the policy blueprint will see income taxes slashed by around 24 billion euros -lrb- $ 36 billion -rrb- , with a focus on reducing the tax burden on families with children and reforms to corporate and inheritance taxes .
but stanislav tillich , the cdu premier of the eastern german state of saxony , has taken a swipe at the plan , insisting the drop in revenue would cancel out his state 's budgetary surplus and negate recent measures taken to balance saxony 's books .
" it can not be that this money is now simply used to cover for a reduction in taxes , " he told the german newsmagazine der spiegel .
" these tax cuts are irresponsible . "
tillich added that plans for how the government would compensate for the drop in revenue remained " very cloudy . "
peter mueller , who heads the cdu government of the small southwestern state of saarland , said he agreed with the federal government 's goal of putting more money into the hands of german tax payers , but said plans for achieving this through sweeping tax cuts were unfounded .
" i believe we should stick with the proven linear-progressive tax plan , " he said .

the policy blueprint will see income taxes slashed by around 24 billion euros -lrb- $ 36 billion -rrb- , with a focus on reducing the tax burden on families with children and reforms to corporate and inheritance taxes .
but stanislav tillich , the cdu premier of the eastern german state of saxony , has taken a swipe at the plan , insisting the drop in revenue would cancel out his state 's budgetary surplus and negate recent measures taken to balance saxony 's books .
" it can not be that this money is now simply used to cover for a reduction in taxes , " he told the german newsmagazine der spiegel .
" these tax cuts are irresponsible . "
tillich added that plans for how the government would compensate for the drop in revenue remained " very cloudy . "
peter mueller , who heads the cdu government of the small southwestern state of saarland , said he agreed with the federal government 's goal of putting more money into the hands of german tax payers , but said plans for achieving this through sweeping tax cuts were unfounded .
" i believe we should stick with the proven linear-progressive tax plan , " he said .

the former foreign minister 's move could deepen the political crisis in the war-torn nation . germany 's new foreign minister , guido westerwelle , expressed disappointment with afghan opposition candidate abdullah abdullah 's withdrawal from the presidential run-off election .
in remarks at the national congress of young liberals on sunday in saarbruecken , westerwelle said the situation in afghanistan required a level-headed reaction and that now " the election process should be completed in accordance with law and order . "
meanwhile , british prime minister gordon brown said that abdullah had told him that his decision to pull out was " in the interests of national unity . "
brown said that afghan president hamid karzai had called him after abdullah 's announcement to say that he wanted to issue a " unity manifesto " for the afghan people .
he added that he could n't rule out abdullah 's inclusion in a unity government .
" i do n't think anything is being ruled out .
but i think what is more likely is once the decision has been made about the second round election , president karzai , or whoever is president , will want to unify the country , " brown said sunday .
abdullah abdullah told supporters in kabul on sunday that he was withdrawing from the november 7 contest to protest what he described as " misconduct " by the government and the country 's electoral commission .
he said he made the decision after his demands to avoid a repeat of massive first-round fraud were rejected by karzai .
" the decision … was not an easy one .
it was a decision that i have taken after wide-ranging consultations with the people of afghanistan , my supporters and influential leaders , " abdullah said in a lengthy address .
the former foreign minister went on to launch a scathing attack on karzai 's eight-year rule , dimming any hopes that the two rivals could yet agree on some form of power-sharing agreement .
" we have had eight years of lost opportunities because of the weakness of the government , " he said to applause from around 2,000 supporters .
demand to sack top officials following the widespread fraud in the first round on august 20 , abdullah demanded that karzai sack the head of the electoral commission , azizullah ludin , and suspend four ministers who campaigned for the incumbent .
the abdullah camp had set a deadline of saturday for karzai to yield to the demands , saying that he would not take part in a contest that would not be free and fair .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamid karzai reluctantly agreed to the run-off election however , his demands received short shrift , with electoral authorities saying ludin could only be dismissed by afghanistan 's supreme court , while karzai said abdullah had no right to interfere with ministerial positions .
" the election commission was not independent .
it was their job to ensure a credible election and we saw what happened , " abdullah said .
" the people were deprived of their democratic rights . "
" poll will be held " speaking on afghan television shortly before abdullah 's announcement , karzai 's campaign spokesman indicated that the election would still go ahead .
" the election law says that in the event of a second round , the candidates must participate , " the spokesman told a private television station .
" the conditions -lrb- set by abdullah -rrb- were impractical and had no basis in law .
these conditions were never received by us but only given to unama , " karzai 's spokesman added , referring to the un mission in afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai 's former foreign minister has become a formidable rival karzai 's share of the vote in the first round fell to 49.67 percent after a un-backed watchdog deemed around a quarter of all votes cast to be fraudulent .
insisting that the fraud had been overstated , karzai only agreed to a second round under extensive diplomatic pressure from washington .
abdullah won just over 30 percent of the vote in the first round , prompting some observers to point out that it would have been a colossal feat for karzai 's lone remaining challenger to win the race .
afghanistan has been wracked by weeks of political uncertainty and security remains a major concern after a resurgent taliban vowed to disrupt the presidential run-off .
ahead of sunday 's announcement , some analysts and diplomats had suggested that abdullah 's withdrawal from the contest - as part of a power-sharing deal in return for a key government post in the next government - would spare the country further political turmoil. svs / rb / afp / reuters editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the former foreign minister went on to launch a scathing attack on karzai 's eight-year rule , dimming any hopes that the two rivals could yet agree on some form of power-sharing agreement .
" we have had eight years of lost opportunities because of the weakness of the government , " he said to applause from around 2,000 supporters .
demand to sack top officials following the widespread fraud in the first round on august 20 , abdullah demanded that karzai sack the head of the electoral commission , azizullah ludin , and suspend four ministers who campaigned for the incumbent .
the abdullah camp had set a deadline of saturday for karzai to yield to the demands , saying that he would not take part in a contest that would not be free and fair .

" the election commission was not independent .
it was their job to ensure a credible election and we saw what happened , " abdullah said .
" the people were deprived of their democratic rights . "
" poll will be held " speaking on afghan television shortly before abdullah 's announcement , karzai 's campaign spokesman indicated that the election would still go ahead .
" the election law says that in the event of a second round , the candidates must participate , " the spokesman told a private television station .
" the conditions -lrb- set by abdullah -rrb- were impractical and had no basis in law .

abdullah won just over 30 percent of the vote in the first round , prompting some observers to point out that it would have been a colossal feat for karzai 's lone remaining challenger to win the race .

the former foreign minister 's move could deepen the political crisis in the war-torn nation . germany 's new foreign minister , guido westerwelle , expressed disappointment with afghan opposition candidate abdullah abdullah 's withdrawal from the presidential run-off election .
in remarks at the national congress of young liberals on sunday in saarbruecken , westerwelle said the situation in afghanistan required a level-headed reaction and that now " the election process should be completed in accordance with law and order . "
meanwhile , british prime minister gordon brown said that abdullah had told him that his decision to pull out was " in the interests of national unity . "
brown said that afghan president hamid karzai had called him after abdullah 's announcement to say that he wanted to issue a " unity manifesto " for the afghan people .
he added that he could n't rule out abdullah 's inclusion in a unity government .

samuel k. , an 88-year-old man who lives near bonn , had given descriptions of his time as a guard to investigators in 1969 , 1975 , 1980 and again this past june .
" it was clear to us that jews were killed there and were later burned , too .
we could smell it every day , " the magazine quotes k. as saying .
like demjanjuk , k. was a ukrainian soldier taken prisoner by the nazis .
german authorities say the men volunteered or were recruited to serve as guards in concentration camps .
demjanjuk allegedly served in sobibor and is accused of being an accessory to the murder of 27,900 people , mostly jews .
spiegel said that k. fully acknowledged serving as a guard in the belzec death camp .

the september 4 strike on two fuel trucks in the northeastern kunduz province was the most deadly operation involving german troops since world war two .
the afghan government said the airstrike killed 69 taliban fighters and 30 civilians .
german forces said the bombing targeted the fuel tankers as they were hijacked by taliban insurgents and represented a danger .
in the immediate aftermath , berlin said around 50 militants were killed in the attack but that there were no civilian casualties .
witnesses , however , spoke of several civilian casualties , prompting critical reactions even from germany 's nato allies .
the report said that german authorities have put pressure on nato not to issue an outright condemnation of colonel georg klein because it could lead to legal problems .
this message was given to the nato commander in europe , admiral james stavridis , during a visit to berlin on october 15 .
backing for decision general wolfgang schneiderhan , general inspector of the german army , said on thursday that according to the report , colonel klein , had acted correctly in ordering the strike .

he said the exact death toll in the attack could no longer be determined , adding that the report cited a range of between 17 and 142 casualties .
" the investigation is still under review and no other comment can be made at the moment , " a defense ministry spokesman said when asked about the report in der spiegel .
some eu condemnation the attack , carried out by a us f-5 fighter jet , was condemned by several european foreign ministers .
germany has maintained it was necessary to protect its troops from a possible suicide attack by taliban fighters who had hijacked the trucks .
the spiegel report said colonel klein broke standard operating procedure by ordering air support on the grounds that his troops had come into contact with the enemy , even though international forces were nowhere near the tankers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has 4,200 troops troops in afghanistan the magazine also said klein refused to allow the aircraft to conduct a low-altitude sweep of the area before launching its payload , adding that overcast skies also raised doubts about the appropriateness of ordering a strike while relying on a single human information source and video alone .
the report cited a source familiar with the nato report as saying it also addressed positive sides of klein 's leadership and that it could be used to either condemn or excuse him .
germans remain highly skeptical of military operations more than 60 years after the defeat of the nazis .
it was only a decade ago that german troops participated in their first foreign combat mission since the war .

the september 4 strike on two fuel trucks in the northeastern kunduz province was the most deadly operation involving german troops since world war two .
the afghan government said the airstrike killed 69 taliban fighters and 30 civilians .
german forces said the bombing targeted the fuel tankers as they were hijacked by taliban insurgents and represented a danger .
in the immediate aftermath , berlin said around 50 militants were killed in the attack but that there were no civilian casualties .
witnesses , however , spoke of several civilian casualties , prompting critical reactions even from germany 's nato allies .
the report said that german authorities have put pressure on nato not to issue an outright condemnation of colonel georg klein because it could lead to legal problems .
this message was given to the nato commander in europe , admiral james stavridis , during a visit to berlin on october 15 .
backing for decision general wolfgang schneiderhan , general inspector of the german army , said on thursday that according to the report , colonel klein , had acted correctly in ordering the strike .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghans are becoming increasingly angry over rising civilian casualties " in light of the results of the report , i have no reason to doubt that german soldiers acted in the correct military fashion , given their mandate from the united nations and the difficult operational situation , " schneiderhan said .
he said the exact death toll in the attack could no longer be determined , adding that the report cited a range of between 17 and 142 casualties .
" the investigation is still under review and no other comment can be made at the moment , " a defense ministry spokesman said when asked about the report in der spiegel .

the policy blueprint will see income taxes slashed by around 24 billion euros -lrb- $ 36 billion -rrb- , with a focus on reducing the tax burden on families with children and reforms to corporate and inheritance taxes .
but stanislav tillich , the cdu premier of the eastern german state of saxony , has taken a swipe at the plan , insisting the drop in revenue would cancel out his state 's budgetary surplus and negate recent measures taken to balance saxony 's books .
" it can not be that this money is now simply used to cover for a reduction in taxes , " he told the german newsmagazine der spiegel .
" these tax cuts are irresponsible . "
tillich added that plans for how the government would compensate for the drop in revenue remained " very cloudy . "
peter mueller , who heads the cdu government of the small southwestern state of saarland , said he agreed with the federal government 's goal of putting more money into the hands of german tax payers , but said plans for achieving this through sweeping tax cuts were unfounded .
" i believe we should stick with the proven linear-progressive tax plan , " he said .
court case ?
the state premiers said the tax cuts could lead to revenue shortfalls amounting to billions of euros , and threaten upgrades to kindergartens , schools and universities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 24-billion-euro tax cut would take money from schools , critics say saxony-anhalt premier wolfgang boehmer had previously threatened to bring a case before the country 's constitutional court if the federal government pushed ahead with its tax plans .
the new secretary-general of the cdu , hermann groehe , called on tillich and mueller to stand by their federal partners , highlighting that several state premiers who were involved in the coalition negotiations had given their full support to the tax cut plans .
" the party 's various bodies have unanimously approved the coalition deal , " he told german daily hamburger abendblatt . dfm / reuters / ap editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

statistics over the past two years have shown a drop in robberies , rapes and murders but with around 50 people being killed every day across the country , concerns about safety remain high as the world cup approaches . but there is equal concern over the safety of the teams and support staff of countries appearing at the tournament , with some people suggesting beefed-up security operations will be needed to keep players from harm . a recent report in the german sport bild magazine suggested that the germany team would be protected by a full escort of armed security guards when the team leaves its base in pretoria and that the players will be required to wear bullet-proof vests . quotes attributed to guenter schnelle from baysecur , a private security firm which looks after the germany team at away games , suggest that the movement of players outside of their hotel should be kept to a minimum . the overall impression given by the sport bild article and the quotes – which schnelle later denied making – is that germany and the other teams at the world cup will be under siege . federation rejects vest suggestion germany 's dfb football federation spokesman harald stenger told deutsche welle that bullet-proof vests had not even been discussed as an option and that a security operation for the germany team while they are in south africa has not been finalized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach jogi loew 's only worry should be the performance of his team " the person and firm mentioned in the article have not spoken to the dfb about these security issues , " stenger said , saying that the dfb 's security officer is currently in south africa assessing the situation .
when he returns , stenger said , the organization will then determine if additional security is needed . " once the draw for the tournament is made on december 4 , we will again assess the situation and discuss and finalize our plans together with fifa and the south african authorities . " no drastic changes expected stenger said that he did n't expect any drastic change to the security operations that are usually in place when the germany team plays abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack and co. will be as secure as usual in south africa , the dfb says according to him , a private security firm with two to four security staff is employed to travel with the national team and its entourage .
in south africa , there may be additional security operatives deployed from the german federal police -lrb- bka -rrb- because of the location of a media center at the hotel where players will stay . " but we will not be making a big deal just because it is south africa , " he added .
" we are aware of the crime rate but we are not afraid .
there is crime everywhere when you travel with a national team . " dfb security boss helmut spahn told reporters before leaving for south africa that the federation is looking to recruit 20 extra security guards for the team 's stay at their five-star accommodation at the velmore grande hotel in the south african province of gauteng . " we will probably use more personnel than we would normally have , " said spahn . author : nick amies editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 01.11.2009 report : german colonel made errors in afghan strike großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airstrike was ordered by colonel klein and carried out by us fighter jets a german magazine is reporting that a nato probe into a deadly airstrike in afghanistan that caused outrage in the region is more critical of the german commander who ordered it than the german army has admitted . the newsmagazine der spiegel said in an early release of its edition to be published on monday that a nato investigation into the september airstrike that killed dozens of afghan civilians showed the german commander who ordered it broke military procedure .
the september 4 strike on two fuel trucks in the northeastern kunduz province was the most deadly operation involving german troops since world war two .
the afghan government said the airstrike killed 69 taliban fighters and 30 civilians .
german forces said the bombing targeted the fuel tankers as they were hijacked by taliban insurgents and represented a danger .
in the immediate aftermath , berlin said around 50 militants were killed in the attack but that there were no civilian casualties .
witnesses , however , spoke of several civilian casualties , prompting critical reactions even from germany 's nato allies .
the report said that german authorities have put pressure on nato not to issue an outright condemnation of colonel georg klein because it could lead to legal problems .
this message was given to the nato commander in europe , admiral james stavridis , during a visit to berlin on october 15 .
backing for decision general wolfgang schneiderhan , general inspector of the german army , said on thursday that according to the report , colonel klein , had acted correctly in ordering the strike .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghans are becoming increasingly angry over rising civilian casualties " in light of the results of the report , i have no reason to doubt that german soldiers acted in the correct military fashion , given their mandate from the united nations and the difficult operational situation , " schneiderhan said .
he said the exact death toll in the attack could no longer be determined , adding that the report cited a range of between 17 and 142 casualties .
" the investigation is still under review and no other comment can be made at the moment , " a defense ministry spokesman said when asked about the report in der spiegel .
some eu condemnation the attack , carried out by a us f-5 fighter jet , was condemned by several european foreign ministers .
germany has maintained it was necessary to protect its troops from a possible suicide attack by taliban fighters who had hijacked the trucks .
the spiegel report said colonel klein broke standard operating procedure by ordering air support on the grounds that his troops had come into contact with the enemy , even though international forces were nowhere near the tankers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has 4,200 troops troops in afghanistan the magazine also said klein refused to allow the aircraft to conduct a low-altitude sweep of the area before launching its payload , adding that overcast skies also raised doubts about the appropriateness of ordering a strike while relying on a single human information source and video alone .
the report cited a source familiar with the nato report as saying it also addressed positive sides of klein 's leadership and that it could be used to either condemn or excuse him .
germans remain highly skeptical of military operations more than 60 years after the defeat of the nazis .
it was only a decade ago that german troops participated in their first foreign combat mission since the war .
opinion polls indicate a majority of germans want the over 4,000 german troops deployed in afghanistan as part of the six-year-old nato mission to come home. rb / afp / reuters editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's a great honor for the chancellor , but equally great are the expectations of the obama administration . when chancellor merkel steps up to the lectern on tuesday inside the capitol building in washington , she will have achieved something that only one german post-war chancellor before her had done : to give an address before members of congress .
and actually , the speech which konrad adenauer , the first chancellor of the new federal republic , gave to congress on may 28 , 1957 was at a reception given by the house of representatives , not an address to a joint session of congress .
so according to official protocol , chancellor merkel 's speech on capitol hill is a first for a german head of government .
the fact that the recently re-elected chancellor is only the second foreign dignitary to speak before congress since president barack obama took office underlines the symbolic importance of the event .
the other leader granted this privilege was britain 's prime minister gordon brown .
" i think it is a big deal , " john hulsman , an american foreign policy expert based in germany , told deutsche welle .
" the us is a republic and a relatively new country , that does n't have a lot of symbolism .
to speak to a joint session of congress is about as big an honor as can be bestowed on a foreign leader . "
as nancy pelosi , speaker of the house of representatives and the official host of angela merkel said , the german chancellor was invited to commemorate the upcoming 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall .
respected leader and although not officially stated , merkel was also asked to speak to congress because she is highly respected in washington .
under president obama , merkel 's stature in the us capital has only increased - especially when compared to other european heads of governments .
" mrs. merkel as german chancellor is held in high esteem ; her competence and her standing is internationally recognized , " joerg himmelreich , senior trans-atlantic fellow at the german marshall fund in berlin , told deutsche welle .
" germany is definitely the european power washington needs to work with in order to conduct trans-atlantic relations and carry out the multilateral approach that - in contrast to his predecessor - is a goal for the obama administration , " he added .
while the future of german-american relations will play a major role in merkel 's address before congress , history will also be present .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gordon brown is the only other foreign leader invited to speak before congress under president obama " she will probably , and this is very important as a message to the american people as a whole , express her gratitude for the invaluable contribution the first president bush made to the fall of the berlin wall and therefore to german unity , " said himmelreich .
the chancellor is also expected to highlight the importance of german-american relations as a pillar of foreign policy for the new german government .
in addition , merkel will probably talk about international efforts in combating climate change , a sensitive topic to which president obama is more open than congress .
with a giant american flag draped behind her , framed by us vice president joe biden and house speaker nancy pelosi , merkel 's speech before congress will be saturated in symbolism .
but even more important than the official address itself could be the chancellor 's planned meeting with the president .
demand for discussions even though obama and merkel will probably only get together for either a lunch or a dinner , this could be the moment when important matters are addressed .
" i think that 's just the right amount of time to make specific , concrete demands off the record , " said hulsman .
" any longer you are going to get into bigger things , any shorter and it 's sound bites . "
there is an eagerness in the us to finally engage in serious talks with berlin .
the german election campaign put many important topics on ice until a new government was elected .
" washington and the new us administration gladly granted merkel this grace period , " said himmelreich .
" but now president obama would like to know what the new german government thinks about transatlantic relations and obama himself will surely also express his ideas and wishes . " his colleague hulsman put it more bluntly , calling it " put up or shut up time . "
after waiting patiently for the outcome of the german election , the obama administration now wants to know what to expect from berlin .
" beneath all the symbolism and niceness there is an insistent push that now it 's time for germany to step up to the plate , " he said .
afghan strategy high on the agenda for washington is the question of what the new german government wants to contribute in the future to the afghanistan mission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's contribution to afghanistan will be on the agenda the internal debate in the white house about the request by the us commander in afghanistan for additional troops is in the final stages and the experts expect that obama will let the chancellor in on his thinking about his upcoming decision .
merkel could be asked about how germany will provide concrete help in afghanistan if it does n't want to send more troops .
other topics such as iran , climate change and the economic crisis could then be discussed in a similar fashion - openly and not shying away from possible disagreements .
this kind of detailed and frank discussion with germany about foreign policy has been missing , noted hulsman .
instead of concrete policy solutions discussions often focused on grand strategic disagreements between the two countries .
policy solutions now when practical policies are key , obama ca n't find a more suitable partner than merkel , according to hulsman .
" mrs. merkel is not a great orator , she 's not flashy , but she 's incredibly effective in meetings , " he said , adding that with her grasp of policy detail she can not only hold her own against obama , but also put pressure on the president himself .
" she 's intellectually capable of having this nuts-and-bolts policy discussion that 's so desperately needed , " he said .
if the planned meeting between merkel and obama does in fact signal the start of a new phase of open and honest exchange between washington and berlin , than merkel 's trip will have been not only symbolic , but also a sustainable success .

it 's a great honor for the chancellor , but equally great are the expectations of the obama administration . when chancellor merkel steps up to the lectern on tuesday inside the capitol building in washington , she will have achieved something that only one german post-war chancellor before her had done : to give an address before members of congress .
and actually , the speech which konrad adenauer , the first chancellor of the new federal republic , gave to congress on may 28 , 1957 was at a reception given by the house of representatives , not an address to a joint session of congress .
so according to official protocol , chancellor merkel 's speech on capitol hill is a first for a german head of government .
the fact that the recently re-elected chancellor is only the second foreign dignitary to speak before congress since president barack obama took office underlines the symbolic importance of the event .
the other leader granted this privilege was britain 's prime minister gordon brown .
" i think it is a big deal , " john hulsman , an american foreign policy expert based in germany , told deutsche welle .
" the us is a republic and a relatively new country , that does n't have a lot of symbolism .
to speak to a joint session of congress is about as big an honor as can be bestowed on a foreign leader . "
as nancy pelosi , speaker of the house of representatives and the official host of angela merkel said , the german chancellor was invited to commemorate the upcoming 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall .
respected leader and although not officially stated , merkel was also asked to speak to congress because she is highly respected in washington .
under president obama , merkel 's stature in the us capital has only increased - especially when compared to other european heads of governments .
" mrs. merkel as german chancellor is held in high esteem ; her competence and her standing is internationally recognized , " joerg himmelreich , senior trans-atlantic fellow at the german marshall fund in berlin , told deutsche welle .
" germany is definitely the european power washington needs to work with in order to conduct trans-atlantic relations and carry out the multilateral approach that - in contrast to his predecessor - is a goal for the obama administration , " he added .
while the future of german-american relations will play a major role in merkel 's address before congress , history will also be present .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gordon brown is the only other foreign leader invited to speak before congress under president obama " she will probably , and this is very important as a message to the american people as a whole , express her gratitude for the invaluable contribution the first president bush made to the fall of the berlin wall and therefore to german unity , " said himmelreich .
the chancellor is also expected to highlight the importance of german-american relations as a pillar of foreign policy for the new german government .
in addition , merkel will probably talk about international efforts in combating climate change , a sensitive topic to which president obama is more open than congress .
with a giant american flag draped behind her , framed by us vice president joe biden and house speaker nancy pelosi , merkel 's speech before congress will be saturated in symbolism .
but even more important than the official address itself could be the chancellor 's planned meeting with the president .
demand for discussions even though obama and merkel will probably only get together for either a lunch or a dinner , this could be the moment when important matters are addressed .
" i think that 's just the right amount of time to make specific , concrete demands off the record , " said hulsman .
" any longer you are going to get into bigger things , any shorter and it 's sound bites . "
there is an eagerness in the us to finally engage in serious talks with berlin .
the german election campaign put many important topics on ice until a new government was elected .
" washington and the new us administration gladly granted merkel this grace period , " said himmelreich .
" but now president obama would like to know what the new german government thinks about transatlantic relations and obama himself will surely also express his ideas and wishes . " his colleague hulsman put it more bluntly , calling it " put up or shut up time . "
after waiting patiently for the outcome of the german election , the obama administration now wants to know what to expect from berlin .
" beneath all the symbolism and niceness there is an insistent push that now it 's time for germany to step up to the plate , " he said .
afghan strategy high on the agenda for washington is the question of what the new german government wants to contribute in the future to the afghanistan mission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's contribution to afghanistan will be on the agenda the internal debate in the white house about the request by the us commander in afghanistan for additional troops is in the final stages and the experts expect that obama will let the chancellor in on his thinking about his upcoming decision .
merkel could be asked about how germany will provide concrete help in afghanistan if it does n't want to send more troops .
other topics such as iran , climate change and the economic crisis could then be discussed in a similar fashion - openly and not shying away from possible disagreements .
this kind of detailed and frank discussion with germany about foreign policy has been missing , noted hulsman .
instead of concrete policy solutions discussions often focused on grand strategic disagreements between the two countries .
policy solutions now when practical policies are key , obama ca n't find a more suitable partner than merkel , according to hulsman .
" mrs. merkel is not a great orator , she 's not flashy , but she 's incredibly effective in meetings , " he said , adding that with her grasp of policy detail she can not only hold her own against obama , but also put pressure on the president himself .
" she 's intellectually capable of having this nuts-and-bolts policy discussion that 's so desperately needed , " he said .
if the planned meeting between merkel and obama does in fact signal the start of a new phase of open and honest exchange between washington and berlin , than merkel 's trip will have been not only symbolic , but also a sustainable success .

with a giant american flag draped behind her , framed by us vice president joe biden and house speaker nancy pelosi , merkel 's speech before congress will be saturated in symbolism .
but even more important than the official address itself could be the chancellor 's planned meeting with the president .
demand for discussions even though obama and merkel will probably only get together for either a lunch or a dinner , this could be the moment when important matters are addressed .
" i think that 's just the right amount of time to make specific , concrete demands off the record , " said hulsman .
" any longer you are going to get into bigger things , any shorter and it 's sound bites . "
there is an eagerness in the us to finally engage in serious talks with berlin .
the german election campaign put many important topics on ice until a new government was elected .
" washington and the new us administration gladly granted merkel this grace period , " said himmelreich .
" but now president obama would like to know what the new german government thinks about transatlantic relations and obama himself will surely also express his ideas and wishes . " his colleague hulsman put it more bluntly , calling it " put up or shut up time . "
after waiting patiently for the outcome of the german election , the obama administration now wants to know what to expect from berlin .
" beneath all the symbolism and niceness there is an insistent push that now it 's time for germany to step up to the plate , " he said .
afghan strategy high on the agenda for washington is the question of what the new german government wants to contribute in the future to the afghanistan mission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's contribution to afghanistan will be on the agenda the internal debate in the white house about the request by the us commander in afghanistan for additional troops is in the final stages and the experts expect that obama will let the chancellor in on his thinking about his upcoming decision .
merkel could be asked about how germany will provide concrete help in afghanistan if it does n't want to send more troops .
other topics such as iran , climate change and the economic crisis could then be discussed in a similar fashion - openly and not shying away from possible disagreements .
this kind of detailed and frank discussion with germany about foreign policy has been missing , noted hulsman .
instead of concrete policy solutions discussions often focused on grand strategic disagreements between the two countries .
policy solutions now when practical policies are key , obama ca n't find a more suitable partner than merkel , according to hulsman .
" mrs. merkel is not a great orator , she 's not flashy , but she 's incredibly effective in meetings , " he said , adding that with her grasp of policy detail she can not only hold her own against obama , but also put pressure on the president himself .
" she 's intellectually capable of having this nuts-and-bolts policy discussion that 's so desperately needed , " he said .
if the planned meeting between merkel and obama does in fact signal the start of a new phase of open and honest exchange between washington and berlin , than merkel 's trip will have been not only symbolic , but also a sustainable success .

the former foreign minister 's move could deepen the political crisis in the war-torn nation . germany 's new foreign minister , guido westerwelle , expressed disappointment with afghan opposition candidate abdullah abdullah 's withdrawal from the presidential run-off election .
in remarks at the national congress of young liberals on sunday in saarbruecken , westerwelle said the situation in afghanistan required a level-headed reaction and that now " the election process should be completed in accordance with law and order . "
meanwhile , british prime minister gordon brown said that abdullah had told him that his decision to pull out was " in the interests of national unity . "
brown said that afghan president hamid karzai had called him after abdullah 's announcement to say that he wanted to issue a " unity manifesto " for the afghan people .
he added that he could n't rule out abdullah 's inclusion in a unity government .
" i do n't think anything is being ruled out .
but i think what is more likely is once the decision has been made about the second round election , president karzai , or whoever is president , will want to unify the country , " brown said sunday .
abdullah abdullah told supporters in kabul on sunday that he was withdrawing from the november 7 contest to protest what he described as " misconduct " by the government and the country 's electoral commission .
he said he made the decision after his demands to avoid a repeat of massive first-round fraud were rejected by karzai .
" the decision … was not an easy one .
it was a decision that i have taken after wide-ranging consultations with the people of afghanistan , my supporters and influential leaders , " abdullah said in a lengthy address .
the former foreign minister went on to launch a scathing attack on karzai 's eight-year rule , dimming any hopes that the two rivals could yet agree on some form of power-sharing agreement .
" we have had eight years of lost opportunities because of the weakness of the government , " he said to applause from around 2,000 supporters .
demand to sack top officials following the widespread fraud in the first round on august 20 , abdullah demanded that karzai sack the head of the electoral commission , azizullah ludin , and suspend four ministers who campaigned for the incumbent .
the abdullah camp had set a deadline of saturday for karzai to yield to the demands , saying that he would not take part in a contest that would not be free and fair .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamid karzai reluctantly agreed to the run-off election however , his demands received short shrift , with electoral authorities saying ludin could only be dismissed by afghanistan 's supreme court , while karzai said abdullah had no right to interfere with ministerial positions .
" the election commission was not independent .
it was their job to ensure a credible election and we saw what happened , " abdullah said .
" the people were deprived of their democratic rights . "
" poll will be held " speaking on afghan television shortly before abdullah 's announcement , karzai 's campaign spokesman indicated that the election would still go ahead .
" the election law says that in the event of a second round , the candidates must participate , " the spokesman told a private television station .
" the conditions -lrb- set by abdullah -rrb- were impractical and had no basis in law .
these conditions were never received by us but only given to unama , " karzai 's spokesman added , referring to the un mission in afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai 's former foreign minister has become a formidable rival karzai 's share of the vote in the first round fell to 49.67 percent after a un-backed watchdog deemed around a quarter of all votes cast to be fraudulent .
insisting that the fraud had been overstated , karzai only agreed to a second round under extensive diplomatic pressure from washington .
abdullah won just over 30 percent of the vote in the first round , prompting some observers to point out that it would have been a colossal feat for karzai 's lone remaining challenger to win the race .
afghanistan has been wracked by weeks of political uncertainty and security remains a major concern after a resurgent taliban vowed to disrupt the presidential run-off .
ahead of sunday 's announcement , some analysts and diplomats had suggested that abdullah 's withdrawal from the contest - as part of a power-sharing deal in return for a key government post in the next government - would spare the country further political turmoil. svs / rb / afp / reuters editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the former foreign minister 's move could deepen the political crisis in the war-torn nation . germany 's new foreign minister , guido westerwelle , expressed disappointment with afghan opposition candidate abdullah abdullah 's withdrawal from the presidential run-off election .
in remarks at the national congress of young liberals on sunday in saarbruecken , westerwelle said the situation in afghanistan required a level-headed reaction and that now " the election process should be completed in accordance with law and order . "
meanwhile , british prime minister gordon brown said that abdullah had told him that his decision to pull out was " in the interests of national unity . "
brown said that afghan president hamid karzai had called him after abdullah 's announcement to say that he wanted to issue a " unity manifesto " for the afghan people .
he added that he could n't rule out abdullah 's inclusion in a unity government .
" i do n't think anything is being ruled out .
but i think what is more likely is once the decision has been made about the second round election , president karzai , or whoever is president , will want to unify the country , " brown said sunday .
abdullah abdullah told supporters in kabul on sunday that he was withdrawing from the november 7 contest to protest what he described as " misconduct " by the government and the country 's electoral commission .
he said he made the decision after his demands to avoid a repeat of massive first-round fraud were rejected by karzai .
" the decision … was not an easy one .
it was a decision that i have taken after wide-ranging consultations with the people of afghanistan , my supporters and influential leaders , " abdullah said in a lengthy address .
the former foreign minister went on to launch a scathing attack on karzai 's eight-year rule , dimming any hopes that the two rivals could yet agree on some form of power-sharing agreement .
" we have had eight years of lost opportunities because of the weakness of the government , " he said to applause from around 2,000 supporters .
demand to sack top officials following the widespread fraud in the first round on august 20 , abdullah demanded that karzai sack the head of the electoral commission , azizullah ludin , and suspend four ministers who campaigned for the incumbent .
the abdullah camp had set a deadline of saturday for karzai to yield to the demands , saying that he would not take part in a contest that would not be free and fair .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamid karzai reluctantly agreed to the run-off election however , his demands received short shrift , with electoral authorities saying ludin could only be dismissed by afghanistan 's supreme court , while karzai said abdullah had no right to interfere with ministerial positions .
" the election commission was not independent .
it was their job to ensure a credible election and we saw what happened , " abdullah said .
" the people were deprived of their democratic rights . "
" poll will be held " speaking on afghan television shortly before abdullah 's announcement , karzai 's campaign spokesman indicated that the election would still go ahead .
" the election law says that in the event of a second round , the candidates must participate , " the spokesman told a private television station .
" the conditions -lrb- set by abdullah -rrb- were impractical and had no basis in law .
these conditions were never received by us but only given to unama , " karzai 's spokesman added , referring to the un mission in afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai 's former foreign minister has become a formidable rival karzai 's share of the vote in the first round fell to 49.67 percent after a un-backed watchdog deemed around a quarter of all votes cast to be fraudulent .
insisting that the fraud had been overstated , karzai only agreed to a second round under extensive diplomatic pressure from washington .
abdullah won just over 30 percent of the vote in the first round , prompting some observers to point out that it would have been a colossal feat for karzai 's lone remaining challenger to win the race .
afghanistan has been wracked by weeks of political uncertainty and security remains a major concern after a resurgent taliban vowed to disrupt the presidential run-off .
ahead of sunday 's announcement , some analysts and diplomats had suggested that abdullah 's withdrawal from the contest - as part of a power-sharing deal in return for a key government post in the next government - would spare the country further political turmoil. svs / rb / afp / reuters editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the september 4 strike on two fuel trucks in the northeastern kunduz province was the most deadly operation involving german troops since world war two .
the afghan government said the airstrike killed 69 taliban fighters and 30 civilians .
german forces said the bombing targeted the fuel tankers as they were hijacked by taliban insurgents and represented a danger .
in the immediate aftermath , berlin said around 50 militants were killed in the attack but that there were no civilian casualties .
witnesses , however , spoke of several civilian casualties , prompting critical reactions even from germany 's nato allies .
the report said that german authorities have put pressure on nato not to issue an outright condemnation of colonel georg klein because it could lead to legal problems .
this message was given to the nato commander in europe , admiral james stavridis , during a visit to berlin on october 15 .
backing for decision general wolfgang schneiderhan , general inspector of the german army , said on thursday that according to the report , colonel klein , had acted correctly in ordering the strike .

he said the exact death toll in the attack could no longer be determined , adding that the report cited a range of between 17 and 142 casualties .
" the investigation is still under review and no other comment can be made at the moment , " a defense ministry spokesman said when asked about the report in der spiegel .
some eu condemnation the attack , carried out by a us f-5 fighter jet , was condemned by several european foreign ministers .
germany has maintained it was necessary to protect its troops from a possible suicide attack by taliban fighters who had hijacked the trucks .
the spiegel report said colonel klein broke standard operating procedure by ordering air support on the grounds that his troops had come into contact with the enemy , even though international forces were nowhere near the tankers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has 4,200 troops troops in afghanistan the magazine also said klein refused to allow the aircraft to conduct a low-altitude sweep of the area before launching its payload , adding that overcast skies also raised doubts about the appropriateness of ordering a strike while relying on a single human information source and video alone .
the report cited a source familiar with the nato report as saying it also addressed positive sides of klein 's leadership and that it could be used to either condemn or excuse him .
germans remain highly skeptical of military operations more than 60 years after the defeat of the nazis .

samuel k. , an 88-year-old man who lives near bonn , had given descriptions of his time as a guard to investigators in 1969 , 1975 , 1980 and again this past june .
" it was clear to us that jews were killed there and were later burned , too .
we could smell it every day , " the magazine quotes k. as saying .
like demjanjuk , k. was a ukrainian soldier taken prisoner by the nazis .
german authorities say the men volunteered or were recruited to serve as guards in concentration camps .
demjanjuk allegedly served in sobibor and is accused of being an accessory to the murder of 27,900 people , mostly jews .
spiegel said that k. fully acknowledged serving as a guard in the belzec death camp .
but , unlike demjanjuk , who had emigrated to the united states , k. obtained german citizenship and has lived in germany for the last 60 years .
demjanjuk was extradited to germany in september .
his trial is scheduled to begin november 30 in munich. svs / afp / dpa editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

statistics over the past two years have shown a drop in robberies , rapes and murders but with around 50 people being killed every day across the country , concerns about safety remain high as the world cup approaches . but there is equal concern over the safety of the teams and support staff of countries appearing at the tournament , with some people suggesting beefed-up security operations will be needed to keep players from harm . a recent report in the german sport bild magazine suggested that the germany team would be protected by a full escort of armed security guards when the team leaves its base in pretoria and that the players will be required to wear bullet-proof vests . quotes attributed to guenter schnelle from baysecur , a private security firm which looks after the germany team at away games , suggest that the movement of players outside of their hotel should be kept to a minimum . the overall impression given by the sport bild article and the quotes – which schnelle later denied making – is that germany and the other teams at the world cup will be under siege . federation rejects vest suggestion germany 's dfb football federation spokesman harald stenger told deutsche welle that bullet-proof vests had not even been discussed as an option and that a security operation for the germany team while they are in south africa has not been finalized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach jogi loew 's only worry should be the performance of his team " the person and firm mentioned in the article have not spoken to the dfb about these security issues , " stenger said , saying that the dfb 's security officer is currently in south africa assessing the situation .
when he returns , stenger said , the organization will then determine if additional security is needed . " once the draw for the tournament is made on december 4 , we will again assess the situation and discuss and finalize our plans together with fifa and the south african authorities . " no drastic changes expected stenger said that he did n't expect any drastic change to the security operations that are usually in place when the germany team plays abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack and co. will be as secure as usual in south africa , the dfb says according to him , a private security firm with two to four security staff is employed to travel with the national team and its entourage .
in south africa , there may be additional security operatives deployed from the german federal police -lrb- bka -rrb- because of the location of a media center at the hotel where players will stay . " but we will not be making a big deal just because it is south africa , " he added .
" we are aware of the crime rate but we are not afraid .
there is crime everywhere when you travel with a national team . " dfb security boss helmut spahn told reporters before leaving for south africa that the federation is looking to recruit 20 extra security guards for the team 's stay at their five-star accommodation at the velmore grande hotel in the south african province of gauteng . " we will probably use more personnel than we would normally have , " said spahn . author : nick amies editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's a great honor for the chancellor , but equally great are the expectations of the obama administration . when chancellor merkel steps up to the lectern on tuesday inside the capitol building in washington , she will have achieved something that only one german post-war chancellor before her had done : to give an address before members of congress .
and actually , the speech which konrad adenauer , the first chancellor of the new federal republic , gave to congress on may 28 , 1957 was at a reception given by the house of representatives , not an address to a joint session of congress .
so according to official protocol , chancellor merkel 's speech on capitol hill is a first for a german head of government .
the fact that the recently re-elected chancellor is only the second foreign dignitary to speak before congress since president barack obama took office underlines the symbolic importance of the event .
the other leader granted this privilege was britain 's prime minister gordon brown .
" i think it is a big deal , " john hulsman , an american foreign policy expert based in germany , told deutsche welle .
" the us is a republic and a relatively new country , that does n't have a lot of symbolism .
to speak to a joint session of congress is about as big an honor as can be bestowed on a foreign leader . "
as nancy pelosi , speaker of the house of representatives and the official host of angela merkel said , the german chancellor was invited to commemorate the upcoming 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall .
respected leader and although not officially stated , merkel was also asked to speak to congress because she is highly respected in washington .
under president obama , merkel 's stature in the us capital has only increased - especially when compared to other european heads of governments .
" mrs. merkel as german chancellor is held in high esteem ; her competence and her standing is internationally recognized , " joerg himmelreich , senior trans-atlantic fellow at the german marshall fund in berlin , told deutsche welle .
" germany is definitely the european power washington needs to work with in order to conduct trans-atlantic relations and carry out the multilateral approach that - in contrast to his predecessor - is a goal for the obama administration , " he added .
while the future of german-american relations will play a major role in merkel 's address before congress , history will also be present .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gordon brown is the only other foreign leader invited to speak before congress under president obama " she will probably , and this is very important as a message to the american people as a whole , express her gratitude for the invaluable contribution the first president bush made to the fall of the berlin wall and therefore to german unity , " said himmelreich .
the chancellor is also expected to highlight the importance of german-american relations as a pillar of foreign policy for the new german government .
in addition , merkel will probably talk about international efforts in combating climate change , a sensitive topic to which president obama is more open than congress .
with a giant american flag draped behind her , framed by us vice president joe biden and house speaker nancy pelosi , merkel 's speech before congress will be saturated in symbolism .
but even more important than the official address itself could be the chancellor 's planned meeting with the president .
demand for discussions even though obama and merkel will probably only get together for either a lunch or a dinner , this could be the moment when important matters are addressed .
" i think that 's just the right amount of time to make specific , concrete demands off the record , " said hulsman .
" any longer you are going to get into bigger things , any shorter and it 's sound bites . "
there is an eagerness in the us to finally engage in serious talks with berlin .
the german election campaign put many important topics on ice until a new government was elected .
" washington and the new us administration gladly granted merkel this grace period , " said himmelreich .
" but now president obama would like to know what the new german government thinks about transatlantic relations and obama himself will surely also express his ideas and wishes . " his colleague hulsman put it more bluntly , calling it " put up or shut up time . "
after waiting patiently for the outcome of the german election , the obama administration now wants to know what to expect from berlin .
" beneath all the symbolism and niceness there is an insistent push that now it 's time for germany to step up to the plate , " he said .
afghan strategy high on the agenda for washington is the question of what the new german government wants to contribute in the future to the afghanistan mission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's contribution to afghanistan will be on the agenda the internal debate in the white house about the request by the us commander in afghanistan for additional troops is in the final stages and the experts expect that obama will let the chancellor in on his thinking about his upcoming decision .
merkel could be asked about how germany will provide concrete help in afghanistan if it does n't want to send more troops .
other topics such as iran , climate change and the economic crisis could then be discussed in a similar fashion - openly and not shying away from possible disagreements .
this kind of detailed and frank discussion with germany about foreign policy has been missing , noted hulsman .
instead of concrete policy solutions discussions often focused on grand strategic disagreements between the two countries .
policy solutions now when practical policies are key , obama ca n't find a more suitable partner than merkel , according to hulsman .
" mrs. merkel is not a great orator , she 's not flashy , but she 's incredibly effective in meetings , " he said , adding that with her grasp of policy detail she can not only hold her own against obama , but also put pressure on the president himself .
" she 's intellectually capable of having this nuts-and-bolts policy discussion that 's so desperately needed , " he said .
if the planned meeting between merkel and obama does in fact signal the start of a new phase of open and honest exchange between washington and berlin , than merkel 's trip will have been not only symbolic , but also a sustainable success .

the kassel museum of sepulchral culture takes a look at these traditions via artefacts and multimedia .
the airy , modern museum building is perched on the highest point of kassel 's city center .
the architectural style is meant to be a contrast to the ominous subject matter .
of loss and flamenco dancing the universal experience of mourning and loss has been a key creative force since the beginning of time .
so it is no surprise that , in addition to the expected artefacts surrounding the european culture of death and mourning , the museum offers some creative programming as well .
take dancing , for instance .
the museum has had flamenco dance on its program because it is a form of dance that expresses a spectrum of emotions according to museum director reiner soerries .
" there are scores of films in which flamenco is danced as an expression of lost love , and in which all of that anger and rage manifests itself in the dance , " soerries said .
" that type of loss follows us throughout life , and we need to find ways to express it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a connection between dance and death , experts say of course , the museum features the expected artefacts as well , displaying coffins , hearses , and mourning clothing and jewelry , primarily from central europe .
the collection focuses " on german sepulchral culture beginning with the early modern era , from approximately the 16th and 17th century on .
however , we like to look past the horizon with our special exhibitions , " soerries said .
for instance , the museum might look back at antiquity with an exhibition about the etruscan cult of the dead , or delve into other cultures ' attitudes and habits surrounding death .
colorful coffins one such exhibit focused on coffins from ghana .
that country has largely abandoned traditional , sombre coffins , instead painting them in bright colors and building them in the shapes of musical instruments , cars , or animals - any object that symbolizes what the deceased person cared about during his or her lifetime .
a ghanaian coffin that is shaped like a rooster is now in the museum ’ s permanent collection .
even aside from the occasional flamenco program , dancing shows up in other exhibits : near the ghanaian coffins are two costumes complete with large masks resembling asian dragons .
they are part of a traditional tibetan dance of the dead , which plays on a video screen at the museum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ghana is known for creative and bright coffins plague art what would a european museum of death be without reference to the great plague ?
the museum displays works of art from the 15th and 16th centuries - when the bubonic plague spread throughout europe - showing a skeletal death figure dancing in circles with humans .
one painting originating from basel , switzerland shows a group of 42 pairs of figures , and one partner in each pair is human , while the other is the figure of death . the human figure in each pair may be " the emperor , the pope , a king or a nobleman .
but it could also be a mother , a child , or a beggar .
which is to say : death is everyone ’ s companion , regardless of their rank or name . "

the september 4 strike on two fuel trucks in the northeastern kunduz province was the most deadly operation involving german troops since world war two .
the afghan government said the airstrike killed 69 taliban fighters and 30 civilians .
german forces said the bombing targeted the fuel tankers as they were hijacked by taliban insurgents and represented a danger .
in the immediate aftermath , berlin said around 50 militants were killed in the attack but that there were no civilian casualties .
witnesses , however , spoke of several civilian casualties , prompting critical reactions even from germany 's nato allies .
the report said that german authorities have put pressure on nato not to issue an outright condemnation of colonel georg klein because it could lead to legal problems .
this message was given to the nato commander in europe , admiral james stavridis , during a visit to berlin on october 15 .
backing for decision general wolfgang schneiderhan , general inspector of the german army , said on thursday that according to the report , colonel klein , had acted correctly in ordering the strike .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghans are becoming increasingly angry over rising civilian casualties " in light of the results of the report , i have no reason to doubt that german soldiers acted in the correct military fashion , given their mandate from the united nations and the difficult operational situation , " schneiderhan said .
he said the exact death toll in the attack could no longer be determined , adding that the report cited a range of between 17 and 142 casualties .
" the investigation is still under review and no other comment can be made at the moment , " a defense ministry spokesman said when asked about the report in der spiegel .
some eu condemnation the attack , carried out by a us f-5 fighter jet , was condemned by several european foreign ministers .
germany has maintained it was necessary to protect its troops from a possible suicide attack by taliban fighters who had hijacked the trucks .
the spiegel report said colonel klein broke standard operating procedure by ordering air support on the grounds that his troops had come into contact with the enemy , even though international forces were nowhere near the tankers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has 4,200 troops troops in afghanistan the magazine also said klein refused to allow the aircraft to conduct a low-altitude sweep of the area before launching its payload , adding that overcast skies also raised doubts about the appropriateness of ordering a strike while relying on a single human information source and video alone .
the report cited a source familiar with the nato report as saying it also addressed positive sides of klein 's leadership and that it could be used to either condemn or excuse him .
germans remain highly skeptical of military operations more than 60 years after the defeat of the nazis .
it was only a decade ago that german troops participated in their first foreign combat mission since the war .
opinion polls indicate a majority of germans want the over 4,000 german troops deployed in afghanistan as part of the six-year-old nato mission to come home. rb / afp / reuters editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in remarks at the national congress of young liberals on sunday in saarbruecken , westerwelle said the situation in afghanistan required a level-headed reaction and that now " the election process should be completed in accordance with law and order . "
meanwhile , british prime minister gordon brown said that abdullah had told him that his decision to pull out was " in the interests of national unity . "
brown said that afghan president hamid karzai had called him after abdullah 's announcement to say that he wanted to issue a " unity manifesto " for the afghan people .
he added that he could n't rule out abdullah 's inclusion in a unity government .
" i do n't think anything is being ruled out .
but i think what is more likely is once the decision has been made about the second round election , president karzai , or whoever is president , will want to unify the country , " brown said sunday .
abdullah abdullah told supporters in kabul on sunday that he was withdrawing from the november 7 contest to protest what he described as " misconduct " by the government and the country 's electoral commission .
he said he made the decision after his demands to avoid a repeat of massive first-round fraud were rejected by karzai .
" the decision … was not an easy one .
it was a decision that i have taken after wide-ranging consultations with the people of afghanistan , my supporters and influential leaders , " abdullah said in a lengthy address .
the former foreign minister went on to launch a scathing attack on karzai 's eight-year rule , dimming any hopes that the two rivals could yet agree on some form of power-sharing agreement .
" we have had eight years of lost opportunities because of the weakness of the government , " he said to applause from around 2,000 supporters .
demand to sack top officials following the widespread fraud in the first round on august 20 , abdullah demanded that karzai sack the head of the electoral commission , azizullah ludin , and suspend four ministers who campaigned for the incumbent .
the abdullah camp had set a deadline of saturday for karzai to yield to the demands , saying that he would not take part in a contest that would not be free and fair .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamid karzai reluctantly agreed to the run-off election however , his demands received short shrift , with electoral authorities saying ludin could only be dismissed by afghanistan 's supreme court , while karzai said abdullah had no right to interfere with ministerial positions .
" the election commission was not independent .
it was their job to ensure a credible election and we saw what happened , " abdullah said .
" the people were deprived of their democratic rights . "
" poll will be held " speaking on afghan television shortly before abdullah 's announcement , karzai 's campaign spokesman indicated that the election would still go ahead .
" the election law says that in the event of a second round , the candidates must participate , " the spokesman told a private television station .
" the conditions -lrb- set by abdullah -rrb- were impractical and had no basis in law .
these conditions were never received by us but only given to unama , " karzai 's spokesman added , referring to the un mission in afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai 's former foreign minister has become a formidable rival karzai 's share of the vote in the first round fell to 49.67 percent after a un-backed watchdog deemed around a quarter of all votes cast to be fraudulent .
insisting that the fraud had been overstated , karzai only agreed to a second round under extensive diplomatic pressure from washington .
abdullah won just over 30 percent of the vote in the first round , prompting some observers to point out that it would have been a colossal feat for karzai 's lone remaining challenger to win the race .
afghanistan has been wracked by weeks of political uncertainty and security remains a major concern after a resurgent taliban vowed to disrupt the presidential run-off .
ahead of sunday 's announcement , some analysts and diplomats had suggested that abdullah 's withdrawal from the contest - as part of a power-sharing deal in return for a key government post in the next government - would spare the country further political turmoil. svs / rb / afp / reuters editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

advertisement a lengthy queue of students waiting to clear immigration at heathrow immigration officers have warned bosses that new rules designed to stop bogus students entering the uk are not working , the bbc has learned .
non-eu students are supposed to apply to registered institutions , and must prove they can support themselves .
but claims are now verified in the students ' home countries , and uk staff say they have limited ability to challenge those they suspect .
the uk border agency insists all entrants must meet immigration rules .
pressure one heathrow airport immigration officer - speaking on condition of anonymity - told bbc radio 5 live 's donal macintyre programme that uk staff were overwhelmed by the volume of student arrivals .
anyone coming in to the uk must satisfy the border force officer that they meet the immigration rules jeremy oppenheim uk border agency " student season has extended now to virtually the whole year , " he said .
" we are looking at upwards of 500 to 1,000 stuck in the hall , queues stretching for hundreds of yards down the terminal .
" on occasions we 've had to shut the hall as we could n't cope .
" that has led to planes being backed up ... to not allow them to proceed into heathrow until we could clear what we 've got . "
many of these students are entirely legitimate , but he said he and his colleagues are almost powerless to challenge those whom they suspect are not .
" if someone presents a case like that to a chief immigration officer , they take a look at the size and the number of people in the hall , and they turn around and say , ' look , because of the pressure of work , they 've got a visa , get them into the country ' .
" it would take two officers off the desk for hours just to present a case to send them to a detention centre . "
and he believes this means people who have been denied entry to the uk on other grounds are able to enter the uk on bogus student visas .
" we have an awful lot of students who have been refused five , six , even up to nine visas to come here to this country , whether it be for working holidays or student applications , " he said .
" and they 're now coming here . "
proof under the new system , colleges which offer courses to students from outside the european economic area must be accredited by the home office .

media requires javascript to play .
but the heathrow immigration officer alleges that the list of approved institutions contains colleges which he and his colleagues know to have a history of awarding fake qualifications .
" it beggars belief that these places can be graded the way they are , when we know for a fact that we 've proved and got signatures from the passengers that they paid for their certificates , " he said .
the immigration officer told bbc radio 5 live about a recent case of an indian woman in her 50s who presented herself as a student enrolling on an advanced course , despite the fact that she could barely speak english .
" she was going to do an acca accounting course , of which when asked in hindi what acca meant , she did n't have a clue , " he said .
" she was n't even able to say in her own language what the course was going to entail . "
' tightened controls ' these concerns are echoed on an internal uk border agency online message board , seen by the bbc .
one officer wrote : " i can no longer feel proud of my role , given that i am forced on a daily basis to allow entry to passengers who clearly hold no ability or intention to follow any course of study in the united kingdom " .
another commented : " the introduction of the appallingly thought-out points-based system for students has , in one fell swoop , failed the uk taxpayer who expects us to do a good job in tackling illegal immigration . "
the website quotes an acknowledgement from chief executive lin homer that the border agency had " not got it right " on student visas .
but jeremy oppenheim , head of the points-based system at the uk border agency , insisted that the rules were working .
" the points-based system means that only those colleges and schools who provide quality education and take responsibility for their students will be licensed to bring in foreign students , " he told radio 5 live .
" schools and colleges are inspected by accreditation bodies and the uk border agency to ensure they are genuine .
before we tightened controls , around 4,000 uk institutions were bringing in international students .
this currently stands at around 2,000 .
" anyone coming in to the uk must satisfy the border force officer that they meet the immigration rules and will comply with any conditions attached to their visa .
if they can not , the officer can and will refuse entry . "

advertisement a lengthy queue of students waiting to clear immigration at heathrow immigration officers have warned bosses that new rules designed to stop bogus students entering the uk are not working , the bbc has learned .
non-eu students are supposed to apply to registered institutions , and must prove they can support themselves .
but claims are now verified in the students ' home countries , and uk staff say they have limited ability to challenge those they suspect .
the uk border agency insists all entrants must meet immigration rules .
pressure one heathrow airport immigration officer - speaking on condition of anonymity - told bbc radio 5 live 's donal macintyre programme that uk staff were overwhelmed by the volume of student arrivals .
anyone coming in to the uk must satisfy the border force officer that they meet the immigration rules jeremy oppenheim uk border agency " student season has extended now to virtually the whole year , " he said .
" we are looking at upwards of 500 to 1,000 stuck in the hall , queues stretching for hundreds of yards down the terminal .
" on occasions we 've had to shut the hall as we could n't cope .
" that has led to planes being backed up ... to not allow them to proceed into heathrow until we could clear what we 've got . "
many of these students are entirely legitimate , but he said he and his colleagues are almost powerless to challenge those whom they suspect are not .
" if someone presents a case like that to a chief immigration officer , they take a look at the size and the number of people in the hall , and they turn around and say , ' look , because of the pressure of work , they 've got a visa , get them into the country ' .
" it would take two officers off the desk for hours just to present a case to send them to a detention centre . "
and he believes this means people who have been denied entry to the uk on other grounds are able to enter the uk on bogus student visas .
" we have an awful lot of students who have been refused five , six , even up to nine visas to come here to this country , whether it be for working holidays or student applications , " he said .
" and they 're now coming here . "
proof under the new system , colleges which offer courses to students from outside the european economic area must be accredited by the home office .

media requires javascript to play .
but the heathrow immigration officer alleges that the list of approved institutions contains colleges which he and his colleagues know to have a history of awarding fake qualifications .
" it beggars belief that these places can be graded the way they are , when we know for a fact that we 've proved and got signatures from the passengers that they paid for their certificates , " he said .
the immigration officer told bbc radio 5 live about a recent case of an indian woman in her 50s who presented herself as a student enrolling on an advanced course , despite the fact that she could barely speak english .
" she was going to do an acca accounting course , of which when asked in hindi what acca meant , she did n't have a clue , " he said .
" she was n't even able to say in her own language what the course was going to entail . "
' tightened controls ' these concerns are echoed on an internal uk border agency online message board , seen by the bbc .
one officer wrote : " i can no longer feel proud of my role , given that i am forced on a daily basis to allow entry to passengers who clearly hold no ability or intention to follow any course of study in the united kingdom " .
another commented : " the introduction of the appallingly thought-out points-based system for students has , in one fell swoop , failed the uk taxpayer who expects us to do a good job in tackling illegal immigration . "
the website quotes an acknowledgement from chief executive lin homer that the border agency had " not got it right " on student visas .
but jeremy oppenheim , head of the points-based system at the uk border agency , insisted that the rules were working .
" the points-based system means that only those colleges and schools who provide quality education and take responsibility for their students will be licensed to bring in foreign students , " he told radio 5 live .
" schools and colleges are inspected by accreditation bodies and the uk border agency to ensure they are genuine .
before we tightened controls , around 4,000 uk institutions were bringing in international students .
this currently stands at around 2,000 .
" anyone coming in to the uk must satisfy the border force officer that they meet the immigration rules and will comply with any conditions attached to their visa .
if they can not , the officer can and will refuse entry . "
