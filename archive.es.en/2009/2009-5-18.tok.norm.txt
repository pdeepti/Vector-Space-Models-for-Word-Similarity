dw spoke to acclaimed physicist eicke weber , who worked in the us for 23 years , about his decision to come back to germany . after 23 years of research in the usa , which he put an end to after teaching materials science at the university of california in berkeley , professor eicke weber finally came home to germany .
on july 1 , 2006 , the physicist and materials researcher became director of the fraunhofer institute for solar energy systems ise in freiburg , southern germany .
what shaped your decision to come back to germany after working in the us as a researcher for over two decades ?
the united states is a unique place worldwide because it is attractive for people from around the world for active and energetic people and of course for scientists who are looking for excellent working conditions .
the united states therefore really attracts the best scientists from around the world .
the universities in the us offer many attractive positions .
they offer a level playing field to compete for funds for research .
the result is that competition is much tougher than , say , in germany .
but those who continuously have good ideas and stay ahead of the others have good opportunities .
on the other hand , this " brain drain " is n't good for other countries .
that means that europe and asia have to make sure they create attractive conditions for people to come back to .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fraunhofer insitut in freiburg focuses on research in solar energy and energy efficiency the kind of institute i came back to - fraunhofer - is a very special government laboratory because it is a government-sponsored institute , but basically it has to earn its money through its own success .
in my institute , basic funding from the government is down to 10 percent - that means 90 percent is based on our success in bringing in projects , half from industry and half from government sources .
this creates a competitive atmosphere , -lsb- which -rsb- i liked so much while working in the us .
i must say i was very happy to have this opportunity to come back to .
american research institutes offer substantially higher salaries than institutes in germany .
is that one of the main reasons scientists find it difficult to return to countries such as germany ?
it 's a whole package of things .
i have been quite involved in this topic - when i was in the us i founded an organization called " german scholars organization " to help german scholars find interesting jobs in germany .
and what was frequently mentioned was that the salary is not the problem but rather the structure of the system .
in the us , you can enter the university as i did - as an untenured assistant professor , and if you are successful , you can obtain tenure .
and after 10 years , you can progress to be a full professor .
in the german system , you have boxes - that means your eyes are on the assistant professor level and then you have to go to another university to progress and get a permanent position .
this is of course completely unpredictable because you never know what kind of people you are competing with for the new position .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weber says it 's easier to plan a career as a researcher in the us so in the united states , you can plan your career much better .
it 's much more dependant on your own success and your own contribution to science and technology , whereas in germany it depends on factors that are difficult to control .
that means that when you apply for a position , it 's always a gamble , you never know who the other competitors are , you do n't the preferences of the people who want to hire you .
in all the discussions with foreign scholars in the united states , there 's agreement that the us provides very predictable working conditions where everything depends on how good you are .
you set up the " german scholars organization " in the united states in 2003 .
was the idea to build bridges between germany and the us ?
yes , exactly .
as a scholar in the us , you really feel like you are -lsb- out -rsb- in the world and you are approached by universities or industry who want to hire you .
you do n't have a similar type of approach from german employers .
basically you 're not in the country anymore and you have to make big efforts to stay in touch and get to know what 's going on in germany .
at that point we thought an organization that concentrates on building this bridge between very interested employers in germany and those scholars abroad would make a difference .
it did .
we managed to attract a particularly interesting program from the krupp foundation .
the foundation gave us several million euros to provide scholarships of $ 100,000 -lrb- 74,000 euros -rrb- for returning scholars on university positions in germany .
the scholars who got this grant said it made a big difference to them .
so there are things that can be done with relatively modest means in order to make a return to germany more attractive .
have you continued with the focus of your research as head of the fraunhofer institute for solar energy in freiburg ?
yes , as a matter of fact when i came to freiburg , the fraunhofer institute was so interested in my own research that they provided me with a very big research grant so we could set up a whole laboratory to pursue research to make good solar cells from silicon with high impurity content .
of course , this is what i 'm very interested in .
on the other hand , leading an institute with 800 people with a budget of 15 million euros means that i do n't have too much time to be involved in research on a day-to-day basis .
but for me it 's very satisfying that from my director 's level i can make sure that the things i 'm interested in get the support they deserve .
i can really say that i 'm very impressed with the quality of the people and their enthusiasm .
everybody there knows that we are working on something which is important for the future of the world .
and therefore though our salaries are not very competitive , compared to the salaries offered in the industry , many stay - though they could easily double their salaries - because they like the freedom and the atmosphere we provide .

once labelled a neo-liberal , the former imf chief now argues in favor of a strong state . the success of germany 's president can be measured by the reputation he or she has managed to build with the general public .
as such , horst koehler has achieved quite a bit .
two-thirds of germans would like to see koehler stay on .
koehler is at the same time the most popular politician in the country .
chancellor angela merkel was pleased when koehler announced he would stand for a second term . " over the past few years , he has won the hearts of the people in germany with his open-minded approach and by speaking uncomfortable truths , " she said . diligence and curiosity instead of vision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler on a visit to rwanda koehler 's often thinly veiled criticism of the political machinations in berlin has boosted his standing with the general public .
in contrast to his predecessors the economist was not a politician prior to his election .
koehler was the head of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , and he still shies away from the goings-on in berlin . the 66-year-old , who has been in office since july 2004 , does not excel through great vision or gripping speeches .
he is not a particularly talented orator , which is a strong handicap , especially since the public looks to the president 's speeches for guidance .
koehler compensates for this with diligence , tackling problems head on and his showing an honest curiosity in areas where many long-serving politicians only feign interest . africa vs new york investment banks in his own country , koehler 's main concern has been improving youth education , especially for young migrants .
outside germany , his efforts have focused on one of the challenges of globalization : the growing chasm between rich and poor .
koehler has been particularly dedicated to africa , which featured high on his travel list .
" for me , the fate of africa will decide how humane our world really is , " he said .
" and we know today that it would have been less risky to build a train line right across africa than invest in a distinguished new york investment bank . " koehler has backed up his pledge to be an uncomfortable president .
he twice refused to sign legislation that the governing coalition had passed and in several cases he questioned whether bills were constitutional , but ultimately left the decision to germany 's highest court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler was instrumental in bringing an end to gerhard schroeder 's chancellorship koehler 's most important official act was to dissolve parliament in july 2005 , following a request by then chancellor gerhard schroeder , the predecessor of angela merkel . schroeder , intent on snap elections , had consciously stage-managed his defeat in a no-confidence vote . nevertheless , koehler gave the green light for snap elections , and the majority of germans would have made the same decision . pushing for reform with his constant drive for reform , koehler emancipated himself from chancellor merkel and the christian democratic party , on whose ticket he had taken up office at berlin 's bellevue palace . occasionally he went too far by meddling in daily politics , which is considered unacceptable from a german president .
on one occasion he criticized the governing coalition for extending the period under which unemployment pay could be claimed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bellevue palace , the presidential seat in berlin however , the " neoliberal " tag koehler was stuck with due to his previous post with the imf has started to wear off .

pirate attacks nearly doubled to 102 in the first quarter of this year compared to the same period last year , the international maritime bureau recently reported .
most of the attacks occurred in the gulf of aden and off the eastern coast of somalia , precisely in the area where the international community has sent more than a dozen warships to deter and prevent piracy .
it 's impossible to know how many attacks would have taken place without the presence of navy ships from around the world in the region , experts believe international cooperation needs to be improved to make the fight against piracy more effective .
improving coordination is the aim of a conference in kuala lumpur which gets underway monday and which brings together top maritime experts , diplomats and security officials .
four missions , four commands , one task yet getting everyone on the same page can be a challenge .
bjorn seibert , a research affiliate for security studies at the massachusetts institute of technology , lists the various international missions deployed : " you have the eu 's mission , you have nato 's mission and then you have two combined task forces led by the united states , combined task force 151 and 150 , which operate in the same area with the same task . "
the answer seibert and peter lehr give when asked whether the four missions suffer from a lack of cooperation is clear : " i would say they are hampered at the moment , " argues lehr , a piracy specialist at the university of st. andrews .
he points out that the different missions have different chains of command , different rules of engagement and operate under different domestic laws .
that means that for example dutch or german warships can only apprehend pirates if they pose a threat to their national interests , explains lehr .
" recently a dutch warship arrested pirates and freed yemeni hostages , but then realizing that no national interest was threatened they had to release the pirates , which means they had to bring them on the shore again , letting them actually go back to their pirate ports and then strike again , " says lehr .
" that 's the problem . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes , it 's not clear what to do with pirates when they 're caught a more tragic example of the lack of international cooperation mentioned by both experts happened late last year .
an indian warship sank a thai fishing boat it mistook for a so-called pirate mother ship , killing 15 thai crew members .
" this would be something that under eu rules of engagements would not have been possible , " says lehr .
merging missions the international community has recognized coordination is necessary .
at the beginning of the year the contact group on piracy off the coast of somalia -lrb- cpgsc -rrb- was launched to do exactly that .
while the cpsc is a step forward because it provides a broad framework under the united nations for countries to engage in counter-piracy , it does not provide much help in the concrete fight against pirates taking place every day , the experts say .
instead as a more practical approach , suggests seibert , the europeans should ask themselves whether they really need to participate in four different operations to address the same problem .
the answer could be to merge the eu and nato missions and create one combined structure .
" something like this has been done before in 1992 in bosnia where both the western european union and nato had separate naval forces and they had eventually a unified command " , argues seibert .
" so that 's something that you could look into at least over the long term in somalia too . "
lehr agrees that it is vital to establish one set of rules of engagement under the same chain of command .
" but that 's wishful thinking , that wo n't happen anytime soon , i fear , " he adds and points out that the international community has been faced with the same problem in afghanistan for years .
more air patrols but even if a unified command structure proves to be impossible to implement , there are other measures to bolster the effectiveness of counter-piracy operations , such as increasing the number of airplanes patrolling the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been calls for more air patrols still , given the recent spike in attacks despite the naval missions in the area , do counter-piracy operations stand any realistic chance to stop the pirates ? everybody , especially the navy commanders running the operations , knows that it is impossible to tackle piracy with a naval mission , says lehr . it must be solved on land .
" but you can deny the pirates the long reach they have at the moment .
they are operating from mother ships which give them a reach of up to several hundred nautical miles off their shores .
if you can ferret out these mother ships and either arrest or sink them you will turn this high-sea piracy into coastal piracy again which means it will be less lethal , it will be less of a problem . "

pirate attacks nearly doubled to 102 in the first quarter of this year compared to the same period last year , the international maritime bureau recently reported .
most of the attacks occurred in the gulf of aden and off the eastern coast of somalia , precisely in the area where the international community has sent more than a dozen warships to deter and prevent piracy .
it 's impossible to know how many attacks would have taken place without the presence of navy ships from around the world in the region , experts believe international cooperation needs to be improved to make the fight against piracy more effective .
improving coordination is the aim of a conference in kuala lumpur which gets underway monday and which brings together top maritime experts , diplomats and security officials .
four missions , four commands , one task yet getting everyone on the same page can be a challenge .
bjorn seibert , a research affiliate for security studies at the massachusetts institute of technology , lists the various international missions deployed : " you have the eu 's mission , you have nato 's mission and then you have two combined task forces led by the united states , combined task force 151 and 150 , which operate in the same area with the same task . "
the answer seibert and peter lehr give when asked whether the four missions suffer from a lack of cooperation is clear : " i would say they are hampered at the moment , " argues lehr , a piracy specialist at the university of st. andrews .
he points out that the different missions have different chains of command , different rules of engagement and operate under different domestic laws .
that means that for example dutch or german warships can only apprehend pirates if they pose a threat to their national interests , explains lehr .
" recently a dutch warship arrested pirates and freed yemeni hostages , but then realizing that no national interest was threatened they had to release the pirates , which means they had to bring them on the shore again , letting them actually go back to their pirate ports and then strike again , " says lehr .
" that 's the problem . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes , it 's not clear what to do with pirates when they 're caught a more tragic example of the lack of international cooperation mentioned by both experts happened late last year .
an indian warship sank a thai fishing boat it mistook for a so-called pirate mother ship , killing 15 thai crew members .
" this would be something that under eu rules of engagements would not have been possible , " says lehr .
merging missions the international community has recognized coordination is necessary .
at the beginning of the year the contact group on piracy off the coast of somalia -lrb- cpgsc -rrb- was launched to do exactly that .
while the cpsc is a step forward because it provides a broad framework under the united nations for countries to engage in counter-piracy , it does not provide much help in the concrete fight against pirates taking place every day , the experts say .
instead as a more practical approach , suggests seibert , the europeans should ask themselves whether they really need to participate in four different operations to address the same problem .
the answer could be to merge the eu and nato missions and create one combined structure .
" something like this has been done before in 1992 in bosnia where both the western european union and nato had separate naval forces and they had eventually a unified command " , argues seibert .
" so that 's something that you could look into at least over the long term in somalia too . "
lehr agrees that it is vital to establish one set of rules of engagement under the same chain of command .
" but that 's wishful thinking , that wo n't happen anytime soon , i fear , " he adds and points out that the international community has been faced with the same problem in afghanistan for years .
more air patrols but even if a unified command structure proves to be impossible to implement , there are other measures to bolster the effectiveness of counter-piracy operations , such as increasing the number of airplanes patrolling the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been calls for more air patrols still , given the recent spike in attacks despite the naval missions in the area , do counter-piracy operations stand any realistic chance to stop the pirates ? everybody , especially the navy commanders running the operations , knows that it is impossible to tackle piracy with a naval mission , says lehr . it must be solved on land .
" but you can deny the pirates the long reach they have at the moment .
they are operating from mother ships which give them a reach of up to several hundred nautical miles off their shores .
if you can ferret out these mother ships and either arrest or sink them you will turn this high-sea piracy into coastal piracy again which means it will be less lethal , it will be less of a problem . "

however , if elected president , he says he would look to socialism for inspiration . " my chances to become president are close to zero , " said peter sodann with a chuckle .
the popular actor from communist east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- is disappointed that people are unwilling to accept him as a politician .
a recent survey showed that only four percent of germans were in favor of sodann becoming president on may 23 .
that 's even lower than the percentage of votes the left party , which nominated him , has in the election body on may 23 . the born misfit the 72-year-old may be convincing as the grumpy inspector in the popular crime series " tatort , " but he has muffed his lines thus far on the political stage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other actors have had more success in politics than sodann sodann made his first blunder in an interview when he said that he would like a role in which he could play an inspector and arrest deutsche bank chief josef ackermann .
the media fallout was devastating .
sodann subsequently made several unfortunate comments that did little to calm the critics . sodann rose from humble beginnings as a toolmaker and went on to become an actor , director and theater manager .
off the stage , he was known for challenging authority .
in 1961 , the student cabaret he led was deemed politically unacceptable , and he was held in detention for nine months by the stasi , east germany 's secret police . as an actor at the berliner ensemble under bertolt brecht and helene weigel and later as a theater director , sodann was highly critical of the gdr .
he has said that the fall of the berlin wall was the most important event in his life . still a fan of socialism the actor has promised to contribute a degree of levity to the office of president .
he has said that he does n't want the gdr back , while emphasizing that socialism remains a good idea which embraces justice and solidarity , and that it was a project which was far from finished , in the same way that christianity was as well . sodann said he wants to fulfill his role no matter how hard it might be .
it 's a philosophy that 's in line with his recently published memoires titled " no half measures . " author : bernd graessler -lrb- nk -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

news photos of the stripper , born heather sweet , showing her baring a full bosom during rehearsals led to a complaint by the european broadcasting union , resulting in an order for her to dress more appropriately for the family television show . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : striptease star dita von teese did n't peel off as much as she would have liked to as an event , eurovision is both loved and loathed for its over-the-top , kitschy performances .
moscow organizers managed to arrange a live video connection to astronauts aboard the international space station who launched the audience tele-voting . this year 's result was decided by a combination of audience tele-voting and decisions by expert juries in the 42 participating countries , although only 25 nations actually made it to the final round in moscow . the russian organizers reportedly spent over 30 million euros on this year 's contest , making it the most expensive competition in eurovision 's history . moscow fails to dazzle gay scene however , the customary glitz and kitsch did not manage to blot out political controversy that started well ahead of the event .
organizers had banned georgia 's entry earlier this year because its song was considered a political jab at the host country russia .
the neighbors had fought a brief war late last august . eurovision is known to be immensely popular among the european gay scene .
on saturday , dozens of riot police detained gay rights protesters who had defied the moscow authorities and tried to stage a demonstration against homophobia which had previously been banned . the leading russian gay activist nikolai alexeyev had urged contestants to boycott eurovision in protest against " russia 's state oppression of human rights " . this year 's winner rybak appeared to throw his support behind the gay rights protesters when he said at a news conference : " why did they -lrb- the moscow police -rrb- spend all their energy stopping gays in moscow when the biggest gay parade was here tonight ? " more than just a laugh ? since eurovision 's inception in 1956 , the show has undergone various changes .
its perception among european viewers has also changed drastically over the years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abba 's victory in 1974 marked the swedish band 's international breakthrough the competition rules state that each country is allowed to choose its own act , and that all vocals must be performed live . initially each country was also obliged to sing in one of its official languages .
however , this rule has been changed several times , allowing participants to resort to english vocals , which have booked the most wins in the history of the competition . all-time greats abba launched their international career by winning the show in 1974 with their smash hit " waterloo " .
but critics say the event has meanwhile degenerated into little more than a circus of mediocre songwriting and sometimes even embarrassing acts .
its fiercest opponents say the song contest has become little more than a joke with viewers merely tuning in for a laugh or a cringe . however , critics can not deny that the show is watched by an estimated television audience of over 100 million people every year , making it one of the most viewed events on the planet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicole 's song for peace gave germany its sole eurovision victory in 1982 ireland currently leads the overall table with seven wins , while germany only managed one victory back in 1982 with the song " ein bisschen frieden " -lrb- a little peace -rrb- , which was performed by 17-year-old singer nicole . norway now boasts three wins and as this year 's victor will host the next eurovision song contest in 2010 . nk / dpa / afp / ap / reuters editor : kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 18.05.2009 vw looking for clarity as talks break off with porsche großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche might now be keeping its distance from vw german automaker volkswagen says it has suspended talks on a possible merger with porsche after workers at the german luxury sports car maker said they would protest against alleged takeover plans . sources at volkswagen in wolfsburg said porsche was not in a financial position to stem a merger and did not appear to be sincerely interested in a takeover bid by vw either .
porsche 's management , they said , did not realize how dicey the situation was for the sports carmaker .
" for a merger of volkswagen and porsche , we need to systematically analyze the current situation of porsche and we need to have a clear picture of the actual conditions there , " volkswagen ceo martin winterkorn was quoted as saying in monday ’ s edition of the berliner zeitung .
volkswagen would need " full transparency " to continue talks , he said .
vw 's chief labor representative , bernd osterloh , said the talks set for monday had been called off because " the current atmosphere was not conducive to a constructive dialog . "
" we were not the ones who had asked for talks and we will not allow volkswagen and individuals in our company to be disparaged just because porsche has no clear strategy , " osterloh said .
friction between the two sides intensified after the porsche and piech families , who control the two carmakers with crossover share holdings , instructed the companies to draft merger plans within the past weeks .
in the negotiations it emerged that the more likely scenario would be that volkswagen would instead end up swallowing porsche .
the economic crisis has changed the equation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the porsche 911 has been the carmaker 's biggest seller over the years in one of germany 's great corporate takeover battles , porsche last year managed to buy a controlling stake in the vastly larger volkswagen .
but the tables were turned this year following the global economic meltdown , which severely hit the auto industry , with porsche looking to volkswagen , europe 's largest automaker , as a knight in shining armor .
ferdinand piech , vw board chairman , underscored porsche 's predicament last monday when he said that the stuttgart-based company was running short of cash .
the head of the porsche works ' council , uwe hueck , said he plans to lead thousands of workers in a protest march this coming monday to demonstrate against what he called piech 's perceived arrogance .
vw 's osterloh remarked it was time for the porsche family " to clearly say what it wants and what it does n't want . "
porsche , in the meantime , along with another german sports car maker , bmw , is apparently exploring the possibility of state loans to shore up the steep drop in demand for its vehicles .
however , according to monday 's edition of the weekly news magazine , der spiegel , " the two companies have not yet made an official request . "

about 100 employees demonstrated in support of hilgert outside the bank in dusseldorf as members of the state-owned bank 's supervisory board arrived for an evening meeting .
westlb later announced that hilgert 's deputy dietrich voigtländer would initially take over .
hilgert had taken charge a year ago after a purge of the previous management .
westlb , which was hit hard by the global financial crisis , is mainly owned by regional savings banks as well as the state of north-rhine westphalia .
in recent months the savings banks had objected to providing further financial guarantees for westlb .

north-rhine westphalia 's finance minister helmut linssen said on monday that the state government had supported hilgert 's plan .
before bad investments took their toll , westlb operated worldwide .

however , if elected president , he says he would look to socialism for inspiration . " my chances to become president are close to zero , " said peter sodann with a chuckle .
the popular actor from communist east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- is disappointed that people are unwilling to accept him as a politician .
a recent survey showed that only four percent of germans were in favor of sodann becoming president on may 23 .
that 's even lower than the percentage of votes the left party , which nominated him , has in the election body on may 23 . the born misfit the 72-year-old may be convincing as the grumpy inspector in the popular crime series " tatort , " but he has muffed his lines thus far on the political stage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other actors have had more success in politics than sodann sodann made his first blunder in an interview when he said that he would like a role in which he could play an inspector and arrest deutsche bank chief josef ackermann .
the media fallout was devastating .
sodann subsequently made several unfortunate comments that did little to calm the critics . sodann rose from humble beginnings as a toolmaker and went on to become an actor , director and theater manager .
off the stage , he was known for challenging authority .
in 1961 , the student cabaret he led was deemed politically unacceptable , and he was held in detention for nine months by the stasi , east germany 's secret police . as an actor at the berliner ensemble under bertolt brecht and helene weigel and later as a theater director , sodann was highly critical of the gdr .
he has said that the fall of the berlin wall was the most important event in his life . still a fan of socialism the actor has promised to contribute a degree of levity to the office of president .
he has said that he does n't want the gdr back , while emphasizing that socialism remains a good idea which embraces justice and solidarity , and that it was a project which was far from finished , in the same way that christianity was as well . sodann said he wants to fulfill his role no matter how hard it might be .
it 's a philosophy that 's in line with his recently published memoires titled " no half measures . " author : bernd graessler -lrb- nk -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

once labelled a neo-liberal , the former imf chief now argues in favor of a strong state . the success of germany 's president can be measured by the reputation he or she has managed to build with the general public .
as such , horst koehler has achieved quite a bit .
two-thirds of germans would like to see koehler stay on .
koehler is at the same time the most popular politician in the country .
chancellor angela merkel was pleased when koehler announced he would stand for a second term . " over the past few years , he has won the hearts of the people in germany with his open-minded approach and by speaking uncomfortable truths , " she said . diligence and curiosity instead of vision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler on a visit to rwanda koehler 's often thinly veiled criticism of the political machinations in berlin has boosted his standing with the general public .
in contrast to his predecessors the economist was not a politician prior to his election .
koehler was the head of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , and he still shies away from the goings-on in berlin . the 66-year-old , who has been in office since july 2004 , does not excel through great vision or gripping speeches .
he is not a particularly talented orator , which is a strong handicap , especially since the public looks to the president 's speeches for guidance .
koehler compensates for this with diligence , tackling problems head on and his showing an honest curiosity in areas where many long-serving politicians only feign interest . africa vs new york investment banks in his own country , koehler 's main concern has been improving youth education , especially for young migrants .
outside germany , his efforts have focused on one of the challenges of globalization : the growing chasm between rich and poor .
koehler has been particularly dedicated to africa , which featured high on his travel list .
" for me , the fate of africa will decide how humane our world really is , " he said .
" and we know today that it would have been less risky to build a train line right across africa than invest in a distinguished new york investment bank . " koehler has backed up his pledge to be an uncomfortable president .
he twice refused to sign legislation that the governing coalition had passed and in several cases he questioned whether bills were constitutional , but ultimately left the decision to germany 's highest court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler was instrumental in bringing an end to gerhard schroeder 's chancellorship koehler 's most important official act was to dissolve parliament in july 2005 , following a request by then chancellor gerhard schroeder , the predecessor of angela merkel . schroeder , intent on snap elections , had consciously stage-managed his defeat in a no-confidence vote . nevertheless , koehler gave the green light for snap elections , and the majority of germans would have made the same decision . pushing for reform with his constant drive for reform , koehler emancipated himself from chancellor merkel and the christian democratic party , on whose ticket he had taken up office at berlin 's bellevue palace . occasionally he went too far by meddling in daily politics , which is considered unacceptable from a german president .
on one occasion he criticized the governing coalition for extending the period under which unemployment pay could be claimed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bellevue palace , the presidential seat in berlin however , the " neoliberal " tag koehler was stuck with due to his previous post with the imf has started to wear off .
in a speech he gave in march on the financial and economic crisis , he called for a strong state that would implement rules to control the market , seeing as unlimited freedom had proven destructive . koehler 's doubts have been growing steadily as to whether economic growth is a panacea , solving problems and maintaining peace , and he is showing stronger inclination toward a new green deal . author : bernd graessler / neil king editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 18.05.2009 eu foreign ministers condemn suu kyi trial in burma großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists have been protesting the detention and trial of aung san suu kyi european union foreign ministers said that the bloc would look into applying new sanctions to the military regime in burma as they condemned the " show trial " of opposition leader aung san suu kyi . european union foreign ministers agreed on monday to look at how sanctions on burma might be toughened over its treatment of opposition leader aung san suu kyi , but some said only asian nations could influence the military government .
the ministers are set to press their counterparts from the association of south-east asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- to take firm action against burma 's military junta at a may 25 meeting , officials said .
" we have an agreement to investigate more sanctions , we have an agreement that we should pursue the asean track next week ... and we have an agreement that we need to come back to that issue , " british foreign secretary david miliband said after a meeting with eu counterparts in brussels .
unanimous condemnation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been protests around the world the regime 's decision to arrest nobel peace prize winner suu kyi and commit her to what miliband called a " show trial " has provoked outrage in europe and dominated monday 's regular eu talks .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said that the trial against aung san suu kyi was further evidence of the state of human rights in burma .
" the trial against aung san suu kyi is an indication of the continued disregard for basic human rights in myanmar -lrb- burma -rrb- , " steinmeier said on the sidelines of the meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels . " to lock away and sentence -lrb- suu kyi -rrb- does not bring stability or reconciliation .
in this way , the scheduled elections will become a farce , " steinmeier said . " i expect the trial to not only be postponed , but to be immediately stopped and ms suu kyi be set free at last , " the minister added .
the other eu ministers echoed these sentiments , condemning the trial of burma 's pro-democracy icon , which got under way in the capital of rangoon shortly before the start of the meeting in brussels .
no sanctions yet however , despite debating the possibility , the foreign ministers stopped short of bringing in more sanctions against the country 's regime , instead calling for more cooperation with regional powers such as china and india .
" this is not the moment to lower the sanctions , this is the moment to increase them , " said eu foreign policy chief javier solana . the czech government , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , is " ready to discuss the reinforcement of sanctions , " but first there " will be a call on the burmese authorities to release aung san suu kyi , " its foreign minister , jan kohout , said . but other ministers pointed out that the extension of the sanctions had not stopped the burmese regime putting suu kyi on trial just a fortnight before her six years of house arrest were to end . the sanctions " have not achieved much .
this is one of the big problems that we always have with sanction policies , " finnish foreign minister alexander stubb said . instead , a number of top officials called on the eu to step up its cooperation with china , india and other regional actors in a bid to pressurize the burmese regime . " we have to reinforce the dialogue with burma 's neighbours ...
we have been doing all of that , but maybe not in a sufficient way , " eu foreign affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said . " we have to engage with the other countries in the region , " agreed swedish foreign minister carl bildt , whose country will assume the eu presidency on july 1 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the military junta claims suu kyi violated the terms of her house arrest one month ago , eu foreign ministers extended through april 2010 a package of sanctions against some 500 regime figures and their families , as well as against some 80 businesses linked to the regime , in a bid to urge them towards democratic reforms .
suu kyi went on trial on monday , facing up to five years in jail after burma 's government said she had broken the terms of her house arrest in connection with an incident involving us citizen john yettaw , who is alleged to have spent two days in her house this month .
suu kyi , 63 , was expected to plead not guilty to the charges .
the junta 's critics have accused it of using the episode as a pretext to keep suu kyi in jail during a politically sensitive period leading up to a general election planned for next year. mrm / nda / dpa / reuters / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : piracy hansa stavanger arrives at kenyan port after piracy ordeal in gulf of aden , piracy scourge continues unabated fighting piracy militarily has mixed success so far international relations -pipe- 18.05.2009 fighting piracy requires better international cooperation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has soldiers participating in anti-piracy missions as an international conference aimed at fighting somali piracy gets underway , concern remains that international efforts are too disjointed to be effective . the results look bleak .
pirate attacks nearly doubled to 102 in the first quarter of this year compared to the same period last year , the international maritime bureau recently reported .
most of the attacks occurred in the gulf of aden and off the eastern coast of somalia , precisely in the area where the international community has sent more than a dozen warships to deter and prevent piracy .
it 's impossible to know how many attacks would have taken place without the presence of navy ships from around the world in the region , experts believe international cooperation needs to be improved to make the fight against piracy more effective .
improving coordination is the aim of a conference in kuala lumpur which gets underway monday and which brings together top maritime experts , diplomats and security officials .
four missions , four commands , one task yet getting everyone on the same page can be a challenge .
bjorn seibert , a research affiliate for security studies at the massachusetts institute of technology , lists the various international missions deployed : " you have the eu 's mission , you have nato 's mission and then you have two combined task forces led by the united states , combined task force 151 and 150 , which operate in the same area with the same task . "
the answer seibert and peter lehr give when asked whether the four missions suffer from a lack of cooperation is clear : " i would say they are hampered at the moment , " argues lehr , a piracy specialist at the university of st. andrews .
he points out that the different missions have different chains of command , different rules of engagement and operate under different domestic laws .
that means that for example dutch or german warships can only apprehend pirates if they pose a threat to their national interests , explains lehr .
" recently a dutch warship arrested pirates and freed yemeni hostages , but then realizing that no national interest was threatened they had to release the pirates , which means they had to bring them on the shore again , letting them actually go back to their pirate ports and then strike again , " says lehr .
" that 's the problem . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes , it 's not clear what to do with pirates when they 're caught a more tragic example of the lack of international cooperation mentioned by both experts happened late last year .
an indian warship sank a thai fishing boat it mistook for a so-called pirate mother ship , killing 15 thai crew members .
" this would be something that under eu rules of engagements would not have been possible , " says lehr .
merging missions the international community has recognized coordination is necessary .
at the beginning of the year the contact group on piracy off the coast of somalia -lrb- cpgsc -rrb- was launched to do exactly that .
while the cpsc is a step forward because it provides a broad framework under the united nations for countries to engage in counter-piracy , it does not provide much help in the concrete fight against pirates taking place every day , the experts say .
instead as a more practical approach , suggests seibert , the europeans should ask themselves whether they really need to participate in four different operations to address the same problem .
the answer could be to merge the eu and nato missions and create one combined structure .
" something like this has been done before in 1992 in bosnia where both the western european union and nato had separate naval forces and they had eventually a unified command " , argues seibert .
" so that 's something that you could look into at least over the long term in somalia too . "
lehr agrees that it is vital to establish one set of rules of engagement under the same chain of command .
" but that 's wishful thinking , that wo n't happen anytime soon , i fear , " he adds and points out that the international community has been faced with the same problem in afghanistan for years .
more air patrols but even if a unified command structure proves to be impossible to implement , there are other measures to bolster the effectiveness of counter-piracy operations , such as increasing the number of airplanes patrolling the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been calls for more air patrols still , given the recent spike in attacks despite the naval missions in the area , do counter-piracy operations stand any realistic chance to stop the pirates ? everybody , especially the navy commanders running the operations , knows that it is impossible to tackle piracy with a naval mission , says lehr . it must be solved on land .
" but you can deny the pirates the long reach they have at the moment .
they are operating from mother ships which give them a reach of up to several hundred nautical miles off their shores .
if you can ferret out these mother ships and either arrest or sink them you will turn this high-sea piracy into coastal piracy again which means it will be less lethal , it will be less of a problem . "

the ministers are set to press their counterparts from the association of south-east asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- to take firm action against burma 's military junta at a may 25 meeting , officials said .
" we have an agreement to investigate more sanctions , we have an agreement that we should pursue the asean track next week ... and we have an agreement that we need to come back to that issue , " british foreign secretary david miliband said after a meeting with eu counterparts in brussels .
unanimous condemnation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been protests around the world the regime 's decision to arrest nobel peace prize winner suu kyi and commit her to what miliband called a " show trial " has provoked outrage in europe and dominated monday 's regular eu talks .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said that the trial against aung san suu kyi was further evidence of the state of human rights in burma .
" the trial against aung san suu kyi is an indication of the continued disregard for basic human rights in myanmar -lrb- burma -rrb- , " steinmeier said on the sidelines of the meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels . " to lock away and sentence -lrb- suu kyi -rrb- does not bring stability or reconciliation .
in this way , the scheduled elections will become a farce , " steinmeier said . " i expect the trial to not only be postponed , but to be immediately stopped and ms suu kyi be set free at last , " the minister added .
the other eu ministers echoed these sentiments , condemning the trial of burma 's pro-democracy icon , which got under way in the capital of rangoon shortly before the start of the meeting in brussels .
no sanctions yet however , despite debating the possibility , the foreign ministers stopped short of bringing in more sanctions against the country 's regime , instead calling for more cooperation with regional powers such as china and india .
" this is not the moment to lower the sanctions , this is the moment to increase them , " said eu foreign policy chief javier solana . the czech government , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , is " ready to discuss the reinforcement of sanctions , " but first there " will be a call on the burmese authorities to release aung san suu kyi , " its foreign minister , jan kohout , said . but other ministers pointed out that the extension of the sanctions had not stopped the burmese regime putting suu kyi on trial just a fortnight before her six years of house arrest were to end . the sanctions " have not achieved much .
this is one of the big problems that we always have with sanction policies , " finnish foreign minister alexander stubb said . instead , a number of top officials called on the eu to step up its cooperation with china , india and other regional actors in a bid to pressurize the burmese regime . " we have to reinforce the dialogue with burma 's neighbours ...
we have been doing all of that , but maybe not in a sufficient way , " eu foreign affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said . " we have to engage with the other countries in the region , " agreed swedish foreign minister carl bildt , whose country will assume the eu presidency on july 1 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the military junta claims suu kyi violated the terms of her house arrest one month ago , eu foreign ministers extended through april 2010 a package of sanctions against some 500 regime figures and their families , as well as against some 80 businesses linked to the regime , in a bid to urge them towards democratic reforms .
suu kyi went on trial on monday , facing up to five years in jail after burma 's government said she had broken the terms of her house arrest in connection with an incident involving us citizen john yettaw , who is alleged to have spent two days in her house this month .
suu kyi , 63 , was expected to plead not guilty to the charges .
the junta 's critics have accused it of using the episode as a pretext to keep suu kyi in jail during a politically sensitive period leading up to a general election planned for next year. mrm / nda / dpa / reuters / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , if elected president , he says he would look to socialism for inspiration . " my chances to become president are close to zero , " said peter sodann with a chuckle .
the popular actor from communist east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- is disappointed that people are unwilling to accept him as a politician .
a recent survey showed that only four percent of germans were in favor of sodann becoming president on may 23 .
that 's even lower than the percentage of votes the left party , which nominated him , has in the election body on may 23 . the born misfit the 72-year-old may be convincing as the grumpy inspector in the popular crime series " tatort , " but he has muffed his lines thus far on the political stage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other actors have had more success in politics than sodann sodann made his first blunder in an interview when he said that he would like a role in which he could play an inspector and arrest deutsche bank chief josef ackermann .
the media fallout was devastating .
sodann subsequently made several unfortunate comments that did little to calm the critics . sodann rose from humble beginnings as a toolmaker and went on to become an actor , director and theater manager .
off the stage , he was known for challenging authority .
in 1961 , the student cabaret he led was deemed politically unacceptable , and he was held in detention for nine months by the stasi , east germany 's secret police . as an actor at the berliner ensemble under bertolt brecht and helene weigel and later as a theater director , sodann was highly critical of the gdr .
he has said that the fall of the berlin wall was the most important event in his life . still a fan of socialism the actor has promised to contribute a degree of levity to the office of president .
he has said that he does n't want the gdr back , while emphasizing that socialism remains a good idea which embraces justice and solidarity , and that it was a project which was far from finished , in the same way that christianity was as well . sodann said he wants to fulfill his role no matter how hard it might be .
it 's a philosophy that 's in line with his recently published memoires titled " no half measures . " author : bernd graessler -lrb- nk -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the ministers are set to press their counterparts from the association of south-east asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- to take firm action against burma 's military junta at a may 25 meeting , officials said .
" we have an agreement to investigate more sanctions , we have an agreement that we should pursue the asean track next week ... and we have an agreement that we need to come back to that issue , " british foreign secretary david miliband said after a meeting with eu counterparts in brussels .
unanimous condemnation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been protests around the world the regime 's decision to arrest nobel peace prize winner suu kyi and commit her to what miliband called a " show trial " has provoked outrage in europe and dominated monday 's regular eu talks .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said that the trial against aung san suu kyi was further evidence of the state of human rights in burma .
" the trial against aung san suu kyi is an indication of the continued disregard for basic human rights in myanmar -lrb- burma -rrb- , " steinmeier said on the sidelines of the meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels . " to lock away and sentence -lrb- suu kyi -rrb- does not bring stability or reconciliation .
in this way , the scheduled elections will become a farce , " steinmeier said . " i expect the trial to not only be postponed , but to be immediately stopped and ms suu kyi be set free at last , " the minister added .
the other eu ministers echoed these sentiments , condemning the trial of burma 's pro-democracy icon , which got under way in the capital of rangoon shortly before the start of the meeting in brussels .
no sanctions yet however , despite debating the possibility , the foreign ministers stopped short of bringing in more sanctions against the country 's regime , instead calling for more cooperation with regional powers such as china and india .
" this is not the moment to lower the sanctions , this is the moment to increase them , " said eu foreign policy chief javier solana . the czech government , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , is " ready to discuss the reinforcement of sanctions , " but first there " will be a call on the burmese authorities to release aung san suu kyi , " its foreign minister , jan kohout , said . but other ministers pointed out that the extension of the sanctions had not stopped the burmese regime putting suu kyi on trial just a fortnight before her six years of house arrest were to end . the sanctions " have not achieved much .
this is one of the big problems that we always have with sanction policies , " finnish foreign minister alexander stubb said . instead , a number of top officials called on the eu to step up its cooperation with china , india and other regional actors in a bid to pressurize the burmese regime . " we have to reinforce the dialogue with burma 's neighbours ...
we have been doing all of that , but maybe not in a sufficient way , " eu foreign affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said . " we have to engage with the other countries in the region , " agreed swedish foreign minister carl bildt , whose country will assume the eu presidency on july 1 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the military junta claims suu kyi violated the terms of her house arrest one month ago , eu foreign ministers extended through april 2010 a package of sanctions against some 500 regime figures and their families , as well as against some 80 businesses linked to the regime , in a bid to urge them towards democratic reforms .
suu kyi went on trial on monday , facing up to five years in jail after burma 's government said she had broken the terms of her house arrest in connection with an incident involving us citizen john yettaw , who is alleged to have spent two days in her house this month .
suu kyi , 63 , was expected to plead not guilty to the charges .
the junta 's critics have accused it of using the episode as a pretext to keep suu kyi in jail during a politically sensitive period leading up to a general election planned for next year. mrm / nda / dpa / reuters / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 18.05.2009 eu foreign ministers condemn suu kyi trial in burma großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists have been protesting the detention and trial of aung san suu kyi european union foreign ministers said that the bloc would look into applying new sanctions to the military regime in burma as they condemned the " show trial " of opposition leader aung san suu kyi . european union foreign ministers agreed on monday to look at how sanctions on burma might be toughened over its treatment of opposition leader aung san suu kyi , but some said only asian nations could influence the military government .
the ministers are set to press their counterparts from the association of south-east asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- to take firm action against burma 's military junta at a may 25 meeting , officials said .
" we have an agreement to investigate more sanctions , we have an agreement that we should pursue the asean track next week ... and we have an agreement that we need to come back to that issue , " british foreign secretary david miliband said after a meeting with eu counterparts in brussels .
unanimous condemnation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been protests around the world the regime 's decision to arrest nobel peace prize winner suu kyi and commit her to what miliband called a " show trial " has provoked outrage in europe and dominated monday 's regular eu talks .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said that the trial against aung san suu kyi was further evidence of the state of human rights in burma .
" the trial against aung san suu kyi is an indication of the continued disregard for basic human rights in myanmar -lrb- burma -rrb- , " steinmeier said on the sidelines of the meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels . " to lock away and sentence -lrb- suu kyi -rrb- does not bring stability or reconciliation .
in this way , the scheduled elections will become a farce , " steinmeier said . " i expect the trial to not only be postponed , but to be immediately stopped and ms suu kyi be set free at last , " the minister added .
the other eu ministers echoed these sentiments , condemning the trial of burma 's pro-democracy icon , which got under way in the capital of rangoon shortly before the start of the meeting in brussels .
no sanctions yet however , despite debating the possibility , the foreign ministers stopped short of bringing in more sanctions against the country 's regime , instead calling for more cooperation with regional powers such as china and india .
" this is not the moment to lower the sanctions , this is the moment to increase them , " said eu foreign policy chief javier solana . the czech government , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , is " ready to discuss the reinforcement of sanctions , " but first there " will be a call on the burmese authorities to release aung san suu kyi , " its foreign minister , jan kohout , said . but other ministers pointed out that the extension of the sanctions had not stopped the burmese regime putting suu kyi on trial just a fortnight before her six years of house arrest were to end . the sanctions " have not achieved much .
this is one of the big problems that we always have with sanction policies , " finnish foreign minister alexander stubb said . instead , a number of top officials called on the eu to step up its cooperation with china , india and other regional actors in a bid to pressurize the burmese regime . " we have to reinforce the dialogue with burma 's neighbours ...
we have been doing all of that , but maybe not in a sufficient way , " eu foreign affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said . " we have to engage with the other countries in the region , " agreed swedish foreign minister carl bildt , whose country will assume the eu presidency on july 1 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the military junta claims suu kyi violated the terms of her house arrest one month ago , eu foreign ministers extended through april 2010 a package of sanctions against some 500 regime figures and their families , as well as against some 80 businesses linked to the regime , in a bid to urge them towards democratic reforms .
suu kyi went on trial on monday , facing up to five years in jail after burma 's government said she had broken the terms of her house arrest in connection with an incident involving us citizen john yettaw , who is alleged to have spent two days in her house this month .
suu kyi , 63 , was expected to plead not guilty to the charges .
the junta 's critics have accused it of using the episode as a pretext to keep suu kyi in jail during a politically sensitive period leading up to a general election planned for next year. mrm / nda / dpa / reuters / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the result indicated citizens are ready for change in the recession-hit baltic state . european union budget commissioner dalia grybauskaite , who ran as an independent candidate , won 69 percent of the vote .
she came in well ahead of her nearest rival , social democrat algirdas butkevicius , who obtained just 11.87 percent .
the five other candidates lagged even farther behind .
official results showed just over 51 percent of the country 's 2.7 million registered voters turned out , which according to lithuanian law , was just enough for grybauskaite to avoid a runoff ballot .
" i congratulate the lithuanian people for their choice , " the 53-year-old told a cheering crowd at her election quarters , before adding : " the taste of victory is the burden of responsibility . "
grybauskaite takes office at a time when lithuania is struggling to cope with the global economic downturn .
unemployment stands at 15.5 percent , which is the european union 's third highest , while overall salaries are predicted to fall by 12.3 percent this year .
last week , the country 's central bank more than tripled its already doom-laden forecast , saying the economy was likely to shrink by 15.6 percent this year .
with lithuania no longer enjoying the reputation of a fast-growing economic " tiger " as it had after joining the european union in 2004 and up until 2007 , grybauskaite has committed herself to stabilizing the country 's financial status .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rioters in lithuania showed their anger over unpopular reforms " the first challenge is the economic crisis … i think that together we will be able to emerge from these times of hardships much better , much more direct and much richer , " she said .
she has pledged to provide tax breaks for small and medium-sized businesses , stimulate exports and absorb eu aid faster .
the president-elect , who has a martial arts black belt , has also vowed to address allegations of corruption within the current government .
" i believe in transparency and i will demand that quality from everyone .
i do n't appreciate liars or late-comers , " grybauskaite said .
support from incumbent government overall , grybauskaite 's victory has been warmly welcomed in lithuania by both voters and politicians alike .
" we have a good president and i am really happy with what we are trying to achieve .
i am happy that she is coming with a very clear message of change , which is needed very much for lithuania , " prime minister andrius kubilius said .
his conservative party colleague , vytautas landsbergis said grybauskaite would be " energetic , positive and determined to act " .
ahead of the election , grybauskaite won the backing of the ruling conservatives , who did not put up a candidate .
grybauskaite will officially take over the reigns from outgoing president valdas adamkus in july .
the 82-year-old adamkus , who is also non-partisan , will retire after serving two five-year terms , which is the maximum allowed under the lithuanian constitution. cg / dpa / reuters / afp editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to the first-ever poverty atlas released by der paritaetische , one of the big five social welfare organizations in germany , the level of poverty in some eastern parts of the country is up to four times higher than in the south .
the atlas , released on monday in berlin , shows that the german region of western pomerania leads the nation when it comes to poverty , with more than one in four people there living at or below the poverty line .
on the opposite end of the spectrum - as well as the opposite end of the country - the region of schwarzwald-baar-heuberg has a poverty rate of 7.4 percent .
call for countermeasures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schneider is calling for unemployment benefits to be raised speaking at a press conference , association head ulrich schneider criticized the growing regional and social divisions within the country .
many regions , especially those in the east , could easily become dependent on the state to survive , he said , calling for rapid and systematic countermeasures .
those measures include raising long-term unemployment benefits from 351 euros -lrb- $ 474 -rrb- a month to 440 euros as well as doing a better job of applying the economic stimulus package to the regions that really need it .
such an increase would cost up to 10 billion euros per year .

in germany , the term applies to anyone who earns less than 60 percent of the average national wage .
for singles that 's 764 euros -lrb- $ 1,031 -rrb- per month , and for couples without children it 's 1,376 euros .
it comes as no surprise that the regions the atlas shows as having the highest poverty rate also have the highest level of unemployment .
the poverty rate overall in germany is 14.3 percent , with the average in the west of the country being 12.9 percent , 6.6 percent lower than in the east . that corresponds with data provided by the german statistics office , which says that as of january of this year , unemployment was 13.9 percent in the east and 6.9 percent in the west . dividing up the wealth at the unveiling , schneider that new measures to fight poverty should n't include programs like the scrapping bonus .
the 2,500-euro bonus goes to people who have their old cars scrapped and buy a new car .
it 's meant to help the ailing auto industry through the financial crisis .
schneider said a third of the federal funds dedicated to economic stimulus measures , which amount to 10 billion euros , are going to the three states with the lowest poverty levels : bavaria , hesse and baden-wuerttemberg. mrm / dpa / reuters / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to the first-ever poverty atlas released by der paritaetische , one of the big five social welfare organizations in germany , the level of poverty in some eastern parts of the country is up to four times higher than in the south .
the atlas , released on monday in berlin , shows that the german region of western pomerania leads the nation when it comes to poverty , with more than one in four people there living at or below the poverty line .
on the opposite end of the spectrum - as well as the opposite end of the country - the region of schwarzwald-baar-heuberg has a poverty rate of 7.4 percent .
call for countermeasures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schneider is calling for unemployment benefits to be raised speaking at a press conference , association head ulrich schneider criticized the growing regional and social divisions within the country .
many regions , especially those in the east , could easily become dependent on the state to survive , he said , calling for rapid and systematic countermeasures .
those measures include raising long-term unemployment benefits from 351 euros -lrb- $ 474 -rrb- a month to 440 euros as well as doing a better job of applying the economic stimulus package to the regions that really need it .
such an increase would cost up to 10 billion euros per year .
the definition of ' poor ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 14.3 percent of germans are said to live below the poverty line of course , the atlas begs the question : what does poor actually mean ?
in germany , the term applies to anyone who earns less than 60 percent of the average national wage .
for singles that 's 764 euros -lrb- $ 1,031 -rrb- per month , and for couples without children it 's 1,376 euros .
it comes as no surprise that the regions the atlas shows as having the highest poverty rate also have the highest level of unemployment .

according to the first-ever poverty atlas released by der paritaetische , one of the big five social welfare organizations in germany , the level of poverty in some eastern parts of the country is up to four times higher than in the south .
the atlas , released on monday in berlin , shows that the german region of western pomerania leads the nation when it comes to poverty , with more than one in four people there living at or below the poverty line .
on the opposite end of the spectrum - as well as the opposite end of the country - the region of schwarzwald-baar-heuberg has a poverty rate of 7.4 percent .
call for countermeasures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schneider is calling for unemployment benefits to be raised speaking at a press conference , association head ulrich schneider criticized the growing regional and social divisions within the country .
many regions , especially those in the east , could easily become dependent on the state to survive , he said , calling for rapid and systematic countermeasures .
those measures include raising long-term unemployment benefits from 351 euros -lrb- $ 474 -rrb- a month to 440 euros as well as doing a better job of applying the economic stimulus package to the regions that really need it .
such an increase would cost up to 10 billion euros per year .
the definition of ' poor ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 14.3 percent of germans are said to live below the poverty line of course , the atlas begs the question : what does poor actually mean ?
in germany , the term applies to anyone who earns less than 60 percent of the average national wage .
for singles that 's 764 euros -lrb- $ 1,031 -rrb- per month , and for couples without children it 's 1,376 euros .
it comes as no surprise that the regions the atlas shows as having the highest poverty rate also have the highest level of unemployment .
the poverty rate overall in germany is 14.3 percent , with the average in the west of the country being 12.9 percent , 6.6 percent lower than in the east . that corresponds with data provided by the german statistics office , which says that as of january of this year , unemployment was 13.9 percent in the east and 6.9 percent in the west . dividing up the wealth at the unveiling , schneider that new measures to fight poverty should n't include programs like the scrapping bonus .
the 2,500-euro bonus goes to people who have their old cars scrapped and buy a new car .
it 's meant to help the ailing auto industry through the financial crisis .
schneider said a third of the federal funds dedicated to economic stimulus measures , which amount to 10 billion euros , are going to the three states with the lowest poverty levels : bavaria , hesse and baden-wuerttemberg. mrm / dpa / reuters / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

can obama revive the middle east peace process ?
let 's hope he can , say europeans . barack obama vowed to take a different approach to foreign policy , one that would include working closely with allies . at a speech in berlin last summer , then-candidate obama proclaimed that " america has no better partner than europe . "
and european leaders have made it clear they 're counting on obama to push forward the middle east peace process .
obama 's meeting with israel 's prime minister benjamin netanyahu on monday in the white house provides a big chance for obama to live up to his pre-presidential statements on the middle east .
many feel obama , simply by declaring the goal to find a solution for the israeli-palestinian conflict a top priority for his administration , has done more right from the start than both the bush and the clinton administrations .
by naming a special envoy to the region and by stating his support for a so-called two-state solution - that is , the creation of a viable palestinian state next to israel - obama again displayed his commitment to the peace process .
but despite all the early efforts by the obama administration , one important fact remains unchanged : without the support of israel and the palestinians , any push for peace in the region is doomed .
so the big question when obama meets netanyahu is whether the us president can convince the israeli premier , who based on his political past and his recent statements is considered a hardliner , to go along with his vision .
can obama convince netanyahu ?
michael bauer , who heads the project europe and the middle east at munich 's center for applied policy research , puts a damper on hopes for a quick success : " the prospects for a successful resumption of the peace process are not very good at this point . "
bauer lists the international community 's cold reception of the new israeli government , especially its far-right foreign minister avidgor lieberman , the war in gaza which led to a further deterioration of already strained israeli-arab relations , the internal palestinian division between hamas and fatah and the continued israeli settlements as factors that could prove difficult to overcome .
despite those problems , argues nathalie tocci , the measuring stick for obama remains clear : " there is the question first and foremost whether netanyahu will accept the end goal of the road map , which means the acceptance of a two-state solution . "
but as tocci , a senior research fellow at the center for european policy research , is quick to add , merely stating one 's acceptance of common goals is not enough .
" the main issue hindering the accomplishment of progress along the road map was the fact of an absence of an international monitoring presence that could actually monitor the extent to which the obligations by both parties were fulfilled on the ground , " tocci said bauer agrees , saying obama should not rely on rhetoric commitments , but also demand concrete efforts on behalf of the israelis to rebuild confidence , for example by halting the construction of settlements .
europe 's role european leaders voiced their opinions on how obama ought to approach the middle east peace process during his recent visit to the continent .
but other than giving advice , what role can europe really play now that the us has retaken the leadership role ? " the europeans have in many ways played a second part in all the peace negotiations , " says daniel korski , a senior fellow at the european council on foreign relations .
" europeans have in a sense been the paymasters offering the financial incentives for any kind of peace deal .
however , practically they have always been marginalized in part because the israeli government has never been really interested in seeing european governments engaged . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe could play a larger role in peace negotiations but this is changing , korski argues .
first , some europeans are not ready to simply pick up the check again after seeing a lot of their investments go up in smoke in gaza .
and second , there are more pro-israeli leaders in major european capitals than before , providing the chance for europe to engage better with israel .
still , says korski , the question remains unanswered as to what exactly europe 's role could be in the peace process .
europe also has limited influence because it does n't speak with one voice on foreign affairs issues , experts say .
" but that does n't mean that the european union can not play a role , " says bauer .
" maybe it is even good that some member states have better relations with israel and other member states are perceived to be closer to the palestinian side . "
by turning its weakness into an asset , bauer suggests , europe could really act as an honest mediator in the conflict .

" the main issue hindering the accomplishment of progress along the road map was the fact of an absence of an international monitoring presence that could actually monitor the extent to which the obligations by both parties were fulfilled on the ground , " tocci said bauer agrees , saying obama should not rely on rhetoric commitments , but also demand concrete efforts on behalf of the israelis to rebuild confidence , for example by halting the construction of settlements .
europe 's role european leaders voiced their opinions on how obama ought to approach the middle east peace process during his recent visit to the continent .
but other than giving advice , what role can europe really play now that the us has retaken the leadership role ? " the europeans have in many ways played a second part in all the peace negotiations , " says daniel korski , a senior fellow at the european council on foreign relations .
" europeans have in a sense been the paymasters offering the financial incentives for any kind of peace deal .
however , practically they have always been marginalized in part because the israeli government has never been really interested in seeing european governments engaged . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe could play a larger role in peace negotiations but this is changing , korski argues .
first , some europeans are not ready to simply pick up the check again after seeing a lot of their investments go up in smoke in gaza .
and second , there are more pro-israeli leaders in major european capitals than before , providing the chance for europe to engage better with israel .
still , says korski , the question remains unanswered as to what exactly europe 's role could be in the peace process .
europe also has limited influence because it does n't speak with one voice on foreign affairs issues , experts say .
" but that does n't mean that the european union can not play a role , " says bauer .
" maybe it is even good that some member states have better relations with israel and other member states are perceived to be closer to the palestinian side . "
by turning its weakness into an asset , bauer suggests , europe could really act as an honest mediator in the conflict .

can obama revive the middle east peace process ?
let 's hope he can , say europeans . barack obama vowed to take a different approach to foreign policy , one that would include working closely with allies . at a speech in berlin last summer , then-candidate obama proclaimed that " america has no better partner than europe . "
and european leaders have made it clear they 're counting on obama to push forward the middle east peace process .
obama 's meeting with israel 's prime minister benjamin netanyahu on monday in the white house provides a big chance for obama to live up to his pre-presidential statements on the middle east .
many feel obama , simply by declaring the goal to find a solution for the israeli-palestinian conflict a top priority for his administration , has done more right from the start than both the bush and the clinton administrations .
by naming a special envoy to the region and by stating his support for a so-called two-state solution - that is , the creation of a viable palestinian state next to israel - obama again displayed his commitment to the peace process .
but despite all the early efforts by the obama administration , one important fact remains unchanged : without the support of israel and the palestinians , any push for peace in the region is doomed .
so the big question when obama meets netanyahu is whether the us president can convince the israeli premier , who based on his political past and his recent statements is considered a hardliner , to go along with his vision .
can obama convince netanyahu ?
michael bauer , who heads the project europe and the middle east at munich 's center for applied policy research , puts a damper on hopes for a quick success : " the prospects for a successful resumption of the peace process are not very good at this point . "
bauer lists the international community 's cold reception of the new israeli government , especially its far-right foreign minister avidgor lieberman , the war in gaza which led to a further deterioration of already strained israeli-arab relations , the internal palestinian division between hamas and fatah and the continued israeli settlements as factors that could prove difficult to overcome .
despite those problems , argues nathalie tocci , the measuring stick for obama remains clear : " there is the question first and foremost whether netanyahu will accept the end goal of the road map , which means the acceptance of a two-state solution . "
but as tocci , a senior research fellow at the center for european policy research , is quick to add , merely stating one 's acceptance of common goals is not enough .

news photos of the stripper , born heather sweet , showing her baring a full bosom during rehearsals led to a complaint by the european broadcasting union , resulting in an order for her to dress more appropriately for the family television show . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : striptease star dita von teese did n't peel off as much as she would have liked to as an event , eurovision is both loved and loathed for its over-the-top , kitschy performances .
moscow organizers managed to arrange a live video connection to astronauts aboard the international space station who launched the audience tele-voting . this year 's result was decided by a combination of audience tele-voting and decisions by expert juries in the 42 participating countries , although only 25 nations actually made it to the final round in moscow . the russian organizers reportedly spent over 30 million euros on this year 's contest , making it the most expensive competition in eurovision 's history . moscow fails to dazzle gay scene however , the customary glitz and kitsch did not manage to blot out political controversy that started well ahead of the event .
organizers had banned georgia 's entry earlier this year because its song was considered a political jab at the host country russia .
the neighbors had fought a brief war late last august . eurovision is known to be immensely popular among the european gay scene .
on saturday , dozens of riot police detained gay rights protesters who had defied the moscow authorities and tried to stage a demonstration against homophobia which had previously been banned . the leading russian gay activist nikolai alexeyev had urged contestants to boycott eurovision in protest against " russia 's state oppression of human rights " . this year 's winner rybak appeared to throw his support behind the gay rights protesters when he said at a news conference : " why did they -lrb- the moscow police -rrb- spend all their energy stopping gays in moscow when the biggest gay parade was here tonight ? " more than just a laugh ? since eurovision 's inception in 1956 , the show has undergone various changes .
its perception among european viewers has also changed drastically over the years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abba 's victory in 1974 marked the swedish band 's international breakthrough the competition rules state that each country is allowed to choose its own act , and that all vocals must be performed live . initially each country was also obliged to sing in one of its official languages .
however , this rule has been changed several times , allowing participants to resort to english vocals , which have booked the most wins in the history of the competition . all-time greats abba launched their international career by winning the show in 1974 with their smash hit " waterloo " .
but critics say the event has meanwhile degenerated into little more than a circus of mediocre songwriting and sometimes even embarrassing acts .
its fiercest opponents say the song contest has become little more than a joke with viewers merely tuning in for a laugh or a cringe . however , critics can not deny that the show is watched by an estimated television audience of over 100 million people every year , making it one of the most viewed events on the planet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicole 's song for peace gave germany its sole eurovision victory in 1982 ireland currently leads the overall table with seven wins , while germany only managed one victory back in 1982 with the song " ein bisschen frieden " -lrb- a little peace -rrb- , which was performed by 17-year-old singer nicole . norway now boasts three wins and as this year 's victor will host the next eurovision song contest in 2010 . nk / dpa / afp / ap / reuters editor : kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the ministers are set to press their counterparts from the association of south-east asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- to take firm action against burma 's military junta at a may 25 meeting , officials said .
" we have an agreement to investigate more sanctions , we have an agreement that we should pursue the asean track next week ... and we have an agreement that we need to come back to that issue , " british foreign secretary david miliband said after a meeting with eu counterparts in brussels .
unanimous condemnation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been protests around the world the regime 's decision to arrest nobel peace prize winner suu kyi and commit her to what miliband called a " show trial " has provoked outrage in europe and dominated monday 's regular eu talks .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said that the trial against aung san suu kyi was further evidence of the state of human rights in burma .
" the trial against aung san suu kyi is an indication of the continued disregard for basic human rights in myanmar -lrb- burma -rrb- , " steinmeier said on the sidelines of the meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels . " to lock away and sentence -lrb- suu kyi -rrb- does not bring stability or reconciliation .
in this way , the scheduled elections will become a farce , " steinmeier said . " i expect the trial to not only be postponed , but to be immediately stopped and ms suu kyi be set free at last , " the minister added .
the other eu ministers echoed these sentiments , condemning the trial of burma 's pro-democracy icon , which got under way in the capital of rangoon shortly before the start of the meeting in brussels .
no sanctions yet however , despite debating the possibility , the foreign ministers stopped short of bringing in more sanctions against the country 's regime , instead calling for more cooperation with regional powers such as china and india .
" this is not the moment to lower the sanctions , this is the moment to increase them , " said eu foreign policy chief javier solana . the czech government , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , is " ready to discuss the reinforcement of sanctions , " but first there " will be a call on the burmese authorities to release aung san suu kyi , " its foreign minister , jan kohout , said . but other ministers pointed out that the extension of the sanctions had not stopped the burmese regime putting suu kyi on trial just a fortnight before her six years of house arrest were to end . the sanctions " have not achieved much .
this is one of the big problems that we always have with sanction policies , " finnish foreign minister alexander stubb said . instead , a number of top officials called on the eu to step up its cooperation with china , india and other regional actors in a bid to pressurize the burmese regime . " we have to reinforce the dialogue with burma 's neighbours ...
we have been doing all of that , but maybe not in a sufficient way , " eu foreign affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said . " we have to engage with the other countries in the region , " agreed swedish foreign minister carl bildt , whose country will assume the eu presidency on july 1 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the military junta claims suu kyi violated the terms of her house arrest one month ago , eu foreign ministers extended through april 2010 a package of sanctions against some 500 regime figures and their families , as well as against some 80 businesses linked to the regime , in a bid to urge them towards democratic reforms .
suu kyi went on trial on monday , facing up to five years in jail after burma 's government said she had broken the terms of her house arrest in connection with an incident involving us citizen john yettaw , who is alleged to have spent two days in her house this month .
suu kyi , 63 , was expected to plead not guilty to the charges .
the junta 's critics have accused it of using the episode as a pretext to keep suu kyi in jail during a politically sensitive period leading up to a general election planned for next year. mrm / nda / dpa / reuters / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

both sides have expressed a willingness to come to an agreement on complex arms control issues . the us and russia have begun renegotiating the strategic arms reduction treaty -lrb- start -rrb- on monday in moscow .
start , one of the largest and most complex arms control treaties , was signed in 1991 , and expires in december of 2009 .
both washington and moscow have indicated that the political will exists to overcome disagreements on the size , nature and purpose of their nuclear arsenals and strategic weapons .
" there are good chances for bringing our positions closer and for working out agreements , " russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said last week after a meeting with us secretary of state hillary clinton in washington .

the white house said in a statement that the meeting will allow the us and russia an opportunity " to deepen engagement on reducing nuclear weapons , cooperating on non-proliferation , exploring ways to cooperate on missile defense , addressing mutual threats and security challenges . "
disarmament process began at the height of the cold war both sides have come to the conclusion that military deterrence is as effective with less warheads on either side , and have agreed to make cuts in the number of warheads they have deployed to around 1,000 to 1,500 each .
other issues include whether the treaty should cover delivery systems like bombers and missiles , verification procedures and information sharing .
the us and russia both have an interest in ensuring the talks conclude with results .
" in support of its arms control interests and interest in strategic stability more generally , the united states should pursue a much broader and more ambitious set of strategic dialogues , " said former us defense secretary william perry , who is now part of the congressional commission on the strategic posture of the united states .
fjodor lukjanov , editor in chief of the moscow magazine russia in world politics , says a new start treaty is eminently important for russia .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 18.05.2009 eu foreign ministers condemn suu kyi trial in burma großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists have been protesting the detention and trial of aung san suu kyi european union foreign ministers said that the bloc would look into applying new sanctions to the military regime in burma as they condemned the " show trial " of opposition leader aung san suu kyi . european union foreign ministers agreed on monday to look at how sanctions on burma might be toughened over its treatment of opposition leader aung san suu kyi , but some said only asian nations could influence the military government .
the ministers are set to press their counterparts from the association of south-east asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- to take firm action against burma 's military junta at a may 25 meeting , officials said .
" we have an agreement to investigate more sanctions , we have an agreement that we should pursue the asean track next week ... and we have an agreement that we need to come back to that issue , " british foreign secretary david miliband said after a meeting with eu counterparts in brussels .
unanimous condemnation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been protests around the world the regime 's decision to arrest nobel peace prize winner suu kyi and commit her to what miliband called a " show trial " has provoked outrage in europe and dominated monday 's regular eu talks .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said that the trial against aung san suu kyi was further evidence of the state of human rights in burma .
" the trial against aung san suu kyi is an indication of the continued disregard for basic human rights in myanmar -lrb- burma -rrb- , " steinmeier said on the sidelines of the meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels . " to lock away and sentence -lrb- suu kyi -rrb- does not bring stability or reconciliation .
in this way , the scheduled elections will become a farce , " steinmeier said . " i expect the trial to not only be postponed , but to be immediately stopped and ms suu kyi be set free at last , " the minister added .
the other eu ministers echoed these sentiments , condemning the trial of burma 's pro-democracy icon , which got under way in the capital of rangoon shortly before the start of the meeting in brussels .
no sanctions yet however , despite debating the possibility , the foreign ministers stopped short of bringing in more sanctions against the country 's regime , instead calling for more cooperation with regional powers such as china and india .
" this is not the moment to lower the sanctions , this is the moment to increase them , " said eu foreign policy chief javier solana . the czech government , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , is " ready to discuss the reinforcement of sanctions , " but first there " will be a call on the burmese authorities to release aung san suu kyi , " its foreign minister , jan kohout , said . but other ministers pointed out that the extension of the sanctions had not stopped the burmese regime putting suu kyi on trial just a fortnight before her six years of house arrest were to end . the sanctions " have not achieved much .
this is one of the big problems that we always have with sanction policies , " finnish foreign minister alexander stubb said . instead , a number of top officials called on the eu to step up its cooperation with china , india and other regional actors in a bid to pressurize the burmese regime . " we have to reinforce the dialogue with burma 's neighbours ...

suu kyi , 63 , was expected to plead not guilty to the charges .
the junta 's critics have accused it of using the episode as a pretext to keep suu kyi in jail during a politically sensitive period leading up to a general election planned for next year. mrm / nda / dpa / reuters / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

porsche 's management , they said , did not realize how dicey the situation was for the sports carmaker .
" for a merger of volkswagen and porsche , we need to systematically analyze the current situation of porsche and we need to have a clear picture of the actual conditions there , " volkswagen ceo martin winterkorn was quoted as saying in monday ’ s edition of the berliner zeitung .
volkswagen would need " full transparency " to continue talks , he said .
vw 's chief labor representative , bernd osterloh , said the talks set for monday had been called off because " the current atmosphere was not conducive to a constructive dialog . "
" we were not the ones who had asked for talks and we will not allow volkswagen and individuals in our company to be disparaged just because porsche has no clear strategy , " osterloh said .
friction between the two sides intensified after the porsche and piech families , who control the two carmakers with crossover share holdings , instructed the companies to draft merger plans within the past weeks .
in the negotiations it emerged that the more likely scenario would be that volkswagen would instead end up swallowing porsche .
the economic crisis has changed the equation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the porsche 911 has been the carmaker 's biggest seller over the years in one of germany 's great corporate takeover battles , porsche last year managed to buy a controlling stake in the vastly larger volkswagen .
but the tables were turned this year following the global economic meltdown , which severely hit the auto industry , with porsche looking to volkswagen , europe 's largest automaker , as a knight in shining armor .
ferdinand piech , vw board chairman , underscored porsche 's predicament last monday when he said that the stuttgart-based company was running short of cash .
the head of the porsche works ' council , uwe hueck , said he plans to lead thousands of workers in a protest march this coming monday to demonstrate against what he called piech 's perceived arrogance .
vw 's osterloh remarked it was time for the porsche family " to clearly say what it wants and what it does n't want . "
porsche , in the meantime , along with another german sports car maker , bmw , is apparently exploring the possibility of state loans to shore up the steep drop in demand for its vehicles .
however , according to monday 's edition of the weekly news magazine , der spiegel , " the two companies have not yet made an official request . "

dw spoke to acclaimed physicist eicke weber , who worked in the us for 23 years , about his decision to come back to germany . after 23 years of research in the usa , which he put an end to after teaching materials science at the university of california in berkeley , professor eicke weber finally came home to germany .
on july 1 , 2006 , the physicist and materials researcher became director of the fraunhofer institute for solar energy systems ise in freiburg , southern germany .
what shaped your decision to come back to germany after working in the us as a researcher for over two decades ?
the united states is a unique place worldwide because it is attractive for people from around the world for active and energetic people and of course for scientists who are looking for excellent working conditions .
the united states therefore really attracts the best scientists from around the world .
the universities in the us offer many attractive positions .
they offer a level playing field to compete for funds for research .
the result is that competition is much tougher than , say , in germany .
but those who continuously have good ideas and stay ahead of the others have good opportunities .
on the other hand , this " brain drain " is n't good for other countries .
that means that europe and asia have to make sure they create attractive conditions for people to come back to .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fraunhofer insitut in freiburg focuses on research in solar energy and energy efficiency the kind of institute i came back to - fraunhofer - is a very special government laboratory because it is a government-sponsored institute , but basically it has to earn its money through its own success .
in my institute , basic funding from the government is down to 10 percent - that means 90 percent is based on our success in bringing in projects , half from industry and half from government sources .
this creates a competitive atmosphere , -lsb- which -rsb- i liked so much while working in the us .
i must say i was very happy to have this opportunity to come back to .
american research institutes offer substantially higher salaries than institutes in germany .
is that one of the main reasons scientists find it difficult to return to countries such as germany ?
it 's a whole package of things .
i have been quite involved in this topic - when i was in the us i founded an organization called " german scholars organization " to help german scholars find interesting jobs in germany .
and what was frequently mentioned was that the salary is not the problem but rather the structure of the system .
in the us , you can enter the university as i did - as an untenured assistant professor , and if you are successful , you can obtain tenure .
and after 10 years , you can progress to be a full professor .
in the german system , you have boxes - that means your eyes are on the assistant professor level and then you have to go to another university to progress and get a permanent position .
this is of course completely unpredictable because you never know what kind of people you are competing with for the new position .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weber says it 's easier to plan a career as a researcher in the us so in the united states , you can plan your career much better .
it 's much more dependant on your own success and your own contribution to science and technology , whereas in germany it depends on factors that are difficult to control .
that means that when you apply for a position , it 's always a gamble , you never know who the other competitors are , you do n't the preferences of the people who want to hire you .
in all the discussions with foreign scholars in the united states , there 's agreement that the us provides very predictable working conditions where everything depends on how good you are .
you set up the " german scholars organization " in the united states in 2003 .
was the idea to build bridges between germany and the us ?
yes , exactly .
as a scholar in the us , you really feel like you are -lsb- out -rsb- in the world and you are approached by universities or industry who want to hire you .
you do n't have a similar type of approach from german employers .
basically you 're not in the country anymore and you have to make big efforts to stay in touch and get to know what 's going on in germany .
at that point we thought an organization that concentrates on building this bridge between very interested employers in germany and those scholars abroad would make a difference .
it did .
we managed to attract a particularly interesting program from the krupp foundation .
the foundation gave us several million euros to provide scholarships of $ 100,000 -lrb- 74,000 euros -rrb- for returning scholars on university positions in germany .
the scholars who got this grant said it made a big difference to them .
so there are things that can be done with relatively modest means in order to make a return to germany more attractive .
have you continued with the focus of your research as head of the fraunhofer institute for solar energy in freiburg ?
yes , as a matter of fact when i came to freiburg , the fraunhofer institute was so interested in my own research that they provided me with a very big research grant so we could set up a whole laboratory to pursue research to make good solar cells from silicon with high impurity content .
of course , this is what i 'm very interested in .
on the other hand , leading an institute with 800 people with a budget of 15 million euros means that i do n't have too much time to be involved in research on a day-to-day basis .
but for me it 's very satisfying that from my director 's level i can make sure that the things i 'm interested in get the support they deserve .
i can really say that i 'm very impressed with the quality of the people and their enthusiasm .
everybody there knows that we are working on something which is important for the future of the world .
and therefore though our salaries are not very competitive , compared to the salaries offered in the industry , many stay - though they could easily double their salaries - because they like the freedom and the atmosphere we provide .

basically you 're not in the country anymore and you have to make big efforts to stay in touch and get to know what 's going on in germany .
at that point we thought an organization that concentrates on building this bridge between very interested employers in germany and those scholars abroad would make a difference .
it did .
we managed to attract a particularly interesting program from the krupp foundation .
the foundation gave us several million euros to provide scholarships of $ 100,000 -lrb- 74,000 euros -rrb- for returning scholars on university positions in germany .
the scholars who got this grant said it made a big difference to them .
so there are things that can be done with relatively modest means in order to make a return to germany more attractive .
have you continued with the focus of your research as head of the fraunhofer institute for solar energy in freiburg ?
yes , as a matter of fact when i came to freiburg , the fraunhofer institute was so interested in my own research that they provided me with a very big research grant so we could set up a whole laboratory to pursue research to make good solar cells from silicon with high impurity content .
of course , this is what i 'm very interested in .
on the other hand , leading an institute with 800 people with a budget of 15 million euros means that i do n't have too much time to be involved in research on a day-to-day basis .
but for me it 's very satisfying that from my director 's level i can make sure that the things i 'm interested in get the support they deserve .
i can really say that i 'm very impressed with the quality of the people and their enthusiasm .
everybody there knows that we are working on something which is important for the future of the world .
and therefore though our salaries are not very competitive , compared to the salaries offered in the industry , many stay - though they could easily double their salaries - because they like the freedom and the atmosphere we provide .

porsche 's management , they said , did not realize how dicey the situation was for the sports carmaker .
" for a merger of volkswagen and porsche , we need to systematically analyze the current situation of porsche and we need to have a clear picture of the actual conditions there , " volkswagen ceo martin winterkorn was quoted as saying in monday ’ s edition of the berliner zeitung .
volkswagen would need " full transparency " to continue talks , he said .
vw 's chief labor representative , bernd osterloh , said the talks set for monday had been called off because " the current atmosphere was not conducive to a constructive dialog . "
" we were not the ones who had asked for talks and we will not allow volkswagen and individuals in our company to be disparaged just because porsche has no clear strategy , " osterloh said .
friction between the two sides intensified after the porsche and piech families , who control the two carmakers with crossover share holdings , instructed the companies to draft merger plans within the past weeks .
in the negotiations it emerged that the more likely scenario would be that volkswagen would instead end up swallowing porsche .
the economic crisis has changed the equation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the porsche 911 has been the carmaker 's biggest seller over the years in one of germany 's great corporate takeover battles , porsche last year managed to buy a controlling stake in the vastly larger volkswagen .

the head of the porsche works ' council , uwe hueck , said he plans to lead thousands of workers in a protest march this coming monday to demonstrate against what he called piech 's perceived arrogance .
vw 's osterloh remarked it was time for the porsche family " to clearly say what it wants and what it does n't want . "
porsche , in the meantime , along with another german sports car maker , bmw , is apparently exploring the possibility of state loans to shore up the steep drop in demand for its vehicles .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 18.05.2009 german poverty atlas shows huge social divide großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of people living below the poverty line is on the rise in germany a new study by a german welfare organization shows that the gap between rich and poor is widening in the country , with the east and northwest lagging clearly behind the south . germany is being ripped apart - at least socially .
according to the first-ever poverty atlas released by der paritaetische , one of the big five social welfare organizations in germany , the level of poverty in some eastern parts of the country is up to four times higher than in the south .
the atlas , released on monday in berlin , shows that the german region of western pomerania leads the nation when it comes to poverty , with more than one in four people there living at or below the poverty line .
on the opposite end of the spectrum - as well as the opposite end of the country - the region of schwarzwald-baar-heuberg has a poverty rate of 7.4 percent .
call for countermeasures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schneider is calling for unemployment benefits to be raised speaking at a press conference , association head ulrich schneider criticized the growing regional and social divisions within the country .
many regions , especially those in the east , could easily become dependent on the state to survive , he said , calling for rapid and systematic countermeasures .
those measures include raising long-term unemployment benefits from 351 euros -lrb- $ 474 -rrb- a month to 440 euros as well as doing a better job of applying the economic stimulus package to the regions that really need it .
such an increase would cost up to 10 billion euros per year .
the definition of ' poor ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 14.3 percent of germans are said to live below the poverty line of course , the atlas begs the question : what does poor actually mean ?
in germany , the term applies to anyone who earns less than 60 percent of the average national wage .
for singles that 's 764 euros -lrb- $ 1,031 -rrb- per month , and for couples without children it 's 1,376 euros .
it comes as no surprise that the regions the atlas shows as having the highest poverty rate also have the highest level of unemployment .
the poverty rate overall in germany is 14.3 percent , with the average in the west of the country being 12.9 percent , 6.6 percent lower than in the east . that corresponds with data provided by the german statistics office , which says that as of january of this year , unemployment was 13.9 percent in the east and 6.9 percent in the west . dividing up the wealth at the unveiling , schneider that new measures to fight poverty should n't include programs like the scrapping bonus .
the 2,500-euro bonus goes to people who have their old cars scrapped and buy a new car .
it 's meant to help the ailing auto industry through the financial crisis .
schneider said a third of the federal funds dedicated to economic stimulus measures , which amount to 10 billion euros , are going to the three states with the lowest poverty levels : bavaria , hesse and baden-wuerttemberg. mrm / dpa / reuters / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , a power struggle over the shape of a new , post-merger auto giant is threatening to wreck a deal to amalgamate europe 's largest automaker with luxury sports car manufacturer porsche .
monday 's meeting was called to address the integration plan , which was agreed upon earlier this month after a meeting of the porsche family and top executives of the two companies in salzburg , austria .
however , that plan veered off course over the weekend when vw announced it was stalling negotiations pending " clarification " from porsche .
the latter , however , insisted talks were still on track and that only a working group meeting between the two companies had been cancelled .

porsche may have to seek another partner in order to survive if the vw plan falls through . in the latest twist in the volkswagen-porsche merger saga , vw chairman ferdinand piech failed to show up at a crucial meeting of porsche 's supervisory board on monday .
reports say no explanation has been offered for his absence .
the piechs and porsches are heirs to two of germany 's oldest industrial families .
now , a power struggle over the shape of a new , post-merger auto giant is threatening to wreck a deal to amalgamate europe 's largest automaker with luxury sports car manufacturer porsche .
monday 's meeting was called to address the integration plan , which was agreed upon earlier this month after a meeting of the porsche family and top executives of the two companies in salzburg , austria .
however , that plan veered off course over the weekend when vw announced it was stalling negotiations pending " clarification " from porsche .
the latter , however , insisted talks were still on track and that only a working group meeting between the two companies had been cancelled .
the porsche parent group owns just over 50 percent of vw after boosting its stake earlier in the year .
in fact , the company had aimed to raise its stake to 75 percent until it was hit by the global economic downturn . porsche is now weighed down by a nine-billion-euro -lrb- $ 12 billion -rrb- debt , which forced it to abandon ambitions for a complete takeover of the much larger vw . meanwhile , thousands of porsche workers demonstrated on monday outside the venue of the meeting in weissach , a suburb of the southern city of stuttgart , against vw 's reported plans to turn porsche into just another division of the auto giant .
the chief labor representative urged the roughly 3,000 demonstrators to fight to retain porsche 's independence . rb / dpa / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

generally seen as a tough and competent leader by the electorate , merkel is also often perceived as cool and lacking in charisma .
merkel saw this as an opportunity to connect with voters on a personal level .
in the berlin studio of commercial broadcaster rtl , merkel met with 100 guests and answered questions ranging from how she planned to balance the budget without increasing taxes to what she likes to cook in her free time .
the town hall meeting is a departure from typical german political campaigns , which rarely focus on a candidate 's personality and private life .
merkel 's appearance was seen by many in germany as obama-esque .
us president barack obama is known for his charm and held a town hall meeting while in strasbourg , france , at the beginning of april for a nato summit .
a kinder , gentler chancellor this election year merkel 's party , the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , seems to be pushing a softer merkel and is banking on her popularity .
the chancellor is doing better in opinion polls than the cdu itself .

and a potential increase in the sales tax was an " absolute no . "
merkel also doled out some practical advice during the evening .
when an unemployed 21 year old complained that the employment office could n't give him appointment for two months , merkel agreed that should n't be the case .
but then she asked what he had trained to do .
when the young man answered , " nothing " , she encouraged him to take advantage of his free time .

the show uses photographs , documents , books , instruments and detailed explanations to show how vastly different the two musical icons were treated by the nazis and how their works were manipulated and distorted .
museum director joerg hansen said hitler 's reception of the two composers offers an " important lesson " about the nazi rhetoric of " german superiority " and " jewish threat . "
mendelssohn denigrated by the nazis mendelssohn -lrb- 1809-1847 -rrb- , born to an illustrious jewish family in hamburg , sharply divided opinion in the music world .
during his lifetime he was considered a musical genius by some while others found his style too conservative .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mendelssohn is considered one of the most important composers of the romantic period but mendelssohn is largely credited for playing a pivotal role in the revival of interest in the music of bach , which had largely been forgotten around that time .
just a century later , the tables had turned - when hitler came to power in 1933 , the nazi regime cited mendelssohn 's jewish origin as a reason to ban performance and publication of his works .
once the co-founder of the new bach society in leipzig , mendelssohn was denigrated by nazi musicologists as having contributed to the " effeminacy " of german music in the 19th century .
the show documents how the nazis in 1936 removed a statue of mendelssohn erected in leipzig in 1892 and his works from all the important concert halls in the country .
it also touches on the 1938 duesseldorf exhibition " degenerate music . "
bach the most " german of all germans " bach , on the other hand , was celebrated by the nazis as a " northern " musical artist .
his music was played during nazi party conferences and the texts to his works were tweaked to suit the party 's propaganda .
a special unit set up by the regime to rework music ensured that bach 's music was " purified of jewish references . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : johann sebastian bach is widely considered one of the greatest composers in the western tradition museum director hansen said adolf hitler and his propaganda minister joseph goebbels publicly paid homage to bach as the " most german of all german composers " while mendelssohn the " jew " was considered a dangerous " accident " in music history .
one of the exhibits in eisenach includes a choral piece by bach which was reworded to be the battle song of the hitler youth movement .
another photograph shows the leipzig thomas choir which joined the movement in 1937 .
the exhibition spans the period from 1829 , when the then 21-year-old mendelssohn performed bach 's st. matthew passion at the berlin singakademie , to the persecution and death of jewish artists in nazi concentration camps .

it earned mendelssohn widespread acclaim .
hansen said the exhibition remained a controversial one because it touched on a difficult chapter of history .
as a result , the museum director said it can not be shown in the eastern city of leipzig - an important city where both bach and mendelssohn spent important and productive parts of their careers and where bach is a larger-than-life figure .

the show uses photographs , documents , books , instruments and detailed explanations to show how vastly different the two musical icons were treated by the nazis and how their works were manipulated and distorted .
museum director joerg hansen said hitler 's reception of the two composers offers an " important lesson " about the nazi rhetoric of " german superiority " and " jewish threat . "
mendelssohn denigrated by the nazis mendelssohn -lrb- 1809-1847 -rrb- , born to an illustrious jewish family in hamburg , sharply divided opinion in the music world .
during his lifetime he was considered a musical genius by some while others found his style too conservative .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mendelssohn is considered one of the most important composers of the romantic period but mendelssohn is largely credited for playing a pivotal role in the revival of interest in the music of bach , which had largely been forgotten around that time .
just a century later , the tables had turned - when hitler came to power in 1933 , the nazi regime cited mendelssohn 's jewish origin as a reason to ban performance and publication of his works .
once the co-founder of the new bach society in leipzig , mendelssohn was denigrated by nazi musicologists as having contributed to the " effeminacy " of german music in the 19th century .
the show documents how the nazis in 1936 removed a statue of mendelssohn erected in leipzig in 1892 and his works from all the important concert halls in the country .
it also touches on the 1938 duesseldorf exhibition " degenerate music . "
bach the most " german of all germans " bach , on the other hand , was celebrated by the nazis as a " northern " musical artist .
his music was played during nazi party conferences and the texts to his works were tweaked to suit the party 's propaganda .
a special unit set up by the regime to rework music ensured that bach 's music was " purified of jewish references . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : johann sebastian bach is widely considered one of the greatest composers in the western tradition museum director hansen said adolf hitler and his propaganda minister joseph goebbels publicly paid homage to bach as the " most german of all german composers " while mendelssohn the " jew " was considered a dangerous " accident " in music history .
one of the exhibits in eisenach includes a choral piece by bach which was reworded to be the battle song of the hitler youth movement .
another photograph shows the leipzig thomas choir which joined the movement in 1937 .
the exhibition spans the period from 1829 , when the then 21-year-old mendelssohn performed bach 's st. matthew passion at the berlin singakademie , to the persecution and death of jewish artists in nazi concentration camps .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view of the bachhaus in eisenach in the state of thuringia , the birthplace of bach the success of mendelssohn 's berlin performance , the first since bach 's death in 1750 , was an important element in the renaissance of bach 's music in germany and , eventually , throughout europe .
it earned mendelssohn widespread acclaim .
hansen said the exhibition remained a controversial one because it touched on a difficult chapter of history .
as a result , the museum director said it can not be shown in the eastern city of leipzig - an important city where both bach and mendelssohn spent important and productive parts of their careers and where bach is a larger-than-life figure .

porsche may have to seek another partner in order to survive if the vw plan falls through . in the latest twist in the volkswagen-porsche merger saga , vw chairman ferdinand piech failed to show up at a crucial meeting of porsche 's supervisory board on monday .
reports say no explanation has been offered for his absence .

porsche 's management , they said , did not realize how dicey the situation was for the sports carmaker .
" for a merger of volkswagen and porsche , we need to systematically analyze the current situation of porsche and we need to have a clear picture of the actual conditions there , " volkswagen ceo martin winterkorn was quoted as saying in monday ’ s edition of the berliner zeitung .
volkswagen would need " full transparency " to continue talks , he said .
vw 's chief labor representative , bernd osterloh , said the talks set for monday had been called off because " the current atmosphere was not conducive to a constructive dialog . "
" we were not the ones who had asked for talks and we will not allow volkswagen and individuals in our company to be disparaged just because porsche has no clear strategy , " osterloh said .
friction between the two sides intensified after the porsche and piech families , who control the two carmakers with crossover share holdings , instructed the companies to draft merger plans within the past weeks .
in the negotiations it emerged that the more likely scenario would be that volkswagen would instead end up swallowing porsche .
the economic crisis has changed the equation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the porsche 911 has been the carmaker 's biggest seller over the years in one of germany 's great corporate takeover battles , porsche last year managed to buy a controlling stake in the vastly larger volkswagen .
but the tables were turned this year following the global economic meltdown , which severely hit the auto industry , with porsche looking to volkswagen , europe 's largest automaker , as a knight in shining armor .
ferdinand piech , vw board chairman , underscored porsche 's predicament last monday when he said that the stuttgart-based company was running short of cash .
the head of the porsche works ' council , uwe hueck , said he plans to lead thousands of workers in a protest march this coming monday to demonstrate against what he called piech 's perceived arrogance .
vw 's osterloh remarked it was time for the porsche family " to clearly say what it wants and what it does n't want . "
porsche , in the meantime , along with another german sports car maker , bmw , is apparently exploring the possibility of state loans to shore up the steep drop in demand for its vehicles .
however , according to monday 's edition of the weekly news magazine , der spiegel , " the two companies have not yet made an official request . "

porsche 's management , they said , did not realize how dicey the situation was for the sports carmaker .
" for a merger of volkswagen and porsche , we need to systematically analyze the current situation of porsche and we need to have a clear picture of the actual conditions there , " volkswagen ceo martin winterkorn was quoted as saying in monday ’ s edition of the berliner zeitung .
volkswagen would need " full transparency " to continue talks , he said .
vw 's chief labor representative , bernd osterloh , said the talks set for monday had been called off because " the current atmosphere was not conducive to a constructive dialog . "
" we were not the ones who had asked for talks and we will not allow volkswagen and individuals in our company to be disparaged just because porsche has no clear strategy , " osterloh said .
friction between the two sides intensified after the porsche and piech families , who control the two carmakers with crossover share holdings , instructed the companies to draft merger plans within the past weeks .
in the negotiations it emerged that the more likely scenario would be that volkswagen would instead end up swallowing porsche .
the economic crisis has changed the equation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the porsche 911 has been the carmaker 's biggest seller over the years in one of germany 's great corporate takeover battles , porsche last year managed to buy a controlling stake in the vastly larger volkswagen .
but the tables were turned this year following the global economic meltdown , which severely hit the auto industry , with porsche looking to volkswagen , europe 's largest automaker , as a knight in shining armor .
ferdinand piech , vw board chairman , underscored porsche 's predicament last monday when he said that the stuttgart-based company was running short of cash .
the head of the porsche works ' council , uwe hueck , said he plans to lead thousands of workers in a protest march this coming monday to demonstrate against what he called piech 's perceived arrogance .
vw 's osterloh remarked it was time for the porsche family " to clearly say what it wants and what it does n't want . "
porsche , in the meantime , along with another german sports car maker , bmw , is apparently exploring the possibility of state loans to shore up the steep drop in demand for its vehicles .
however , according to monday 's edition of the weekly news magazine , der spiegel , " the two companies have not yet made an official request . "

according to the first-ever poverty atlas released by der paritaetische , one of the big five social welfare organizations in germany , the level of poverty in some eastern parts of the country is up to four times higher than in the south .
the atlas , released on monday in berlin , shows that the german region of western pomerania leads the nation when it comes to poverty , with more than one in four people there living at or below the poverty line .
on the opposite end of the spectrum - as well as the opposite end of the country - the region of schwarzwald-baar-heuberg has a poverty rate of 7.4 percent .
call for countermeasures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schneider is calling for unemployment benefits to be raised speaking at a press conference , association head ulrich schneider criticized the growing regional and social divisions within the country .
many regions , especially those in the east , could easily become dependent on the state to survive , he said , calling for rapid and systematic countermeasures .
those measures include raising long-term unemployment benefits from 351 euros -lrb- $ 474 -rrb- a month to 440 euros as well as doing a better job of applying the economic stimulus package to the regions that really need it .
such an increase would cost up to 10 billion euros per year .
the definition of ' poor ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 14.3 percent of germans are said to live below the poverty line of course , the atlas begs the question : what does poor actually mean ?
in germany , the term applies to anyone who earns less than 60 percent of the average national wage .
for singles that 's 764 euros -lrb- $ 1,031 -rrb- per month , and for couples without children it 's 1,376 euros .
it comes as no surprise that the regions the atlas shows as having the highest poverty rate also have the highest level of unemployment .
the poverty rate overall in germany is 14.3 percent , with the average in the west of the country being 12.9 percent , 6.6 percent lower than in the east . that corresponds with data provided by the german statistics office , which says that as of january of this year , unemployment was 13.9 percent in the east and 6.9 percent in the west . dividing up the wealth at the unveiling , schneider that new measures to fight poverty should n't include programs like the scrapping bonus .
the 2,500-euro bonus goes to people who have their old cars scrapped and buy a new car .
it 's meant to help the ailing auto industry through the financial crisis .
schneider said a third of the federal funds dedicated to economic stimulus measures , which amount to 10 billion euros , are going to the three states with the lowest poverty levels : bavaria , hesse and baden-wuerttemberg. mrm / dpa / reuters / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

porsche 's management , they said , did not realize how dicey the situation was for the sports carmaker .
" for a merger of volkswagen and porsche , we need to systematically analyze the current situation of porsche and we need to have a clear picture of the actual conditions there , " volkswagen ceo martin winterkorn was quoted as saying in monday ’ s edition of the berliner zeitung .
volkswagen would need " full transparency " to continue talks , he said .
vw 's chief labor representative , bernd osterloh , said the talks set for monday had been called off because " the current atmosphere was not conducive to a constructive dialog . "
" we were not the ones who had asked for talks and we will not allow volkswagen and individuals in our company to be disparaged just because porsche has no clear strategy , " osterloh said .
friction between the two sides intensified after the porsche and piech families , who control the two carmakers with crossover share holdings , instructed the companies to draft merger plans within the past weeks .

the head of the porsche works ' council , uwe hueck , said he plans to lead thousands of workers in a protest march this coming monday to demonstrate against what he called piech 's perceived arrogance .
vw 's osterloh remarked it was time for the porsche family " to clearly say what it wants and what it does n't want . "
porsche , in the meantime , along with another german sports car maker , bmw , is apparently exploring the possibility of state loans to shore up the steep drop in demand for its vehicles .

ferdinand piech , vw board chairman , underscored porsche 's predicament last monday when he said that the stuttgart-based company was running short of cash .
the head of the porsche works ' council , uwe hueck , said he plans to lead thousands of workers in a protest march this coming monday to demonstrate against what he called piech 's perceived arrogance .
vw 's osterloh remarked it was time for the porsche family " to clearly say what it wants and what it does n't want . "
porsche , in the meantime , along with another german sports car maker , bmw , is apparently exploring the possibility of state loans to shore up the steep drop in demand for its vehicles .
however , according to monday 's edition of the weekly news magazine , der spiegel , " the two companies have not yet made an official request . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 18.05.2009 lithuanians vote in female president großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grybauskaite was previously lithuania 's finance minister voters in lithuania have elected the country ’ s first female president in a landslide .
the result indicated citizens are ready for change in the recession-hit baltic state . european union budget commissioner dalia grybauskaite , who ran as an independent candidate , won 69 percent of the vote .
she came in well ahead of her nearest rival , social democrat algirdas butkevicius , who obtained just 11.87 percent .
the five other candidates lagged even farther behind .
official results showed just over 51 percent of the country 's 2.7 million registered voters turned out , which according to lithuanian law , was just enough for grybauskaite to avoid a runoff ballot .
" i congratulate the lithuanian people for their choice , " the 53-year-old told a cheering crowd at her election quarters , before adding : " the taste of victory is the burden of responsibility . "
grybauskaite takes office at a time when lithuania is struggling to cope with the global economic downturn .
unemployment stands at 15.5 percent , which is the european union 's third highest , while overall salaries are predicted to fall by 12.3 percent this year .
last week , the country 's central bank more than tripled its already doom-laden forecast , saying the economy was likely to shrink by 15.6 percent this year .
with lithuania no longer enjoying the reputation of a fast-growing economic " tiger " as it had after joining the european union in 2004 and up until 2007 , grybauskaite has committed herself to stabilizing the country 's financial status .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rioters in lithuania showed their anger over unpopular reforms " the first challenge is the economic crisis … i think that together we will be able to emerge from these times of hardships much better , much more direct and much richer , " she said .
she has pledged to provide tax breaks for small and medium-sized businesses , stimulate exports and absorb eu aid faster .
the president-elect , who has a martial arts black belt , has also vowed to address allegations of corruption within the current government .
" i believe in transparency and i will demand that quality from everyone .
i do n't appreciate liars or late-comers , " grybauskaite said .
support from incumbent government overall , grybauskaite 's victory has been warmly welcomed in lithuania by both voters and politicians alike .
" we have a good president and i am really happy with what we are trying to achieve .
i am happy that she is coming with a very clear message of change , which is needed very much for lithuania , " prime minister andrius kubilius said .
his conservative party colleague , vytautas landsbergis said grybauskaite would be " energetic , positive and determined to act " .
ahead of the election , grybauskaite won the backing of the ruling conservatives , who did not put up a candidate .
grybauskaite will officially take over the reigns from outgoing president valdas adamkus in july .
the 82-year-old adamkus , who is also non-partisan , will retire after serving two five-year terms , which is the maximum allowed under the lithuanian constitution. cg / dpa / reuters / afp editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

both sides have expressed a willingness to come to an agreement on complex arms control issues . the us and russia have begun renegotiating the strategic arms reduction treaty -lrb- start -rrb- on monday in moscow .
start , one of the largest and most complex arms control treaties , was signed in 1991 , and expires in december of 2009 .
both washington and moscow have indicated that the political will exists to overcome disagreements on the size , nature and purpose of their nuclear arsenals and strategic weapons .
" there are good chances for bringing our positions closer and for working out agreements , " russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said last week after a meeting with us secretary of state hillary clinton in washington .
seeking a replacement for start the us delegation is headed by assistant secretary of state rose gottemoeller . anatoly antonov , head of the foreign ministry department for security and disarmament , leads the russian delegation .
the fresh start negotiations come as us president barack obama pushes ahead with his agenda to " reset " frayed ties with russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president obama has called for a world without nuclear weapons in july , obama is scheduled to travel to moscow for a summit with his russian counterpart dmitry medvedev in which they will discuss , among other security challenges , the reduction of nuclear weapons arsenals .
the white house said in a statement that the meeting will allow the us and russia an opportunity " to deepen engagement on reducing nuclear weapons , cooperating on non-proliferation , exploring ways to cooperate on missile defense , addressing mutual threats and security challenges . "
disarmament process began at the height of the cold war both sides have come to the conclusion that military deterrence is as effective with less warheads on either side , and have agreed to make cuts in the number of warheads they have deployed to around 1,000 to 1,500 each .
other issues include whether the treaty should cover delivery systems like bombers and missiles , verification procedures and information sharing .
the us and russia both have an interest in ensuring the talks conclude with results .
" in support of its arms control interests and interest in strategic stability more generally , the united states should pursue a much broader and more ambitious set of strategic dialogues , " said former us defense secretary william perry , who is now part of the congressional commission on the strategic posture of the united states .
fjodor lukjanov , editor in chief of the moscow magazine russia in world politics , says a new start treaty is eminently important for russia .
" otherwise , there 's the risk that the us might just let the treaty expire and then do what they like , " lukjanov says .

generally seen as a tough and competent leader by the electorate , merkel is also often perceived as cool and lacking in charisma .
merkel saw this as an opportunity to connect with voters on a personal level .
in the berlin studio of commercial broadcaster rtl , merkel met with 100 guests and answered questions ranging from how she planned to balance the budget without increasing taxes to what she likes to cook in her free time .
the town hall meeting is a departure from typical german political campaigns , which rarely focus on a candidate 's personality and private life .
merkel 's appearance was seen by many in germany as obama-esque .
us president barack obama is known for his charm and held a town hall meeting while in strasbourg , france , at the beginning of april for a nato summit .
a kinder , gentler chancellor this election year merkel 's party , the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , seems to be pushing a softer merkel and is banking on her popularity .

" we 've probably just about reached the low point , " she said of the ongoing recession .
and a potential increase in the sales tax was an " absolute no . "
merkel also doled out some practical advice during the evening .
when an unemployed 21 year old complained that the employment office could n't give him appointment for two months , merkel agreed that should n't be the case .
but then she asked what he had trained to do .
when the young man answered , " nothing " , she encouraged him to take advantage of his free time .
" do everything you can to train for a career , " she advised .

" i make a pretty good potato soup , " she said , and her guests say they love her stuffed beef roll .
" i do n't think they 're just telling me what i want to hear , " she said .

generally seen as a tough and competent leader by the electorate , merkel is also often perceived as cool and lacking in charisma .
merkel saw this as an opportunity to connect with voters on a personal level .
in the berlin studio of commercial broadcaster rtl , merkel met with 100 guests and answered questions ranging from how she planned to balance the budget without increasing taxes to what she likes to cook in her free time .
the town hall meeting is a departure from typical german political campaigns , which rarely focus on a candidate 's personality and private life .
merkel 's appearance was seen by many in germany as obama-esque .
us president barack obama is known for his charm and held a town hall meeting while in strasbourg , france , at the beginning of april for a nato summit .
a kinder , gentler chancellor this election year merkel 's party , the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , seems to be pushing a softer merkel and is banking on her popularity .
the chancellor is doing better in opinion polls than the cdu itself .
as the global economy crumbles , merkel must convince voters that she and her traditionally pro-business party understand the everyday concerns that trouble ordinary germans .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's advice to the unemployed ?
train for a career the german economy is facing its deepest recession since world war ii and some 300,000 jobs have been lost since last september when the us investment bank lehman brothers collapsed .
despite the difficult situation , merkel was optimistic .
" we 've probably just about reached the low point , " she said of the ongoing recession .
and a potential increase in the sales tax was an " absolute no . "
merkel also doled out some practical advice during the evening .
when an unemployed 21 year old complained that the employment office could n't give him appointment for two months , merkel agreed that should n't be the case .
but then she asked what he had trained to do .
when the young man answered , " nothing " , she encouraged him to take advantage of his free time .
" do everything you can to train for a career , " she advised .
let 's get personal participants in the forum wanted to know how merkel stayed connected with the lives of germany 's citizens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel relaxes by cooking or traveling with her husband her husband , chemistry professor joachin sauer , keeps her grounded , she said .
" i have to fold my own clothes at home and fill the washing machine , " she said .
she shops for food at normal grocery stores , she said , adding that she likes to cook on the weekends .
" i make a pretty good potato soup , " she said , and her guests say they love her stuffed beef roll .
" i do n't think they 're just telling me what i want to hear , " she said .
the chancellor also spoke openly about the importance of her faith in god .
she believes god looks over and protects humanity , and " that gives me strength , " she said. hf / dpa / reuters editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the show uses photographs , documents , books , instruments and detailed explanations to show how vastly different the two musical icons were treated by the nazis and how their works were manipulated and distorted .
museum director joerg hansen said hitler 's reception of the two composers offers an " important lesson " about the nazi rhetoric of " german superiority " and " jewish threat . "
mendelssohn denigrated by the nazis mendelssohn -lrb- 1809-1847 -rrb- , born to an illustrious jewish family in hamburg , sharply divided opinion in the music world .
during his lifetime he was considered a musical genius by some while others found his style too conservative .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mendelssohn is considered one of the most important composers of the romantic period but mendelssohn is largely credited for playing a pivotal role in the revival of interest in the music of bach , which had largely been forgotten around that time .
just a century later , the tables had turned - when hitler came to power in 1933 , the nazi regime cited mendelssohn 's jewish origin as a reason to ban performance and publication of his works .
once the co-founder of the new bach society in leipzig , mendelssohn was denigrated by nazi musicologists as having contributed to the " effeminacy " of german music in the 19th century .
the show documents how the nazis in 1936 removed a statue of mendelssohn erected in leipzig in 1892 and his works from all the important concert halls in the country .
it also touches on the 1938 duesseldorf exhibition " degenerate music . "
bach the most " german of all germans " bach , on the other hand , was celebrated by the nazis as a " northern " musical artist .
his music was played during nazi party conferences and the texts to his works were tweaked to suit the party 's propaganda .
a special unit set up by the regime to rework music ensured that bach 's music was " purified of jewish references . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : johann sebastian bach is widely considered one of the greatest composers in the western tradition museum director hansen said adolf hitler and his propaganda minister joseph goebbels publicly paid homage to bach as the " most german of all german composers " while mendelssohn the " jew " was considered a dangerous " accident " in music history .
one of the exhibits in eisenach includes a choral piece by bach which was reworded to be the battle song of the hitler youth movement .
another photograph shows the leipzig thomas choir which joined the movement in 1937 .
the exhibition spans the period from 1829 , when the then 21-year-old mendelssohn performed bach 's st. matthew passion at the berlin singakademie , to the persecution and death of jewish artists in nazi concentration camps .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view of the bachhaus in eisenach in the state of thuringia , the birthplace of bach the success of mendelssohn 's berlin performance , the first since bach 's death in 1750 , was an important element in the renaissance of bach 's music in germany and , eventually , throughout europe .
it earned mendelssohn widespread acclaim .
hansen said the exhibition remained a controversial one because it touched on a difficult chapter of history .
as a result , the museum director said it can not be shown in the eastern city of leipzig - an important city where both bach and mendelssohn spent important and productive parts of their careers and where bach is a larger-than-life figure .

news photos of the stripper , born heather sweet , showing her baring a full bosom during rehearsals led to a complaint by the european broadcasting union , resulting in an order for her to dress more appropriately for the family television show . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : striptease star dita von teese did n't peel off as much as she would have liked to as an event , eurovision is both loved and loathed for its over-the-top , kitschy performances .
moscow organizers managed to arrange a live video connection to astronauts aboard the international space station who launched the audience tele-voting . this year 's result was decided by a combination of audience tele-voting and decisions by expert juries in the 42 participating countries , although only 25 nations actually made it to the final round in moscow . the russian organizers reportedly spent over 30 million euros on this year 's contest , making it the most expensive competition in eurovision 's history . moscow fails to dazzle gay scene however , the customary glitz and kitsch did not manage to blot out political controversy that started well ahead of the event .
organizers had banned georgia 's entry earlier this year because its song was considered a political jab at the host country russia .
the neighbors had fought a brief war late last august . eurovision is known to be immensely popular among the european gay scene .
on saturday , dozens of riot police detained gay rights protesters who had defied the moscow authorities and tried to stage a demonstration against homophobia which had previously been banned . the leading russian gay activist nikolai alexeyev had urged contestants to boycott eurovision in protest against " russia 's state oppression of human rights " . this year 's winner rybak appeared to throw his support behind the gay rights protesters when he said at a news conference : " why did they -lrb- the moscow police -rrb- spend all their energy stopping gays in moscow when the biggest gay parade was here tonight ? " more than just a laugh ? since eurovision 's inception in 1956 , the show has undergone various changes .
its perception among european viewers has also changed drastically over the years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abba 's victory in 1974 marked the swedish band 's international breakthrough the competition rules state that each country is allowed to choose its own act , and that all vocals must be performed live . initially each country was also obliged to sing in one of its official languages .
however , this rule has been changed several times , allowing participants to resort to english vocals , which have booked the most wins in the history of the competition . all-time greats abba launched their international career by winning the show in 1974 with their smash hit " waterloo " .
but critics say the event has meanwhile degenerated into little more than a circus of mediocre songwriting and sometimes even embarrassing acts .
its fiercest opponents say the song contest has become little more than a joke with viewers merely tuning in for a laugh or a cringe . however , critics can not deny that the show is watched by an estimated television audience of over 100 million people every year , making it one of the most viewed events on the planet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicole 's song for peace gave germany its sole eurovision victory in 1982 ireland currently leads the overall table with seven wins , while germany only managed one victory back in 1982 with the song " ein bisschen frieden " -lrb- a little peace -rrb- , which was performed by 17-year-old singer nicole . norway now boasts three wins and as this year 's victor will host the next eurovision song contest in 2010 . nk / dpa / afp / ap / reuters editor : kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 18.05.2009 researcher says merit-based us system better at attracting talent großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weber says the us does a better job of rewarding success and creativity than europe in recent years , skilled germans have migrated to foreign shores for jobs and opportunities .
dw spoke to acclaimed physicist eicke weber , who worked in the us for 23 years , about his decision to come back to germany . after 23 years of research in the usa , which he put an end to after teaching materials science at the university of california in berkeley , professor eicke weber finally came home to germany .
on july 1 , 2006 , the physicist and materials researcher became director of the fraunhofer institute for solar energy systems ise in freiburg , southern germany .
what shaped your decision to come back to germany after working in the us as a researcher for over two decades ?
the united states is a unique place worldwide because it is attractive for people from around the world for active and energetic people and of course for scientists who are looking for excellent working conditions .
the united states therefore really attracts the best scientists from around the world .
the universities in the us offer many attractive positions .
they offer a level playing field to compete for funds for research .
the result is that competition is much tougher than , say , in germany .
but those who continuously have good ideas and stay ahead of the others have good opportunities .
on the other hand , this " brain drain " is n't good for other countries .
that means that europe and asia have to make sure they create attractive conditions for people to come back to .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fraunhofer insitut in freiburg focuses on research in solar energy and energy efficiency the kind of institute i came back to - fraunhofer - is a very special government laboratory because it is a government-sponsored institute , but basically it has to earn its money through its own success .
in my institute , basic funding from the government is down to 10 percent - that means 90 percent is based on our success in bringing in projects , half from industry and half from government sources .
this creates a competitive atmosphere , -lsb- which -rsb- i liked so much while working in the us .
i must say i was very happy to have this opportunity to come back to .
american research institutes offer substantially higher salaries than institutes in germany .
is that one of the main reasons scientists find it difficult to return to countries such as germany ?
it 's a whole package of things .
i have been quite involved in this topic - when i was in the us i founded an organization called " german scholars organization " to help german scholars find interesting jobs in germany .
and what was frequently mentioned was that the salary is not the problem but rather the structure of the system .
in the us , you can enter the university as i did - as an untenured assistant professor , and if you are successful , you can obtain tenure .
and after 10 years , you can progress to be a full professor .
in the german system , you have boxes - that means your eyes are on the assistant professor level and then you have to go to another university to progress and get a permanent position .
this is of course completely unpredictable because you never know what kind of people you are competing with for the new position .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weber says it 's easier to plan a career as a researcher in the us so in the united states , you can plan your career much better .
it 's much more dependant on your own success and your own contribution to science and technology , whereas in germany it depends on factors that are difficult to control .
that means that when you apply for a position , it 's always a gamble , you never know who the other competitors are , you do n't the preferences of the people who want to hire you .
in all the discussions with foreign scholars in the united states , there 's agreement that the us provides very predictable working conditions where everything depends on how good you are .
you set up the " german scholars organization " in the united states in 2003 .
was the idea to build bridges between germany and the us ?
yes , exactly .
as a scholar in the us , you really feel like you are -lsb- out -rsb- in the world and you are approached by universities or industry who want to hire you .
you do n't have a similar type of approach from german employers .
basically you 're not in the country anymore and you have to make big efforts to stay in touch and get to know what 's going on in germany .
at that point we thought an organization that concentrates on building this bridge between very interested employers in germany and those scholars abroad would make a difference .
it did .
we managed to attract a particularly interesting program from the krupp foundation .
the foundation gave us several million euros to provide scholarships of $ 100,000 -lrb- 74,000 euros -rrb- for returning scholars on university positions in germany .
the scholars who got this grant said it made a big difference to them .
so there are things that can be done with relatively modest means in order to make a return to germany more attractive .
have you continued with the focus of your research as head of the fraunhofer institute for solar energy in freiburg ?
yes , as a matter of fact when i came to freiburg , the fraunhofer institute was so interested in my own research that they provided me with a very big research grant so we could set up a whole laboratory to pursue research to make good solar cells from silicon with high impurity content .
of course , this is what i 'm very interested in .
on the other hand , leading an institute with 800 people with a budget of 15 million euros means that i do n't have too much time to be involved in research on a day-to-day basis .
but for me it 's very satisfying that from my director 's level i can make sure that the things i 'm interested in get the support they deserve .
i can really say that i 'm very impressed with the quality of the people and their enthusiasm .
everybody there knows that we are working on something which is important for the future of the world .
and therefore though our salaries are not very competitive , compared to the salaries offered in the industry , many stay - though they could easily double their salaries - because they like the freedom and the atmosphere we provide .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 18.05.2009 researcher says merit-based us system better at attracting talent großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weber says the us does a better job of rewarding success and creativity than europe in recent years , skilled germans have migrated to foreign shores for jobs and opportunities .
dw spoke to acclaimed physicist eicke weber , who worked in the us for 23 years , about his decision to come back to germany . after 23 years of research in the usa , which he put an end to after teaching materials science at the university of california in berkeley , professor eicke weber finally came home to germany .
on july 1 , 2006 , the physicist and materials researcher became director of the fraunhofer institute for solar energy systems ise in freiburg , southern germany .
what shaped your decision to come back to germany after working in the us as a researcher for over two decades ?
the united states is a unique place worldwide because it is attractive for people from around the world for active and energetic people and of course for scientists who are looking for excellent working conditions .
the united states therefore really attracts the best scientists from around the world .
the universities in the us offer many attractive positions .
they offer a level playing field to compete for funds for research .
the result is that competition is much tougher than , say , in germany .
but those who continuously have good ideas and stay ahead of the others have good opportunities .
on the other hand , this " brain drain " is n't good for other countries .
that means that europe and asia have to make sure they create attractive conditions for people to come back to .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fraunhofer insitut in freiburg focuses on research in solar energy and energy efficiency the kind of institute i came back to - fraunhofer - is a very special government laboratory because it is a government-sponsored institute , but basically it has to earn its money through its own success .
in my institute , basic funding from the government is down to 10 percent - that means 90 percent is based on our success in bringing in projects , half from industry and half from government sources .
this creates a competitive atmosphere , -lsb- which -rsb- i liked so much while working in the us .
i must say i was very happy to have this opportunity to come back to .
american research institutes offer substantially higher salaries than institutes in germany .
is that one of the main reasons scientists find it difficult to return to countries such as germany ?
it 's a whole package of things .
i have been quite involved in this topic - when i was in the us i founded an organization called " german scholars organization " to help german scholars find interesting jobs in germany .
and what was frequently mentioned was that the salary is not the problem but rather the structure of the system .
in the us , you can enter the university as i did - as an untenured assistant professor , and if you are successful , you can obtain tenure .
and after 10 years , you can progress to be a full professor .
in the german system , you have boxes - that means your eyes are on the assistant professor level and then you have to go to another university to progress and get a permanent position .
this is of course completely unpredictable because you never know what kind of people you are competing with for the new position .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weber says it 's easier to plan a career as a researcher in the us so in the united states , you can plan your career much better .
it 's much more dependant on your own success and your own contribution to science and technology , whereas in germany it depends on factors that are difficult to control .
that means that when you apply for a position , it 's always a gamble , you never know who the other competitors are , you do n't the preferences of the people who want to hire you .
in all the discussions with foreign scholars in the united states , there 's agreement that the us provides very predictable working conditions where everything depends on how good you are .
you set up the " german scholars organization " in the united states in 2003 .
was the idea to build bridges between germany and the us ?
yes , exactly .
as a scholar in the us , you really feel like you are -lsb- out -rsb- in the world and you are approached by universities or industry who want to hire you .
you do n't have a similar type of approach from german employers .
basically you 're not in the country anymore and you have to make big efforts to stay in touch and get to know what 's going on in germany .
at that point we thought an organization that concentrates on building this bridge between very interested employers in germany and those scholars abroad would make a difference .
it did .
we managed to attract a particularly interesting program from the krupp foundation .
the foundation gave us several million euros to provide scholarships of $ 100,000 -lrb- 74,000 euros -rrb- for returning scholars on university positions in germany .
the scholars who got this grant said it made a big difference to them .
so there are things that can be done with relatively modest means in order to make a return to germany more attractive .
have you continued with the focus of your research as head of the fraunhofer institute for solar energy in freiburg ?
yes , as a matter of fact when i came to freiburg , the fraunhofer institute was so interested in my own research that they provided me with a very big research grant so we could set up a whole laboratory to pursue research to make good solar cells from silicon with high impurity content .
of course , this is what i 'm very interested in .
on the other hand , leading an institute with 800 people with a budget of 15 million euros means that i do n't have too much time to be involved in research on a day-to-day basis .
but for me it 's very satisfying that from my director 's level i can make sure that the things i 'm interested in get the support they deserve .
i can really say that i 'm very impressed with the quality of the people and their enthusiasm .
everybody there knows that we are working on something which is important for the future of the world .
and therefore though our salaries are not very competitive , compared to the salaries offered in the industry , many stay - though they could easily double their salaries - because they like the freedom and the atmosphere we provide .

yes , exactly .
as a scholar in the us , you really feel like you are -lsb- out -rsb- in the world and you are approached by universities or industry who want to hire you .
you do n't have a similar type of approach from german employers .
basically you 're not in the country anymore and you have to make big efforts to stay in touch and get to know what 's going on in germany .
at that point we thought an organization that concentrates on building this bridge between very interested employers in germany and those scholars abroad would make a difference .
it did .
we managed to attract a particularly interesting program from the krupp foundation .
the foundation gave us several million euros to provide scholarships of $ 100,000 -lrb- 74,000 euros -rrb- for returning scholars on university positions in germany .
the scholars who got this grant said it made a big difference to them .
so there are things that can be done with relatively modest means in order to make a return to germany more attractive .
have you continued with the focus of your research as head of the fraunhofer institute for solar energy in freiburg ?
yes , as a matter of fact when i came to freiburg , the fraunhofer institute was so interested in my own research that they provided me with a very big research grant so we could set up a whole laboratory to pursue research to make good solar cells from silicon with high impurity content .
of course , this is what i 'm very interested in .
on the other hand , leading an institute with 800 people with a budget of 15 million euros means that i do n't have too much time to be involved in research on a day-to-day basis .
but for me it 's very satisfying that from my director 's level i can make sure that the things i 'm interested in get the support they deserve .
i can really say that i 'm very impressed with the quality of the people and their enthusiasm .
everybody there knows that we are working on something which is important for the future of the world .
and therefore though our salaries are not very competitive , compared to the salaries offered in the industry , many stay - though they could easily double their salaries - because they like the freedom and the atmosphere we provide .

the ministers are set to press their counterparts from the association of south-east asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- to take firm action against burma 's military junta at a may 25 meeting , officials said .

the ministers are set to press their counterparts from the association of south-east asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- to take firm action against burma 's military junta at a may 25 meeting , officials said .
" we have an agreement to investigate more sanctions , we have an agreement that we should pursue the asean track next week ... and we have an agreement that we need to come back to that issue , " british foreign secretary david miliband said after a meeting with eu counterparts in brussels .
unanimous condemnation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been protests around the world the regime 's decision to arrest nobel peace prize winner suu kyi and commit her to what miliband called a " show trial " has provoked outrage in europe and dominated monday 's regular eu talks .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said that the trial against aung san suu kyi was further evidence of the state of human rights in burma .
" the trial against aung san suu kyi is an indication of the continued disregard for basic human rights in myanmar -lrb- burma -rrb- , " steinmeier said on the sidelines of the meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels . " to lock away and sentence -lrb- suu kyi -rrb- does not bring stability or reconciliation .
in this way , the scheduled elections will become a farce , " steinmeier said . " i expect the trial to not only be postponed , but to be immediately stopped and ms suu kyi be set free at last , " the minister added .
the other eu ministers echoed these sentiments , condemning the trial of burma 's pro-democracy icon , which got under way in the capital of rangoon shortly before the start of the meeting in brussels .
no sanctions yet however , despite debating the possibility , the foreign ministers stopped short of bringing in more sanctions against the country 's regime , instead calling for more cooperation with regional powers such as china and india .
" this is not the moment to lower the sanctions , this is the moment to increase them , " said eu foreign policy chief javier solana . the czech government , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , is " ready to discuss the reinforcement of sanctions , " but first there " will be a call on the burmese authorities to release aung san suu kyi , " its foreign minister , jan kohout , said . but other ministers pointed out that the extension of the sanctions had not stopped the burmese regime putting suu kyi on trial just a fortnight before her six years of house arrest were to end . the sanctions " have not achieved much .
this is one of the big problems that we always have with sanction policies , " finnish foreign minister alexander stubb said . instead , a number of top officials called on the eu to step up its cooperation with china , india and other regional actors in a bid to pressurize the burmese regime . " we have to reinforce the dialogue with burma 's neighbours ...
we have been doing all of that , but maybe not in a sufficient way , " eu foreign affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said . " we have to engage with the other countries in the region , " agreed swedish foreign minister carl bildt , whose country will assume the eu presidency on july 1 .

steinmeier worries that accepting the inmates would cause a political fight with beijing , which has been demanding that they be extradited to china . conditional acceptance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beijing considers some uighurs to be terrorists according to der spiegel , reinhard silberberg , a senior official with the german foreign ministry , told the us berlin would take in the nine provided that other european nations accept uighurs as well , thereby lessening the pressure on germany . steinmeier has received support for his statement from former german chancellor gerhard schroeder , who told der spiegel that accepting uighurs would certainly put a strain on german-chinese relations . schroeder said that while he is in favor of supporting us president barack obama in his efforts to close guantanamo , only the us is in a position to take in the uighurs without suffering any political consequences from china . mrm / reuters / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

porsche may have to seek another partner in order to survive if the vw plan falls through . in the latest twist in the volkswagen-porsche merger saga , vw chairman ferdinand piech failed to show up at a crucial meeting of porsche 's supervisory board on monday .
reports say no explanation has been offered for his absence .
the piechs and porsches are heirs to two of germany 's oldest industrial families .
now , a power struggle over the shape of a new , post-merger auto giant is threatening to wreck a deal to amalgamate europe 's largest automaker with luxury sports car manufacturer porsche .
monday 's meeting was called to address the integration plan , which was agreed upon earlier this month after a meeting of the porsche family and top executives of the two companies in salzburg , austria .
however , that plan veered off course over the weekend when vw announced it was stalling negotiations pending " clarification " from porsche .
the latter , however , insisted talks were still on track and that only a working group meeting between the two companies had been cancelled .
the porsche parent group owns just over 50 percent of vw after boosting its stake earlier in the year .
in fact , the company had aimed to raise its stake to 75 percent until it was hit by the global economic downturn . porsche is now weighed down by a nine-billion-euro -lrb- $ 12 billion -rrb- debt , which forced it to abandon ambitions for a complete takeover of the much larger vw . meanwhile , thousands of porsche workers demonstrated on monday outside the venue of the meeting in weissach , a suburb of the southern city of stuttgart , against vw 's reported plans to turn porsche into just another division of the auto giant .

porsche may have to seek another partner in order to survive if the vw plan falls through . in the latest twist in the volkswagen-porsche merger saga , vw chairman ferdinand piech failed to show up at a crucial meeting of porsche 's supervisory board on monday .

monday 's meeting was called to address the integration plan , which was agreed upon earlier this month after a meeting of the porsche family and top executives of the two companies in salzburg , austria .
however , that plan veered off course over the weekend when vw announced it was stalling negotiations pending " clarification " from porsche .
the latter , however , insisted talks were still on track and that only a working group meeting between the two companies had been cancelled .

in fact , the company had aimed to raise its stake to 75 percent until it was hit by the global economic downturn . porsche is now weighed down by a nine-billion-euro -lrb- $ 12 billion -rrb- debt , which forced it to abandon ambitions for a complete takeover of the much larger vw . meanwhile , thousands of porsche workers demonstrated on monday outside the venue of the meeting in weissach , a suburb of the southern city of stuttgart , against vw 's reported plans to turn porsche into just another division of the auto giant .

according to the first-ever poverty atlas released by der paritaetische , one of the big five social welfare organizations in germany , the level of poverty in some eastern parts of the country is up to four times higher than in the south .
the atlas , released on monday in berlin , shows that the german region of western pomerania leads the nation when it comes to poverty , with more than one in four people there living at or below the poverty line .
on the opposite end of the spectrum - as well as the opposite end of the country - the region of schwarzwald-baar-heuberg has a poverty rate of 7.4 percent .
call for countermeasures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schneider is calling for unemployment benefits to be raised speaking at a press conference , association head ulrich schneider criticized the growing regional and social divisions within the country .
many regions , especially those in the east , could easily become dependent on the state to survive , he said , calling for rapid and systematic countermeasures .
those measures include raising long-term unemployment benefits from 351 euros -lrb- $ 474 -rrb- a month to 440 euros as well as doing a better job of applying the economic stimulus package to the regions that really need it .
such an increase would cost up to 10 billion euros per year .

for singles that 's 764 euros -lrb- $ 1,031 -rrb- per month , and for couples without children it 's 1,376 euros .
it comes as no surprise that the regions the atlas shows as having the highest poverty rate also have the highest level of unemployment .
the poverty rate overall in germany is 14.3 percent , with the average in the west of the country being 12.9 percent , 6.6 percent lower than in the east . that corresponds with data provided by the german statistics office , which says that as of january of this year , unemployment was 13.9 percent in the east and 6.9 percent in the west . dividing up the wealth at the unveiling , schneider that new measures to fight poverty should n't include programs like the scrapping bonus .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 18.05.2009 researcher says merit-based us system better at attracting talent großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weber says the us does a better job of rewarding success and creativity than europe in recent years , skilled germans have migrated to foreign shores for jobs and opportunities .
dw spoke to acclaimed physicist eicke weber , who worked in the us for 23 years , about his decision to come back to germany . after 23 years of research in the usa , which he put an end to after teaching materials science at the university of california in berkeley , professor eicke weber finally came home to germany .
on july 1 , 2006 , the physicist and materials researcher became director of the fraunhofer institute for solar energy systems ise in freiburg , southern germany .
what shaped your decision to come back to germany after working in the us as a researcher for over two decades ?
the united states is a unique place worldwide because it is attractive for people from around the world for active and energetic people and of course for scientists who are looking for excellent working conditions .
the united states therefore really attracts the best scientists from around the world .
the universities in the us offer many attractive positions .
they offer a level playing field to compete for funds for research .
the result is that competition is much tougher than , say , in germany .
but those who continuously have good ideas and stay ahead of the others have good opportunities .
on the other hand , this " brain drain " is n't good for other countries .
that means that europe and asia have to make sure they create attractive conditions for people to come back to .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fraunhofer insitut in freiburg focuses on research in solar energy and energy efficiency the kind of institute i came back to - fraunhofer - is a very special government laboratory because it is a government-sponsored institute , but basically it has to earn its money through its own success .
in my institute , basic funding from the government is down to 10 percent - that means 90 percent is based on our success in bringing in projects , half from industry and half from government sources .
this creates a competitive atmosphere , -lsb- which -rsb- i liked so much while working in the us .
i must say i was very happy to have this opportunity to come back to .
american research institutes offer substantially higher salaries than institutes in germany .
is that one of the main reasons scientists find it difficult to return to countries such as germany ?
it 's a whole package of things .
i have been quite involved in this topic - when i was in the us i founded an organization called " german scholars organization " to help german scholars find interesting jobs in germany .
and what was frequently mentioned was that the salary is not the problem but rather the structure of the system .
in the us , you can enter the university as i did - as an untenured assistant professor , and if you are successful , you can obtain tenure .
and after 10 years , you can progress to be a full professor .
in the german system , you have boxes - that means your eyes are on the assistant professor level and then you have to go to another university to progress and get a permanent position .
this is of course completely unpredictable because you never know what kind of people you are competing with for the new position .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weber says it 's easier to plan a career as a researcher in the us so in the united states , you can plan your career much better .
it 's much more dependant on your own success and your own contribution to science and technology , whereas in germany it depends on factors that are difficult to control .
that means that when you apply for a position , it 's always a gamble , you never know who the other competitors are , you do n't the preferences of the people who want to hire you .
in all the discussions with foreign scholars in the united states , there 's agreement that the us provides very predictable working conditions where everything depends on how good you are .
you set up the " german scholars organization " in the united states in 2003 .
was the idea to build bridges between germany and the us ?
yes , exactly .
as a scholar in the us , you really feel like you are -lsb- out -rsb- in the world and you are approached by universities or industry who want to hire you .
you do n't have a similar type of approach from german employers .
basically you 're not in the country anymore and you have to make big efforts to stay in touch and get to know what 's going on in germany .
at that point we thought an organization that concentrates on building this bridge between very interested employers in germany and those scholars abroad would make a difference .
it did .
we managed to attract a particularly interesting program from the krupp foundation .
the foundation gave us several million euros to provide scholarships of $ 100,000 -lrb- 74,000 euros -rrb- for returning scholars on university positions in germany .
the scholars who got this grant said it made a big difference to them .
so there are things that can be done with relatively modest means in order to make a return to germany more attractive .
have you continued with the focus of your research as head of the fraunhofer institute for solar energy in freiburg ?
yes , as a matter of fact when i came to freiburg , the fraunhofer institute was so interested in my own research that they provided me with a very big research grant so we could set up a whole laboratory to pursue research to make good solar cells from silicon with high impurity content .
of course , this is what i 'm very interested in .
on the other hand , leading an institute with 800 people with a budget of 15 million euros means that i do n't have too much time to be involved in research on a day-to-day basis .
but for me it 's very satisfying that from my director 's level i can make sure that the things i 'm interested in get the support they deserve .
i can really say that i 'm very impressed with the quality of the people and their enthusiasm .
everybody there knows that we are working on something which is important for the future of the world .
and therefore though our salaries are not very competitive , compared to the salaries offered in the industry , many stay - though they could easily double their salaries - because they like the freedom and the atmosphere we provide .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 18.05.2009 eu foreign ministers condemn suu kyi trial in burma großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists have been protesting the detention and trial of aung san suu kyi european union foreign ministers said that the bloc would look into applying new sanctions to the military regime in burma as they condemned the " show trial " of opposition leader aung san suu kyi . european union foreign ministers agreed on monday to look at how sanctions on burma might be toughened over its treatment of opposition leader aung san suu kyi , but some said only asian nations could influence the military government .
the ministers are set to press their counterparts from the association of south-east asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- to take firm action against burma 's military junta at a may 25 meeting , officials said .
" we have an agreement to investigate more sanctions , we have an agreement that we should pursue the asean track next week ... and we have an agreement that we need to come back to that issue , " british foreign secretary david miliband said after a meeting with eu counterparts in brussels .
unanimous condemnation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been protests around the world the regime 's decision to arrest nobel peace prize winner suu kyi and commit her to what miliband called a " show trial " has provoked outrage in europe and dominated monday 's regular eu talks .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said that the trial against aung san suu kyi was further evidence of the state of human rights in burma .
" the trial against aung san suu kyi is an indication of the continued disregard for basic human rights in myanmar -lrb- burma -rrb- , " steinmeier said on the sidelines of the meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels . " to lock away and sentence -lrb- suu kyi -rrb- does not bring stability or reconciliation .
in this way , the scheduled elections will become a farce , " steinmeier said . " i expect the trial to not only be postponed , but to be immediately stopped and ms suu kyi be set free at last , " the minister added .
the other eu ministers echoed these sentiments , condemning the trial of burma 's pro-democracy icon , which got under way in the capital of rangoon shortly before the start of the meeting in brussels .
no sanctions yet however , despite debating the possibility , the foreign ministers stopped short of bringing in more sanctions against the country 's regime , instead calling for more cooperation with regional powers such as china and india .
" this is not the moment to lower the sanctions , this is the moment to increase them , " said eu foreign policy chief javier solana . the czech government , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , is " ready to discuss the reinforcement of sanctions , " but first there " will be a call on the burmese authorities to release aung san suu kyi , " its foreign minister , jan kohout , said . but other ministers pointed out that the extension of the sanctions had not stopped the burmese regime putting suu kyi on trial just a fortnight before her six years of house arrest were to end . the sanctions " have not achieved much .
this is one of the big problems that we always have with sanction policies , " finnish foreign minister alexander stubb said . instead , a number of top officials called on the eu to step up its cooperation with china , india and other regional actors in a bid to pressurize the burmese regime . " we have to reinforce the dialogue with burma 's neighbours ...

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 18.05.2009 exhibition highlights works of german composers in nazi era großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibition shows various publications from the nazi era on bach and his music germany is marking the 200th birthday of composer felix mendelssohn , an important figure in the revival of the music of bach , with a first ever exhibition focusing on how the nazis treated the two artists . called " blood and spirit - bach , mendelssohn and their music in the third reich , " a controversial exhibition opened on friday at the bachhaus in the eastern city of eisenach , the birthplace of johann sebastian bach -lrb- 1685-1750 -rrb- .
the show uses photographs , documents , books , instruments and detailed explanations to show how vastly different the two musical icons were treated by the nazis and how their works were manipulated and distorted .
museum director joerg hansen said hitler 's reception of the two composers offers an " important lesson " about the nazi rhetoric of " german superiority " and " jewish threat . "
mendelssohn denigrated by the nazis mendelssohn -lrb- 1809-1847 -rrb- , born to an illustrious jewish family in hamburg , sharply divided opinion in the music world .
during his lifetime he was considered a musical genius by some while others found his style too conservative .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mendelssohn is considered one of the most important composers of the romantic period but mendelssohn is largely credited for playing a pivotal role in the revival of interest in the music of bach , which had largely been forgotten around that time .
just a century later , the tables had turned - when hitler came to power in 1933 , the nazi regime cited mendelssohn 's jewish origin as a reason to ban performance and publication of his works .
once the co-founder of the new bach society in leipzig , mendelssohn was denigrated by nazi musicologists as having contributed to the " effeminacy " of german music in the 19th century .
the show documents how the nazis in 1936 removed a statue of mendelssohn erected in leipzig in 1892 and his works from all the important concert halls in the country .
it also touches on the 1938 duesseldorf exhibition " degenerate music . "
bach the most " german of all germans " bach , on the other hand , was celebrated by the nazis as a " northern " musical artist .
his music was played during nazi party conferences and the texts to his works were tweaked to suit the party 's propaganda .
a special unit set up by the regime to rework music ensured that bach 's music was " purified of jewish references . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : johann sebastian bach is widely considered one of the greatest composers in the western tradition museum director hansen said adolf hitler and his propaganda minister joseph goebbels publicly paid homage to bach as the " most german of all german composers " while mendelssohn the " jew " was considered a dangerous " accident " in music history .
one of the exhibits in eisenach includes a choral piece by bach which was reworded to be the battle song of the hitler youth movement .
another photograph shows the leipzig thomas choir which joined the movement in 1937 .
the exhibition spans the period from 1829 , when the then 21-year-old mendelssohn performed bach 's st. matthew passion at the berlin singakademie , to the persecution and death of jewish artists in nazi concentration camps .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view of the bachhaus in eisenach in the state of thuringia , the birthplace of bach the success of mendelssohn 's berlin performance , the first since bach 's death in 1750 , was an important element in the renaissance of bach 's music in germany and , eventually , throughout europe .
it earned mendelssohn widespread acclaim .
hansen said the exhibition remained a controversial one because it touched on a difficult chapter of history .
as a result , the museum director said it can not be shown in the eastern city of leipzig - an important city where both bach and mendelssohn spent important and productive parts of their careers and where bach is a larger-than-life figure .
the exhibition in eisenach runs through nov 8 , 2009. sp / dpa / epd editor : kristin zeier send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the show uses photographs , documents , books , instruments and detailed explanations to show how vastly different the two musical icons were treated by the nazis and how their works were manipulated and distorted .
museum director joerg hansen said hitler 's reception of the two composers offers an " important lesson " about the nazi rhetoric of " german superiority " and " jewish threat . "
mendelssohn denigrated by the nazis mendelssohn -lrb- 1809-1847 -rrb- , born to an illustrious jewish family in hamburg , sharply divided opinion in the music world .
during his lifetime he was considered a musical genius by some while others found his style too conservative .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mendelssohn is considered one of the most important composers of the romantic period but mendelssohn is largely credited for playing a pivotal role in the revival of interest in the music of bach , which had largely been forgotten around that time .
just a century later , the tables had turned - when hitler came to power in 1933 , the nazi regime cited mendelssohn 's jewish origin as a reason to ban performance and publication of his works .
once the co-founder of the new bach society in leipzig , mendelssohn was denigrated by nazi musicologists as having contributed to the " effeminacy " of german music in the 19th century .
the show documents how the nazis in 1936 removed a statue of mendelssohn erected in leipzig in 1892 and his works from all the important concert halls in the country .
it also touches on the 1938 duesseldorf exhibition " degenerate music . "
bach the most " german of all germans " bach , on the other hand , was celebrated by the nazis as a " northern " musical artist .
his music was played during nazi party conferences and the texts to his works were tweaked to suit the party 's propaganda .
a special unit set up by the regime to rework music ensured that bach 's music was " purified of jewish references . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : johann sebastian bach is widely considered one of the greatest composers in the western tradition museum director hansen said adolf hitler and his propaganda minister joseph goebbels publicly paid homage to bach as the " most german of all german composers " while mendelssohn the " jew " was considered a dangerous " accident " in music history .
one of the exhibits in eisenach includes a choral piece by bach which was reworded to be the battle song of the hitler youth movement .
another photograph shows the leipzig thomas choir which joined the movement in 1937 .
the exhibition spans the period from 1829 , when the then 21-year-old mendelssohn performed bach 's st. matthew passion at the berlin singakademie , to the persecution and death of jewish artists in nazi concentration camps .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view of the bachhaus in eisenach in the state of thuringia , the birthplace of bach the success of mendelssohn 's berlin performance , the first since bach 's death in 1750 , was an important element in the renaissance of bach 's music in germany and , eventually , throughout europe .
it earned mendelssohn widespread acclaim .
hansen said the exhibition remained a controversial one because it touched on a difficult chapter of history .
as a result , the museum director said it can not be shown in the eastern city of leipzig - an important city where both bach and mendelssohn spent important and productive parts of their careers and where bach is a larger-than-life figure .

generally seen as a tough and competent leader by the electorate , merkel is also often perceived as cool and lacking in charisma .
merkel saw this as an opportunity to connect with voters on a personal level .
in the berlin studio of commercial broadcaster rtl , merkel met with 100 guests and answered questions ranging from how she planned to balance the budget without increasing taxes to what she likes to cook in her free time .
the town hall meeting is a departure from typical german political campaigns , which rarely focus on a candidate 's personality and private life .
merkel 's appearance was seen by many in germany as obama-esque .
us president barack obama is known for his charm and held a town hall meeting while in strasbourg , france , at the beginning of april for a nato summit .
a kinder , gentler chancellor this election year merkel 's party , the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , seems to be pushing a softer merkel and is banking on her popularity .
the chancellor is doing better in opinion polls than the cdu itself .
as the global economy crumbles , merkel must convince voters that she and her traditionally pro-business party understand the everyday concerns that trouble ordinary germans .

train for a career the german economy is facing its deepest recession since world war ii and some 300,000 jobs have been lost since last september when the us investment bank lehman brothers collapsed .
despite the difficult situation , merkel was optimistic .
" we 've probably just about reached the low point , " she said of the ongoing recession .
and a potential increase in the sales tax was an " absolute no . "
merkel also doled out some practical advice during the evening .
when an unemployed 21 year old complained that the employment office could n't give him appointment for two months , merkel agreed that should n't be the case .
but then she asked what he had trained to do .
when the young man answered , " nothing " , she encouraged him to take advantage of his free time .
" do everything you can to train for a career , " she advised .
let 's get personal participants in the forum wanted to know how merkel stayed connected with the lives of germany 's citizens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel relaxes by cooking or traveling with her husband her husband , chemistry professor joachin sauer , keeps her grounded , she said .
" i have to fold my own clothes at home and fill the washing machine , " she said .

" i make a pretty good potato soup , " she said , and her guests say they love her stuffed beef roll .
" i do n't think they 're just telling me what i want to hear , " she said .
the chancellor also spoke openly about the importance of her faith in god .
she believes god looks over and protects humanity , and " that gives me strength , " she said. hf / dpa / reuters editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the ministers are set to press their counterparts from the association of south-east asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- to take firm action against burma 's military junta at a may 25 meeting , officials said .
" we have an agreement to investigate more sanctions , we have an agreement that we should pursue the asean track next week ... and we have an agreement that we need to come back to that issue , " british foreign secretary david miliband said after a meeting with eu counterparts in brussels .
unanimous condemnation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been protests around the world the regime 's decision to arrest nobel peace prize winner suu kyi and commit her to what miliband called a " show trial " has provoked outrage in europe and dominated monday 's regular eu talks .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said that the trial against aung san suu kyi was further evidence of the state of human rights in burma .
" the trial against aung san suu kyi is an indication of the continued disregard for basic human rights in myanmar -lrb- burma -rrb- , " steinmeier said on the sidelines of the meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels . " to lock away and sentence -lrb- suu kyi -rrb- does not bring stability or reconciliation .
in this way , the scheduled elections will become a farce , " steinmeier said . " i expect the trial to not only be postponed , but to be immediately stopped and ms suu kyi be set free at last , " the minister added .
the other eu ministers echoed these sentiments , condemning the trial of burma 's pro-democracy icon , which got under way in the capital of rangoon shortly before the start of the meeting in brussels .
no sanctions yet however , despite debating the possibility , the foreign ministers stopped short of bringing in more sanctions against the country 's regime , instead calling for more cooperation with regional powers such as china and india .
" this is not the moment to lower the sanctions , this is the moment to increase them , " said eu foreign policy chief javier solana . the czech government , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , is " ready to discuss the reinforcement of sanctions , " but first there " will be a call on the burmese authorities to release aung san suu kyi , " its foreign minister , jan kohout , said . but other ministers pointed out that the extension of the sanctions had not stopped the burmese regime putting suu kyi on trial just a fortnight before her six years of house arrest were to end . the sanctions " have not achieved much .
this is one of the big problems that we always have with sanction policies , " finnish foreign minister alexander stubb said . instead , a number of top officials called on the eu to step up its cooperation with china , india and other regional actors in a bid to pressurize the burmese regime . " we have to reinforce the dialogue with burma 's neighbours ...
we have been doing all of that , but maybe not in a sufficient way , " eu foreign affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said . " we have to engage with the other countries in the region , " agreed swedish foreign minister carl bildt , whose country will assume the eu presidency on july 1 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the military junta claims suu kyi violated the terms of her house arrest one month ago , eu foreign ministers extended through april 2010 a package of sanctions against some 500 regime figures and their families , as well as against some 80 businesses linked to the regime , in a bid to urge them towards democratic reforms .
suu kyi went on trial on monday , facing up to five years in jail after burma 's government said she had broken the terms of her house arrest in connection with an incident involving us citizen john yettaw , who is alleged to have spent two days in her house this month .
suu kyi , 63 , was expected to plead not guilty to the charges .
the junta 's critics have accused it of using the episode as a pretext to keep suu kyi in jail during a politically sensitive period leading up to a general election planned for next year. mrm / nda / dpa / reuters / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

generally seen as a tough and competent leader by the electorate , merkel is also often perceived as cool and lacking in charisma .
merkel saw this as an opportunity to connect with voters on a personal level .
in the berlin studio of commercial broadcaster rtl , merkel met with 100 guests and answered questions ranging from how she planned to balance the budget without increasing taxes to what she likes to cook in her free time .
the town hall meeting is a departure from typical german political campaigns , which rarely focus on a candidate 's personality and private life .
merkel 's appearance was seen by many in germany as obama-esque .
us president barack obama is known for his charm and held a town hall meeting while in strasbourg , france , at the beginning of april for a nato summit .
a kinder , gentler chancellor this election year merkel 's party , the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , seems to be pushing a softer merkel and is banking on her popularity .
the chancellor is doing better in opinion polls than the cdu itself .
as the global economy crumbles , merkel must convince voters that she and her traditionally pro-business party understand the everyday concerns that trouble ordinary germans .

merkel also doled out some practical advice during the evening .
when an unemployed 21 year old complained that the employment office could n't give him appointment for two months , merkel agreed that should n't be the case .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 18.05.2009 porsche crisis talks as vw merger falters großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche 's bid to own majority shares in vw caused it to rack up 9 billion euros in debt an integrated volkswagen-porsche company appears less likely amid growing friction between the clans which own the two carmakers .
porsche may have to seek another partner in order to survive if the vw plan falls through . in the latest twist in the volkswagen-porsche merger saga , vw chairman ferdinand piech failed to show up at a crucial meeting of porsche 's supervisory board on monday .
reports say no explanation has been offered for his absence .
the piechs and porsches are heirs to two of germany 's oldest industrial families .
now , a power struggle over the shape of a new , post-merger auto giant is threatening to wreck a deal to amalgamate europe 's largest automaker with luxury sports car manufacturer porsche .
monday 's meeting was called to address the integration plan , which was agreed upon earlier this month after a meeting of the porsche family and top executives of the two companies in salzburg , austria .
however , that plan veered off course over the weekend when vw announced it was stalling negotiations pending " clarification " from porsche .
the latter , however , insisted talks were still on track and that only a working group meeting between the two companies had been cancelled .
the porsche parent group owns just over 50 percent of vw after boosting its stake earlier in the year .
in fact , the company had aimed to raise its stake to 75 percent until it was hit by the global economic downturn . porsche is now weighed down by a nine-billion-euro -lrb- $ 12 billion -rrb- debt , which forced it to abandon ambitions for a complete takeover of the much larger vw . meanwhile , thousands of porsche workers demonstrated on monday outside the venue of the meeting in weissach , a suburb of the southern city of stuttgart , against vw 's reported plans to turn porsche into just another division of the auto giant .
the chief labor representative urged the roughly 3,000 demonstrators to fight to retain porsche 's independence . rb / dpa / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de vw looking for clarity as talks break off with porsche german automaker volkswagen says it has suspended talks on a possible merger with porsche after workers at the german luxury sports car maker said they would protest against alleged takeover plans .
-lrb- 18.05.2009 -rrb- porsche 's takeover bid for vw scrutinized by regulators bafin , germany 's market regulator , is to investigate whether porsche was involved in market manipulation during its bid to take over rival german carmaker volkswagen .
-lrb- 12.05.2009 -rrb- speculation abounds over future boss of a vw-porsche group german car experts are waiting to see who takes the wheel after a potential tie-up of porsche and vw .
much uncertainty remains , including who will own the auto giant and what city the company will call home .

porsche may have to seek another partner in order to survive if the vw plan falls through . in the latest twist in the volkswagen-porsche merger saga , vw chairman ferdinand piech failed to show up at a crucial meeting of porsche 's supervisory board on monday .
reports say no explanation has been offered for his absence .
the piechs and porsches are heirs to two of germany 's oldest industrial families .
now , a power struggle over the shape of a new , post-merger auto giant is threatening to wreck a deal to amalgamate europe 's largest automaker with luxury sports car manufacturer porsche .
monday 's meeting was called to address the integration plan , which was agreed upon earlier this month after a meeting of the porsche family and top executives of the two companies in salzburg , austria .
however , that plan veered off course over the weekend when vw announced it was stalling negotiations pending " clarification " from porsche .
the latter , however , insisted talks were still on track and that only a working group meeting between the two companies had been cancelled .
the porsche parent group owns just over 50 percent of vw after boosting its stake earlier in the year .
in fact , the company had aimed to raise its stake to 75 percent until it was hit by the global economic downturn . porsche is now weighed down by a nine-billion-euro -lrb- $ 12 billion -rrb- debt , which forced it to abandon ambitions for a complete takeover of the much larger vw . meanwhile , thousands of porsche workers demonstrated on monday outside the venue of the meeting in weissach , a suburb of the southern city of stuttgart , against vw 's reported plans to turn porsche into just another division of the auto giant .

porsche 's management , they said , did not realize how dicey the situation was for the sports carmaker .
" for a merger of volkswagen and porsche , we need to systematically analyze the current situation of porsche and we need to have a clear picture of the actual conditions there , " volkswagen ceo martin winterkorn was quoted as saying in monday ’ s edition of the berliner zeitung .
volkswagen would need " full transparency " to continue talks , he said .
vw 's chief labor representative , bernd osterloh , said the talks set for monday had been called off because " the current atmosphere was not conducive to a constructive dialog . "
" we were not the ones who had asked for talks and we will not allow volkswagen and individuals in our company to be disparaged just because porsche has no clear strategy , " osterloh said .
friction between the two sides intensified after the porsche and piech families , who control the two carmakers with crossover share holdings , instructed the companies to draft merger plans within the past weeks .
in the negotiations it emerged that the more likely scenario would be that volkswagen would instead end up swallowing porsche .

ferdinand piech , vw board chairman , underscored porsche 's predicament last monday when he said that the stuttgart-based company was running short of cash .
the head of the porsche works ' council , uwe hueck , said he plans to lead thousands of workers in a protest march this coming monday to demonstrate against what he called piech 's perceived arrogance .
vw 's osterloh remarked it was time for the porsche family " to clearly say what it wants and what it does n't want . "
porsche , in the meantime , along with another german sports car maker , bmw , is apparently exploring the possibility of state loans to shore up the steep drop in demand for its vehicles .

porsche 's management , they said , did not realize how dicey the situation was for the sports carmaker .
" for a merger of volkswagen and porsche , we need to systematically analyze the current situation of porsche and we need to have a clear picture of the actual conditions there , " volkswagen ceo martin winterkorn was quoted as saying in monday ’ s edition of the berliner zeitung .
volkswagen would need " full transparency " to continue talks , he said .
vw 's chief labor representative , bernd osterloh , said the talks set for monday had been called off because " the current atmosphere was not conducive to a constructive dialog . "
" we were not the ones who had asked for talks and we will not allow volkswagen and individuals in our company to be disparaged just because porsche has no clear strategy , " osterloh said .
friction between the two sides intensified after the porsche and piech families , who control the two carmakers with crossover share holdings , instructed the companies to draft merger plans within the past weeks .
in the negotiations it emerged that the more likely scenario would be that volkswagen would instead end up swallowing porsche .
the economic crisis has changed the equation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the porsche 911 has been the carmaker 's biggest seller over the years in one of germany 's great corporate takeover battles , porsche last year managed to buy a controlling stake in the vastly larger volkswagen .

ferdinand piech , vw board chairman , underscored porsche 's predicament last monday when he said that the stuttgart-based company was running short of cash .
the head of the porsche works ' council , uwe hueck , said he plans to lead thousands of workers in a protest march this coming monday to demonstrate against what he called piech 's perceived arrogance .
vw 's osterloh remarked it was time for the porsche family " to clearly say what it wants and what it does n't want . "
porsche , in the meantime , along with another german sports car maker , bmw , is apparently exploring the possibility of state loans to shore up the steep drop in demand for its vehicles .

generally seen as a tough and competent leader by the electorate , merkel is also often perceived as cool and lacking in charisma .
merkel saw this as an opportunity to connect with voters on a personal level .
in the berlin studio of commercial broadcaster rtl , merkel met with 100 guests and answered questions ranging from how she planned to balance the budget without increasing taxes to what she likes to cook in her free time .
the town hall meeting is a departure from typical german political campaigns , which rarely focus on a candidate 's personality and private life .
merkel 's appearance was seen by many in germany as obama-esque .
us president barack obama is known for his charm and held a town hall meeting while in strasbourg , france , at the beginning of april for a nato summit .

train for a career the german economy is facing its deepest recession since world war ii and some 300,000 jobs have been lost since last september when the us investment bank lehman brothers collapsed .
despite the difficult situation , merkel was optimistic .
" we 've probably just about reached the low point , " she said of the ongoing recession .
and a potential increase in the sales tax was an " absolute no . "
merkel also doled out some practical advice during the evening .
when an unemployed 21 year old complained that the employment office could n't give him appointment for two months , merkel agreed that should n't be the case .
but then she asked what he had trained to do .
when the young man answered , " nothing " , she encouraged him to take advantage of his free time .
" do everything you can to train for a career , " she advised .
let 's get personal participants in the forum wanted to know how merkel stayed connected with the lives of germany 's citizens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel relaxes by cooking or traveling with her husband her husband , chemistry professor joachin sauer , keeps her grounded , she said .
" i have to fold my own clothes at home and fill the washing machine , " she said .
she shops for food at normal grocery stores , she said , adding that she likes to cook on the weekends .
" i make a pretty good potato soup , " she said , and her guests say they love her stuffed beef roll .
" i do n't think they 're just telling me what i want to hear , " she said .
the chancellor also spoke openly about the importance of her faith in god .
she believes god looks over and protects humanity , and " that gives me strength , " she said. hf / dpa / reuters editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

us president barack obama is known for his charm and held a town hall meeting while in strasbourg , france , at the beginning of april for a nato summit .
a kinder , gentler chancellor this election year merkel 's party , the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , seems to be pushing a softer merkel and is banking on her popularity .
the chancellor is doing better in opinion polls than the cdu itself .
as the global economy crumbles , merkel must convince voters that she and her traditionally pro-business party understand the everyday concerns that trouble ordinary germans .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's advice to the unemployed ?
train for a career the german economy is facing its deepest recession since world war ii and some 300,000 jobs have been lost since last september when the us investment bank lehman brothers collapsed .
despite the difficult situation , merkel was optimistic .
" we 've probably just about reached the low point , " she said of the ongoing recession .
and a potential increase in the sales tax was an " absolute no . "
merkel also doled out some practical advice during the evening .
when an unemployed 21 year old complained that the employment office could n't give him appointment for two months , merkel agreed that should n't be the case .
but then she asked what he had trained to do .
when the young man answered , " nothing " , she encouraged him to take advantage of his free time .
" do everything you can to train for a career , " she advised .
let 's get personal participants in the forum wanted to know how merkel stayed connected with the lives of germany 's citizens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel relaxes by cooking or traveling with her husband her husband , chemistry professor joachin sauer , keeps her grounded , she said .
" i have to fold my own clothes at home and fill the washing machine , " she said .
she shops for food at normal grocery stores , she said , adding that she likes to cook on the weekends .
" i make a pretty good potato soup , " she said , and her guests say they love her stuffed beef roll .
" i do n't think they 're just telling me what i want to hear , " she said .
the chancellor also spoke openly about the importance of her faith in god .
she believes god looks over and protects humanity , and " that gives me strength , " she said. hf / dpa / reuters editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

porsche may have to seek another partner in order to survive if the vw plan falls through . in the latest twist in the volkswagen-porsche merger saga , vw chairman ferdinand piech failed to show up at a crucial meeting of porsche 's supervisory board on monday .
reports say no explanation has been offered for his absence .
the piechs and porsches are heirs to two of germany 's oldest industrial families .
now , a power struggle over the shape of a new , post-merger auto giant is threatening to wreck a deal to amalgamate europe 's largest automaker with luxury sports car manufacturer porsche .
monday 's meeting was called to address the integration plan , which was agreed upon earlier this month after a meeting of the porsche family and top executives of the two companies in salzburg , austria .
however , that plan veered off course over the weekend when vw announced it was stalling negotiations pending " clarification " from porsche .
the latter , however , insisted talks were still on track and that only a working group meeting between the two companies had been cancelled .
the porsche parent group owns just over 50 percent of vw after boosting its stake earlier in the year .
in fact , the company had aimed to raise its stake to 75 percent until it was hit by the global economic downturn . porsche is now weighed down by a nine-billion-euro -lrb- $ 12 billion -rrb- debt , which forced it to abandon ambitions for a complete takeover of the much larger vw . meanwhile , thousands of porsche workers demonstrated on monday outside the venue of the meeting in weissach , a suburb of the southern city of stuttgart , against vw 's reported plans to turn porsche into just another division of the auto giant .
the chief labor representative urged the roughly 3,000 demonstrators to fight to retain porsche 's independence . rb / dpa / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

about 100 employees demonstrated in support of hilgert outside the bank in dusseldorf as members of the state-owned bank 's supervisory board arrived for an evening meeting .
westlb later announced that hilgert 's deputy dietrich voigtländer would initially take over .
hilgert had taken charge a year ago after a purge of the previous management .
westlb , which was hit hard by the global financial crisis , is mainly owned by regional savings banks as well as the state of north-rhine westphalia .
in recent months the savings banks had objected to providing further financial guarantees for westlb .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 18.05.2009 researcher says merit-based us system better at attracting talent großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weber says the us does a better job of rewarding success and creativity than europe in recent years , skilled germans have migrated to foreign shores for jobs and opportunities .
dw spoke to acclaimed physicist eicke weber , who worked in the us for 23 years , about his decision to come back to germany . after 23 years of research in the usa , which he put an end to after teaching materials science at the university of california in berkeley , professor eicke weber finally came home to germany .
on july 1 , 2006 , the physicist and materials researcher became director of the fraunhofer institute for solar energy systems ise in freiburg , southern germany .
what shaped your decision to come back to germany after working in the us as a researcher for over two decades ?
the united states is a unique place worldwide because it is attractive for people from around the world for active and energetic people and of course for scientists who are looking for excellent working conditions .
the united states therefore really attracts the best scientists from around the world .
the universities in the us offer many attractive positions .
they offer a level playing field to compete for funds for research .
the result is that competition is much tougher than , say , in germany .
but those who continuously have good ideas and stay ahead of the others have good opportunities .
on the other hand , this " brain drain " is n't good for other countries .
that means that europe and asia have to make sure they create attractive conditions for people to come back to .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fraunhofer insitut in freiburg focuses on research in solar energy and energy efficiency the kind of institute i came back to - fraunhofer - is a very special government laboratory because it is a government-sponsored institute , but basically it has to earn its money through its own success .
in my institute , basic funding from the government is down to 10 percent - that means 90 percent is based on our success in bringing in projects , half from industry and half from government sources .
this creates a competitive atmosphere , -lsb- which -rsb- i liked so much while working in the us .
i must say i was very happy to have this opportunity to come back to .
american research institutes offer substantially higher salaries than institutes in germany .
is that one of the main reasons scientists find it difficult to return to countries such as germany ?
it 's a whole package of things .
i have been quite involved in this topic - when i was in the us i founded an organization called " german scholars organization " to help german scholars find interesting jobs in germany .
and what was frequently mentioned was that the salary is not the problem but rather the structure of the system .
in the us , you can enter the university as i did - as an untenured assistant professor , and if you are successful , you can obtain tenure .
and after 10 years , you can progress to be a full professor .
in the german system , you have boxes - that means your eyes are on the assistant professor level and then you have to go to another university to progress and get a permanent position .
this is of course completely unpredictable because you never know what kind of people you are competing with for the new position .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weber says it 's easier to plan a career as a researcher in the us so in the united states , you can plan your career much better .
it 's much more dependant on your own success and your own contribution to science and technology , whereas in germany it depends on factors that are difficult to control .
that means that when you apply for a position , it 's always a gamble , you never know who the other competitors are , you do n't the preferences of the people who want to hire you .
in all the discussions with foreign scholars in the united states , there 's agreement that the us provides very predictable working conditions where everything depends on how good you are .
you set up the " german scholars organization " in the united states in 2003 .
was the idea to build bridges between germany and the us ?
yes , exactly .
as a scholar in the us , you really feel like you are -lsb- out -rsb- in the world and you are approached by universities or industry who want to hire you .
you do n't have a similar type of approach from german employers .
basically you 're not in the country anymore and you have to make big efforts to stay in touch and get to know what 's going on in germany .
at that point we thought an organization that concentrates on building this bridge between very interested employers in germany and those scholars abroad would make a difference .
it did .
we managed to attract a particularly interesting program from the krupp foundation .
the foundation gave us several million euros to provide scholarships of $ 100,000 -lrb- 74,000 euros -rrb- for returning scholars on university positions in germany .
the scholars who got this grant said it made a big difference to them .
so there are things that can be done with relatively modest means in order to make a return to germany more attractive .
have you continued with the focus of your research as head of the fraunhofer institute for solar energy in freiburg ?
yes , as a matter of fact when i came to freiburg , the fraunhofer institute was so interested in my own research that they provided me with a very big research grant so we could set up a whole laboratory to pursue research to make good solar cells from silicon with high impurity content .
of course , this is what i 'm very interested in .
on the other hand , leading an institute with 800 people with a budget of 15 million euros means that i do n't have too much time to be involved in research on a day-to-day basis .
but for me it 's very satisfying that from my director 's level i can make sure that the things i 'm interested in get the support they deserve .
i can really say that i 'm very impressed with the quality of the people and their enthusiasm .
everybody there knows that we are working on something which is important for the future of the world .
and therefore though our salaries are not very competitive , compared to the salaries offered in the industry , many stay - though they could easily double their salaries - because they like the freedom and the atmosphere we provide .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 18.05.2009 researcher says merit-based us system better at attracting talent großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weber says the us does a better job of rewarding success and creativity than europe in recent years , skilled germans have migrated to foreign shores for jobs and opportunities .
dw spoke to acclaimed physicist eicke weber , who worked in the us for 23 years , about his decision to come back to germany . after 23 years of research in the usa , which he put an end to after teaching materials science at the university of california in berkeley , professor eicke weber finally came home to germany .
on july 1 , 2006 , the physicist and materials researcher became director of the fraunhofer institute for solar energy systems ise in freiburg , southern germany .
what shaped your decision to come back to germany after working in the us as a researcher for over two decades ?
the united states is a unique place worldwide because it is attractive for people from around the world for active and energetic people and of course for scientists who are looking for excellent working conditions .
the united states therefore really attracts the best scientists from around the world .
the universities in the us offer many attractive positions .
they offer a level playing field to compete for funds for research .
the result is that competition is much tougher than , say , in germany .
but those who continuously have good ideas and stay ahead of the others have good opportunities .
on the other hand , this " brain drain " is n't good for other countries .
that means that europe and asia have to make sure they create attractive conditions for people to come back to .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fraunhofer insitut in freiburg focuses on research in solar energy and energy efficiency the kind of institute i came back to - fraunhofer - is a very special government laboratory because it is a government-sponsored institute , but basically it has to earn its money through its own success .
in my institute , basic funding from the government is down to 10 percent - that means 90 percent is based on our success in bringing in projects , half from industry and half from government sources .
this creates a competitive atmosphere , -lsb- which -rsb- i liked so much while working in the us .
i must say i was very happy to have this opportunity to come back to .
american research institutes offer substantially higher salaries than institutes in germany .
is that one of the main reasons scientists find it difficult to return to countries such as germany ?
it 's a whole package of things .
i have been quite involved in this topic - when i was in the us i founded an organization called " german scholars organization " to help german scholars find interesting jobs in germany .
and what was frequently mentioned was that the salary is not the problem but rather the structure of the system .
in the us , you can enter the university as i did - as an untenured assistant professor , and if you are successful , you can obtain tenure .
and after 10 years , you can progress to be a full professor .
in the german system , you have boxes - that means your eyes are on the assistant professor level and then you have to go to another university to progress and get a permanent position .
this is of course completely unpredictable because you never know what kind of people you are competing with for the new position .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weber says it 's easier to plan a career as a researcher in the us so in the united states , you can plan your career much better .
it 's much more dependant on your own success and your own contribution to science and technology , whereas in germany it depends on factors that are difficult to control .
that means that when you apply for a position , it 's always a gamble , you never know who the other competitors are , you do n't the preferences of the people who want to hire you .
in all the discussions with foreign scholars in the united states , there 's agreement that the us provides very predictable working conditions where everything depends on how good you are .
you set up the " german scholars organization " in the united states in 2003 .
was the idea to build bridges between germany and the us ?
yes , exactly .
as a scholar in the us , you really feel like you are -lsb- out -rsb- in the world and you are approached by universities or industry who want to hire you .
you do n't have a similar type of approach from german employers .
basically you 're not in the country anymore and you have to make big efforts to stay in touch and get to know what 's going on in germany .
at that point we thought an organization that concentrates on building this bridge between very interested employers in germany and those scholars abroad would make a difference .
it did .
we managed to attract a particularly interesting program from the krupp foundation .
the foundation gave us several million euros to provide scholarships of $ 100,000 -lrb- 74,000 euros -rrb- for returning scholars on university positions in germany .
the scholars who got this grant said it made a big difference to them .
so there are things that can be done with relatively modest means in order to make a return to germany more attractive .
have you continued with the focus of your research as head of the fraunhofer institute for solar energy in freiburg ?
yes , as a matter of fact when i came to freiburg , the fraunhofer institute was so interested in my own research that they provided me with a very big research grant so we could set up a whole laboratory to pursue research to make good solar cells from silicon with high impurity content .
of course , this is what i 'm very interested in .
on the other hand , leading an institute with 800 people with a budget of 15 million euros means that i do n't have too much time to be involved in research on a day-to-day basis .
but for me it 's very satisfying that from my director 's level i can make sure that the things i 'm interested in get the support they deserve .
i can really say that i 'm very impressed with the quality of the people and their enthusiasm .
everybody there knows that we are working on something which is important for the future of the world .
and therefore though our salaries are not very competitive , compared to the salaries offered in the industry , many stay - though they could easily double their salaries - because they like the freedom and the atmosphere we provide .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 18.05.2009 obama faces big test on the middle east großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us president has vowed to tackle the israeli-palestinian conflict expectations run high for monday 's first official meeting between president obama and prime minister netanyahu .
can obama revive the middle east peace process ?
let 's hope he can , say europeans . barack obama vowed to take a different approach to foreign policy , one that would include working closely with allies . at a speech in berlin last summer , then-candidate obama proclaimed that " america has no better partner than europe . "
and european leaders have made it clear they 're counting on obama to push forward the middle east peace process .
obama 's meeting with israel 's prime minister benjamin netanyahu on monday in the white house provides a big chance for obama to live up to his pre-presidential statements on the middle east .
many feel obama , simply by declaring the goal to find a solution for the israeli-palestinian conflict a top priority for his administration , has done more right from the start than both the bush and the clinton administrations .
by naming a special envoy to the region and by stating his support for a so-called two-state solution - that is , the creation of a viable palestinian state next to israel - obama again displayed his commitment to the peace process .
but despite all the early efforts by the obama administration , one important fact remains unchanged : without the support of israel and the palestinians , any push for peace in the region is doomed .
so the big question when obama meets netanyahu is whether the us president can convince the israeli premier , who based on his political past and his recent statements is considered a hardliner , to go along with his vision .
can obama convince netanyahu ?
michael bauer , who heads the project europe and the middle east at munich 's center for applied policy research , puts a damper on hopes for a quick success : " the prospects for a successful resumption of the peace process are not very good at this point . "
bauer lists the international community 's cold reception of the new israeli government , especially its far-right foreign minister avidgor lieberman , the war in gaza which led to a further deterioration of already strained israeli-arab relations , the internal palestinian division between hamas and fatah and the continued israeli settlements as factors that could prove difficult to overcome .
despite those problems , argues nathalie tocci , the measuring stick for obama remains clear : " there is the question first and foremost whether netanyahu will accept the end goal of the road map , which means the acceptance of a two-state solution . "
but as tocci , a senior research fellow at the center for european policy research , is quick to add , merely stating one 's acceptance of common goals is not enough .
" the main issue hindering the accomplishment of progress along the road map was the fact of an absence of an international monitoring presence that could actually monitor the extent to which the obligations by both parties were fulfilled on the ground , " tocci said bauer agrees , saying obama should not rely on rhetoric commitments , but also demand concrete efforts on behalf of the israelis to rebuild confidence , for example by halting the construction of settlements .
europe 's role european leaders voiced their opinions on how obama ought to approach the middle east peace process during his recent visit to the continent .
but other than giving advice , what role can europe really play now that the us has retaken the leadership role ? " the europeans have in many ways played a second part in all the peace negotiations , " says daniel korski , a senior fellow at the european council on foreign relations .
" europeans have in a sense been the paymasters offering the financial incentives for any kind of peace deal .
however , practically they have always been marginalized in part because the israeli government has never been really interested in seeing european governments engaged . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe could play a larger role in peace negotiations but this is changing , korski argues .
first , some europeans are not ready to simply pick up the check again after seeing a lot of their investments go up in smoke in gaza .
and second , there are more pro-israeli leaders in major european capitals than before , providing the chance for europe to engage better with israel .
still , says korski , the question remains unanswered as to what exactly europe 's role could be in the peace process .
europe also has limited influence because it does n't speak with one voice on foreign affairs issues , experts say .
" but that does n't mean that the european union can not play a role , " says bauer .
" maybe it is even good that some member states have better relations with israel and other member states are perceived to be closer to the palestinian side . "
by turning its weakness into an asset , bauer suggests , europe could really act as an honest mediator in the conflict .

can obama revive the middle east peace process ?
let 's hope he can , say europeans . barack obama vowed to take a different approach to foreign policy , one that would include working closely with allies . at a speech in berlin last summer , then-candidate obama proclaimed that " america has no better partner than europe . "
and european leaders have made it clear they 're counting on obama to push forward the middle east peace process .
obama 's meeting with israel 's prime minister benjamin netanyahu on monday in the white house provides a big chance for obama to live up to his pre-presidential statements on the middle east .
many feel obama , simply by declaring the goal to find a solution for the israeli-palestinian conflict a top priority for his administration , has done more right from the start than both the bush and the clinton administrations .
by naming a special envoy to the region and by stating his support for a so-called two-state solution - that is , the creation of a viable palestinian state next to israel - obama again displayed his commitment to the peace process .
but despite all the early efforts by the obama administration , one important fact remains unchanged : without the support of israel and the palestinians , any push for peace in the region is doomed .
so the big question when obama meets netanyahu is whether the us president can convince the israeli premier , who based on his political past and his recent statements is considered a hardliner , to go along with his vision .
can obama convince netanyahu ?
michael bauer , who heads the project europe and the middle east at munich 's center for applied policy research , puts a damper on hopes for a quick success : " the prospects for a successful resumption of the peace process are not very good at this point . "
bauer lists the international community 's cold reception of the new israeli government , especially its far-right foreign minister avidgor lieberman , the war in gaza which led to a further deterioration of already strained israeli-arab relations , the internal palestinian division between hamas and fatah and the continued israeli settlements as factors that could prove difficult to overcome .
despite those problems , argues nathalie tocci , the measuring stick for obama remains clear : " there is the question first and foremost whether netanyahu will accept the end goal of the road map , which means the acceptance of a two-state solution . "
but as tocci , a senior research fellow at the center for european policy research , is quick to add , merely stating one 's acceptance of common goals is not enough .
" the main issue hindering the accomplishment of progress along the road map was the fact of an absence of an international monitoring presence that could actually monitor the extent to which the obligations by both parties were fulfilled on the ground , " tocci said bauer agrees , saying obama should not rely on rhetoric commitments , but also demand concrete efforts on behalf of the israelis to rebuild confidence , for example by halting the construction of settlements .
europe 's role european leaders voiced their opinions on how obama ought to approach the middle east peace process during his recent visit to the continent .
but other than giving advice , what role can europe really play now that the us has retaken the leadership role ? " the europeans have in many ways played a second part in all the peace negotiations , " says daniel korski , a senior fellow at the european council on foreign relations .
" europeans have in a sense been the paymasters offering the financial incentives for any kind of peace deal .
however , practically they have always been marginalized in part because the israeli government has never been really interested in seeing european governments engaged . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe could play a larger role in peace negotiations but this is changing , korski argues .
first , some europeans are not ready to simply pick up the check again after seeing a lot of their investments go up in smoke in gaza .
and second , there are more pro-israeli leaders in major european capitals than before , providing the chance for europe to engage better with israel .
still , says korski , the question remains unanswered as to what exactly europe 's role could be in the peace process .
europe also has limited influence because it does n't speak with one voice on foreign affairs issues , experts say .
" but that does n't mean that the european union can not play a role , " says bauer .
" maybe it is even good that some member states have better relations with israel and other member states are perceived to be closer to the palestinian side . "
by turning its weakness into an asset , bauer suggests , europe could really act as an honest mediator in the conflict .

news photos of the stripper , born heather sweet , showing her baring a full bosom during rehearsals led to a complaint by the european broadcasting union , resulting in an order for her to dress more appropriately for the family television show . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : striptease star dita von teese did n't peel off as much as she would have liked to as an event , eurovision is both loved and loathed for its over-the-top , kitschy performances .
moscow organizers managed to arrange a live video connection to astronauts aboard the international space station who launched the audience tele-voting . this year 's result was decided by a combination of audience tele-voting and decisions by expert juries in the 42 participating countries , although only 25 nations actually made it to the final round in moscow . the russian organizers reportedly spent over 30 million euros on this year 's contest , making it the most expensive competition in eurovision 's history . moscow fails to dazzle gay scene however , the customary glitz and kitsch did not manage to blot out political controversy that started well ahead of the event .
organizers had banned georgia 's entry earlier this year because its song was considered a political jab at the host country russia .
the neighbors had fought a brief war late last august . eurovision is known to be immensely popular among the european gay scene .
on saturday , dozens of riot police detained gay rights protesters who had defied the moscow authorities and tried to stage a demonstration against homophobia which had previously been banned . the leading russian gay activist nikolai alexeyev had urged contestants to boycott eurovision in protest against " russia 's state oppression of human rights " . this year 's winner rybak appeared to throw his support behind the gay rights protesters when he said at a news conference : " why did they -lrb- the moscow police -rrb- spend all their energy stopping gays in moscow when the biggest gay parade was here tonight ? " more than just a laugh ? since eurovision 's inception in 1956 , the show has undergone various changes .
its perception among european viewers has also changed drastically over the years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abba 's victory in 1974 marked the swedish band 's international breakthrough the competition rules state that each country is allowed to choose its own act , and that all vocals must be performed live . initially each country was also obliged to sing in one of its official languages .
however , this rule has been changed several times , allowing participants to resort to english vocals , which have booked the most wins in the history of the competition . all-time greats abba launched their international career by winning the show in 1974 with their smash hit " waterloo " .
but critics say the event has meanwhile degenerated into little more than a circus of mediocre songwriting and sometimes even embarrassing acts .
its fiercest opponents say the song contest has become little more than a joke with viewers merely tuning in for a laugh or a cringe . however , critics can not deny that the show is watched by an estimated television audience of over 100 million people every year , making it one of the most viewed events on the planet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicole 's song for peace gave germany its sole eurovision victory in 1982 ireland currently leads the overall table with seven wins , while germany only managed one victory back in 1982 with the song " ein bisschen frieden " -lrb- a little peace -rrb- , which was performed by 17-year-old singer nicole . norway now boasts three wins and as this year 's victor will host the next eurovision song contest in 2010 . nk / dpa / afp / ap / reuters editor : kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on saturday , dozens of riot police detained gay rights protesters who had defied the moscow authorities and tried to stage a demonstration against homophobia which had previously been banned . the leading russian gay activist nikolai alexeyev had urged contestants to boycott eurovision in protest against " russia 's state oppression of human rights " . this year 's winner rybak appeared to throw his support behind the gay rights protesters when he said at a news conference : " why did they -lrb- the moscow police -rrb- spend all their energy stopping gays in moscow when the biggest gay parade was here tonight ? " more than just a laugh ? since eurovision 's inception in 1956 , the show has undergone various changes .
its perception among european viewers has also changed drastically over the years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abba 's victory in 1974 marked the swedish band 's international breakthrough the competition rules state that each country is allowed to choose its own act , and that all vocals must be performed live . initially each country was also obliged to sing in one of its official languages .
however , this rule has been changed several times , allowing participants to resort to english vocals , which have booked the most wins in the history of the competition . all-time greats abba launched their international career by winning the show in 1974 with their smash hit " waterloo " .
but critics say the event has meanwhile degenerated into little more than a circus of mediocre songwriting and sometimes even embarrassing acts .
its fiercest opponents say the song contest has become little more than a joke with viewers merely tuning in for a laugh or a cringe . however , critics can not deny that the show is watched by an estimated television audience of over 100 million people every year , making it one of the most viewed events on the planet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicole 's song for peace gave germany its sole eurovision victory in 1982 ireland currently leads the overall table with seven wins , while germany only managed one victory back in 1982 with the song " ein bisschen frieden " -lrb- a little peace -rrb- , which was performed by 17-year-old singer nicole . norway now boasts three wins and as this year 's victor will host the next eurovision song contest in 2010 . nk / dpa / afp / ap / reuters editor : kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

can obama revive the middle east peace process ?
let 's hope he can , say europeans . barack obama vowed to take a different approach to foreign policy , one that would include working closely with allies . at a speech in berlin last summer , then-candidate obama proclaimed that " america has no better partner than europe . "
and european leaders have made it clear they 're counting on obama to push forward the middle east peace process .
obama 's meeting with israel 's prime minister benjamin netanyahu on monday in the white house provides a big chance for obama to live up to his pre-presidential statements on the middle east .
many feel obama , simply by declaring the goal to find a solution for the israeli-palestinian conflict a top priority for his administration , has done more right from the start than both the bush and the clinton administrations .
by naming a special envoy to the region and by stating his support for a so-called two-state solution - that is , the creation of a viable palestinian state next to israel - obama again displayed his commitment to the peace process .
but despite all the early efforts by the obama administration , one important fact remains unchanged : without the support of israel and the palestinians , any push for peace in the region is doomed .
so the big question when obama meets netanyahu is whether the us president can convince the israeli premier , who based on his political past and his recent statements is considered a hardliner , to go along with his vision .
can obama convince netanyahu ?
michael bauer , who heads the project europe and the middle east at munich 's center for applied policy research , puts a damper on hopes for a quick success : " the prospects for a successful resumption of the peace process are not very good at this point . "
bauer lists the international community 's cold reception of the new israeli government , especially its far-right foreign minister avidgor lieberman , the war in gaza which led to a further deterioration of already strained israeli-arab relations , the internal palestinian division between hamas and fatah and the continued israeli settlements as factors that could prove difficult to overcome .
despite those problems , argues nathalie tocci , the measuring stick for obama remains clear : " there is the question first and foremost whether netanyahu will accept the end goal of the road map , which means the acceptance of a two-state solution . "
but as tocci , a senior research fellow at the center for european policy research , is quick to add , merely stating one 's acceptance of common goals is not enough .
" the main issue hindering the accomplishment of progress along the road map was the fact of an absence of an international monitoring presence that could actually monitor the extent to which the obligations by both parties were fulfilled on the ground , " tocci said bauer agrees , saying obama should not rely on rhetoric commitments , but also demand concrete efforts on behalf of the israelis to rebuild confidence , for example by halting the construction of settlements .
europe 's role european leaders voiced their opinions on how obama ought to approach the middle east peace process during his recent visit to the continent .
but other than giving advice , what role can europe really play now that the us has retaken the leadership role ? " the europeans have in many ways played a second part in all the peace negotiations , " says daniel korski , a senior fellow at the european council on foreign relations .
" europeans have in a sense been the paymasters offering the financial incentives for any kind of peace deal .
however , practically they have always been marginalized in part because the israeli government has never been really interested in seeing european governments engaged . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe could play a larger role in peace negotiations but this is changing , korski argues .
first , some europeans are not ready to simply pick up the check again after seeing a lot of their investments go up in smoke in gaza .
and second , there are more pro-israeli leaders in major european capitals than before , providing the chance for europe to engage better with israel .
still , says korski , the question remains unanswered as to what exactly europe 's role could be in the peace process .
europe also has limited influence because it does n't speak with one voice on foreign affairs issues , experts say .
" but that does n't mean that the european union can not play a role , " says bauer .
" maybe it is even good that some member states have better relations with israel and other member states are perceived to be closer to the palestinian side . "
by turning its weakness into an asset , bauer suggests , europe could really act as an honest mediator in the conflict .

steinmeier worries that accepting the inmates would cause a political fight with beijing , which has been demanding that they be extradited to china . conditional acceptance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beijing considers some uighurs to be terrorists according to der spiegel , reinhard silberberg , a senior official with the german foreign ministry , told the us berlin would take in the nine provided that other european nations accept uighurs as well , thereby lessening the pressure on germany . steinmeier has received support for his statement from former german chancellor gerhard schroeder , who told der spiegel that accepting uighurs would certainly put a strain on german-chinese relations . schroeder said that while he is in favor of supporting us president barack obama in his efforts to close guantanamo , only the us is in a position to take in the uighurs without suffering any political consequences from china . mrm / reuters / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the result indicated citizens are ready for change in the recession-hit baltic state . european union budget commissioner dalia grybauskaite , who ran as an independent candidate , won 69 percent of the vote .
she came in well ahead of her nearest rival , social democrat algirdas butkevicius , who obtained just 11.87 percent .
the five other candidates lagged even farther behind .
official results showed just over 51 percent of the country 's 2.7 million registered voters turned out , which according to lithuanian law , was just enough for grybauskaite to avoid a runoff ballot .
" i congratulate the lithuanian people for their choice , " the 53-year-old told a cheering crowd at her election quarters , before adding : " the taste of victory is the burden of responsibility . "
grybauskaite takes office at a time when lithuania is struggling to cope with the global economic downturn .
unemployment stands at 15.5 percent , which is the european union 's third highest , while overall salaries are predicted to fall by 12.3 percent this year .
last week , the country 's central bank more than tripled its already doom-laden forecast , saying the economy was likely to shrink by 15.6 percent this year .
with lithuania no longer enjoying the reputation of a fast-growing economic " tiger " as it had after joining the european union in 2004 and up until 2007 , grybauskaite has committed herself to stabilizing the country 's financial status .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rioters in lithuania showed their anger over unpopular reforms " the first challenge is the economic crisis … i think that together we will be able to emerge from these times of hardships much better , much more direct and much richer , " she said .
she has pledged to provide tax breaks for small and medium-sized businesses , stimulate exports and absorb eu aid faster .
the president-elect , who has a martial arts black belt , has also vowed to address allegations of corruption within the current government .
" i believe in transparency and i will demand that quality from everyone .
i do n't appreciate liars or late-comers , " grybauskaite said .
support from incumbent government overall , grybauskaite 's victory has been warmly welcomed in lithuania by both voters and politicians alike .
" we have a good president and i am really happy with what we are trying to achieve .
i am happy that she is coming with a very clear message of change , which is needed very much for lithuania , " prime minister andrius kubilius said .
his conservative party colleague , vytautas landsbergis said grybauskaite would be " energetic , positive and determined to act " .
ahead of the election , grybauskaite won the backing of the ruling conservatives , who did not put up a candidate .
grybauskaite will officially take over the reigns from outgoing president valdas adamkus in july .
the 82-year-old adamkus , who is also non-partisan , will retire after serving two five-year terms , which is the maximum allowed under the lithuanian constitution. cg / dpa / reuters / afp editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
" the fight must stop now , " the eu ministers demanded , adding that those who have violated international human rights laws " must be brought to justice . "
while describing the tamil tigers as terrorists who have used civilians as human shields , the ministers said this was no excuse for the government trampling on human rights to fight them .
they also urged the sri lankan government to cooperate with the united nations in resolving the crisis , ending restrictions on aid agencies and allowing the international committee of the red cross to monitor screening of people leaving the conflict zone .
the call came as sri lankan authorities declared a " final victory , " after annoning they killed tamil leader vellupillai prabhakaran earlier in the day .
prabhakaran 's son and several other top tamil tigers were killed over the weekend .
the sri lankan president had already claimed victory on saturday , while the tigers admitted defeat on sunday .

"
" the fight must stop now , " the eu ministers demanded , adding that those who have violated international human rights laws " must be brought to justice . "
while describing the tamil tigers as terrorists who have used civilians as human shields , the ministers said this was no excuse for the government trampling on human rights to fight them .
they also urged the sri lankan government to cooperate with the united nations in resolving the crisis , ending restrictions on aid agencies and allowing the international committee of the red cross to monitor screening of people leaving the conflict zone .
the call came as sri lankan authorities declared a " final victory , " after annoning they killed tamil leader vellupillai prabhakaran earlier in the day .
prabhakaran 's son and several other top tamil tigers were killed over the weekend .
the sri lankan president had already claimed victory on saturday , while the tigers admitted defeat on sunday .

the result indicated citizens are ready for change in the recession-hit baltic state . european union budget commissioner dalia grybauskaite , who ran as an independent candidate , won 69 percent of the vote .
she came in well ahead of her nearest rival , social democrat algirdas butkevicius , who obtained just 11.87 percent .
the five other candidates lagged even farther behind .
official results showed just over 51 percent of the country 's 2.7 million registered voters turned out , which according to lithuanian law , was just enough for grybauskaite to avoid a runoff ballot .
" i congratulate the lithuanian people for their choice , " the 53-year-old told a cheering crowd at her election quarters , before adding : " the taste of victory is the burden of responsibility . "
grybauskaite takes office at a time when lithuania is struggling to cope with the global economic downturn .
unemployment stands at 15.5 percent , which is the european union 's third highest , while overall salaries are predicted to fall by 12.3 percent this year .
last week , the country 's central bank more than tripled its already doom-laden forecast , saying the economy was likely to shrink by 15.6 percent this year .
with lithuania no longer enjoying the reputation of a fast-growing economic " tiger " as it had after joining the european union in 2004 and up until 2007 , grybauskaite has committed herself to stabilizing the country 's financial status .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rioters in lithuania showed their anger over unpopular reforms " the first challenge is the economic crisis … i think that together we will be able to emerge from these times of hardships much better , much more direct and much richer , " she said .
she has pledged to provide tax breaks for small and medium-sized businesses , stimulate exports and absorb eu aid faster .
the president-elect , who has a martial arts black belt , has also vowed to address allegations of corruption within the current government .
" i believe in transparency and i will demand that quality from everyone .
i do n't appreciate liars or late-comers , " grybauskaite said .
support from incumbent government overall , grybauskaite 's victory has been warmly welcomed in lithuania by both voters and politicians alike .
" we have a good president and i am really happy with what we are trying to achieve .
i am happy that she is coming with a very clear message of change , which is needed very much for lithuania , " prime minister andrius kubilius said .
his conservative party colleague , vytautas landsbergis said grybauskaite would be " energetic , positive and determined to act " .
ahead of the election , grybauskaite won the backing of the ruling conservatives , who did not put up a candidate .
grybauskaite will officially take over the reigns from outgoing president valdas adamkus in july .
the 82-year-old adamkus , who is also non-partisan , will retire after serving two five-year terms , which is the maximum allowed under the lithuanian constitution. cg / dpa / reuters / afp editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to the first-ever poverty atlas released by der paritaetische , one of the big five social welfare organizations in germany , the level of poverty in some eastern parts of the country is up to four times higher than in the south .
the atlas , released on monday in berlin , shows that the german region of western pomerania leads the nation when it comes to poverty , with more than one in four people there living at or below the poverty line .
on the opposite end of the spectrum - as well as the opposite end of the country - the region of schwarzwald-baar-heuberg has a poverty rate of 7.4 percent .

those measures include raising long-term unemployment benefits from 351 euros -lrb- $ 474 -rrb- a month to 440 euros as well as doing a better job of applying the economic stimulus package to the regions that really need it .
such an increase would cost up to 10 billion euros per year .

for singles that 's 764 euros -lrb- $ 1,031 -rrb- per month , and for couples without children it 's 1,376 euros .
it comes as no surprise that the regions the atlas shows as having the highest poverty rate also have the highest level of unemployment .
the poverty rate overall in germany is 14.3 percent , with the average in the west of the country being 12.9 percent , 6.6 percent lower than in the east . that corresponds with data provided by the german statistics office , which says that as of january of this year , unemployment was 13.9 percent in the east and 6.9 percent in the west . dividing up the wealth at the unveiling , schneider that new measures to fight poverty should n't include programs like the scrapping bonus .

according to the first-ever poverty atlas released by der paritaetische , one of the big five social welfare organizations in germany , the level of poverty in some eastern parts of the country is up to four times higher than in the south .
the atlas , released on monday in berlin , shows that the german region of western pomerania leads the nation when it comes to poverty , with more than one in four people there living at or below the poverty line .
on the opposite end of the spectrum - as well as the opposite end of the country - the region of schwarzwald-baar-heuberg has a poverty rate of 7.4 percent .

pirate attacks nearly doubled to 102 in the first quarter of this year compared to the same period last year , the international maritime bureau recently reported .
most of the attacks occurred in the gulf of aden and off the eastern coast of somalia , precisely in the area where the international community has sent more than a dozen warships to deter and prevent piracy .
it 's impossible to know how many attacks would have taken place without the presence of navy ships from around the world in the region , experts believe international cooperation needs to be improved to make the fight against piracy more effective .
improving coordination is the aim of a conference in kuala lumpur which gets underway monday and which brings together top maritime experts , diplomats and security officials .
four missions , four commands , one task yet getting everyone on the same page can be a challenge .
bjorn seibert , a research affiliate for security studies at the massachusetts institute of technology , lists the various international missions deployed : " you have the eu 's mission , you have nato 's mission and then you have two combined task forces led by the united states , combined task force 151 and 150 , which operate in the same area with the same task . "
the answer seibert and peter lehr give when asked whether the four missions suffer from a lack of cooperation is clear : " i would say they are hampered at the moment , " argues lehr , a piracy specialist at the university of st. andrews .
he points out that the different missions have different chains of command , different rules of engagement and operate under different domestic laws .
that means that for example dutch or german warships can only apprehend pirates if they pose a threat to their national interests , explains lehr .
" recently a dutch warship arrested pirates and freed yemeni hostages , but then realizing that no national interest was threatened they had to release the pirates , which means they had to bring them on the shore again , letting them actually go back to their pirate ports and then strike again , " says lehr .
" that 's the problem . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes , it 's not clear what to do with pirates when they 're caught a more tragic example of the lack of international cooperation mentioned by both experts happened late last year .
an indian warship sank a thai fishing boat it mistook for a so-called pirate mother ship , killing 15 thai crew members .
" this would be something that under eu rules of engagements would not have been possible , " says lehr .
merging missions the international community has recognized coordination is necessary .
at the beginning of the year the contact group on piracy off the coast of somalia -lrb- cpgsc -rrb- was launched to do exactly that .
while the cpsc is a step forward because it provides a broad framework under the united nations for countries to engage in counter-piracy , it does not provide much help in the concrete fight against pirates taking place every day , the experts say .
instead as a more practical approach , suggests seibert , the europeans should ask themselves whether they really need to participate in four different operations to address the same problem .
the answer could be to merge the eu and nato missions and create one combined structure .
" something like this has been done before in 1992 in bosnia where both the western european union and nato had separate naval forces and they had eventually a unified command " , argues seibert .
" so that 's something that you could look into at least over the long term in somalia too . "
lehr agrees that it is vital to establish one set of rules of engagement under the same chain of command .
" but that 's wishful thinking , that wo n't happen anytime soon , i fear , " he adds and points out that the international community has been faced with the same problem in afghanistan for years .
more air patrols but even if a unified command structure proves to be impossible to implement , there are other measures to bolster the effectiveness of counter-piracy operations , such as increasing the number of airplanes patrolling the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been calls for more air patrols still , given the recent spike in attacks despite the naval missions in the area , do counter-piracy operations stand any realistic chance to stop the pirates ? everybody , especially the navy commanders running the operations , knows that it is impossible to tackle piracy with a naval mission , says lehr . it must be solved on land .
" but you can deny the pirates the long reach they have at the moment .
they are operating from mother ships which give them a reach of up to several hundred nautical miles off their shores .
if you can ferret out these mother ships and either arrest or sink them you will turn this high-sea piracy into coastal piracy again which means it will be less lethal , it will be less of a problem . "

start , one of the largest and most complex arms control treaties , was signed in 1991 , and expires in december of 2009 .
both washington and moscow have indicated that the political will exists to overcome disagreements on the size , nature and purpose of their nuclear arsenals and strategic weapons .
" there are good chances for bringing our positions closer and for working out agreements , " russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said last week after a meeting with us secretary of state hillary clinton in washington .
seeking a replacement for start the us delegation is headed by assistant secretary of state rose gottemoeller . anatoly antonov , head of the foreign ministry department for security and disarmament , leads the russian delegation .

the white house said in a statement that the meeting will allow the us and russia an opportunity " to deepen engagement on reducing nuclear weapons , cooperating on non-proliferation , exploring ways to cooperate on missile defense , addressing mutual threats and security challenges . "
disarmament process began at the height of the cold war both sides have come to the conclusion that military deterrence is as effective with less warheads on either side , and have agreed to make cuts in the number of warheads they have deployed to around 1,000 to 1,500 each .
other issues include whether the treaty should cover delivery systems like bombers and missiles , verification procedures and information sharing .
the us and russia both have an interest in ensuring the talks conclude with results .
" in support of its arms control interests and interest in strategic stability more generally , the united states should pursue a much broader and more ambitious set of strategic dialogues , " said former us defense secretary william perry , who is now part of the congressional commission on the strategic posture of the united states .
fjodor lukjanov , editor in chief of the moscow magazine russia in world politics , says a new start treaty is eminently important for russia .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 18.05.2009 obama faces big test on the middle east großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us president has vowed to tackle the israeli-palestinian conflict expectations run high for monday 's first official meeting between president obama and prime minister netanyahu .
can obama revive the middle east peace process ?
let 's hope he can , say europeans . barack obama vowed to take a different approach to foreign policy , one that would include working closely with allies . at a speech in berlin last summer , then-candidate obama proclaimed that " america has no better partner than europe . "
and european leaders have made it clear they 're counting on obama to push forward the middle east peace process .
obama 's meeting with israel 's prime minister benjamin netanyahu on monday in the white house provides a big chance for obama to live up to his pre-presidential statements on the middle east .
many feel obama , simply by declaring the goal to find a solution for the israeli-palestinian conflict a top priority for his administration , has done more right from the start than both the bush and the clinton administrations .
by naming a special envoy to the region and by stating his support for a so-called two-state solution - that is , the creation of a viable palestinian state next to israel - obama again displayed his commitment to the peace process .
but despite all the early efforts by the obama administration , one important fact remains unchanged : without the support of israel and the palestinians , any push for peace in the region is doomed .
so the big question when obama meets netanyahu is whether the us president can convince the israeli premier , who based on his political past and his recent statements is considered a hardliner , to go along with his vision .
can obama convince netanyahu ?
michael bauer , who heads the project europe and the middle east at munich 's center for applied policy research , puts a damper on hopes for a quick success : " the prospects for a successful resumption of the peace process are not very good at this point . "
bauer lists the international community 's cold reception of the new israeli government , especially its far-right foreign minister avidgor lieberman , the war in gaza which led to a further deterioration of already strained israeli-arab relations , the internal palestinian division between hamas and fatah and the continued israeli settlements as factors that could prove difficult to overcome .
despite those problems , argues nathalie tocci , the measuring stick for obama remains clear : " there is the question first and foremost whether netanyahu will accept the end goal of the road map , which means the acceptance of a two-state solution . "
but as tocci , a senior research fellow at the center for european policy research , is quick to add , merely stating one 's acceptance of common goals is not enough .
" the main issue hindering the accomplishment of progress along the road map was the fact of an absence of an international monitoring presence that could actually monitor the extent to which the obligations by both parties were fulfilled on the ground , " tocci said bauer agrees , saying obama should not rely on rhetoric commitments , but also demand concrete efforts on behalf of the israelis to rebuild confidence , for example by halting the construction of settlements .
europe 's role european leaders voiced their opinions on how obama ought to approach the middle east peace process during his recent visit to the continent .
but other than giving advice , what role can europe really play now that the us has retaken the leadership role ? " the europeans have in many ways played a second part in all the peace negotiations , " says daniel korski , a senior fellow at the european council on foreign relations .
" europeans have in a sense been the paymasters offering the financial incentives for any kind of peace deal .
however , practically they have always been marginalized in part because the israeli government has never been really interested in seeing european governments engaged . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe could play a larger role in peace negotiations but this is changing , korski argues .
first , some europeans are not ready to simply pick up the check again after seeing a lot of their investments go up in smoke in gaza .
and second , there are more pro-israeli leaders in major european capitals than before , providing the chance for europe to engage better with israel .
still , says korski , the question remains unanswered as to what exactly europe 's role could be in the peace process .
europe also has limited influence because it does n't speak with one voice on foreign affairs issues , experts say .
" but that does n't mean that the european union can not play a role , " says bauer .
" maybe it is even good that some member states have better relations with israel and other member states are perceived to be closer to the palestinian side . "
by turning its weakness into an asset , bauer suggests , europe could really act as an honest mediator in the conflict .

news photos of the stripper , born heather sweet , showing her baring a full bosom during rehearsals led to a complaint by the european broadcasting union , resulting in an order for her to dress more appropriately for the family television show . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : striptease star dita von teese did n't peel off as much as she would have liked to as an event , eurovision is both loved and loathed for its over-the-top , kitschy performances .
moscow organizers managed to arrange a live video connection to astronauts aboard the international space station who launched the audience tele-voting . this year 's result was decided by a combination of audience tele-voting and decisions by expert juries in the 42 participating countries , although only 25 nations actually made it to the final round in moscow . the russian organizers reportedly spent over 30 million euros on this year 's contest , making it the most expensive competition in eurovision 's history . moscow fails to dazzle gay scene however , the customary glitz and kitsch did not manage to blot out political controversy that started well ahead of the event .
organizers had banned georgia 's entry earlier this year because its song was considered a political jab at the host country russia .
the neighbors had fought a brief war late last august . eurovision is known to be immensely popular among the european gay scene .
on saturday , dozens of riot police detained gay rights protesters who had defied the moscow authorities and tried to stage a demonstration against homophobia which had previously been banned . the leading russian gay activist nikolai alexeyev had urged contestants to boycott eurovision in protest against " russia 's state oppression of human rights " . this year 's winner rybak appeared to throw his support behind the gay rights protesters when he said at a news conference : " why did they -lrb- the moscow police -rrb- spend all their energy stopping gays in moscow when the biggest gay parade was here tonight ? " more than just a laugh ? since eurovision 's inception in 1956 , the show has undergone various changes .
its perception among european viewers has also changed drastically over the years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abba 's victory in 1974 marked the swedish band 's international breakthrough the competition rules state that each country is allowed to choose its own act , and that all vocals must be performed live . initially each country was also obliged to sing in one of its official languages .
however , this rule has been changed several times , allowing participants to resort to english vocals , which have booked the most wins in the history of the competition . all-time greats abba launched their international career by winning the show in 1974 with their smash hit " waterloo " .
but critics say the event has meanwhile degenerated into little more than a circus of mediocre songwriting and sometimes even embarrassing acts .
its fiercest opponents say the song contest has become little more than a joke with viewers merely tuning in for a laugh or a cringe . however , critics can not deny that the show is watched by an estimated television audience of over 100 million people every year , making it one of the most viewed events on the planet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicole 's song for peace gave germany its sole eurovision victory in 1982 ireland currently leads the overall table with seven wins , while germany only managed one victory back in 1982 with the song " ein bisschen frieden " -lrb- a little peace -rrb- , which was performed by 17-year-old singer nicole . norway now boasts three wins and as this year 's victor will host the next eurovision song contest in 2010 . nk / dpa / afp / ap / reuters editor : kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

can obama revive the middle east peace process ?
let 's hope he can , say europeans . barack obama vowed to take a different approach to foreign policy , one that would include working closely with allies . at a speech in berlin last summer , then-candidate obama proclaimed that " america has no better partner than europe . "
and european leaders have made it clear they 're counting on obama to push forward the middle east peace process .
obama 's meeting with israel 's prime minister benjamin netanyahu on monday in the white house provides a big chance for obama to live up to his pre-presidential statements on the middle east .
many feel obama , simply by declaring the goal to find a solution for the israeli-palestinian conflict a top priority for his administration , has done more right from the start than both the bush and the clinton administrations .
by naming a special envoy to the region and by stating his support for a so-called two-state solution - that is , the creation of a viable palestinian state next to israel - obama again displayed his commitment to the peace process .
but despite all the early efforts by the obama administration , one important fact remains unchanged : without the support of israel and the palestinians , any push for peace in the region is doomed .
so the big question when obama meets netanyahu is whether the us president can convince the israeli premier , who based on his political past and his recent statements is considered a hardliner , to go along with his vision .
can obama convince netanyahu ?
michael bauer , who heads the project europe and the middle east at munich 's center for applied policy research , puts a damper on hopes for a quick success : " the prospects for a successful resumption of the peace process are not very good at this point . "
bauer lists the international community 's cold reception of the new israeli government , especially its far-right foreign minister avidgor lieberman , the war in gaza which led to a further deterioration of already strained israeli-arab relations , the internal palestinian division between hamas and fatah and the continued israeli settlements as factors that could prove difficult to overcome .
despite those problems , argues nathalie tocci , the measuring stick for obama remains clear : " there is the question first and foremost whether netanyahu will accept the end goal of the road map , which means the acceptance of a two-state solution . "
but as tocci , a senior research fellow at the center for european policy research , is quick to add , merely stating one 's acceptance of common goals is not enough .
" the main issue hindering the accomplishment of progress along the road map was the fact of an absence of an international monitoring presence that could actually monitor the extent to which the obligations by both parties were fulfilled on the ground , " tocci said bauer agrees , saying obama should not rely on rhetoric commitments , but also demand concrete efforts on behalf of the israelis to rebuild confidence , for example by halting the construction of settlements .
europe 's role european leaders voiced their opinions on how obama ought to approach the middle east peace process during his recent visit to the continent .
but other than giving advice , what role can europe really play now that the us has retaken the leadership role ? " the europeans have in many ways played a second part in all the peace negotiations , " says daniel korski , a senior fellow at the european council on foreign relations .
" europeans have in a sense been the paymasters offering the financial incentives for any kind of peace deal .
however , practically they have always been marginalized in part because the israeli government has never been really interested in seeing european governments engaged . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe could play a larger role in peace negotiations but this is changing , korski argues .
first , some europeans are not ready to simply pick up the check again after seeing a lot of their investments go up in smoke in gaza .
and second , there are more pro-israeli leaders in major european capitals than before , providing the chance for europe to engage better with israel .
still , says korski , the question remains unanswered as to what exactly europe 's role could be in the peace process .
europe also has limited influence because it does n't speak with one voice on foreign affairs issues , experts say .
" but that does n't mean that the european union can not play a role , " says bauer .
" maybe it is even good that some member states have better relations with israel and other member states are perceived to be closer to the palestinian side . "
by turning its weakness into an asset , bauer suggests , europe could really act as an honest mediator in the conflict .

let 's hope he can , say europeans . barack obama vowed to take a different approach to foreign policy , one that would include working closely with allies . at a speech in berlin last summer , then-candidate obama proclaimed that " america has no better partner than europe . "
and european leaders have made it clear they 're counting on obama to push forward the middle east peace process .
obama 's meeting with israel 's prime minister benjamin netanyahu on monday in the white house provides a big chance for obama to live up to his pre-presidential statements on the middle east .
many feel obama , simply by declaring the goal to find a solution for the israeli-palestinian conflict a top priority for his administration , has done more right from the start than both the bush and the clinton administrations .
by naming a special envoy to the region and by stating his support for a so-called two-state solution - that is , the creation of a viable palestinian state next to israel - obama again displayed his commitment to the peace process .
but despite all the early efforts by the obama administration , one important fact remains unchanged : without the support of israel and the palestinians , any push for peace in the region is doomed .
so the big question when obama meets netanyahu is whether the us president can convince the israeli premier , who based on his political past and his recent statements is considered a hardliner , to go along with his vision .
can obama convince netanyahu ?
michael bauer , who heads the project europe and the middle east at munich 's center for applied policy research , puts a damper on hopes for a quick success : " the prospects for a successful resumption of the peace process are not very good at this point . "
bauer lists the international community 's cold reception of the new israeli government , especially its far-right foreign minister avidgor lieberman , the war in gaza which led to a further deterioration of already strained israeli-arab relations , the internal palestinian division between hamas and fatah and the continued israeli settlements as factors that could prove difficult to overcome .
despite those problems , argues nathalie tocci , the measuring stick for obama remains clear : " there is the question first and foremost whether netanyahu will accept the end goal of the road map , which means the acceptance of a two-state solution . "
but as tocci , a senior research fellow at the center for european policy research , is quick to add , merely stating one 's acceptance of common goals is not enough .
" the main issue hindering the accomplishment of progress along the road map was the fact of an absence of an international monitoring presence that could actually monitor the extent to which the obligations by both parties were fulfilled on the ground , " tocci said bauer agrees , saying obama should not rely on rhetoric commitments , but also demand concrete efforts on behalf of the israelis to rebuild confidence , for example by halting the construction of settlements .
europe 's role european leaders voiced their opinions on how obama ought to approach the middle east peace process during his recent visit to the continent .
but other than giving advice , what role can europe really play now that the us has retaken the leadership role ? " the europeans have in many ways played a second part in all the peace negotiations , " says daniel korski , a senior fellow at the european council on foreign relations .
" europeans have in a sense been the paymasters offering the financial incentives for any kind of peace deal .
however , practically they have always been marginalized in part because the israeli government has never been really interested in seeing european governments engaged . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe could play a larger role in peace negotiations but this is changing , korski argues .
first , some europeans are not ready to simply pick up the check again after seeing a lot of their investments go up in smoke in gaza .
and second , there are more pro-israeli leaders in major european capitals than before , providing the chance for europe to engage better with israel .
still , says korski , the question remains unanswered as to what exactly europe 's role could be in the peace process .
europe also has limited influence because it does n't speak with one voice on foreign affairs issues , experts say .
" but that does n't mean that the european union can not play a role , " says bauer .
" maybe it is even good that some member states have better relations with israel and other member states are perceived to be closer to the palestinian side . "
by turning its weakness into an asset , bauer suggests , europe could really act as an honest mediator in the conflict .

both sides have expressed a willingness to come to an agreement on complex arms control issues . the us and russia have begun renegotiating the strategic arms reduction treaty -lrb- start -rrb- on monday in moscow .
start , one of the largest and most complex arms control treaties , was signed in 1991 , and expires in december of 2009 .
both washington and moscow have indicated that the political will exists to overcome disagreements on the size , nature and purpose of their nuclear arsenals and strategic weapons .
" there are good chances for bringing our positions closer and for working out agreements , " russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said last week after a meeting with us secretary of state hillary clinton in washington .
seeking a replacement for start the us delegation is headed by assistant secretary of state rose gottemoeller . anatoly antonov , head of the foreign ministry department for security and disarmament , leads the russian delegation .
the fresh start negotiations come as us president barack obama pushes ahead with his agenda to " reset " frayed ties with russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president obama has called for a world without nuclear weapons in july , obama is scheduled to travel to moscow for a summit with his russian counterpart dmitry medvedev in which they will discuss , among other security challenges , the reduction of nuclear weapons arsenals .
the white house said in a statement that the meeting will allow the us and russia an opportunity " to deepen engagement on reducing nuclear weapons , cooperating on non-proliferation , exploring ways to cooperate on missile defense , addressing mutual threats and security challenges . "
disarmament process began at the height of the cold war both sides have come to the conclusion that military deterrence is as effective with less warheads on either side , and have agreed to make cuts in the number of warheads they have deployed to around 1,000 to 1,500 each .
other issues include whether the treaty should cover delivery systems like bombers and missiles , verification procedures and information sharing .
the us and russia both have an interest in ensuring the talks conclude with results .
" in support of its arms control interests and interest in strategic stability more generally , the united states should pursue a much broader and more ambitious set of strategic dialogues , " said former us defense secretary william perry , who is now part of the congressional commission on the strategic posture of the united states .
fjodor lukjanov , editor in chief of the moscow magazine russia in world politics , says a new start treaty is eminently important for russia .
" otherwise , there 's the risk that the us might just let the treaty expire and then do what they like , " lukjanov says .

dw spoke to acclaimed physicist eicke weber , who worked in the us for 23 years , about his decision to come back to germany . after 23 years of research in the usa , which he put an end to after teaching materials science at the university of california in berkeley , professor eicke weber finally came home to germany .
on july 1 , 2006 , the physicist and materials researcher became director of the fraunhofer institute for solar energy systems ise in freiburg , southern germany .
what shaped your decision to come back to germany after working in the us as a researcher for over two decades ?
the united states is a unique place worldwide because it is attractive for people from around the world for active and energetic people and of course for scientists who are looking for excellent working conditions .
the united states therefore really attracts the best scientists from around the world .
the universities in the us offer many attractive positions .
they offer a level playing field to compete for funds for research .
the result is that competition is much tougher than , say , in germany .
but those who continuously have good ideas and stay ahead of the others have good opportunities .
on the other hand , this " brain drain " is n't good for other countries .
that means that europe and asia have to make sure they create attractive conditions for people to come back to .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fraunhofer insitut in freiburg focuses on research in solar energy and energy efficiency the kind of institute i came back to - fraunhofer - is a very special government laboratory because it is a government-sponsored institute , but basically it has to earn its money through its own success .
in my institute , basic funding from the government is down to 10 percent - that means 90 percent is based on our success in bringing in projects , half from industry and half from government sources .
this creates a competitive atmosphere , -lsb- which -rsb- i liked so much while working in the us .
i must say i was very happy to have this opportunity to come back to .
american research institutes offer substantially higher salaries than institutes in germany .
is that one of the main reasons scientists find it difficult to return to countries such as germany ?
it 's a whole package of things .
i have been quite involved in this topic - when i was in the us i founded an organization called " german scholars organization " to help german scholars find interesting jobs in germany .
and what was frequently mentioned was that the salary is not the problem but rather the structure of the system .
in the us , you can enter the university as i did - as an untenured assistant professor , and if you are successful , you can obtain tenure .
and after 10 years , you can progress to be a full professor .
in the german system , you have boxes - that means your eyes are on the assistant professor level and then you have to go to another university to progress and get a permanent position .
this is of course completely unpredictable because you never know what kind of people you are competing with for the new position .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weber says it 's easier to plan a career as a researcher in the us so in the united states , you can plan your career much better .
it 's much more dependant on your own success and your own contribution to science and technology , whereas in germany it depends on factors that are difficult to control .
that means that when you apply for a position , it 's always a gamble , you never know who the other competitors are , you do n't the preferences of the people who want to hire you .
in all the discussions with foreign scholars in the united states , there 's agreement that the us provides very predictable working conditions where everything depends on how good you are .
you set up the " german scholars organization " in the united states in 2003 .
was the idea to build bridges between germany and the us ?
yes , exactly .
as a scholar in the us , you really feel like you are -lsb- out -rsb- in the world and you are approached by universities or industry who want to hire you .
you do n't have a similar type of approach from german employers .
basically you 're not in the country anymore and you have to make big efforts to stay in touch and get to know what 's going on in germany .
at that point we thought an organization that concentrates on building this bridge between very interested employers in germany and those scholars abroad would make a difference .
it did .
we managed to attract a particularly interesting program from the krupp foundation .
the foundation gave us several million euros to provide scholarships of $ 100,000 -lrb- 74,000 euros -rrb- for returning scholars on university positions in germany .
the scholars who got this grant said it made a big difference to them .
so there are things that can be done with relatively modest means in order to make a return to germany more attractive .
have you continued with the focus of your research as head of the fraunhofer institute for solar energy in freiburg ?
yes , as a matter of fact when i came to freiburg , the fraunhofer institute was so interested in my own research that they provided me with a very big research grant so we could set up a whole laboratory to pursue research to make good solar cells from silicon with high impurity content .
of course , this is what i 'm very interested in .
on the other hand , leading an institute with 800 people with a budget of 15 million euros means that i do n't have too much time to be involved in research on a day-to-day basis .
but for me it 's very satisfying that from my director 's level i can make sure that the things i 'm interested in get the support they deserve .
i can really say that i 'm very impressed with the quality of the people and their enthusiasm .
everybody there knows that we are working on something which is important for the future of the world .
and therefore though our salaries are not very competitive , compared to the salaries offered in the industry , many stay - though they could easily double their salaries - because they like the freedom and the atmosphere we provide .

in my institute , basic funding from the government is down to 10 percent - that means 90 percent is based on our success in bringing in projects , half from industry and half from government sources .
this creates a competitive atmosphere , -lsb- which -rsb- i liked so much while working in the us .
i must say i was very happy to have this opportunity to come back to .
american research institutes offer substantially higher salaries than institutes in germany .
is that one of the main reasons scientists find it difficult to return to countries such as germany ?
it 's a whole package of things .
i have been quite involved in this topic - when i was in the us i founded an organization called " german scholars organization " to help german scholars find interesting jobs in germany .
and what was frequently mentioned was that the salary is not the problem but rather the structure of the system .
in the us , you can enter the university as i did - as an untenured assistant professor , and if you are successful , you can obtain tenure .
and after 10 years , you can progress to be a full professor .
in the german system , you have boxes - that means your eyes are on the assistant professor level and then you have to go to another university to progress and get a permanent position .
this is of course completely unpredictable because you never know what kind of people you are competing with for the new position .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weber says it 's easier to plan a career as a researcher in the us so in the united states , you can plan your career much better .
it 's much more dependant on your own success and your own contribution to science and technology , whereas in germany it depends on factors that are difficult to control .
that means that when you apply for a position , it 's always a gamble , you never know who the other competitors are , you do n't the preferences of the people who want to hire you .
in all the discussions with foreign scholars in the united states , there 's agreement that the us provides very predictable working conditions where everything depends on how good you are .
you set up the " german scholars organization " in the united states in 2003 .
was the idea to build bridges between germany and the us ?
yes , exactly .
as a scholar in the us , you really feel like you are -lsb- out -rsb- in the world and you are approached by universities or industry who want to hire you .
you do n't have a similar type of approach from german employers .
basically you 're not in the country anymore and you have to make big efforts to stay in touch and get to know what 's going on in germany .
at that point we thought an organization that concentrates on building this bridge between very interested employers in germany and those scholars abroad would make a difference .
it did .
we managed to attract a particularly interesting program from the krupp foundation .
the foundation gave us several million euros to provide scholarships of $ 100,000 -lrb- 74,000 euros -rrb- for returning scholars on university positions in germany .
the scholars who got this grant said it made a big difference to them .
so there are things that can be done with relatively modest means in order to make a return to germany more attractive .
have you continued with the focus of your research as head of the fraunhofer institute for solar energy in freiburg ?
yes , as a matter of fact when i came to freiburg , the fraunhofer institute was so interested in my own research that they provided me with a very big research grant so we could set up a whole laboratory to pursue research to make good solar cells from silicon with high impurity content .
of course , this is what i 'm very interested in .
on the other hand , leading an institute with 800 people with a budget of 15 million euros means that i do n't have too much time to be involved in research on a day-to-day basis .
but for me it 's very satisfying that from my director 's level i can make sure that the things i 'm interested in get the support they deserve .
i can really say that i 'm very impressed with the quality of the people and their enthusiasm .
everybody there knows that we are working on something which is important for the future of the world .
and therefore though our salaries are not very competitive , compared to the salaries offered in the industry , many stay - though they could easily double their salaries - because they like the freedom and the atmosphere we provide .

dw spoke to acclaimed physicist eicke weber , who worked in the us for 23 years , about his decision to come back to germany . after 23 years of research in the usa , which he put an end to after teaching materials science at the university of california in berkeley , professor eicke weber finally came home to germany .
on july 1 , 2006 , the physicist and materials researcher became director of the fraunhofer institute for solar energy systems ise in freiburg , southern germany .
what shaped your decision to come back to germany after working in the us as a researcher for over two decades ?
the united states is a unique place worldwide because it is attractive for people from around the world for active and energetic people and of course for scientists who are looking for excellent working conditions .
the united states therefore really attracts the best scientists from around the world .
the universities in the us offer many attractive positions .
they offer a level playing field to compete for funds for research .
the result is that competition is much tougher than , say , in germany .
but those who continuously have good ideas and stay ahead of the others have good opportunities .
on the other hand , this " brain drain " is n't good for other countries .
that means that europe and asia have to make sure they create attractive conditions for people to come back to .

she came in well ahead of her nearest rival , social democrat algirdas butkevicius , who obtained just 11.87 percent .
the five other candidates lagged even farther behind .
official results showed just over 51 percent of the country 's 2.7 million registered voters turned out , which according to lithuanian law , was just enough for grybauskaite to avoid a runoff ballot .
" i congratulate the lithuanian people for their choice , " the 53-year-old told a cheering crowd at her election quarters , before adding : " the taste of victory is the burden of responsibility . "
grybauskaite takes office at a time when lithuania is struggling to cope with the global economic downturn .
unemployment stands at 15.5 percent , which is the european union 's third highest , while overall salaries are predicted to fall by 12.3 percent this year .
last week , the country 's central bank more than tripled its already doom-laden forecast , saying the economy was likely to shrink by 15.6 percent this year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 18.05.2009 merkel fields questions at town hall meeting großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel opened up for hosts peter kloeppel and maria gresz and the rest of germany germany 's chancellor angela merkel has kicked off her re-election campaign with an intimate town hall meeting , something unheard of in germany . ahead of national elections in september , chancellor angela merkel appeared this weekend on a televised question-and-answer session with german citizens .
generally seen as a tough and competent leader by the electorate , merkel is also often perceived as cool and lacking in charisma .
merkel saw this as an opportunity to connect with voters on a personal level .
in the berlin studio of commercial broadcaster rtl , merkel met with 100 guests and answered questions ranging from how she planned to balance the budget without increasing taxes to what she likes to cook in her free time .
the town hall meeting is a departure from typical german political campaigns , which rarely focus on a candidate 's personality and private life .
merkel 's appearance was seen by many in germany as obama-esque .
us president barack obama is known for his charm and held a town hall meeting while in strasbourg , france , at the beginning of april for a nato summit .
a kinder , gentler chancellor this election year merkel 's party , the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , seems to be pushing a softer merkel and is banking on her popularity .
the chancellor is doing better in opinion polls than the cdu itself .
as the global economy crumbles , merkel must convince voters that she and her traditionally pro-business party understand the everyday concerns that trouble ordinary germans .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's advice to the unemployed ?
train for a career the german economy is facing its deepest recession since world war ii and some 300,000 jobs have been lost since last september when the us investment bank lehman brothers collapsed .
despite the difficult situation , merkel was optimistic .
" we 've probably just about reached the low point , " she said of the ongoing recession .
and a potential increase in the sales tax was an " absolute no . "
merkel also doled out some practical advice during the evening .
when an unemployed 21 year old complained that the employment office could n't give him appointment for two months , merkel agreed that should n't be the case .
but then she asked what he had trained to do .
when the young man answered , " nothing " , she encouraged him to take advantage of his free time .
" do everything you can to train for a career , " she advised .
let 's get personal participants in the forum wanted to know how merkel stayed connected with the lives of germany 's citizens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel relaxes by cooking or traveling with her husband her husband , chemistry professor joachin sauer , keeps her grounded , she said .
" i have to fold my own clothes at home and fill the washing machine , " she said .
she shops for food at normal grocery stores , she said , adding that she likes to cook on the weekends .
" i make a pretty good potato soup , " she said , and her guests say they love her stuffed beef roll .

generally seen as a tough and competent leader by the electorate , merkel is also often perceived as cool and lacking in charisma .
merkel saw this as an opportunity to connect with voters on a personal level .
in the berlin studio of commercial broadcaster rtl , merkel met with 100 guests and answered questions ranging from how she planned to balance the budget without increasing taxes to what she likes to cook in her free time .
the town hall meeting is a departure from typical german political campaigns , which rarely focus on a candidate 's personality and private life .
merkel 's appearance was seen by many in germany as obama-esque .
us president barack obama is known for his charm and held a town hall meeting while in strasbourg , france , at the beginning of april for a nato summit .
a kinder , gentler chancellor this election year merkel 's party , the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , seems to be pushing a softer merkel and is banking on her popularity .
the chancellor is doing better in opinion polls than the cdu itself .
as the global economy crumbles , merkel must convince voters that she and her traditionally pro-business party understand the everyday concerns that trouble ordinary germans .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's advice to the unemployed ?
train for a career the german economy is facing its deepest recession since world war ii and some 300,000 jobs have been lost since last september when the us investment bank lehman brothers collapsed .
despite the difficult situation , merkel was optimistic .
" we 've probably just about reached the low point , " she said of the ongoing recession .
and a potential increase in the sales tax was an " absolute no . "
merkel also doled out some practical advice during the evening .
when an unemployed 21 year old complained that the employment office could n't give him appointment for two months , merkel agreed that should n't be the case .
but then she asked what he had trained to do .
when the young man answered , " nothing " , she encouraged him to take advantage of his free time .
" do everything you can to train for a career , " she advised .
let 's get personal participants in the forum wanted to know how merkel stayed connected with the lives of germany 's citizens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel relaxes by cooking or traveling with her husband her husband , chemistry professor joachin sauer , keeps her grounded , she said .
" i have to fold my own clothes at home and fill the washing machine , " she said .
she shops for food at normal grocery stores , she said , adding that she likes to cook on the weekends .
" i make a pretty good potato soup , " she said , and her guests say they love her stuffed beef roll .
" i do n't think they 're just telling me what i want to hear , " she said .
the chancellor also spoke openly about the importance of her faith in god .
she believes god looks over and protects humanity , and " that gives me strength , " she said. hf / dpa / reuters editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

porsche 's management , they said , did not realize how dicey the situation was for the sports carmaker .
" for a merger of volkswagen and porsche , we need to systematically analyze the current situation of porsche and we need to have a clear picture of the actual conditions there , " volkswagen ceo martin winterkorn was quoted as saying in monday ’ s edition of the berliner zeitung .
volkswagen would need " full transparency " to continue talks , he said .
vw 's chief labor representative , bernd osterloh , said the talks set for monday had been called off because " the current atmosphere was not conducive to a constructive dialog . "
" we were not the ones who had asked for talks and we will not allow volkswagen and individuals in our company to be disparaged just because porsche has no clear strategy , " osterloh said .
friction between the two sides intensified after the porsche and piech families , who control the two carmakers with crossover share holdings , instructed the companies to draft merger plans within the past weeks .
in the negotiations it emerged that the more likely scenario would be that volkswagen would instead end up swallowing porsche .

vw 's osterloh remarked it was time for the porsche family " to clearly say what it wants and what it does n't want . "

porsche 's management , they said , did not realize how dicey the situation was for the sports carmaker .
" for a merger of volkswagen and porsche , we need to systematically analyze the current situation of porsche and we need to have a clear picture of the actual conditions there , " volkswagen ceo martin winterkorn was quoted as saying in monday ’ s edition of the berliner zeitung .
volkswagen would need " full transparency " to continue talks , he said .
vw 's chief labor representative , bernd osterloh , said the talks set for monday had been called off because " the current atmosphere was not conducive to a constructive dialog . "
" we were not the ones who had asked for talks and we will not allow volkswagen and individuals in our company to be disparaged just because porsche has no clear strategy , " osterloh said .
friction between the two sides intensified after the porsche and piech families , who control the two carmakers with crossover share holdings , instructed the companies to draft merger plans within the past weeks .
in the negotiations it emerged that the more likely scenario would be that volkswagen would instead end up swallowing porsche .
the economic crisis has changed the equation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the porsche 911 has been the carmaker 's biggest seller over the years in one of germany 's great corporate takeover battles , porsche last year managed to buy a controlling stake in the vastly larger volkswagen .
but the tables were turned this year following the global economic meltdown , which severely hit the auto industry , with porsche looking to volkswagen , europe 's largest automaker , as a knight in shining armor .
ferdinand piech , vw board chairman , underscored porsche 's predicament last monday when he said that the stuttgart-based company was running short of cash .
the head of the porsche works ' council , uwe hueck , said he plans to lead thousands of workers in a protest march this coming monday to demonstrate against what he called piech 's perceived arrogance .
vw 's osterloh remarked it was time for the porsche family " to clearly say what it wants and what it does n't want . "
porsche , in the meantime , along with another german sports car maker , bmw , is apparently exploring the possibility of state loans to shore up the steep drop in demand for its vehicles .
however , according to monday 's edition of the weekly news magazine , der spiegel , " the two companies have not yet made an official request . "

once labelled a neo-liberal , the former imf chief now argues in favor of a strong state . the success of germany 's president can be measured by the reputation he or she has managed to build with the general public .
as such , horst koehler has achieved quite a bit .
two-thirds of germans would like to see koehler stay on .
koehler is at the same time the most popular politician in the country .
chancellor angela merkel was pleased when koehler announced he would stand for a second term . " over the past few years , he has won the hearts of the people in germany with his open-minded approach and by speaking uncomfortable truths , " she said . diligence and curiosity instead of vision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler on a visit to rwanda koehler 's often thinly veiled criticism of the political machinations in berlin has boosted his standing with the general public .
in contrast to his predecessors the economist was not a politician prior to his election .
koehler was the head of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , and he still shies away from the goings-on in berlin . the 66-year-old , who has been in office since july 2004 , does not excel through great vision or gripping speeches .
he is not a particularly talented orator , which is a strong handicap , especially since the public looks to the president 's speeches for guidance .
koehler compensates for this with diligence , tackling problems head on and his showing an honest curiosity in areas where many long-serving politicians only feign interest . africa vs new york investment banks in his own country , koehler 's main concern has been improving youth education , especially for young migrants .
outside germany , his efforts have focused on one of the challenges of globalization : the growing chasm between rich and poor .
koehler has been particularly dedicated to africa , which featured high on his travel list .
" for me , the fate of africa will decide how humane our world really is , " he said .
" and we know today that it would have been less risky to build a train line right across africa than invest in a distinguished new york investment bank . " koehler has backed up his pledge to be an uncomfortable president .
he twice refused to sign legislation that the governing coalition had passed and in several cases he questioned whether bills were constitutional , but ultimately left the decision to germany 's highest court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler was instrumental in bringing an end to gerhard schroeder 's chancellorship koehler 's most important official act was to dissolve parliament in july 2005 , following a request by then chancellor gerhard schroeder , the predecessor of angela merkel . schroeder , intent on snap elections , had consciously stage-managed his defeat in a no-confidence vote . nevertheless , koehler gave the green light for snap elections , and the majority of germans would have made the same decision . pushing for reform with his constant drive for reform , koehler emancipated himself from chancellor merkel and the christian democratic party , on whose ticket he had taken up office at berlin 's bellevue palace . occasionally he went too far by meddling in daily politics , which is considered unacceptable from a german president .
on one occasion he criticized the governing coalition for extending the period under which unemployment pay could be claimed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bellevue palace , the presidential seat in berlin however , the " neoliberal " tag koehler was stuck with due to his previous post with the imf has started to wear off .
in a speech he gave in march on the financial and economic crisis , he called for a strong state that would implement rules to control the market , seeing as unlimited freedom had proven destructive . koehler 's doubts have been growing steadily as to whether economic growth is a panacea , solving problems and maintaining peace , and he is showing stronger inclination toward a new green deal . author : bernd graessler / neil king editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
" the fight must stop now , " the eu ministers demanded , adding that those who have violated international human rights laws " must be brought to justice . "
while describing the tamil tigers as terrorists who have used civilians as human shields , the ministers said this was no excuse for the government trampling on human rights to fight them .
they also urged the sri lankan government to cooperate with the united nations in resolving the crisis , ending restrictions on aid agencies and allowing the international committee of the red cross to monitor screening of people leaving the conflict zone .
the call came as sri lankan authorities declared a " final victory , " after annoning they killed tamil leader vellupillai prabhakaran earlier in the day .
prabhakaran 's son and several other top tamil tigers were killed over the weekend .
the sri lankan president had already claimed victory on saturday , while the tigers admitted defeat on sunday .
the tamil tigers , or liberation tigers of tamil eelam , have been fighting for an independent state for more than 25 years .
up until two years ago , when the sri lankan government launched a major offensive against them , the rebels ran a de facto mini-state that stretched across one third of the island nation .
the conflict between the government and the rebels has left 70,000 dead , victims of suicide attacks , bomb strikes and assassinations. hf / afp / reuters editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

once labelled a neo-liberal , the former imf chief now argues in favor of a strong state . the success of germany 's president can be measured by the reputation he or she has managed to build with the general public .
as such , horst koehler has achieved quite a bit .
two-thirds of germans would like to see koehler stay on .
koehler is at the same time the most popular politician in the country .
chancellor angela merkel was pleased when koehler announced he would stand for a second term . " over the past few years , he has won the hearts of the people in germany with his open-minded approach and by speaking uncomfortable truths , " she said . diligence and curiosity instead of vision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler on a visit to rwanda koehler 's often thinly veiled criticism of the political machinations in berlin has boosted his standing with the general public .
in contrast to his predecessors the economist was not a politician prior to his election .
koehler was the head of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , and he still shies away from the goings-on in berlin . the 66-year-old , who has been in office since july 2004 , does not excel through great vision or gripping speeches .
he is not a particularly talented orator , which is a strong handicap , especially since the public looks to the president 's speeches for guidance .
koehler compensates for this with diligence , tackling problems head on and his showing an honest curiosity in areas where many long-serving politicians only feign interest . africa vs new york investment banks in his own country , koehler 's main concern has been improving youth education , especially for young migrants .
outside germany , his efforts have focused on one of the challenges of globalization : the growing chasm between rich and poor .
koehler has been particularly dedicated to africa , which featured high on his travel list .
" for me , the fate of africa will decide how humane our world really is , " he said .
" and we know today that it would have been less risky to build a train line right across africa than invest in a distinguished new york investment bank . " koehler has backed up his pledge to be an uncomfortable president .

the show uses photographs , documents , books , instruments and detailed explanations to show how vastly different the two musical icons were treated by the nazis and how their works were manipulated and distorted .
museum director joerg hansen said hitler 's reception of the two composers offers an " important lesson " about the nazi rhetoric of " german superiority " and " jewish threat . "
mendelssohn denigrated by the nazis mendelssohn -lrb- 1809-1847 -rrb- , born to an illustrious jewish family in hamburg , sharply divided opinion in the music world .
during his lifetime he was considered a musical genius by some while others found his style too conservative .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mendelssohn is considered one of the most important composers of the romantic period but mendelssohn is largely credited for playing a pivotal role in the revival of interest in the music of bach , which had largely been forgotten around that time .
just a century later , the tables had turned - when hitler came to power in 1933 , the nazi regime cited mendelssohn 's jewish origin as a reason to ban performance and publication of his works .
once the co-founder of the new bach society in leipzig , mendelssohn was denigrated by nazi musicologists as having contributed to the " effeminacy " of german music in the 19th century .
the show documents how the nazis in 1936 removed a statue of mendelssohn erected in leipzig in 1892 and his works from all the important concert halls in the country .
it also touches on the 1938 duesseldorf exhibition " degenerate music . "
bach the most " german of all germans " bach , on the other hand , was celebrated by the nazis as a " northern " musical artist .
his music was played during nazi party conferences and the texts to his works were tweaked to suit the party 's propaganda .
a special unit set up by the regime to rework music ensured that bach 's music was " purified of jewish references . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : johann sebastian bach is widely considered one of the greatest composers in the western tradition museum director hansen said adolf hitler and his propaganda minister joseph goebbels publicly paid homage to bach as the " most german of all german composers " while mendelssohn the " jew " was considered a dangerous " accident " in music history .
one of the exhibits in eisenach includes a choral piece by bach which was reworded to be the battle song of the hitler youth movement .
another photograph shows the leipzig thomas choir which joined the movement in 1937 .
the exhibition spans the period from 1829 , when the then 21-year-old mendelssohn performed bach 's st. matthew passion at the berlin singakademie , to the persecution and death of jewish artists in nazi concentration camps .

it earned mendelssohn widespread acclaim .
hansen said the exhibition remained a controversial one because it touched on a difficult chapter of history .
as a result , the museum director said it can not be shown in the eastern city of leipzig - an important city where both bach and mendelssohn spent important and productive parts of their careers and where bach is a larger-than-life figure .
the exhibition in eisenach runs through nov 8 , 2009. sp / dpa / epd editor : kristin zeier send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

once labelled a neo-liberal , the former imf chief now argues in favor of a strong state . the success of germany 's president can be measured by the reputation he or she has managed to build with the general public .
as such , horst koehler has achieved quite a bit .
two-thirds of germans would like to see koehler stay on .
koehler is at the same time the most popular politician in the country .
chancellor angela merkel was pleased when koehler announced he would stand for a second term . " over the past few years , he has won the hearts of the people in germany with his open-minded approach and by speaking uncomfortable truths , " she said . diligence and curiosity instead of vision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler on a visit to rwanda koehler 's often thinly veiled criticism of the political machinations in berlin has boosted his standing with the general public .
in contrast to his predecessors the economist was not a politician prior to his election .
koehler was the head of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , and he still shies away from the goings-on in berlin . the 66-year-old , who has been in office since july 2004 , does not excel through great vision or gripping speeches .
he is not a particularly talented orator , which is a strong handicap , especially since the public looks to the president 's speeches for guidance .
koehler compensates for this with diligence , tackling problems head on and his showing an honest curiosity in areas where many long-serving politicians only feign interest . africa vs new york investment banks in his own country , koehler 's main concern has been improving youth education , especially for young migrants .
outside germany , his efforts have focused on one of the challenges of globalization : the growing chasm between rich and poor .
koehler has been particularly dedicated to africa , which featured high on his travel list .
" for me , the fate of africa will decide how humane our world really is , " he said .
" and we know today that it would have been less risky to build a train line right across africa than invest in a distinguished new york investment bank . " koehler has backed up his pledge to be an uncomfortable president .
he twice refused to sign legislation that the governing coalition had passed and in several cases he questioned whether bills were constitutional , but ultimately left the decision to germany 's highest court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler was instrumental in bringing an end to gerhard schroeder 's chancellorship koehler 's most important official act was to dissolve parliament in july 2005 , following a request by then chancellor gerhard schroeder , the predecessor of angela merkel . schroeder , intent on snap elections , had consciously stage-managed his defeat in a no-confidence vote . nevertheless , koehler gave the green light for snap elections , and the majority of germans would have made the same decision . pushing for reform with his constant drive for reform , koehler emancipated himself from chancellor merkel and the christian democratic party , on whose ticket he had taken up office at berlin 's bellevue palace . occasionally he went too far by meddling in daily politics , which is considered unacceptable from a german president .
on one occasion he criticized the governing coalition for extending the period under which unemployment pay could be claimed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bellevue palace , the presidential seat in berlin however , the " neoliberal " tag koehler was stuck with due to his previous post with the imf has started to wear off .
in a speech he gave in march on the financial and economic crisis , he called for a strong state that would implement rules to control the market , seeing as unlimited freedom had proven destructive . koehler 's doubts have been growing steadily as to whether economic growth is a panacea , solving problems and maintaining peace , and he is showing stronger inclination toward a new green deal . author : bernd graessler / neil king editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , if elected president , he says he would look to socialism for inspiration . " my chances to become president are close to zero , " said peter sodann with a chuckle .
the popular actor from communist east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- is disappointed that people are unwilling to accept him as a politician .
a recent survey showed that only four percent of germans were in favor of sodann becoming president on may 23 .
that 's even lower than the percentage of votes the left party , which nominated him , has in the election body on may 23 . the born misfit the 72-year-old may be convincing as the grumpy inspector in the popular crime series " tatort , " but he has muffed his lines thus far on the political stage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other actors have had more success in politics than sodann sodann made his first blunder in an interview when he said that he would like a role in which he could play an inspector and arrest deutsche bank chief josef ackermann .
the media fallout was devastating .
sodann subsequently made several unfortunate comments that did little to calm the critics . sodann rose from humble beginnings as a toolmaker and went on to become an actor , director and theater manager .
off the stage , he was known for challenging authority .
in 1961 , the student cabaret he led was deemed politically unacceptable , and he was held in detention for nine months by the stasi , east germany 's secret police . as an actor at the berliner ensemble under bertolt brecht and helene weigel and later as a theater director , sodann was highly critical of the gdr .
he has said that the fall of the berlin wall was the most important event in his life . still a fan of socialism the actor has promised to contribute a degree of levity to the office of president .
he has said that he does n't want the gdr back , while emphasizing that socialism remains a good idea which embraces justice and solidarity , and that it was a project which was far from finished , in the same way that christianity was as well . sodann said he wants to fulfill his role no matter how hard it might be .
it 's a philosophy that 's in line with his recently published memoires titled " no half measures . " author : bernd graessler -lrb- nk -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 18.05.2009 researcher says merit-based us system better at attracting talent großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weber says the us does a better job of rewarding success and creativity than europe in recent years , skilled germans have migrated to foreign shores for jobs and opportunities .
dw spoke to acclaimed physicist eicke weber , who worked in the us for 23 years , about his decision to come back to germany . after 23 years of research in the usa , which he put an end to after teaching materials science at the university of california in berkeley , professor eicke weber finally came home to germany .
on july 1 , 2006 , the physicist and materials researcher became director of the fraunhofer institute for solar energy systems ise in freiburg , southern germany .
what shaped your decision to come back to germany after working in the us as a researcher for over two decades ?
the united states is a unique place worldwide because it is attractive for people from around the world for active and energetic people and of course for scientists who are looking for excellent working conditions .
the united states therefore really attracts the best scientists from around the world .
the universities in the us offer many attractive positions .
they offer a level playing field to compete for funds for research .
the result is that competition is much tougher than , say , in germany .
but those who continuously have good ideas and stay ahead of the others have good opportunities .
on the other hand , this " brain drain " is n't good for other countries .
that means that europe and asia have to make sure they create attractive conditions for people to come back to .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fraunhofer insitut in freiburg focuses on research in solar energy and energy efficiency the kind of institute i came back to - fraunhofer - is a very special government laboratory because it is a government-sponsored institute , but basically it has to earn its money through its own success .
in my institute , basic funding from the government is down to 10 percent - that means 90 percent is based on our success in bringing in projects , half from industry and half from government sources .
this creates a competitive atmosphere , -lsb- which -rsb- i liked so much while working in the us .
i must say i was very happy to have this opportunity to come back to .
american research institutes offer substantially higher salaries than institutes in germany .
is that one of the main reasons scientists find it difficult to return to countries such as germany ?
it 's a whole package of things .
i have been quite involved in this topic - when i was in the us i founded an organization called " german scholars organization " to help german scholars find interesting jobs in germany .
and what was frequently mentioned was that the salary is not the problem but rather the structure of the system .
in the us , you can enter the university as i did - as an untenured assistant professor , and if you are successful , you can obtain tenure .
and after 10 years , you can progress to be a full professor .
in the german system , you have boxes - that means your eyes are on the assistant professor level and then you have to go to another university to progress and get a permanent position .
this is of course completely unpredictable because you never know what kind of people you are competing with for the new position .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weber says it 's easier to plan a career as a researcher in the us so in the united states , you can plan your career much better .
it 's much more dependant on your own success and your own contribution to science and technology , whereas in germany it depends on factors that are difficult to control .
that means that when you apply for a position , it 's always a gamble , you never know who the other competitors are , you do n't the preferences of the people who want to hire you .
in all the discussions with foreign scholars in the united states , there 's agreement that the us provides very predictable working conditions where everything depends on how good you are .
you set up the " german scholars organization " in the united states in 2003 .
was the idea to build bridges between germany and the us ?
yes , exactly .
as a scholar in the us , you really feel like you are -lsb- out -rsb- in the world and you are approached by universities or industry who want to hire you .
you do n't have a similar type of approach from german employers .
basically you 're not in the country anymore and you have to make big efforts to stay in touch and get to know what 's going on in germany .
at that point we thought an organization that concentrates on building this bridge between very interested employers in germany and those scholars abroad would make a difference .
it did .
we managed to attract a particularly interesting program from the krupp foundation .
the foundation gave us several million euros to provide scholarships of $ 100,000 -lrb- 74,000 euros -rrb- for returning scholars on university positions in germany .
the scholars who got this grant said it made a big difference to them .
so there are things that can be done with relatively modest means in order to make a return to germany more attractive .
have you continued with the focus of your research as head of the fraunhofer institute for solar energy in freiburg ?
yes , as a matter of fact when i came to freiburg , the fraunhofer institute was so interested in my own research that they provided me with a very big research grant so we could set up a whole laboratory to pursue research to make good solar cells from silicon with high impurity content .
of course , this is what i 'm very interested in .
on the other hand , leading an institute with 800 people with a budget of 15 million euros means that i do n't have too much time to be involved in research on a day-to-day basis .
but for me it 's very satisfying that from my director 's level i can make sure that the things i 'm interested in get the support they deserve .
i can really say that i 'm very impressed with the quality of the people and their enthusiasm .
everybody there knows that we are working on something which is important for the future of the world .
and therefore though our salaries are not very competitive , compared to the salaries offered in the industry , many stay - though they could easily double their salaries - because they like the freedom and the atmosphere we provide .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 18.05.2009 researcher says merit-based us system better at attracting talent großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weber says the us does a better job of rewarding success and creativity than europe in recent years , skilled germans have migrated to foreign shores for jobs and opportunities .
dw spoke to acclaimed physicist eicke weber , who worked in the us for 23 years , about his decision to come back to germany . after 23 years of research in the usa , which he put an end to after teaching materials science at the university of california in berkeley , professor eicke weber finally came home to germany .
on july 1 , 2006 , the physicist and materials researcher became director of the fraunhofer institute for solar energy systems ise in freiburg , southern germany .
what shaped your decision to come back to germany after working in the us as a researcher for over two decades ?
the united states is a unique place worldwide because it is attractive for people from around the world for active and energetic people and of course for scientists who are looking for excellent working conditions .
the united states therefore really attracts the best scientists from around the world .
the universities in the us offer many attractive positions .
they offer a level playing field to compete for funds for research .
the result is that competition is much tougher than , say , in germany .
but those who continuously have good ideas and stay ahead of the others have good opportunities .
on the other hand , this " brain drain " is n't good for other countries .
that means that europe and asia have to make sure they create attractive conditions for people to come back to .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fraunhofer insitut in freiburg focuses on research in solar energy and energy efficiency the kind of institute i came back to - fraunhofer - is a very special government laboratory because it is a government-sponsored institute , but basically it has to earn its money through its own success .
in my institute , basic funding from the government is down to 10 percent - that means 90 percent is based on our success in bringing in projects , half from industry and half from government sources .
this creates a competitive atmosphere , -lsb- which -rsb- i liked so much while working in the us .
i must say i was very happy to have this opportunity to come back to .
american research institutes offer substantially higher salaries than institutes in germany .
is that one of the main reasons scientists find it difficult to return to countries such as germany ?
it 's a whole package of things .
i have been quite involved in this topic - when i was in the us i founded an organization called " german scholars organization " to help german scholars find interesting jobs in germany .
and what was frequently mentioned was that the salary is not the problem but rather the structure of the system .
in the us , you can enter the university as i did - as an untenured assistant professor , and if you are successful , you can obtain tenure .
and after 10 years , you can progress to be a full professor .
in the german system , you have boxes - that means your eyes are on the assistant professor level and then you have to go to another university to progress and get a permanent position .
this is of course completely unpredictable because you never know what kind of people you are competing with for the new position .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weber says it 's easier to plan a career as a researcher in the us so in the united states , you can plan your career much better .
it 's much more dependant on your own success and your own contribution to science and technology , whereas in germany it depends on factors that are difficult to control .
that means that when you apply for a position , it 's always a gamble , you never know who the other competitors are , you do n't the preferences of the people who want to hire you .
in all the discussions with foreign scholars in the united states , there 's agreement that the us provides very predictable working conditions where everything depends on how good you are .
you set up the " german scholars organization " in the united states in 2003 .
was the idea to build bridges between germany and the us ?
yes , exactly .
as a scholar in the us , you really feel like you are -lsb- out -rsb- in the world and you are approached by universities or industry who want to hire you .
you do n't have a similar type of approach from german employers .
basically you 're not in the country anymore and you have to make big efforts to stay in touch and get to know what 's going on in germany .
at that point we thought an organization that concentrates on building this bridge between very interested employers in germany and those scholars abroad would make a difference .

the show uses photographs , documents , books , instruments and detailed explanations to show how vastly different the two musical icons were treated by the nazis and how their works were manipulated and distorted .

the show documents how the nazis in 1936 removed a statue of mendelssohn erected in leipzig in 1892 and his works from all the important concert halls in the country .
it also touches on the 1938 duesseldorf exhibition " degenerate music . "
bach the most " german of all germans " bach , on the other hand , was celebrated by the nazis as a " northern " musical artist .

one of the exhibits in eisenach includes a choral piece by bach which was reworded to be the battle song of the hitler youth movement .

the show uses photographs , documents , books , instruments and detailed explanations to show how vastly different the two musical icons were treated by the nazis and how their works were manipulated and distorted .
museum director joerg hansen said hitler 's reception of the two composers offers an " important lesson " about the nazi rhetoric of " german superiority " and " jewish threat . "
mendelssohn denigrated by the nazis mendelssohn -lrb- 1809-1847 -rrb- , born to an illustrious jewish family in hamburg , sharply divided opinion in the music world .
during his lifetime he was considered a musical genius by some while others found his style too conservative .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mendelssohn is considered one of the most important composers of the romantic period but mendelssohn is largely credited for playing a pivotal role in the revival of interest in the music of bach , which had largely been forgotten around that time .
just a century later , the tables had turned - when hitler came to power in 1933 , the nazi regime cited mendelssohn 's jewish origin as a reason to ban performance and publication of his works .
once the co-founder of the new bach society in leipzig , mendelssohn was denigrated by nazi musicologists as having contributed to the " effeminacy " of german music in the 19th century .
the show documents how the nazis in 1936 removed a statue of mendelssohn erected in leipzig in 1892 and his works from all the important concert halls in the country .
it also touches on the 1938 duesseldorf exhibition " degenerate music . "
bach the most " german of all germans " bach , on the other hand , was celebrated by the nazis as a " northern " musical artist .
his music was played during nazi party conferences and the texts to his works were tweaked to suit the party 's propaganda .
a special unit set up by the regime to rework music ensured that bach 's music was " purified of jewish references . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : johann sebastian bach is widely considered one of the greatest composers in the western tradition museum director hansen said adolf hitler and his propaganda minister joseph goebbels publicly paid homage to bach as the " most german of all german composers " while mendelssohn the " jew " was considered a dangerous " accident " in music history .
one of the exhibits in eisenach includes a choral piece by bach which was reworded to be the battle song of the hitler youth movement .
another photograph shows the leipzig thomas choir which joined the movement in 1937 .
the exhibition spans the period from 1829 , when the then 21-year-old mendelssohn performed bach 's st. matthew passion at the berlin singakademie , to the persecution and death of jewish artists in nazi concentration camps .

it earned mendelssohn widespread acclaim .
hansen said the exhibition remained a controversial one because it touched on a difficult chapter of history .
as a result , the museum director said it can not be shown in the eastern city of leipzig - an important city where both bach and mendelssohn spent important and productive parts of their careers and where bach is a larger-than-life figure .

pirate attacks nearly doubled to 102 in the first quarter of this year compared to the same period last year , the international maritime bureau recently reported .
most of the attacks occurred in the gulf of aden and off the eastern coast of somalia , precisely in the area where the international community has sent more than a dozen warships to deter and prevent piracy .
it 's impossible to know how many attacks would have taken place without the presence of navy ships from around the world in the region , experts believe international cooperation needs to be improved to make the fight against piracy more effective .
improving coordination is the aim of a conference in kuala lumpur which gets underway monday and which brings together top maritime experts , diplomats and security officials .
four missions , four commands , one task yet getting everyone on the same page can be a challenge .
bjorn seibert , a research affiliate for security studies at the massachusetts institute of technology , lists the various international missions deployed : " you have the eu 's mission , you have nato 's mission and then you have two combined task forces led by the united states , combined task force 151 and 150 , which operate in the same area with the same task . "
the answer seibert and peter lehr give when asked whether the four missions suffer from a lack of cooperation is clear : " i would say they are hampered at the moment , " argues lehr , a piracy specialist at the university of st. andrews .
he points out that the different missions have different chains of command , different rules of engagement and operate under different domestic laws .
that means that for example dutch or german warships can only apprehend pirates if they pose a threat to their national interests , explains lehr .
" recently a dutch warship arrested pirates and freed yemeni hostages , but then realizing that no national interest was threatened they had to release the pirates , which means they had to bring them on the shore again , letting them actually go back to their pirate ports and then strike again , " says lehr .
" that 's the problem . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes , it 's not clear what to do with pirates when they 're caught a more tragic example of the lack of international cooperation mentioned by both experts happened late last year .
an indian warship sank a thai fishing boat it mistook for a so-called pirate mother ship , killing 15 thai crew members .
" this would be something that under eu rules of engagements would not have been possible , " says lehr .
merging missions the international community has recognized coordination is necessary .
at the beginning of the year the contact group on piracy off the coast of somalia -lrb- cpgsc -rrb- was launched to do exactly that .
while the cpsc is a step forward because it provides a broad framework under the united nations for countries to engage in counter-piracy , it does not provide much help in the concrete fight against pirates taking place every day , the experts say .
instead as a more practical approach , suggests seibert , the europeans should ask themselves whether they really need to participate in four different operations to address the same problem .
the answer could be to merge the eu and nato missions and create one combined structure .
" something like this has been done before in 1992 in bosnia where both the western european union and nato had separate naval forces and they had eventually a unified command " , argues seibert .
" so that 's something that you could look into at least over the long term in somalia too . "
lehr agrees that it is vital to establish one set of rules of engagement under the same chain of command .
" but that 's wishful thinking , that wo n't happen anytime soon , i fear , " he adds and points out that the international community has been faced with the same problem in afghanistan for years .
more air patrols but even if a unified command structure proves to be impossible to implement , there are other measures to bolster the effectiveness of counter-piracy operations , such as increasing the number of airplanes patrolling the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been calls for more air patrols still , given the recent spike in attacks despite the naval missions in the area , do counter-piracy operations stand any realistic chance to stop the pirates ? everybody , especially the navy commanders running the operations , knows that it is impossible to tackle piracy with a naval mission , says lehr . it must be solved on land .
" but you can deny the pirates the long reach they have at the moment .
they are operating from mother ships which give them a reach of up to several hundred nautical miles off their shores .
if you can ferret out these mother ships and either arrest or sink them you will turn this high-sea piracy into coastal piracy again which means it will be less lethal , it will be less of a problem . "

steinmeier worries that accepting the inmates would cause a political fight with beijing , which has been demanding that they be extradited to china . conditional acceptance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beijing considers some uighurs to be terrorists according to der spiegel , reinhard silberberg , a senior official with the german foreign ministry , told the us berlin would take in the nine provided that other european nations accept uighurs as well , thereby lessening the pressure on germany . steinmeier has received support for his statement from former german chancellor gerhard schroeder , who told der spiegel that accepting uighurs would certainly put a strain on german-chinese relations . schroeder said that while he is in favor of supporting us president barack obama in his efforts to close guantanamo , only the us is in a position to take in the uighurs without suffering any political consequences from china . mrm / reuters / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

instead as a more practical approach , suggests seibert , the europeans should ask themselves whether they really need to participate in four different operations to address the same problem .
the answer could be to merge the eu and nato missions and create one combined structure .
" something like this has been done before in 1992 in bosnia where both the western european union and nato had separate naval forces and they had eventually a unified command " , argues seibert .
" so that 's something that you could look into at least over the long term in somalia too . "
lehr agrees that it is vital to establish one set of rules of engagement under the same chain of command .
" but that 's wishful thinking , that wo n't happen anytime soon , i fear , " he adds and points out that the international community has been faced with the same problem in afghanistan for years .
more air patrols but even if a unified command structure proves to be impossible to implement , there are other measures to bolster the effectiveness of counter-piracy operations , such as increasing the number of airplanes patrolling the region .

" but you can deny the pirates the long reach they have at the moment .
they are operating from mother ships which give them a reach of up to several hundred nautical miles off their shores .

pirate attacks nearly doubled to 102 in the first quarter of this year compared to the same period last year , the international maritime bureau recently reported .
most of the attacks occurred in the gulf of aden and off the eastern coast of somalia , precisely in the area where the international community has sent more than a dozen warships to deter and prevent piracy .
it 's impossible to know how many attacks would have taken place without the presence of navy ships from around the world in the region , experts believe international cooperation needs to be improved to make the fight against piracy more effective .
improving coordination is the aim of a conference in kuala lumpur which gets underway monday and which brings together top maritime experts , diplomats and security officials .
four missions , four commands , one task yet getting everyone on the same page can be a challenge .
bjorn seibert , a research affiliate for security studies at the massachusetts institute of technology , lists the various international missions deployed : " you have the eu 's mission , you have nato 's mission and then you have two combined task forces led by the united states , combined task force 151 and 150 , which operate in the same area with the same task . "
the answer seibert and peter lehr give when asked whether the four missions suffer from a lack of cooperation is clear : " i would say they are hampered at the moment , " argues lehr , a piracy specialist at the university of st. andrews .
he points out that the different missions have different chains of command , different rules of engagement and operate under different domestic laws .
that means that for example dutch or german warships can only apprehend pirates if they pose a threat to their national interests , explains lehr .
" recently a dutch warship arrested pirates and freed yemeni hostages , but then realizing that no national interest was threatened they had to release the pirates , which means they had to bring them on the shore again , letting them actually go back to their pirate ports and then strike again , " says lehr .
" that 's the problem . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes , it 's not clear what to do with pirates when they 're caught a more tragic example of the lack of international cooperation mentioned by both experts happened late last year .
an indian warship sank a thai fishing boat it mistook for a so-called pirate mother ship , killing 15 thai crew members .
" this would be something that under eu rules of engagements would not have been possible , " says lehr .
merging missions the international community has recognized coordination is necessary .
at the beginning of the year the contact group on piracy off the coast of somalia -lrb- cpgsc -rrb- was launched to do exactly that .
while the cpsc is a step forward because it provides a broad framework under the united nations for countries to engage in counter-piracy , it does not provide much help in the concrete fight against pirates taking place every day , the experts say .

generally seen as a tough and competent leader by the electorate , merkel is also often perceived as cool and lacking in charisma .
merkel saw this as an opportunity to connect with voters on a personal level .
in the berlin studio of commercial broadcaster rtl , merkel met with 100 guests and answered questions ranging from how she planned to balance the budget without increasing taxes to what she likes to cook in her free time .
the town hall meeting is a departure from typical german political campaigns , which rarely focus on a candidate 's personality and private life .
merkel 's appearance was seen by many in germany as obama-esque .
us president barack obama is known for his charm and held a town hall meeting while in strasbourg , france , at the beginning of april for a nato summit .
a kinder , gentler chancellor this election year merkel 's party , the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , seems to be pushing a softer merkel and is banking on her popularity .
the chancellor is doing better in opinion polls than the cdu itself .
as the global economy crumbles , merkel must convince voters that she and her traditionally pro-business party understand the everyday concerns that trouble ordinary germans .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's advice to the unemployed ?
train for a career the german economy is facing its deepest recession since world war ii and some 300,000 jobs have been lost since last september when the us investment bank lehman brothers collapsed .
despite the difficult situation , merkel was optimistic .
" we 've probably just about reached the low point , " she said of the ongoing recession .
and a potential increase in the sales tax was an " absolute no . "
merkel also doled out some practical advice during the evening .
when an unemployed 21 year old complained that the employment office could n't give him appointment for two months , merkel agreed that should n't be the case .
but then she asked what he had trained to do .
when the young man answered , " nothing " , she encouraged him to take advantage of his free time .
" do everything you can to train for a career , " she advised .
let 's get personal participants in the forum wanted to know how merkel stayed connected with the lives of germany 's citizens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel relaxes by cooking or traveling with her husband her husband , chemistry professor joachin sauer , keeps her grounded , she said .
" i have to fold my own clothes at home and fill the washing machine , " she said .
she shops for food at normal grocery stores , she said , adding that she likes to cook on the weekends .
" i make a pretty good potato soup , " she said , and her guests say they love her stuffed beef roll .
" i do n't think they 're just telling me what i want to hear , " she said .
the chancellor also spoke openly about the importance of her faith in god .
she believes god looks over and protects humanity , and " that gives me strength , " she said. hf / dpa / reuters editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : piracy hansa stavanger arrives at kenyan port after piracy ordeal in gulf of aden , piracy scourge continues unabated fighting piracy militarily has mixed success so far international relations -pipe- 18.05.2009 fighting piracy requires better international cooperation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has soldiers participating in anti-piracy missions as an international conference aimed at fighting somali piracy gets underway , concern remains that international efforts are too disjointed to be effective . the results look bleak .
pirate attacks nearly doubled to 102 in the first quarter of this year compared to the same period last year , the international maritime bureau recently reported .
most of the attacks occurred in the gulf of aden and off the eastern coast of somalia , precisely in the area where the international community has sent more than a dozen warships to deter and prevent piracy .
it 's impossible to know how many attacks would have taken place without the presence of navy ships from around the world in the region , experts believe international cooperation needs to be improved to make the fight against piracy more effective .
improving coordination is the aim of a conference in kuala lumpur which gets underway monday and which brings together top maritime experts , diplomats and security officials .
four missions , four commands , one task yet getting everyone on the same page can be a challenge .
bjorn seibert , a research affiliate for security studies at the massachusetts institute of technology , lists the various international missions deployed : " you have the eu 's mission , you have nato 's mission and then you have two combined task forces led by the united states , combined task force 151 and 150 , which operate in the same area with the same task . "
the answer seibert and peter lehr give when asked whether the four missions suffer from a lack of cooperation is clear : " i would say they are hampered at the moment , " argues lehr , a piracy specialist at the university of st. andrews .
he points out that the different missions have different chains of command , different rules of engagement and operate under different domestic laws .
that means that for example dutch or german warships can only apprehend pirates if they pose a threat to their national interests , explains lehr .
" recently a dutch warship arrested pirates and freed yemeni hostages , but then realizing that no national interest was threatened they had to release the pirates , which means they had to bring them on the shore again , letting them actually go back to their pirate ports and then strike again , " says lehr .
" that 's the problem . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes , it 's not clear what to do with pirates when they 're caught a more tragic example of the lack of international cooperation mentioned by both experts happened late last year .
an indian warship sank a thai fishing boat it mistook for a so-called pirate mother ship , killing 15 thai crew members .
" this would be something that under eu rules of engagements would not have been possible , " says lehr .
merging missions the international community has recognized coordination is necessary .
at the beginning of the year the contact group on piracy off the coast of somalia -lrb- cpgsc -rrb- was launched to do exactly that .
while the cpsc is a step forward because it provides a broad framework under the united nations for countries to engage in counter-piracy , it does not provide much help in the concrete fight against pirates taking place every day , the experts say .
instead as a more practical approach , suggests seibert , the europeans should ask themselves whether they really need to participate in four different operations to address the same problem .
the answer could be to merge the eu and nato missions and create one combined structure .
" something like this has been done before in 1992 in bosnia where both the western european union and nato had separate naval forces and they had eventually a unified command " , argues seibert .
" so that 's something that you could look into at least over the long term in somalia too . "
lehr agrees that it is vital to establish one set of rules of engagement under the same chain of command .
" but that 's wishful thinking , that wo n't happen anytime soon , i fear , " he adds and points out that the international community has been faced with the same problem in afghanistan for years .
more air patrols but even if a unified command structure proves to be impossible to implement , there are other measures to bolster the effectiveness of counter-piracy operations , such as increasing the number of airplanes patrolling the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been calls for more air patrols still , given the recent spike in attacks despite the naval missions in the area , do counter-piracy operations stand any realistic chance to stop the pirates ? everybody , especially the navy commanders running the operations , knows that it is impossible to tackle piracy with a naval mission , says lehr . it must be solved on land .
" but you can deny the pirates the long reach they have at the moment .
they are operating from mother ships which give them a reach of up to several hundred nautical miles off their shores .
if you can ferret out these mother ships and either arrest or sink them you will turn this high-sea piracy into coastal piracy again which means it will be less lethal , it will be less of a problem . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : piracy hansa stavanger arrives at kenyan port after piracy ordeal in gulf of aden , piracy scourge continues unabated fighting piracy militarily has mixed success so far international relations -pipe- 18.05.2009 fighting piracy requires better international cooperation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has soldiers participating in anti-piracy missions as an international conference aimed at fighting somali piracy gets underway , concern remains that international efforts are too disjointed to be effective . the results look bleak .
pirate attacks nearly doubled to 102 in the first quarter of this year compared to the same period last year , the international maritime bureau recently reported .
most of the attacks occurred in the gulf of aden and off the eastern coast of somalia , precisely in the area where the international community has sent more than a dozen warships to deter and prevent piracy .
it 's impossible to know how many attacks would have taken place without the presence of navy ships from around the world in the region , experts believe international cooperation needs to be improved to make the fight against piracy more effective .
improving coordination is the aim of a conference in kuala lumpur which gets underway monday and which brings together top maritime experts , diplomats and security officials .
four missions , four commands , one task yet getting everyone on the same page can be a challenge .
bjorn seibert , a research affiliate for security studies at the massachusetts institute of technology , lists the various international missions deployed : " you have the eu 's mission , you have nato 's mission and then you have two combined task forces led by the united states , combined task force 151 and 150 , which operate in the same area with the same task . "
the answer seibert and peter lehr give when asked whether the four missions suffer from a lack of cooperation is clear : " i would say they are hampered at the moment , " argues lehr , a piracy specialist at the university of st. andrews .
he points out that the different missions have different chains of command , different rules of engagement and operate under different domestic laws .
that means that for example dutch or german warships can only apprehend pirates if they pose a threat to their national interests , explains lehr .
" recently a dutch warship arrested pirates and freed yemeni hostages , but then realizing that no national interest was threatened they had to release the pirates , which means they had to bring them on the shore again , letting them actually go back to their pirate ports and then strike again , " says lehr .
" that 's the problem . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes , it 's not clear what to do with pirates when they 're caught a more tragic example of the lack of international cooperation mentioned by both experts happened late last year .
an indian warship sank a thai fishing boat it mistook for a so-called pirate mother ship , killing 15 thai crew members .
" this would be something that under eu rules of engagements would not have been possible , " says lehr .
merging missions the international community has recognized coordination is necessary .
at the beginning of the year the contact group on piracy off the coast of somalia -lrb- cpgsc -rrb- was launched to do exactly that .
while the cpsc is a step forward because it provides a broad framework under the united nations for countries to engage in counter-piracy , it does not provide much help in the concrete fight against pirates taking place every day , the experts say .
instead as a more practical approach , suggests seibert , the europeans should ask themselves whether they really need to participate in four different operations to address the same problem .
the answer could be to merge the eu and nato missions and create one combined structure .
" something like this has been done before in 1992 in bosnia where both the western european union and nato had separate naval forces and they had eventually a unified command " , argues seibert .
" so that 's something that you could look into at least over the long term in somalia too . "
lehr agrees that it is vital to establish one set of rules of engagement under the same chain of command .
" but that 's wishful thinking , that wo n't happen anytime soon , i fear , " he adds and points out that the international community has been faced with the same problem in afghanistan for years .
more air patrols but even if a unified command structure proves to be impossible to implement , there are other measures to bolster the effectiveness of counter-piracy operations , such as increasing the number of airplanes patrolling the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been calls for more air patrols still , given the recent spike in attacks despite the naval missions in the area , do counter-piracy operations stand any realistic chance to stop the pirates ? everybody , especially the navy commanders running the operations , knows that it is impossible to tackle piracy with a naval mission , says lehr . it must be solved on land .
" but you can deny the pirates the long reach they have at the moment .
they are operating from mother ships which give them a reach of up to several hundred nautical miles off their shores .
if you can ferret out these mother ships and either arrest or sink them you will turn this high-sea piracy into coastal piracy again which means it will be less lethal , it will be less of a problem . "

the result indicated citizens are ready for change in the recession-hit baltic state . european union budget commissioner dalia grybauskaite , who ran as an independent candidate , won 69 percent of the vote .
she came in well ahead of her nearest rival , social democrat algirdas butkevicius , who obtained just 11.87 percent .
the five other candidates lagged even farther behind .
official results showed just over 51 percent of the country 's 2.7 million registered voters turned out , which according to lithuanian law , was just enough for grybauskaite to avoid a runoff ballot .
" i congratulate the lithuanian people for their choice , " the 53-year-old told a cheering crowd at her election quarters , before adding : " the taste of victory is the burden of responsibility . "
grybauskaite takes office at a time when lithuania is struggling to cope with the global economic downturn .
unemployment stands at 15.5 percent , which is the european union 's third highest , while overall salaries are predicted to fall by 12.3 percent this year .
last week , the country 's central bank more than tripled its already doom-laden forecast , saying the economy was likely to shrink by 15.6 percent this year .
with lithuania no longer enjoying the reputation of a fast-growing economic " tiger " as it had after joining the european union in 2004 and up until 2007 , grybauskaite has committed herself to stabilizing the country 's financial status .

she has pledged to provide tax breaks for small and medium-sized businesses , stimulate exports and absorb eu aid faster .
the president-elect , who has a martial arts black belt , has also vowed to address allegations of corruption within the current government .
" i believe in transparency and i will demand that quality from everyone .
i do n't appreciate liars or late-comers , " grybauskaite said .
support from incumbent government overall , grybauskaite 's victory has been warmly welcomed in lithuania by both voters and politicians alike .

his conservative party colleague , vytautas landsbergis said grybauskaite would be " energetic , positive and determined to act " .
ahead of the election , grybauskaite won the backing of the ruling conservatives , who did not put up a candidate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 18.05.2009 merkel fields questions at town hall meeting großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel opened up for hosts peter kloeppel and maria gresz and the rest of germany germany 's chancellor angela merkel has kicked off her re-election campaign with an intimate town hall meeting , something unheard of in germany . ahead of national elections in september , chancellor angela merkel appeared this weekend on a televised question-and-answer session with german citizens .
generally seen as a tough and competent leader by the electorate , merkel is also often perceived as cool and lacking in charisma .
merkel saw this as an opportunity to connect with voters on a personal level .
in the berlin studio of commercial broadcaster rtl , merkel met with 100 guests and answered questions ranging from how she planned to balance the budget without increasing taxes to what she likes to cook in her free time .
the town hall meeting is a departure from typical german political campaigns , which rarely focus on a candidate 's personality and private life .
merkel 's appearance was seen by many in germany as obama-esque .
us president barack obama is known for his charm and held a town hall meeting while in strasbourg , france , at the beginning of april for a nato summit .
a kinder , gentler chancellor this election year merkel 's party , the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , seems to be pushing a softer merkel and is banking on her popularity .
the chancellor is doing better in opinion polls than the cdu itself .
as the global economy crumbles , merkel must convince voters that she and her traditionally pro-business party understand the everyday concerns that trouble ordinary germans .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's advice to the unemployed ?
train for a career the german economy is facing its deepest recession since world war ii and some 300,000 jobs have been lost since last september when the us investment bank lehman brothers collapsed .
despite the difficult situation , merkel was optimistic .
" we 've probably just about reached the low point , " she said of the ongoing recession .
and a potential increase in the sales tax was an " absolute no . "
merkel also doled out some practical advice during the evening .
when an unemployed 21 year old complained that the employment office could n't give him appointment for two months , merkel agreed that should n't be the case .
but then she asked what he had trained to do .

the show uses photographs , documents , books , instruments and detailed explanations to show how vastly different the two musical icons were treated by the nazis and how their works were manipulated and distorted .
museum director joerg hansen said hitler 's reception of the two composers offers an " important lesson " about the nazi rhetoric of " german superiority " and " jewish threat . "
mendelssohn denigrated by the nazis mendelssohn -lrb- 1809-1847 -rrb- , born to an illustrious jewish family in hamburg , sharply divided opinion in the music world .
during his lifetime he was considered a musical genius by some while others found his style too conservative .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mendelssohn is considered one of the most important composers of the romantic period but mendelssohn is largely credited for playing a pivotal role in the revival of interest in the music of bach , which had largely been forgotten around that time .
just a century later , the tables had turned - when hitler came to power in 1933 , the nazi regime cited mendelssohn 's jewish origin as a reason to ban performance and publication of his works .
once the co-founder of the new bach society in leipzig , mendelssohn was denigrated by nazi musicologists as having contributed to the " effeminacy " of german music in the 19th century .
the show documents how the nazis in 1936 removed a statue of mendelssohn erected in leipzig in 1892 and his works from all the important concert halls in the country .
it also touches on the 1938 duesseldorf exhibition " degenerate music . "
bach the most " german of all germans " bach , on the other hand , was celebrated by the nazis as a " northern " musical artist .
his music was played during nazi party conferences and the texts to his works were tweaked to suit the party 's propaganda .
a special unit set up by the regime to rework music ensured that bach 's music was " purified of jewish references . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : johann sebastian bach is widely considered one of the greatest composers in the western tradition museum director hansen said adolf hitler and his propaganda minister joseph goebbels publicly paid homage to bach as the " most german of all german composers " while mendelssohn the " jew " was considered a dangerous " accident " in music history .
one of the exhibits in eisenach includes a choral piece by bach which was reworded to be the battle song of the hitler youth movement .
another photograph shows the leipzig thomas choir which joined the movement in 1937 .
the exhibition spans the period from 1829 , when the then 21-year-old mendelssohn performed bach 's st. matthew passion at the berlin singakademie , to the persecution and death of jewish artists in nazi concentration camps .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view of the bachhaus in eisenach in the state of thuringia , the birthplace of bach the success of mendelssohn 's berlin performance , the first since bach 's death in 1750 , was an important element in the renaissance of bach 's music in germany and , eventually , throughout europe .
it earned mendelssohn widespread acclaim .
hansen said the exhibition remained a controversial one because it touched on a difficult chapter of history .
as a result , the museum director said it can not be shown in the eastern city of leipzig - an important city where both bach and mendelssohn spent important and productive parts of their careers and where bach is a larger-than-life figure .

pirate attacks nearly doubled to 102 in the first quarter of this year compared to the same period last year , the international maritime bureau recently reported .
most of the attacks occurred in the gulf of aden and off the eastern coast of somalia , precisely in the area where the international community has sent more than a dozen warships to deter and prevent piracy .
it 's impossible to know how many attacks would have taken place without the presence of navy ships from around the world in the region , experts believe international cooperation needs to be improved to make the fight against piracy more effective .
improving coordination is the aim of a conference in kuala lumpur which gets underway monday and which brings together top maritime experts , diplomats and security officials .
four missions , four commands , one task yet getting everyone on the same page can be a challenge .
bjorn seibert , a research affiliate for security studies at the massachusetts institute of technology , lists the various international missions deployed : " you have the eu 's mission , you have nato 's mission and then you have two combined task forces led by the united states , combined task force 151 and 150 , which operate in the same area with the same task . "
the answer seibert and peter lehr give when asked whether the four missions suffer from a lack of cooperation is clear : " i would say they are hampered at the moment , " argues lehr , a piracy specialist at the university of st. andrews .
he points out that the different missions have different chains of command , different rules of engagement and operate under different domestic laws .
that means that for example dutch or german warships can only apprehend pirates if they pose a threat to their national interests , explains lehr .
" recently a dutch warship arrested pirates and freed yemeni hostages , but then realizing that no national interest was threatened they had to release the pirates , which means they had to bring them on the shore again , letting them actually go back to their pirate ports and then strike again , " says lehr .
" that 's the problem . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes , it 's not clear what to do with pirates when they 're caught a more tragic example of the lack of international cooperation mentioned by both experts happened late last year .
an indian warship sank a thai fishing boat it mistook for a so-called pirate mother ship , killing 15 thai crew members .
" this would be something that under eu rules of engagements would not have been possible , " says lehr .
merging missions the international community has recognized coordination is necessary .
at the beginning of the year the contact group on piracy off the coast of somalia -lrb- cpgsc -rrb- was launched to do exactly that .
while the cpsc is a step forward because it provides a broad framework under the united nations for countries to engage in counter-piracy , it does not provide much help in the concrete fight against pirates taking place every day , the experts say .
instead as a more practical approach , suggests seibert , the europeans should ask themselves whether they really need to participate in four different operations to address the same problem .
the answer could be to merge the eu and nato missions and create one combined structure .
" something like this has been done before in 1992 in bosnia where both the western european union and nato had separate naval forces and they had eventually a unified command " , argues seibert .
" so that 's something that you could look into at least over the long term in somalia too . "
lehr agrees that it is vital to establish one set of rules of engagement under the same chain of command .
" but that 's wishful thinking , that wo n't happen anytime soon , i fear , " he adds and points out that the international community has been faced with the same problem in afghanistan for years .
more air patrols but even if a unified command structure proves to be impossible to implement , there are other measures to bolster the effectiveness of counter-piracy operations , such as increasing the number of airplanes patrolling the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been calls for more air patrols still , given the recent spike in attacks despite the naval missions in the area , do counter-piracy operations stand any realistic chance to stop the pirates ? everybody , especially the navy commanders running the operations , knows that it is impossible to tackle piracy with a naval mission , says lehr . it must be solved on land .
" but you can deny the pirates the long reach they have at the moment .
they are operating from mother ships which give them a reach of up to several hundred nautical miles off their shores .
if you can ferret out these mother ships and either arrest or sink them you will turn this high-sea piracy into coastal piracy again which means it will be less lethal , it will be less of a problem . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 18.05.2009 researcher says merit-based us system better at attracting talent großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weber says the us does a better job of rewarding success and creativity than europe in recent years , skilled germans have migrated to foreign shores for jobs and opportunities .
dw spoke to acclaimed physicist eicke weber , who worked in the us for 23 years , about his decision to come back to germany . after 23 years of research in the usa , which he put an end to after teaching materials science at the university of california in berkeley , professor eicke weber finally came home to germany .
on july 1 , 2006 , the physicist and materials researcher became director of the fraunhofer institute for solar energy systems ise in freiburg , southern germany .
what shaped your decision to come back to germany after working in the us as a researcher for over two decades ?
the united states is a unique place worldwide because it is attractive for people from around the world for active and energetic people and of course for scientists who are looking for excellent working conditions .
the united states therefore really attracts the best scientists from around the world .
the universities in the us offer many attractive positions .
they offer a level playing field to compete for funds for research .
the result is that competition is much tougher than , say , in germany .
but those who continuously have good ideas and stay ahead of the others have good opportunities .
on the other hand , this " brain drain " is n't good for other countries .
that means that europe and asia have to make sure they create attractive conditions for people to come back to .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fraunhofer insitut in freiburg focuses on research in solar energy and energy efficiency the kind of institute i came back to - fraunhofer - is a very special government laboratory because it is a government-sponsored institute , but basically it has to earn its money through its own success .
in my institute , basic funding from the government is down to 10 percent - that means 90 percent is based on our success in bringing in projects , half from industry and half from government sources .
this creates a competitive atmosphere , -lsb- which -rsb- i liked so much while working in the us .
i must say i was very happy to have this opportunity to come back to .
american research institutes offer substantially higher salaries than institutes in germany .
is that one of the main reasons scientists find it difficult to return to countries such as germany ?
it 's a whole package of things .
i have been quite involved in this topic - when i was in the us i founded an organization called " german scholars organization " to help german scholars find interesting jobs in germany .
and what was frequently mentioned was that the salary is not the problem but rather the structure of the system .
in the us , you can enter the university as i did - as an untenured assistant professor , and if you are successful , you can obtain tenure .
and after 10 years , you can progress to be a full professor .
in the german system , you have boxes - that means your eyes are on the assistant professor level and then you have to go to another university to progress and get a permanent position .
this is of course completely unpredictable because you never know what kind of people you are competing with for the new position .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weber says it 's easier to plan a career as a researcher in the us so in the united states , you can plan your career much better .
it 's much more dependant on your own success and your own contribution to science and technology , whereas in germany it depends on factors that are difficult to control .
that means that when you apply for a position , it 's always a gamble , you never know who the other competitors are , you do n't the preferences of the people who want to hire you .
in all the discussions with foreign scholars in the united states , there 's agreement that the us provides very predictable working conditions where everything depends on how good you are .
you set up the " german scholars organization " in the united states in 2003 .
was the idea to build bridges between germany and the us ?
yes , exactly .
as a scholar in the us , you really feel like you are -lsb- out -rsb- in the world and you are approached by universities or industry who want to hire you .
you do n't have a similar type of approach from german employers .
basically you 're not in the country anymore and you have to make big efforts to stay in touch and get to know what 's going on in germany .
at that point we thought an organization that concentrates on building this bridge between very interested employers in germany and those scholars abroad would make a difference .
it did .
we managed to attract a particularly interesting program from the krupp foundation .
the foundation gave us several million euros to provide scholarships of $ 100,000 -lrb- 74,000 euros -rrb- for returning scholars on university positions in germany .
the scholars who got this grant said it made a big difference to them .
so there are things that can be done with relatively modest means in order to make a return to germany more attractive .
have you continued with the focus of your research as head of the fraunhofer institute for solar energy in freiburg ?
yes , as a matter of fact when i came to freiburg , the fraunhofer institute was so interested in my own research that they provided me with a very big research grant so we could set up a whole laboratory to pursue research to make good solar cells from silicon with high impurity content .
of course , this is what i 'm very interested in .
on the other hand , leading an institute with 800 people with a budget of 15 million euros means that i do n't have too much time to be involved in research on a day-to-day basis .
but for me it 's very satisfying that from my director 's level i can make sure that the things i 'm interested in get the support they deserve .
i can really say that i 'm very impressed with the quality of the people and their enthusiasm .

"
" the fight must stop now , " the eu ministers demanded , adding that those who have violated international human rights laws " must be brought to justice . "
while describing the tamil tigers as terrorists who have used civilians as human shields , the ministers said this was no excuse for the government trampling on human rights to fight them .
they also urged the sri lankan government to cooperate with the united nations in resolving the crisis , ending restrictions on aid agencies and allowing the international committee of the red cross to monitor screening of people leaving the conflict zone .
the call came as sri lankan authorities declared a " final victory , " after annoning they killed tamil leader vellupillai prabhakaran earlier in the day .
prabhakaran 's son and several other top tamil tigers were killed over the weekend .
the sri lankan president had already claimed victory on saturday , while the tigers admitted defeat on sunday .
the tamil tigers , or liberation tigers of tamil eelam , have been fighting for an independent state for more than 25 years .
up until two years ago , when the sri lankan government launched a major offensive against them , the rebels ran a de facto mini-state that stretched across one third of the island nation .

according to the first-ever poverty atlas released by der paritaetische , one of the big five social welfare organizations in germany , the level of poverty in some eastern parts of the country is up to four times higher than in the south .
the atlas , released on monday in berlin , shows that the german region of western pomerania leads the nation when it comes to poverty , with more than one in four people there living at or below the poverty line .
on the opposite end of the spectrum - as well as the opposite end of the country - the region of schwarzwald-baar-heuberg has a poverty rate of 7.4 percent .
call for countermeasures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schneider is calling for unemployment benefits to be raised speaking at a press conference , association head ulrich schneider criticized the growing regional and social divisions within the country .
many regions , especially those in the east , could easily become dependent on the state to survive , he said , calling for rapid and systematic countermeasures .
those measures include raising long-term unemployment benefits from 351 euros -lrb- $ 474 -rrb- a month to 440 euros as well as doing a better job of applying the economic stimulus package to the regions that really need it .
such an increase would cost up to 10 billion euros per year .
the definition of ' poor ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 14.3 percent of germans are said to live below the poverty line of course , the atlas begs the question : what does poor actually mean ?
in germany , the term applies to anyone who earns less than 60 percent of the average national wage .
for singles that 's 764 euros -lrb- $ 1,031 -rrb- per month , and for couples without children it 's 1,376 euros .
it comes as no surprise that the regions the atlas shows as having the highest poverty rate also have the highest level of unemployment .
the poverty rate overall in germany is 14.3 percent , with the average in the west of the country being 12.9 percent , 6.6 percent lower than in the east . that corresponds with data provided by the german statistics office , which says that as of january of this year , unemployment was 13.9 percent in the east and 6.9 percent in the west . dividing up the wealth at the unveiling , schneider that new measures to fight poverty should n't include programs like the scrapping bonus .
the 2,500-euro bonus goes to people who have their old cars scrapped and buy a new car .
it 's meant to help the ailing auto industry through the financial crisis .
schneider said a third of the federal funds dedicated to economic stimulus measures , which amount to 10 billion euros , are going to the three states with the lowest poverty levels : bavaria , hesse and baden-wuerttemberg. mrm / dpa / reuters / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the show uses photographs , documents , books , instruments and detailed explanations to show how vastly different the two musical icons were treated by the nazis and how their works were manipulated and distorted .
museum director joerg hansen said hitler 's reception of the two composers offers an " important lesson " about the nazi rhetoric of " german superiority " and " jewish threat . "
mendelssohn denigrated by the nazis mendelssohn -lrb- 1809-1847 -rrb- , born to an illustrious jewish family in hamburg , sharply divided opinion in the music world .
during his lifetime he was considered a musical genius by some while others found his style too conservative .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mendelssohn is considered one of the most important composers of the romantic period but mendelssohn is largely credited for playing a pivotal role in the revival of interest in the music of bach , which had largely been forgotten around that time .
just a century later , the tables had turned - when hitler came to power in 1933 , the nazi regime cited mendelssohn 's jewish origin as a reason to ban performance and publication of his works .
once the co-founder of the new bach society in leipzig , mendelssohn was denigrated by nazi musicologists as having contributed to the " effeminacy " of german music in the 19th century .
the show documents how the nazis in 1936 removed a statue of mendelssohn erected in leipzig in 1892 and his works from all the important concert halls in the country .
it also touches on the 1938 duesseldorf exhibition " degenerate music . "
bach the most " german of all germans " bach , on the other hand , was celebrated by the nazis as a " northern " musical artist .
his music was played during nazi party conferences and the texts to his works were tweaked to suit the party 's propaganda .
a special unit set up by the regime to rework music ensured that bach 's music was " purified of jewish references . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : johann sebastian bach is widely considered one of the greatest composers in the western tradition museum director hansen said adolf hitler and his propaganda minister joseph goebbels publicly paid homage to bach as the " most german of all german composers " while mendelssohn the " jew " was considered a dangerous " accident " in music history .
one of the exhibits in eisenach includes a choral piece by bach which was reworded to be the battle song of the hitler youth movement .
another photograph shows the leipzig thomas choir which joined the movement in 1937 .
the exhibition spans the period from 1829 , when the then 21-year-old mendelssohn performed bach 's st. matthew passion at the berlin singakademie , to the persecution and death of jewish artists in nazi concentration camps .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view of the bachhaus in eisenach in the state of thuringia , the birthplace of bach the success of mendelssohn 's berlin performance , the first since bach 's death in 1750 , was an important element in the renaissance of bach 's music in germany and , eventually , throughout europe .
it earned mendelssohn widespread acclaim .
hansen said the exhibition remained a controversial one because it touched on a difficult chapter of history .
as a result , the museum director said it can not be shown in the eastern city of leipzig - an important city where both bach and mendelssohn spent important and productive parts of their careers and where bach is a larger-than-life figure .

about 100 employees demonstrated in support of hilgert outside the bank in dusseldorf as members of the state-owned bank 's supervisory board arrived for an evening meeting .
westlb later announced that hilgert 's deputy dietrich voigtländer would initially take over .
hilgert had taken charge a year ago after a purge of the previous management .

generally seen as a tough and competent leader by the electorate , merkel is also often perceived as cool and lacking in charisma .
merkel saw this as an opportunity to connect with voters on a personal level .
in the berlin studio of commercial broadcaster rtl , merkel met with 100 guests and answered questions ranging from how she planned to balance the budget without increasing taxes to what she likes to cook in her free time .
the town hall meeting is a departure from typical german political campaigns , which rarely focus on a candidate 's personality and private life .
merkel 's appearance was seen by many in germany as obama-esque .
us president barack obama is known for his charm and held a town hall meeting while in strasbourg , france , at the beginning of april for a nato summit .
a kinder , gentler chancellor this election year merkel 's party , the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , seems to be pushing a softer merkel and is banking on her popularity .
the chancellor is doing better in opinion polls than the cdu itself .
as the global economy crumbles , merkel must convince voters that she and her traditionally pro-business party understand the everyday concerns that trouble ordinary germans .

the ministers are set to press their counterparts from the association of south-east asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- to take firm action against burma 's military junta at a may 25 meeting , officials said .
" we have an agreement to investigate more sanctions , we have an agreement that we should pursue the asean track next week ... and we have an agreement that we need to come back to that issue , " british foreign secretary david miliband said after a meeting with eu counterparts in brussels .
unanimous condemnation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been protests around the world the regime 's decision to arrest nobel peace prize winner suu kyi and commit her to what miliband called a " show trial " has provoked outrage in europe and dominated monday 's regular eu talks .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said that the trial against aung san suu kyi was further evidence of the state of human rights in burma .
" the trial against aung san suu kyi is an indication of the continued disregard for basic human rights in myanmar -lrb- burma -rrb- , " steinmeier said on the sidelines of the meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels . " to lock away and sentence -lrb- suu kyi -rrb- does not bring stability or reconciliation .
in this way , the scheduled elections will become a farce , " steinmeier said . " i expect the trial to not only be postponed , but to be immediately stopped and ms suu kyi be set free at last , " the minister added .
the other eu ministers echoed these sentiments , condemning the trial of burma 's pro-democracy icon , which got under way in the capital of rangoon shortly before the start of the meeting in brussels .
no sanctions yet however , despite debating the possibility , the foreign ministers stopped short of bringing in more sanctions against the country 's regime , instead calling for more cooperation with regional powers such as china and india .
" this is not the moment to lower the sanctions , this is the moment to increase them , " said eu foreign policy chief javier solana . the czech government , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , is " ready to discuss the reinforcement of sanctions , " but first there " will be a call on the burmese authorities to release aung san suu kyi , " its foreign minister , jan kohout , said . but other ministers pointed out that the extension of the sanctions had not stopped the burmese regime putting suu kyi on trial just a fortnight before her six years of house arrest were to end . the sanctions " have not achieved much .
this is one of the big problems that we always have with sanction policies , " finnish foreign minister alexander stubb said . instead , a number of top officials called on the eu to step up its cooperation with china , india and other regional actors in a bid to pressurize the burmese regime . " we have to reinforce the dialogue with burma 's neighbours ...
we have been doing all of that , but maybe not in a sufficient way , " eu foreign affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said . " we have to engage with the other countries in the region , " agreed swedish foreign minister carl bildt , whose country will assume the eu presidency on july 1 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the military junta claims suu kyi violated the terms of her house arrest one month ago , eu foreign ministers extended through april 2010 a package of sanctions against some 500 regime figures and their families , as well as against some 80 businesses linked to the regime , in a bid to urge them towards democratic reforms .
suu kyi went on trial on monday , facing up to five years in jail after burma 's government said she had broken the terms of her house arrest in connection with an incident involving us citizen john yettaw , who is alleged to have spent two days in her house this month .
suu kyi , 63 , was expected to plead not guilty to the charges .
the junta 's critics have accused it of using the episode as a pretext to keep suu kyi in jail during a politically sensitive period leading up to a general election planned for next year. mrm / nda / dpa / reuters / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

steinmeier worries that accepting the inmates would cause a political fight with beijing , which has been demanding that they be extradited to china . conditional acceptance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beijing considers some uighurs to be terrorists according to der spiegel , reinhard silberberg , a senior official with the german foreign ministry , told the us berlin would take in the nine provided that other european nations accept uighurs as well , thereby lessening the pressure on germany . steinmeier has received support for his statement from former german chancellor gerhard schroeder , who told der spiegel that accepting uighurs would certainly put a strain on german-chinese relations . schroeder said that while he is in favor of supporting us president barack obama in his efforts to close guantanamo , only the us is in a position to take in the uighurs without suffering any political consequences from china . mrm / reuters / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , if elected president , he says he would look to socialism for inspiration . " my chances to become president are close to zero , " said peter sodann with a chuckle .
the popular actor from communist east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- is disappointed that people are unwilling to accept him as a politician .
a recent survey showed that only four percent of germans were in favor of sodann becoming president on may 23 .
that 's even lower than the percentage of votes the left party , which nominated him , has in the election body on may 23 . the born misfit the 72-year-old may be convincing as the grumpy inspector in the popular crime series " tatort , " but he has muffed his lines thus far on the political stage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other actors have had more success in politics than sodann sodann made his first blunder in an interview when he said that he would like a role in which he could play an inspector and arrest deutsche bank chief josef ackermann .
the media fallout was devastating .
sodann subsequently made several unfortunate comments that did little to calm the critics . sodann rose from humble beginnings as a toolmaker and went on to become an actor , director and theater manager .
off the stage , he was known for challenging authority .
in 1961 , the student cabaret he led was deemed politically unacceptable , and he was held in detention for nine months by the stasi , east germany 's secret police . as an actor at the berliner ensemble under bertolt brecht and helene weigel and later as a theater director , sodann was highly critical of the gdr .
he has said that the fall of the berlin wall was the most important event in his life . still a fan of socialism the actor has promised to contribute a degree of levity to the office of president .
he has said that he does n't want the gdr back , while emphasizing that socialism remains a good idea which embraces justice and solidarity , and that it was a project which was far from finished , in the same way that christianity was as well . sodann said he wants to fulfill his role no matter how hard it might be .
it 's a philosophy that 's in line with his recently published memoires titled " no half measures . " author : bernd graessler -lrb- nk -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : piracy hansa stavanger arrives at kenyan port after piracy ordeal in gulf of aden , piracy scourge continues unabated fighting piracy militarily has mixed success so far international relations -pipe- 18.05.2009 fighting piracy requires better international cooperation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has soldiers participating in anti-piracy missions as an international conference aimed at fighting somali piracy gets underway , concern remains that international efforts are too disjointed to be effective . the results look bleak .
pirate attacks nearly doubled to 102 in the first quarter of this year compared to the same period last year , the international maritime bureau recently reported .
most of the attacks occurred in the gulf of aden and off the eastern coast of somalia , precisely in the area where the international community has sent more than a dozen warships to deter and prevent piracy .
it 's impossible to know how many attacks would have taken place without the presence of navy ships from around the world in the region , experts believe international cooperation needs to be improved to make the fight against piracy more effective .
improving coordination is the aim of a conference in kuala lumpur which gets underway monday and which brings together top maritime experts , diplomats and security officials .
four missions , four commands , one task yet getting everyone on the same page can be a challenge .
bjorn seibert , a research affiliate for security studies at the massachusetts institute of technology , lists the various international missions deployed : " you have the eu 's mission , you have nato 's mission and then you have two combined task forces led by the united states , combined task force 151 and 150 , which operate in the same area with the same task . "
the answer seibert and peter lehr give when asked whether the four missions suffer from a lack of cooperation is clear : " i would say they are hampered at the moment , " argues lehr , a piracy specialist at the university of st. andrews .
he points out that the different missions have different chains of command , different rules of engagement and operate under different domestic laws .
that means that for example dutch or german warships can only apprehend pirates if they pose a threat to their national interests , explains lehr .
" recently a dutch warship arrested pirates and freed yemeni hostages , but then realizing that no national interest was threatened they had to release the pirates , which means they had to bring them on the shore again , letting them actually go back to their pirate ports and then strike again , " says lehr .
" that 's the problem . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes , it 's not clear what to do with pirates when they 're caught a more tragic example of the lack of international cooperation mentioned by both experts happened late last year .
an indian warship sank a thai fishing boat it mistook for a so-called pirate mother ship , killing 15 thai crew members .
" this would be something that under eu rules of engagements would not have been possible , " says lehr .
merging missions the international community has recognized coordination is necessary .
at the beginning of the year the contact group on piracy off the coast of somalia -lrb- cpgsc -rrb- was launched to do exactly that .
while the cpsc is a step forward because it provides a broad framework under the united nations for countries to engage in counter-piracy , it does not provide much help in the concrete fight against pirates taking place every day , the experts say .
instead as a more practical approach , suggests seibert , the europeans should ask themselves whether they really need to participate in four different operations to address the same problem .
the answer could be to merge the eu and nato missions and create one combined structure .
" something like this has been done before in 1992 in bosnia where both the western european union and nato had separate naval forces and they had eventually a unified command " , argues seibert .
" so that 's something that you could look into at least over the long term in somalia too . "
lehr agrees that it is vital to establish one set of rules of engagement under the same chain of command .
" but that 's wishful thinking , that wo n't happen anytime soon , i fear , " he adds and points out that the international community has been faced with the same problem in afghanistan for years .
more air patrols but even if a unified command structure proves to be impossible to implement , there are other measures to bolster the effectiveness of counter-piracy operations , such as increasing the number of airplanes patrolling the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been calls for more air patrols still , given the recent spike in attacks despite the naval missions in the area , do counter-piracy operations stand any realistic chance to stop the pirates ? everybody , especially the navy commanders running the operations , knows that it is impossible to tackle piracy with a naval mission , says lehr . it must be solved on land .
" but you can deny the pirates the long reach they have at the moment .
they are operating from mother ships which give them a reach of up to several hundred nautical miles off their shores .
if you can ferret out these mother ships and either arrest or sink them you will turn this high-sea piracy into coastal piracy again which means it will be less lethal , it will be less of a problem . "

generally seen as a tough and competent leader by the electorate , merkel is also often perceived as cool and lacking in charisma .
merkel saw this as an opportunity to connect with voters on a personal level .
in the berlin studio of commercial broadcaster rtl , merkel met with 100 guests and answered questions ranging from how she planned to balance the budget without increasing taxes to what she likes to cook in her free time .
the town hall meeting is a departure from typical german political campaigns , which rarely focus on a candidate 's personality and private life .
merkel 's appearance was seen by many in germany as obama-esque .
us president barack obama is known for his charm and held a town hall meeting while in strasbourg , france , at the beginning of april for a nato summit .
a kinder , gentler chancellor this election year merkel 's party , the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , seems to be pushing a softer merkel and is banking on her popularity .
the chancellor is doing better in opinion polls than the cdu itself .
as the global economy crumbles , merkel must convince voters that she and her traditionally pro-business party understand the everyday concerns that trouble ordinary germans .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's advice to the unemployed ?
train for a career the german economy is facing its deepest recession since world war ii and some 300,000 jobs have been lost since last september when the us investment bank lehman brothers collapsed .
despite the difficult situation , merkel was optimistic .
" we 've probably just about reached the low point , " she said of the ongoing recession .
and a potential increase in the sales tax was an " absolute no . "
merkel also doled out some practical advice during the evening .
when an unemployed 21 year old complained that the employment office could n't give him appointment for two months , merkel agreed that should n't be the case .
but then she asked what he had trained to do .
when the young man answered , " nothing " , she encouraged him to take advantage of his free time .
" do everything you can to train for a career , " she advised .
let 's get personal participants in the forum wanted to know how merkel stayed connected with the lives of germany 's citizens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel relaxes by cooking or traveling with her husband her husband , chemistry professor joachin sauer , keeps her grounded , she said .
" i have to fold my own clothes at home and fill the washing machine , " she said .
she shops for food at normal grocery stores , she said , adding that she likes to cook on the weekends .
" i make a pretty good potato soup , " she said , and her guests say they love her stuffed beef roll .
" i do n't think they 're just telling me what i want to hear , " she said .
the chancellor also spoke openly about the importance of her faith in god .
she believes god looks over and protects humanity , and " that gives me strength , " she said. hf / dpa / reuters editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the ministers are set to press their counterparts from the association of south-east asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- to take firm action against burma 's military junta at a may 25 meeting , officials said .
" we have an agreement to investigate more sanctions , we have an agreement that we should pursue the asean track next week ... and we have an agreement that we need to come back to that issue , " british foreign secretary david miliband said after a meeting with eu counterparts in brussels .
unanimous condemnation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been protests around the world the regime 's decision to arrest nobel peace prize winner suu kyi and commit her to what miliband called a " show trial " has provoked outrage in europe and dominated monday 's regular eu talks .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said that the trial against aung san suu kyi was further evidence of the state of human rights in burma .
" the trial against aung san suu kyi is an indication of the continued disregard for basic human rights in myanmar -lrb- burma -rrb- , " steinmeier said on the sidelines of the meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels . " to lock away and sentence -lrb- suu kyi -rrb- does not bring stability or reconciliation .
in this way , the scheduled elections will become a farce , " steinmeier said . " i expect the trial to not only be postponed , but to be immediately stopped and ms suu kyi be set free at last , " the minister added .
the other eu ministers echoed these sentiments , condemning the trial of burma 's pro-democracy icon , which got under way in the capital of rangoon shortly before the start of the meeting in brussels .
no sanctions yet however , despite debating the possibility , the foreign ministers stopped short of bringing in more sanctions against the country 's regime , instead calling for more cooperation with regional powers such as china and india .
" this is not the moment to lower the sanctions , this is the moment to increase them , " said eu foreign policy chief javier solana . the czech government , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , is " ready to discuss the reinforcement of sanctions , " but first there " will be a call on the burmese authorities to release aung san suu kyi , " its foreign minister , jan kohout , said . but other ministers pointed out that the extension of the sanctions had not stopped the burmese regime putting suu kyi on trial just a fortnight before her six years of house arrest were to end . the sanctions " have not achieved much .
this is one of the big problems that we always have with sanction policies , " finnish foreign minister alexander stubb said . instead , a number of top officials called on the eu to step up its cooperation with china , india and other regional actors in a bid to pressurize the burmese regime . " we have to reinforce the dialogue with burma 's neighbours ...
we have been doing all of that , but maybe not in a sufficient way , " eu foreign affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said . " we have to engage with the other countries in the region , " agreed swedish foreign minister carl bildt , whose country will assume the eu presidency on july 1 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the military junta claims suu kyi violated the terms of her house arrest one month ago , eu foreign ministers extended through april 2010 a package of sanctions against some 500 regime figures and their families , as well as against some 80 businesses linked to the regime , in a bid to urge them towards democratic reforms .
suu kyi went on trial on monday , facing up to five years in jail after burma 's government said she had broken the terms of her house arrest in connection with an incident involving us citizen john yettaw , who is alleged to have spent two days in her house this month .
suu kyi , 63 , was expected to plead not guilty to the charges .
the junta 's critics have accused it of using the episode as a pretext to keep suu kyi in jail during a politically sensitive period leading up to a general election planned for next year. mrm / nda / dpa / reuters / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

generally seen as a tough and competent leader by the electorate , merkel is also often perceived as cool and lacking in charisma .
merkel saw this as an opportunity to connect with voters on a personal level .
in the berlin studio of commercial broadcaster rtl , merkel met with 100 guests and answered questions ranging from how she planned to balance the budget without increasing taxes to what she likes to cook in her free time .
the town hall meeting is a departure from typical german political campaigns , which rarely focus on a candidate 's personality and private life .
merkel 's appearance was seen by many in germany as obama-esque .
us president barack obama is known for his charm and held a town hall meeting while in strasbourg , france , at the beginning of april for a nato summit .

the ministers are set to press their counterparts from the association of south-east asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- to take firm action against burma 's military junta at a may 25 meeting , officials said .
" we have an agreement to investigate more sanctions , we have an agreement that we should pursue the asean track next week ... and we have an agreement that we need to come back to that issue , " british foreign secretary david miliband said after a meeting with eu counterparts in brussels .

the ministers are set to press their counterparts from the association of south-east asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- to take firm action against burma 's military junta at a may 25 meeting , officials said .
" we have an agreement to investigate more sanctions , we have an agreement that we should pursue the asean track next week ... and we have an agreement that we need to come back to that issue , " british foreign secretary david miliband said after a meeting with eu counterparts in brussels .
unanimous condemnation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been protests around the world the regime 's decision to arrest nobel peace prize winner suu kyi and commit her to what miliband called a " show trial " has provoked outrage in europe and dominated monday 's regular eu talks .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said that the trial against aung san suu kyi was further evidence of the state of human rights in burma .
" the trial against aung san suu kyi is an indication of the continued disregard for basic human rights in myanmar -lrb- burma -rrb- , " steinmeier said on the sidelines of the meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels . " to lock away and sentence -lrb- suu kyi -rrb- does not bring stability or reconciliation .
in this way , the scheduled elections will become a farce , " steinmeier said . " i expect the trial to not only be postponed , but to be immediately stopped and ms suu kyi be set free at last , " the minister added .
the other eu ministers echoed these sentiments , condemning the trial of burma 's pro-democracy icon , which got under way in the capital of rangoon shortly before the start of the meeting in brussels .
no sanctions yet however , despite debating the possibility , the foreign ministers stopped short of bringing in more sanctions against the country 's regime , instead calling for more cooperation with regional powers such as china and india .
" this is not the moment to lower the sanctions , this is the moment to increase them , " said eu foreign policy chief javier solana . the czech government , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , is " ready to discuss the reinforcement of sanctions , " but first there " will be a call on the burmese authorities to release aung san suu kyi , " its foreign minister , jan kohout , said . but other ministers pointed out that the extension of the sanctions had not stopped the burmese regime putting suu kyi on trial just a fortnight before her six years of house arrest were to end . the sanctions " have not achieved much .
this is one of the big problems that we always have with sanction policies , " finnish foreign minister alexander stubb said . instead , a number of top officials called on the eu to step up its cooperation with china , india and other regional actors in a bid to pressurize the burmese regime . " we have to reinforce the dialogue with burma 's neighbours ...
we have been doing all of that , but maybe not in a sufficient way , " eu foreign affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said . " we have to engage with the other countries in the region , " agreed swedish foreign minister carl bildt , whose country will assume the eu presidency on july 1 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the military junta claims suu kyi violated the terms of her house arrest one month ago , eu foreign ministers extended through april 2010 a package of sanctions against some 500 regime figures and their families , as well as against some 80 businesses linked to the regime , in a bid to urge them towards democratic reforms .
suu kyi went on trial on monday , facing up to five years in jail after burma 's government said she had broken the terms of her house arrest in connection with an incident involving us citizen john yettaw , who is alleged to have spent two days in her house this month .
suu kyi , 63 , was expected to plead not guilty to the charges .

the result indicated citizens are ready for change in the recession-hit baltic state . european union budget commissioner dalia grybauskaite , who ran as an independent candidate , won 69 percent of the vote .
she came in well ahead of her nearest rival , social democrat algirdas butkevicius , who obtained just 11.87 percent .
the five other candidates lagged even farther behind .
official results showed just over 51 percent of the country 's 2.7 million registered voters turned out , which according to lithuanian law , was just enough for grybauskaite to avoid a runoff ballot .
" i congratulate the lithuanian people for their choice , " the 53-year-old told a cheering crowd at her election quarters , before adding : " the taste of victory is the burden of responsibility . "
grybauskaite takes office at a time when lithuania is struggling to cope with the global economic downturn .
unemployment stands at 15.5 percent , which is the european union 's third highest , while overall salaries are predicted to fall by 12.3 percent this year .
last week , the country 's central bank more than tripled its already doom-laden forecast , saying the economy was likely to shrink by 15.6 percent this year .
with lithuania no longer enjoying the reputation of a fast-growing economic " tiger " as it had after joining the european union in 2004 and up until 2007 , grybauskaite has committed herself to stabilizing the country 's financial status .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rioters in lithuania showed their anger over unpopular reforms " the first challenge is the economic crisis … i think that together we will be able to emerge from these times of hardships much better , much more direct and much richer , " she said .
she has pledged to provide tax breaks for small and medium-sized businesses , stimulate exports and absorb eu aid faster .
the president-elect , who has a martial arts black belt , has also vowed to address allegations of corruption within the current government .
" i believe in transparency and i will demand that quality from everyone .
i do n't appreciate liars or late-comers , " grybauskaite said .
support from incumbent government overall , grybauskaite 's victory has been warmly welcomed in lithuania by both voters and politicians alike .
" we have a good president and i am really happy with what we are trying to achieve .
i am happy that she is coming with a very clear message of change , which is needed very much for lithuania , " prime minister andrius kubilius said .
his conservative party colleague , vytautas landsbergis said grybauskaite would be " energetic , positive and determined to act " .
ahead of the election , grybauskaite won the backing of the ruling conservatives , who did not put up a candidate .
grybauskaite will officially take over the reigns from outgoing president valdas adamkus in july .
the 82-year-old adamkus , who is also non-partisan , will retire after serving two five-year terms , which is the maximum allowed under the lithuanian constitution. cg / dpa / reuters / afp editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 18.05.2009 german poverty atlas shows huge social divide großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of people living below the poverty line is on the rise in germany a new study by a german welfare organization shows that the gap between rich and poor is widening in the country , with the east and northwest lagging clearly behind the south . germany is being ripped apart - at least socially .
according to the first-ever poverty atlas released by der paritaetische , one of the big five social welfare organizations in germany , the level of poverty in some eastern parts of the country is up to four times higher than in the south .
the atlas , released on monday in berlin , shows that the german region of western pomerania leads the nation when it comes to poverty , with more than one in four people there living at or below the poverty line .
on the opposite end of the spectrum - as well as the opposite end of the country - the region of schwarzwald-baar-heuberg has a poverty rate of 7.4 percent .
call for countermeasures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schneider is calling for unemployment benefits to be raised speaking at a press conference , association head ulrich schneider criticized the growing regional and social divisions within the country .
many regions , especially those in the east , could easily become dependent on the state to survive , he said , calling for rapid and systematic countermeasures .
those measures include raising long-term unemployment benefits from 351 euros -lrb- $ 474 -rrb- a month to 440 euros as well as doing a better job of applying the economic stimulus package to the regions that really need it .
such an increase would cost up to 10 billion euros per year .
the definition of ' poor ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 14.3 percent of germans are said to live below the poverty line of course , the atlas begs the question : what does poor actually mean ?
in germany , the term applies to anyone who earns less than 60 percent of the average national wage .
for singles that 's 764 euros -lrb- $ 1,031 -rrb- per month , and for couples without children it 's 1,376 euros .
it comes as no surprise that the regions the atlas shows as having the highest poverty rate also have the highest level of unemployment .
the poverty rate overall in germany is 14.3 percent , with the average in the west of the country being 12.9 percent , 6.6 percent lower than in the east . that corresponds with data provided by the german statistics office , which says that as of january of this year , unemployment was 13.9 percent in the east and 6.9 percent in the west . dividing up the wealth at the unveiling , schneider that new measures to fight poverty should n't include programs like the scrapping bonus .
the 2,500-euro bonus goes to people who have their old cars scrapped and buy a new car .
it 's meant to help the ailing auto industry through the financial crisis .
schneider said a third of the federal funds dedicated to economic stimulus measures , which amount to 10 billion euros , are going to the three states with the lowest poverty levels : bavaria , hesse and baden-wuerttemberg. mrm / dpa / reuters / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

pirate attacks nearly doubled to 102 in the first quarter of this year compared to the same period last year , the international maritime bureau recently reported .
most of the attacks occurred in the gulf of aden and off the eastern coast of somalia , precisely in the area where the international community has sent more than a dozen warships to deter and prevent piracy .
it 's impossible to know how many attacks would have taken place without the presence of navy ships from around the world in the region , experts believe international cooperation needs to be improved to make the fight against piracy more effective .
improving coordination is the aim of a conference in kuala lumpur which gets underway monday and which brings together top maritime experts , diplomats and security officials .
four missions , four commands , one task yet getting everyone on the same page can be a challenge .
bjorn seibert , a research affiliate for security studies at the massachusetts institute of technology , lists the various international missions deployed : " you have the eu 's mission , you have nato 's mission and then you have two combined task forces led by the united states , combined task force 151 and 150 , which operate in the same area with the same task . "
the answer seibert and peter lehr give when asked whether the four missions suffer from a lack of cooperation is clear : " i would say they are hampered at the moment , " argues lehr , a piracy specialist at the university of st. andrews .
he points out that the different missions have different chains of command , different rules of engagement and operate under different domestic laws .
that means that for example dutch or german warships can only apprehend pirates if they pose a threat to their national interests , explains lehr .
" recently a dutch warship arrested pirates and freed yemeni hostages , but then realizing that no national interest was threatened they had to release the pirates , which means they had to bring them on the shore again , letting them actually go back to their pirate ports and then strike again , " says lehr .
" that 's the problem . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes , it 's not clear what to do with pirates when they 're caught a more tragic example of the lack of international cooperation mentioned by both experts happened late last year .
an indian warship sank a thai fishing boat it mistook for a so-called pirate mother ship , killing 15 thai crew members .
" this would be something that under eu rules of engagements would not have been possible , " says lehr .
merging missions the international community has recognized coordination is necessary .
at the beginning of the year the contact group on piracy off the coast of somalia -lrb- cpgsc -rrb- was launched to do exactly that .
while the cpsc is a step forward because it provides a broad framework under the united nations for countries to engage in counter-piracy , it does not provide much help in the concrete fight against pirates taking place every day , the experts say .
instead as a more practical approach , suggests seibert , the europeans should ask themselves whether they really need to participate in four different operations to address the same problem .
the answer could be to merge the eu and nato missions and create one combined structure .
" something like this has been done before in 1992 in bosnia where both the western european union and nato had separate naval forces and they had eventually a unified command " , argues seibert .
" so that 's something that you could look into at least over the long term in somalia too . "

pirate attacks nearly doubled to 102 in the first quarter of this year compared to the same period last year , the international maritime bureau recently reported .
most of the attacks occurred in the gulf of aden and off the eastern coast of somalia , precisely in the area where the international community has sent more than a dozen warships to deter and prevent piracy .
it 's impossible to know how many attacks would have taken place without the presence of navy ships from around the world in the region , experts believe international cooperation needs to be improved to make the fight against piracy more effective .
improving coordination is the aim of a conference in kuala lumpur which gets underway monday and which brings together top maritime experts , diplomats and security officials .
four missions , four commands , one task yet getting everyone on the same page can be a challenge .
bjorn seibert , a research affiliate for security studies at the massachusetts institute of technology , lists the various international missions deployed : " you have the eu 's mission , you have nato 's mission and then you have two combined task forces led by the united states , combined task force 151 and 150 , which operate in the same area with the same task . "
the answer seibert and peter lehr give when asked whether the four missions suffer from a lack of cooperation is clear : " i would say they are hampered at the moment , " argues lehr , a piracy specialist at the university of st. andrews .
he points out that the different missions have different chains of command , different rules of engagement and operate under different domestic laws .
that means that for example dutch or german warships can only apprehend pirates if they pose a threat to their national interests , explains lehr .
" recently a dutch warship arrested pirates and freed yemeni hostages , but then realizing that no national interest was threatened they had to release the pirates , which means they had to bring them on the shore again , letting them actually go back to their pirate ports and then strike again , " says lehr .
" that 's the problem . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes , it 's not clear what to do with pirates when they 're caught a more tragic example of the lack of international cooperation mentioned by both experts happened late last year .
an indian warship sank a thai fishing boat it mistook for a so-called pirate mother ship , killing 15 thai crew members .
" this would be something that under eu rules of engagements would not have been possible , " says lehr .
merging missions the international community has recognized coordination is necessary .
at the beginning of the year the contact group on piracy off the coast of somalia -lrb- cpgsc -rrb- was launched to do exactly that .
while the cpsc is a step forward because it provides a broad framework under the united nations for countries to engage in counter-piracy , it does not provide much help in the concrete fight against pirates taking place every day , the experts say .
instead as a more practical approach , suggests seibert , the europeans should ask themselves whether they really need to participate in four different operations to address the same problem .
the answer could be to merge the eu and nato missions and create one combined structure .
" something like this has been done before in 1992 in bosnia where both the western european union and nato had separate naval forces and they had eventually a unified command " , argues seibert .
" so that 's something that you could look into at least over the long term in somalia too . "
lehr agrees that it is vital to establish one set of rules of engagement under the same chain of command .

"
" the fight must stop now , " the eu ministers demanded , adding that those who have violated international human rights laws " must be brought to justice . "
while describing the tamil tigers as terrorists who have used civilians as human shields , the ministers said this was no excuse for the government trampling on human rights to fight them .
they also urged the sri lankan government to cooperate with the united nations in resolving the crisis , ending restrictions on aid agencies and allowing the international committee of the red cross to monitor screening of people leaving the conflict zone .
the call came as sri lankan authorities declared a " final victory , " after annoning they killed tamil leader vellupillai prabhakaran earlier in the day .
prabhakaran 's son and several other top tamil tigers were killed over the weekend .
the sri lankan president had already claimed victory on saturday , while the tigers admitted defeat on sunday .
the tamil tigers , or liberation tigers of tamil eelam , have been fighting for an independent state for more than 25 years .
up until two years ago , when the sri lankan government launched a major offensive against them , the rebels ran a de facto mini-state that stretched across one third of the island nation .
the conflict between the government and the rebels has left 70,000 dead , victims of suicide attacks , bomb strikes and assassinations. hf / afp / reuters editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : piracy hansa stavanger arrives at kenyan port after piracy ordeal in gulf of aden , piracy scourge continues unabated fighting piracy militarily has mixed success so far international relations -pipe- 18.05.2009 fighting piracy requires better international cooperation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has soldiers participating in anti-piracy missions as an international conference aimed at fighting somali piracy gets underway , concern remains that international efforts are too disjointed to be effective . the results look bleak .
pirate attacks nearly doubled to 102 in the first quarter of this year compared to the same period last year , the international maritime bureau recently reported .
most of the attacks occurred in the gulf of aden and off the eastern coast of somalia , precisely in the area where the international community has sent more than a dozen warships to deter and prevent piracy .
it 's impossible to know how many attacks would have taken place without the presence of navy ships from around the world in the region , experts believe international cooperation needs to be improved to make the fight against piracy more effective .
improving coordination is the aim of a conference in kuala lumpur which gets underway monday and which brings together top maritime experts , diplomats and security officials .
four missions , four commands , one task yet getting everyone on the same page can be a challenge .
bjorn seibert , a research affiliate for security studies at the massachusetts institute of technology , lists the various international missions deployed : " you have the eu 's mission , you have nato 's mission and then you have two combined task forces led by the united states , combined task force 151 and 150 , which operate in the same area with the same task . "
the answer seibert and peter lehr give when asked whether the four missions suffer from a lack of cooperation is clear : " i would say they are hampered at the moment , " argues lehr , a piracy specialist at the university of st. andrews .
he points out that the different missions have different chains of command , different rules of engagement and operate under different domestic laws .
that means that for example dutch or german warships can only apprehend pirates if they pose a threat to their national interests , explains lehr .
" recently a dutch warship arrested pirates and freed yemeni hostages , but then realizing that no national interest was threatened they had to release the pirates , which means they had to bring them on the shore again , letting them actually go back to their pirate ports and then strike again , " says lehr .
" that 's the problem . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes , it 's not clear what to do with pirates when they 're caught a more tragic example of the lack of international cooperation mentioned by both experts happened late last year .
an indian warship sank a thai fishing boat it mistook for a so-called pirate mother ship , killing 15 thai crew members .
" this would be something that under eu rules of engagements would not have been possible , " says lehr .
merging missions the international community has recognized coordination is necessary .
at the beginning of the year the contact group on piracy off the coast of somalia -lrb- cpgsc -rrb- was launched to do exactly that .
while the cpsc is a step forward because it provides a broad framework under the united nations for countries to engage in counter-piracy , it does not provide much help in the concrete fight against pirates taking place every day , the experts say .
instead as a more practical approach , suggests seibert , the europeans should ask themselves whether they really need to participate in four different operations to address the same problem .
the answer could be to merge the eu and nato missions and create one combined structure .
" something like this has been done before in 1992 in bosnia where both the western european union and nato had separate naval forces and they had eventually a unified command " , argues seibert .
" so that 's something that you could look into at least over the long term in somalia too . "
lehr agrees that it is vital to establish one set of rules of engagement under the same chain of command .
" but that 's wishful thinking , that wo n't happen anytime soon , i fear , " he adds and points out that the international community has been faced with the same problem in afghanistan for years .
more air patrols but even if a unified command structure proves to be impossible to implement , there are other measures to bolster the effectiveness of counter-piracy operations , such as increasing the number of airplanes patrolling the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been calls for more air patrols still , given the recent spike in attacks despite the naval missions in the area , do counter-piracy operations stand any realistic chance to stop the pirates ? everybody , especially the navy commanders running the operations , knows that it is impossible to tackle piracy with a naval mission , says lehr . it must be solved on land .
" but you can deny the pirates the long reach they have at the moment .
they are operating from mother ships which give them a reach of up to several hundred nautical miles off their shores .
if you can ferret out these mother ships and either arrest or sink them you will turn this high-sea piracy into coastal piracy again which means it will be less lethal , it will be less of a problem . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 18.05.2009 german poverty atlas shows huge social divide großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of people living below the poverty line is on the rise in germany a new study by a german welfare organization shows that the gap between rich and poor is widening in the country , with the east and northwest lagging clearly behind the south . germany is being ripped apart - at least socially .
according to the first-ever poverty atlas released by der paritaetische , one of the big five social welfare organizations in germany , the level of poverty in some eastern parts of the country is up to four times higher than in the south .
the atlas , released on monday in berlin , shows that the german region of western pomerania leads the nation when it comes to poverty , with more than one in four people there living at or below the poverty line .
on the opposite end of the spectrum - as well as the opposite end of the country - the region of schwarzwald-baar-heuberg has a poverty rate of 7.4 percent .
call for countermeasures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schneider is calling for unemployment benefits to be raised speaking at a press conference , association head ulrich schneider criticized the growing regional and social divisions within the country .
many regions , especially those in the east , could easily become dependent on the state to survive , he said , calling for rapid and systematic countermeasures .
those measures include raising long-term unemployment benefits from 351 euros -lrb- $ 474 -rrb- a month to 440 euros as well as doing a better job of applying the economic stimulus package to the regions that really need it .
such an increase would cost up to 10 billion euros per year .
the definition of ' poor ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 14.3 percent of germans are said to live below the poverty line of course , the atlas begs the question : what does poor actually mean ?
in germany , the term applies to anyone who earns less than 60 percent of the average national wage .
for singles that 's 764 euros -lrb- $ 1,031 -rrb- per month , and for couples without children it 's 1,376 euros .
it comes as no surprise that the regions the atlas shows as having the highest poverty rate also have the highest level of unemployment .
the poverty rate overall in germany is 14.3 percent , with the average in the west of the country being 12.9 percent , 6.6 percent lower than in the east . that corresponds with data provided by the german statistics office , which says that as of january of this year , unemployment was 13.9 percent in the east and 6.9 percent in the west . dividing up the wealth at the unveiling , schneider that new measures to fight poverty should n't include programs like the scrapping bonus .
the 2,500-euro bonus goes to people who have their old cars scrapped and buy a new car .
it 's meant to help the ailing auto industry through the financial crisis .
schneider said a third of the federal funds dedicated to economic stimulus measures , which amount to 10 billion euros , are going to the three states with the lowest poverty levels : bavaria , hesse and baden-wuerttemberg. mrm / dpa / reuters / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 18.05.2009 obama faces big test on the middle east großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us president has vowed to tackle the israeli-palestinian conflict expectations run high for monday 's first official meeting between president obama and prime minister netanyahu .
can obama revive the middle east peace process ?
let 's hope he can , say europeans . barack obama vowed to take a different approach to foreign policy , one that would include working closely with allies . at a speech in berlin last summer , then-candidate obama proclaimed that " america has no better partner than europe . "
and european leaders have made it clear they 're counting on obama to push forward the middle east peace process .
obama 's meeting with israel 's prime minister benjamin netanyahu on monday in the white house provides a big chance for obama to live up to his pre-presidential statements on the middle east .
many feel obama , simply by declaring the goal to find a solution for the israeli-palestinian conflict a top priority for his administration , has done more right from the start than both the bush and the clinton administrations .
by naming a special envoy to the region and by stating his support for a so-called two-state solution - that is , the creation of a viable palestinian state next to israel - obama again displayed his commitment to the peace process .
but despite all the early efforts by the obama administration , one important fact remains unchanged : without the support of israel and the palestinians , any push for peace in the region is doomed .
so the big question when obama meets netanyahu is whether the us president can convince the israeli premier , who based on his political past and his recent statements is considered a hardliner , to go along with his vision .
can obama convince netanyahu ?
michael bauer , who heads the project europe and the middle east at munich 's center for applied policy research , puts a damper on hopes for a quick success : " the prospects for a successful resumption of the peace process are not very good at this point . "
bauer lists the international community 's cold reception of the new israeli government , especially its far-right foreign minister avidgor lieberman , the war in gaza which led to a further deterioration of already strained israeli-arab relations , the internal palestinian division between hamas and fatah and the continued israeli settlements as factors that could prove difficult to overcome .
despite those problems , argues nathalie tocci , the measuring stick for obama remains clear : " there is the question first and foremost whether netanyahu will accept the end goal of the road map , which means the acceptance of a two-state solution . "
but as tocci , a senior research fellow at the center for european policy research , is quick to add , merely stating one 's acceptance of common goals is not enough .
" the main issue hindering the accomplishment of progress along the road map was the fact of an absence of an international monitoring presence that could actually monitor the extent to which the obligations by both parties were fulfilled on the ground , " tocci said bauer agrees , saying obama should not rely on rhetoric commitments , but also demand concrete efforts on behalf of the israelis to rebuild confidence , for example by halting the construction of settlements .
europe 's role european leaders voiced their opinions on how obama ought to approach the middle east peace process during his recent visit to the continent .
but other than giving advice , what role can europe really play now that the us has retaken the leadership role ? " the europeans have in many ways played a second part in all the peace negotiations , " says daniel korski , a senior fellow at the european council on foreign relations .
" europeans have in a sense been the paymasters offering the financial incentives for any kind of peace deal .
however , practically they have always been marginalized in part because the israeli government has never been really interested in seeing european governments engaged . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe could play a larger role in peace negotiations but this is changing , korski argues .
first , some europeans are not ready to simply pick up the check again after seeing a lot of their investments go up in smoke in gaza .
and second , there are more pro-israeli leaders in major european capitals than before , providing the chance for europe to engage better with israel .
still , says korski , the question remains unanswered as to what exactly europe 's role could be in the peace process .
europe also has limited influence because it does n't speak with one voice on foreign affairs issues , experts say .
" but that does n't mean that the european union can not play a role , " says bauer .
" maybe it is even good that some member states have better relations with israel and other member states are perceived to be closer to the palestinian side . "
by turning its weakness into an asset , bauer suggests , europe could really act as an honest mediator in the conflict .

porsche 's management , they said , did not realize how dicey the situation was for the sports carmaker .
" for a merger of volkswagen and porsche , we need to systematically analyze the current situation of porsche and we need to have a clear picture of the actual conditions there , " volkswagen ceo martin winterkorn was quoted as saying in monday ’ s edition of the berliner zeitung .
volkswagen would need " full transparency " to continue talks , he said .
vw 's chief labor representative , bernd osterloh , said the talks set for monday had been called off because " the current atmosphere was not conducive to a constructive dialog . "
" we were not the ones who had asked for talks and we will not allow volkswagen and individuals in our company to be disparaged just because porsche has no clear strategy , " osterloh said .
friction between the two sides intensified after the porsche and piech families , who control the two carmakers with crossover share holdings , instructed the companies to draft merger plans within the past weeks .
in the negotiations it emerged that the more likely scenario would be that volkswagen would instead end up swallowing porsche .
the economic crisis has changed the equation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the porsche 911 has been the carmaker 's biggest seller over the years in one of germany 's great corporate takeover battles , porsche last year managed to buy a controlling stake in the vastly larger volkswagen .
but the tables were turned this year following the global economic meltdown , which severely hit the auto industry , with porsche looking to volkswagen , europe 's largest automaker , as a knight in shining armor .
ferdinand piech , vw board chairman , underscored porsche 's predicament last monday when he said that the stuttgart-based company was running short of cash .
the head of the porsche works ' council , uwe hueck , said he plans to lead thousands of workers in a protest march this coming monday to demonstrate against what he called piech 's perceived arrogance .
vw 's osterloh remarked it was time for the porsche family " to clearly say what it wants and what it does n't want . "
porsche , in the meantime , along with another german sports car maker , bmw , is apparently exploring the possibility of state loans to shore up the steep drop in demand for its vehicles .
however , according to monday 's edition of the weekly news magazine , der spiegel , " the two companies have not yet made an official request . "

news photos of the stripper , born heather sweet , showing her baring a full bosom during rehearsals led to a complaint by the european broadcasting union , resulting in an order for her to dress more appropriately for the family television show . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : striptease star dita von teese did n't peel off as much as she would have liked to as an event , eurovision is both loved and loathed for its over-the-top , kitschy performances .
moscow organizers managed to arrange a live video connection to astronauts aboard the international space station who launched the audience tele-voting . this year 's result was decided by a combination of audience tele-voting and decisions by expert juries in the 42 participating countries , although only 25 nations actually made it to the final round in moscow . the russian organizers reportedly spent over 30 million euros on this year 's contest , making it the most expensive competition in eurovision 's history . moscow fails to dazzle gay scene however , the customary glitz and kitsch did not manage to blot out political controversy that started well ahead of the event .
organizers had banned georgia 's entry earlier this year because its song was considered a political jab at the host country russia .
the neighbors had fought a brief war late last august . eurovision is known to be immensely popular among the european gay scene .
on saturday , dozens of riot police detained gay rights protesters who had defied the moscow authorities and tried to stage a demonstration against homophobia which had previously been banned . the leading russian gay activist nikolai alexeyev had urged contestants to boycott eurovision in protest against " russia 's state oppression of human rights " . this year 's winner rybak appeared to throw his support behind the gay rights protesters when he said at a news conference : " why did they -lrb- the moscow police -rrb- spend all their energy stopping gays in moscow when the biggest gay parade was here tonight ? " more than just a laugh ? since eurovision 's inception in 1956 , the show has undergone various changes .
its perception among european viewers has also changed drastically over the years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abba 's victory in 1974 marked the swedish band 's international breakthrough the competition rules state that each country is allowed to choose its own act , and that all vocals must be performed live . initially each country was also obliged to sing in one of its official languages .
however , this rule has been changed several times , allowing participants to resort to english vocals , which have booked the most wins in the history of the competition . all-time greats abba launched their international career by winning the show in 1974 with their smash hit " waterloo " .
but critics say the event has meanwhile degenerated into little more than a circus of mediocre songwriting and sometimes even embarrassing acts .
its fiercest opponents say the song contest has become little more than a joke with viewers merely tuning in for a laugh or a cringe . however , critics can not deny that the show is watched by an estimated television audience of over 100 million people every year , making it one of the most viewed events on the planet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicole 's song for peace gave germany its sole eurovision victory in 1982 ireland currently leads the overall table with seven wins , while germany only managed one victory back in 1982 with the song " ein bisschen frieden " -lrb- a little peace -rrb- , which was performed by 17-year-old singer nicole . norway now boasts three wins and as this year 's victor will host the next eurovision song contest in 2010 . nk / dpa / afp / ap / reuters editor : kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 18.05.2009 vw looking for clarity as talks break off with porsche großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche might now be keeping its distance from vw german automaker volkswagen says it has suspended talks on a possible merger with porsche after workers at the german luxury sports car maker said they would protest against alleged takeover plans . sources at volkswagen in wolfsburg said porsche was not in a financial position to stem a merger and did not appear to be sincerely interested in a takeover bid by vw either .
porsche 's management , they said , did not realize how dicey the situation was for the sports carmaker .
" for a merger of volkswagen and porsche , we need to systematically analyze the current situation of porsche and we need to have a clear picture of the actual conditions there , " volkswagen ceo martin winterkorn was quoted as saying in monday ’ s edition of the berliner zeitung .
volkswagen would need " full transparency " to continue talks , he said .
vw 's chief labor representative , bernd osterloh , said the talks set for monday had been called off because " the current atmosphere was not conducive to a constructive dialog . "
" we were not the ones who had asked for talks and we will not allow volkswagen and individuals in our company to be disparaged just because porsche has no clear strategy , " osterloh said .
friction between the two sides intensified after the porsche and piech families , who control the two carmakers with crossover share holdings , instructed the companies to draft merger plans within the past weeks .
in the negotiations it emerged that the more likely scenario would be that volkswagen would instead end up swallowing porsche .
the economic crisis has changed the equation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the porsche 911 has been the carmaker 's biggest seller over the years in one of germany 's great corporate takeover battles , porsche last year managed to buy a controlling stake in the vastly larger volkswagen .
but the tables were turned this year following the global economic meltdown , which severely hit the auto industry , with porsche looking to volkswagen , europe 's largest automaker , as a knight in shining armor .
ferdinand piech , vw board chairman , underscored porsche 's predicament last monday when he said that the stuttgart-based company was running short of cash .
the head of the porsche works ' council , uwe hueck , said he plans to lead thousands of workers in a protest march this coming monday to demonstrate against what he called piech 's perceived arrogance .
vw 's osterloh remarked it was time for the porsche family " to clearly say what it wants and what it does n't want . "
porsche , in the meantime , along with another german sports car maker , bmw , is apparently exploring the possibility of state loans to shore up the steep drop in demand for its vehicles .
however , according to monday 's edition of the weekly news magazine , der spiegel , " the two companies have not yet made an official request . "

much uncertainty remains , including who will own the auto giant and what city the company will call home .

porsche 's management , they said , did not realize how dicey the situation was for the sports carmaker .
" for a merger of volkswagen and porsche , we need to systematically analyze the current situation of porsche and we need to have a clear picture of the actual conditions there , " volkswagen ceo martin winterkorn was quoted as saying in monday ’ s edition of the berliner zeitung .
volkswagen would need " full transparency " to continue talks , he said .
vw 's chief labor representative , bernd osterloh , said the talks set for monday had been called off because " the current atmosphere was not conducive to a constructive dialog . "
" we were not the ones who had asked for talks and we will not allow volkswagen and individuals in our company to be disparaged just because porsche has no clear strategy , " osterloh said .
friction between the two sides intensified after the porsche and piech families , who control the two carmakers with crossover share holdings , instructed the companies to draft merger plans within the past weeks .
in the negotiations it emerged that the more likely scenario would be that volkswagen would instead end up swallowing porsche .
the economic crisis has changed the equation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the porsche 911 has been the carmaker 's biggest seller over the years in one of germany 's great corporate takeover battles , porsche last year managed to buy a controlling stake in the vastly larger volkswagen .
but the tables were turned this year following the global economic meltdown , which severely hit the auto industry , with porsche looking to volkswagen , europe 's largest automaker , as a knight in shining armor .
ferdinand piech , vw board chairman , underscored porsche 's predicament last monday when he said that the stuttgart-based company was running short of cash .
the head of the porsche works ' council , uwe hueck , said he plans to lead thousands of workers in a protest march this coming monday to demonstrate against what he called piech 's perceived arrogance .
vw 's osterloh remarked it was time for the porsche family " to clearly say what it wants and what it does n't want . "
porsche , in the meantime , along with another german sports car maker , bmw , is apparently exploring the possibility of state loans to shore up the steep drop in demand for its vehicles .

can obama revive the middle east peace process ?
let 's hope he can , say europeans . barack obama vowed to take a different approach to foreign policy , one that would include working closely with allies . at a speech in berlin last summer , then-candidate obama proclaimed that " america has no better partner than europe . "
and european leaders have made it clear they 're counting on obama to push forward the middle east peace process .
obama 's meeting with israel 's prime minister benjamin netanyahu on monday in the white house provides a big chance for obama to live up to his pre-presidential statements on the middle east .
many feel obama , simply by declaring the goal to find a solution for the israeli-palestinian conflict a top priority for his administration , has done more right from the start than both the bush and the clinton administrations .
by naming a special envoy to the region and by stating his support for a so-called two-state solution - that is , the creation of a viable palestinian state next to israel - obama again displayed his commitment to the peace process .
but despite all the early efforts by the obama administration , one important fact remains unchanged : without the support of israel and the palestinians , any push for peace in the region is doomed .
so the big question when obama meets netanyahu is whether the us president can convince the israeli premier , who based on his political past and his recent statements is considered a hardliner , to go along with his vision .
can obama convince netanyahu ?
michael bauer , who heads the project europe and the middle east at munich 's center for applied policy research , puts a damper on hopes for a quick success : " the prospects for a successful resumption of the peace process are not very good at this point . "
bauer lists the international community 's cold reception of the new israeli government , especially its far-right foreign minister avidgor lieberman , the war in gaza which led to a further deterioration of already strained israeli-arab relations , the internal palestinian division between hamas and fatah and the continued israeli settlements as factors that could prove difficult to overcome .
despite those problems , argues nathalie tocci , the measuring stick for obama remains clear : " there is the question first and foremost whether netanyahu will accept the end goal of the road map , which means the acceptance of a two-state solution . "
but as tocci , a senior research fellow at the center for european policy research , is quick to add , merely stating one 's acceptance of common goals is not enough .
" the main issue hindering the accomplishment of progress along the road map was the fact of an absence of an international monitoring presence that could actually monitor the extent to which the obligations by both parties were fulfilled on the ground , " tocci said bauer agrees , saying obama should not rely on rhetoric commitments , but also demand concrete efforts on behalf of the israelis to rebuild confidence , for example by halting the construction of settlements .
europe 's role european leaders voiced their opinions on how obama ought to approach the middle east peace process during his recent visit to the continent .
but other than giving advice , what role can europe really play now that the us has retaken the leadership role ? " the europeans have in many ways played a second part in all the peace negotiations , " says daniel korski , a senior fellow at the european council on foreign relations .
" europeans have in a sense been the paymasters offering the financial incentives for any kind of peace deal .
however , practically they have always been marginalized in part because the israeli government has never been really interested in seeing european governments engaged . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe could play a larger role in peace negotiations but this is changing , korski argues .
first , some europeans are not ready to simply pick up the check again after seeing a lot of their investments go up in smoke in gaza .
and second , there are more pro-israeli leaders in major european capitals than before , providing the chance for europe to engage better with israel .
still , says korski , the question remains unanswered as to what exactly europe 's role could be in the peace process .
europe also has limited influence because it does n't speak with one voice on foreign affairs issues , experts say .
" but that does n't mean that the european union can not play a role , " says bauer .
" maybe it is even good that some member states have better relations with israel and other member states are perceived to be closer to the palestinian side . "
by turning its weakness into an asset , bauer suggests , europe could really act as an honest mediator in the conflict .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : piracy hansa stavanger arrives at kenyan port after piracy ordeal in gulf of aden , piracy scourge continues unabated fighting piracy militarily has mixed success so far international relations -pipe- 18.05.2009 fighting piracy requires better international cooperation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has soldiers participating in anti-piracy missions as an international conference aimed at fighting somali piracy gets underway , concern remains that international efforts are too disjointed to be effective . the results look bleak .
pirate attacks nearly doubled to 102 in the first quarter of this year compared to the same period last year , the international maritime bureau recently reported .
most of the attacks occurred in the gulf of aden and off the eastern coast of somalia , precisely in the area where the international community has sent more than a dozen warships to deter and prevent piracy .
it 's impossible to know how many attacks would have taken place without the presence of navy ships from around the world in the region , experts believe international cooperation needs to be improved to make the fight against piracy more effective .
improving coordination is the aim of a conference in kuala lumpur which gets underway monday and which brings together top maritime experts , diplomats and security officials .
four missions , four commands , one task yet getting everyone on the same page can be a challenge .
bjorn seibert , a research affiliate for security studies at the massachusetts institute of technology , lists the various international missions deployed : " you have the eu 's mission , you have nato 's mission and then you have two combined task forces led by the united states , combined task force 151 and 150 , which operate in the same area with the same task . "
the answer seibert and peter lehr give when asked whether the four missions suffer from a lack of cooperation is clear : " i would say they are hampered at the moment , " argues lehr , a piracy specialist at the university of st. andrews .
he points out that the different missions have different chains of command , different rules of engagement and operate under different domestic laws .
that means that for example dutch or german warships can only apprehend pirates if they pose a threat to their national interests , explains lehr .
" recently a dutch warship arrested pirates and freed yemeni hostages , but then realizing that no national interest was threatened they had to release the pirates , which means they had to bring them on the shore again , letting them actually go back to their pirate ports and then strike again , " says lehr .
" that 's the problem . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes , it 's not clear what to do with pirates when they 're caught a more tragic example of the lack of international cooperation mentioned by both experts happened late last year .
an indian warship sank a thai fishing boat it mistook for a so-called pirate mother ship , killing 15 thai crew members .
" this would be something that under eu rules of engagements would not have been possible , " says lehr .
merging missions the international community has recognized coordination is necessary .
at the beginning of the year the contact group on piracy off the coast of somalia -lrb- cpgsc -rrb- was launched to do exactly that .
while the cpsc is a step forward because it provides a broad framework under the united nations for countries to engage in counter-piracy , it does not provide much help in the concrete fight against pirates taking place every day , the experts say .
instead as a more practical approach , suggests seibert , the europeans should ask themselves whether they really need to participate in four different operations to address the same problem .
the answer could be to merge the eu and nato missions and create one combined structure .
" something like this has been done before in 1992 in bosnia where both the western european union and nato had separate naval forces and they had eventually a unified command " , argues seibert .
" so that 's something that you could look into at least over the long term in somalia too . "
lehr agrees that it is vital to establish one set of rules of engagement under the same chain of command .
" but that 's wishful thinking , that wo n't happen anytime soon , i fear , " he adds and points out that the international community has been faced with the same problem in afghanistan for years .
more air patrols but even if a unified command structure proves to be impossible to implement , there are other measures to bolster the effectiveness of counter-piracy operations , such as increasing the number of airplanes patrolling the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been calls for more air patrols still , given the recent spike in attacks despite the naval missions in the area , do counter-piracy operations stand any realistic chance to stop the pirates ? everybody , especially the navy commanders running the operations , knows that it is impossible to tackle piracy with a naval mission , says lehr . it must be solved on land .
" but you can deny the pirates the long reach they have at the moment .
they are operating from mother ships which give them a reach of up to several hundred nautical miles off their shores .
if you can ferret out these mother ships and either arrest or sink them you will turn this high-sea piracy into coastal piracy again which means it will be less lethal , it will be less of a problem . "

can obama revive the middle east peace process ?
let 's hope he can , say europeans . barack obama vowed to take a different approach to foreign policy , one that would include working closely with allies . at a speech in berlin last summer , then-candidate obama proclaimed that " america has no better partner than europe . "
and european leaders have made it clear they 're counting on obama to push forward the middle east peace process .
obama 's meeting with israel 's prime minister benjamin netanyahu on monday in the white house provides a big chance for obama to live up to his pre-presidential statements on the middle east .
many feel obama , simply by declaring the goal to find a solution for the israeli-palestinian conflict a top priority for his administration , has done more right from the start than both the bush and the clinton administrations .
by naming a special envoy to the region and by stating his support for a so-called two-state solution - that is , the creation of a viable palestinian state next to israel - obama again displayed his commitment to the peace process .
but despite all the early efforts by the obama administration , one important fact remains unchanged : without the support of israel and the palestinians , any push for peace in the region is doomed .
so the big question when obama meets netanyahu is whether the us president can convince the israeli premier , who based on his political past and his recent statements is considered a hardliner , to go along with his vision .
can obama convince netanyahu ?
michael bauer , who heads the project europe and the middle east at munich 's center for applied policy research , puts a damper on hopes for a quick success : " the prospects for a successful resumption of the peace process are not very good at this point . "
bauer lists the international community 's cold reception of the new israeli government , especially its far-right foreign minister avidgor lieberman , the war in gaza which led to a further deterioration of already strained israeli-arab relations , the internal palestinian division between hamas and fatah and the continued israeli settlements as factors that could prove difficult to overcome .
despite those problems , argues nathalie tocci , the measuring stick for obama remains clear : " there is the question first and foremost whether netanyahu will accept the end goal of the road map , which means the acceptance of a two-state solution . "
but as tocci , a senior research fellow at the center for european policy research , is quick to add , merely stating one 's acceptance of common goals is not enough .
" the main issue hindering the accomplishment of progress along the road map was the fact of an absence of an international monitoring presence that could actually monitor the extent to which the obligations by both parties were fulfilled on the ground , " tocci said bauer agrees , saying obama should not rely on rhetoric commitments , but also demand concrete efforts on behalf of the israelis to rebuild confidence , for example by halting the construction of settlements .
europe 's role european leaders voiced their opinions on how obama ought to approach the middle east peace process during his recent visit to the continent .
but other than giving advice , what role can europe really play now that the us has retaken the leadership role ? " the europeans have in many ways played a second part in all the peace negotiations , " says daniel korski , a senior fellow at the european council on foreign relations .
" europeans have in a sense been the paymasters offering the financial incentives for any kind of peace deal .
however , practically they have always been marginalized in part because the israeli government has never been really interested in seeing european governments engaged . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe could play a larger role in peace negotiations but this is changing , korski argues .
first , some europeans are not ready to simply pick up the check again after seeing a lot of their investments go up in smoke in gaza .
and second , there are more pro-israeli leaders in major european capitals than before , providing the chance for europe to engage better with israel .
still , says korski , the question remains unanswered as to what exactly europe 's role could be in the peace process .
europe also has limited influence because it does n't speak with one voice on foreign affairs issues , experts say .
" but that does n't mean that the european union can not play a role , " says bauer .
" maybe it is even good that some member states have better relations with israel and other member states are perceived to be closer to the palestinian side . "
by turning its weakness into an asset , bauer suggests , europe could really act as an honest mediator in the conflict .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 18.05.2009 exhibition highlights works of german composers in nazi era großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibition shows various publications from the nazi era on bach and his music germany is marking the 200th birthday of composer felix mendelssohn , an important figure in the revival of the music of bach , with a first ever exhibition focusing on how the nazis treated the two artists . called " blood and spirit - bach , mendelssohn and their music in the third reich , " a controversial exhibition opened on friday at the bachhaus in the eastern city of eisenach , the birthplace of johann sebastian bach -lrb- 1685-1750 -rrb- .
the show uses photographs , documents , books , instruments and detailed explanations to show how vastly different the two musical icons were treated by the nazis and how their works were manipulated and distorted .
museum director joerg hansen said hitler 's reception of the two composers offers an " important lesson " about the nazi rhetoric of " german superiority " and " jewish threat . "
mendelssohn denigrated by the nazis mendelssohn -lrb- 1809-1847 -rrb- , born to an illustrious jewish family in hamburg , sharply divided opinion in the music world .
during his lifetime he was considered a musical genius by some while others found his style too conservative .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mendelssohn is considered one of the most important composers of the romantic period but mendelssohn is largely credited for playing a pivotal role in the revival of interest in the music of bach , which had largely been forgotten around that time .
just a century later , the tables had turned - when hitler came to power in 1933 , the nazi regime cited mendelssohn 's jewish origin as a reason to ban performance and publication of his works .
once the co-founder of the new bach society in leipzig , mendelssohn was denigrated by nazi musicologists as having contributed to the " effeminacy " of german music in the 19th century .
the show documents how the nazis in 1936 removed a statue of mendelssohn erected in leipzig in 1892 and his works from all the important concert halls in the country .
it also touches on the 1938 duesseldorf exhibition " degenerate music . "
bach the most " german of all germans " bach , on the other hand , was celebrated by the nazis as a " northern " musical artist .
his music was played during nazi party conferences and the texts to his works were tweaked to suit the party 's propaganda .
a special unit set up by the regime to rework music ensured that bach 's music was " purified of jewish references . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : johann sebastian bach is widely considered one of the greatest composers in the western tradition museum director hansen said adolf hitler and his propaganda minister joseph goebbels publicly paid homage to bach as the " most german of all german composers " while mendelssohn the " jew " was considered a dangerous " accident " in music history .
one of the exhibits in eisenach includes a choral piece by bach which was reworded to be the battle song of the hitler youth movement .
another photograph shows the leipzig thomas choir which joined the movement in 1937 .
the exhibition spans the period from 1829 , when the then 21-year-old mendelssohn performed bach 's st. matthew passion at the berlin singakademie , to the persecution and death of jewish artists in nazi concentration camps .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view of the bachhaus in eisenach in the state of thuringia , the birthplace of bach the success of mendelssohn 's berlin performance , the first since bach 's death in 1750 , was an important element in the renaissance of bach 's music in germany and , eventually , throughout europe .
it earned mendelssohn widespread acclaim .
hansen said the exhibition remained a controversial one because it touched on a difficult chapter of history .
as a result , the museum director said it can not be shown in the eastern city of leipzig - an important city where both bach and mendelssohn spent important and productive parts of their careers and where bach is a larger-than-life figure .

the show uses photographs , documents , books , instruments and detailed explanations to show how vastly different the two musical icons were treated by the nazis and how their works were manipulated and distorted .
museum director joerg hansen said hitler 's reception of the two composers offers an " important lesson " about the nazi rhetoric of " german superiority " and " jewish threat . "
mendelssohn denigrated by the nazis mendelssohn -lrb- 1809-1847 -rrb- , born to an illustrious jewish family in hamburg , sharply divided opinion in the music world .
during his lifetime he was considered a musical genius by some while others found his style too conservative .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mendelssohn is considered one of the most important composers of the romantic period but mendelssohn is largely credited for playing a pivotal role in the revival of interest in the music of bach , which had largely been forgotten around that time .
just a century later , the tables had turned - when hitler came to power in 1933 , the nazi regime cited mendelssohn 's jewish origin as a reason to ban performance and publication of his works .
once the co-founder of the new bach society in leipzig , mendelssohn was denigrated by nazi musicologists as having contributed to the " effeminacy " of german music in the 19th century .
the show documents how the nazis in 1936 removed a statue of mendelssohn erected in leipzig in 1892 and his works from all the important concert halls in the country .
it also touches on the 1938 duesseldorf exhibition " degenerate music . "
bach the most " german of all germans " bach , on the other hand , was celebrated by the nazis as a " northern " musical artist .
his music was played during nazi party conferences and the texts to his works were tweaked to suit the party 's propaganda .
a special unit set up by the regime to rework music ensured that bach 's music was " purified of jewish references . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : johann sebastian bach is widely considered one of the greatest composers in the western tradition museum director hansen said adolf hitler and his propaganda minister joseph goebbels publicly paid homage to bach as the " most german of all german composers " while mendelssohn the " jew " was considered a dangerous " accident " in music history .
one of the exhibits in eisenach includes a choral piece by bach which was reworded to be the battle song of the hitler youth movement .
another photograph shows the leipzig thomas choir which joined the movement in 1937 .
the exhibition spans the period from 1829 , when the then 21-year-old mendelssohn performed bach 's st. matthew passion at the berlin singakademie , to the persecution and death of jewish artists in nazi concentration camps .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view of the bachhaus in eisenach in the state of thuringia , the birthplace of bach the success of mendelssohn 's berlin performance , the first since bach 's death in 1750 , was an important element in the renaissance of bach 's music in germany and , eventually , throughout europe .
it earned mendelssohn widespread acclaim .
hansen said the exhibition remained a controversial one because it touched on a difficult chapter of history .
as a result , the museum director said it can not be shown in the eastern city of leipzig - an important city where both bach and mendelssohn spent important and productive parts of their careers and where bach is a larger-than-life figure .

about 100 employees demonstrated in support of hilgert outside the bank in dusseldorf as members of the state-owned bank 's supervisory board arrived for an evening meeting .
westlb later announced that hilgert 's deputy dietrich voigtländer would initially take over .
hilgert had taken charge a year ago after a purge of the previous management .
westlb , which was hit hard by the global financial crisis , is mainly owned by regional savings banks as well as the state of north-rhine westphalia .
in recent months the savings banks had objected to providing further financial guarantees for westlb .

according to the first-ever poverty atlas released by der paritaetische , one of the big five social welfare organizations in germany , the level of poverty in some eastern parts of the country is up to four times higher than in the south .
the atlas , released on monday in berlin , shows that the german region of western pomerania leads the nation when it comes to poverty , with more than one in four people there living at or below the poverty line .
on the opposite end of the spectrum - as well as the opposite end of the country - the region of schwarzwald-baar-heuberg has a poverty rate of 7.4 percent .
call for countermeasures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schneider is calling for unemployment benefits to be raised speaking at a press conference , association head ulrich schneider criticized the growing regional and social divisions within the country .
many regions , especially those in the east , could easily become dependent on the state to survive , he said , calling for rapid and systematic countermeasures .
those measures include raising long-term unemployment benefits from 351 euros -lrb- $ 474 -rrb- a month to 440 euros as well as doing a better job of applying the economic stimulus package to the regions that really need it .
such an increase would cost up to 10 billion euros per year .
the definition of ' poor ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 14.3 percent of germans are said to live below the poverty line of course , the atlas begs the question : what does poor actually mean ?
in germany , the term applies to anyone who earns less than 60 percent of the average national wage .
for singles that 's 764 euros -lrb- $ 1,031 -rrb- per month , and for couples without children it 's 1,376 euros .
it comes as no surprise that the regions the atlas shows as having the highest poverty rate also have the highest level of unemployment .
the poverty rate overall in germany is 14.3 percent , with the average in the west of the country being 12.9 percent , 6.6 percent lower than in the east . that corresponds with data provided by the german statistics office , which says that as of january of this year , unemployment was 13.9 percent in the east and 6.9 percent in the west . dividing up the wealth at the unveiling , schneider that new measures to fight poverty should n't include programs like the scrapping bonus .
the 2,500-euro bonus goes to people who have their old cars scrapped and buy a new car .
it 's meant to help the ailing auto industry through the financial crisis .
schneider said a third of the federal funds dedicated to economic stimulus measures , which amount to 10 billion euros , are going to the three states with the lowest poverty levels : bavaria , hesse and baden-wuerttemberg. mrm / dpa / reuters / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

start , one of the largest and most complex arms control treaties , was signed in 1991 , and expires in december of 2009 .
both washington and moscow have indicated that the political will exists to overcome disagreements on the size , nature and purpose of their nuclear arsenals and strategic weapons .
" there are good chances for bringing our positions closer and for working out agreements , " russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said last week after a meeting with us secretary of state hillary clinton in washington .
seeking a replacement for start the us delegation is headed by assistant secretary of state rose gottemoeller . anatoly antonov , head of the foreign ministry department for security and disarmament , leads the russian delegation .

the white house said in a statement that the meeting will allow the us and russia an opportunity " to deepen engagement on reducing nuclear weapons , cooperating on non-proliferation , exploring ways to cooperate on missile defense , addressing mutual threats and security challenges . "
disarmament process began at the height of the cold war both sides have come to the conclusion that military deterrence is as effective with less warheads on either side , and have agreed to make cuts in the number of warheads they have deployed to around 1,000 to 1,500 each .
other issues include whether the treaty should cover delivery systems like bombers and missiles , verification procedures and information sharing .
the us and russia both have an interest in ensuring the talks conclude with results .
" in support of its arms control interests and interest in strategic stability more generally , the united states should pursue a much broader and more ambitious set of strategic dialogues , " said former us defense secretary william perry , who is now part of the congressional commission on the strategic posture of the united states .
fjodor lukjanov , editor in chief of the moscow magazine russia in world politics , says a new start treaty is eminently important for russia .

generally seen as a tough and competent leader by the electorate , merkel is also often perceived as cool and lacking in charisma .
merkel saw this as an opportunity to connect with voters on a personal level .
in the berlin studio of commercial broadcaster rtl , merkel met with 100 guests and answered questions ranging from how she planned to balance the budget without increasing taxes to what she likes to cook in her free time .
the town hall meeting is a departure from typical german political campaigns , which rarely focus on a candidate 's personality and private life .
merkel 's appearance was seen by many in germany as obama-esque .
us president barack obama is known for his charm and held a town hall meeting while in strasbourg , france , at the beginning of april for a nato summit .
a kinder , gentler chancellor this election year merkel 's party , the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , seems to be pushing a softer merkel and is banking on her popularity .
the chancellor is doing better in opinion polls than the cdu itself .
as the global economy crumbles , merkel must convince voters that she and her traditionally pro-business party understand the everyday concerns that trouble ordinary germans .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's advice to the unemployed ?
train for a career the german economy is facing its deepest recession since world war ii and some 300,000 jobs have been lost since last september when the us investment bank lehman brothers collapsed .
despite the difficult situation , merkel was optimistic .
" we 've probably just about reached the low point , " she said of the ongoing recession .
and a potential increase in the sales tax was an " absolute no . "
merkel also doled out some practical advice during the evening .
when an unemployed 21 year old complained that the employment office could n't give him appointment for two months , merkel agreed that should n't be the case .
but then she asked what he had trained to do .
when the young man answered , " nothing " , she encouraged him to take advantage of his free time .
" do everything you can to train for a career , " she advised .
let 's get personal participants in the forum wanted to know how merkel stayed connected with the lives of germany 's citizens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel relaxes by cooking or traveling with her husband her husband , chemistry professor joachin sauer , keeps her grounded , she said .
" i have to fold my own clothes at home and fill the washing machine , " she said .
she shops for food at normal grocery stores , she said , adding that she likes to cook on the weekends .
" i make a pretty good potato soup , " she said , and her guests say they love her stuffed beef roll .
" i do n't think they 're just telling me what i want to hear , " she said .
the chancellor also spoke openly about the importance of her faith in god .
she believes god looks over and protects humanity , and " that gives me strength , " she said. hf / dpa / reuters editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the centre for policy studies document called labour 's £ 1.5bn-a-year anti-drugs policy an " expensive failure " .
it said the uk 's policy of spending most of its drug budget on treatment was less effective than spending more on prevention and enforcement .
the home office said the report " inaccurately portrays the impact of the government 's drug strategy " .
according to author kathy gyngell , spending on methadone increased threefold between 2003 and 2008 , as the government switched focus from combating illegal drug use to dealing with addicts .
she argued that this " harm-reduction approach " had failed , instead leaving 147,000 people in " state-sponsored " addiction .
the author also said class a consumption and " problem drug use " had " risen dramatically " during the past 10 years , with drug use spreading to rural areas and the age of children 's initiation into drugs falling . "

the report 's author said the uk 's drug policy should bear down on the illicit use of all drugs and feature a tougher enforcement programme to reduce the supply of drugs .
" labour 's war on drugs has not , despite the rhetoric to the contrary , been fought .
it has been a phoney war - and an expensive failure , " she said .
" while the uk spends the majority of its drug budget on its so-called treatment programmes , both the netherlands and sweden spend most of their drugs budget on prevention and enforcement .
drug seizures " their drugs problems are a half and a third of the size of the uk respectively . "
her comments come just days after soca said at least 5,000 criminals were now in the sights of the agency after a 75 % rise in operations .
of the 287 cases that reached court , 266 - or 93 % - ended in a conviction , according to the agency 's annual report .
the home office rejected the claims made in the think tank 's report .
a spokesman said overall drug use was at its " lowest level " since measurements began .
" record numbers are entering and staying in treatment and recorded acquisitive crime - to which drug related crime makes a significant contribution - has fallen by 28 % since the introduction of the drug interventions programme , " he said .
the spokesman also referred to figures showing that , in 2007/08 , police and hm revenue and customs made 216,792 seizures of drugs in england and wales - an increase of 17 % since 2006/07 and the highest since records began in 1973 .

the centre for policy studies document called labour 's £ 1.5bn-a-year anti-drugs policy an " expensive failure " .
it said the uk 's policy of spending most of its drug budget on treatment was less effective than spending more on prevention and enforcement .
the home office said the report " inaccurately portrays the impact of the government 's drug strategy " .
according to author kathy gyngell , spending on methadone increased threefold between 2003 and 2008 , as the government switched focus from combating illegal drug use to dealing with addicts .
she argued that this " harm-reduction approach " had failed , instead leaving 147,000 people in " state-sponsored " addiction .
the author also said class a consumption and " problem drug use " had " risen dramatically " during the past 10 years , with drug use spreading to rural areas and the age of children 's initiation into drugs falling .
labour 's war on drugs has not , despite the rhetoric to the contrary , been fought kathy gyngell centre for policy studies the report for the right-wing think tank claims more than 10 % of 11-year-olds have taken drugs , while 41 % of 15-year-olds had done so .
turning her attention to the serious organised crime agency -lrb- soca -rrb- , ms gyngell said the agency - which was set up in 2006 - had been a " failure " in its bid to tackle the drugs trade in the uk .
the report 's author said the uk 's drug policy should bear down on the illicit use of all drugs and feature a tougher enforcement programme to reduce the supply of drugs .
" labour 's war on drugs has not , despite the rhetoric to the contrary , been fought .
it has been a phoney war - and an expensive failure , " she said .
" while the uk spends the majority of its drug budget on its so-called treatment programmes , both the netherlands and sweden spend most of their drugs budget on prevention and enforcement .
drug seizures " their drugs problems are a half and a third of the size of the uk respectively . "
her comments come just days after soca said at least 5,000 criminals were now in the sights of the agency after a 75 % rise in operations .
of the 287 cases that reached court , 266 - or 93 % - ended in a conviction , according to the agency 's annual report .
the home office rejected the claims made in the think tank 's report .
a spokesman said overall drug use was at its " lowest level " since measurements began .
" record numbers are entering and staying in treatment and recorded acquisitive crime - to which drug related crime makes a significant contribution - has fallen by 28 % since the introduction of the drug interventions programme , " he said .
the spokesman also referred to figures showing that , in 2007/08 , police and hm revenue and customs made 216,792 seizures of drugs in england and wales - an increase of 17 % since 2006/07 and the highest since records began in 1973 .

the government 's battle against uk drug use has been condemned as a " phoney war " in a report by a think tank .
the centre for policy studies document called labour 's £ 1.5bn-a-year anti-drugs policy an " expensive failure " .
it said the uk 's policy of spending most of its drug budget on treatment was less effective than spending more on prevention and enforcement .
the home office said the report " inaccurately portrays the impact of the government 's drug strategy " .
according to author kathy gyngell , spending on methadone increased threefold between 2003 and 2008 , as the government switched focus from combating illegal drug use to dealing with addicts .
she argued that this " harm-reduction approach " had failed , instead leaving 147,000 people in " state-sponsored " addiction .
the author also said class a consumption and " problem drug use " had " risen dramatically " during the past 10 years , with drug use spreading to rural areas and the age of children 's initiation into drugs falling .

the report 's author said the uk 's drug policy should bear down on the illicit use of all drugs and feature a tougher enforcement programme to reduce the supply of drugs .
" labour 's war on drugs has not , despite the rhetoric to the contrary , been fought .
it has been a phoney war - and an expensive failure , " she said .
" while the uk spends the majority of its drug budget on its so-called treatment programmes , both the netherlands and sweden spend most of their drugs budget on prevention and enforcement .
drug seizures " their drugs problems are a half and a third of the size of the uk respectively . "
her comments come just days after soca said at least 5,000 criminals were now in the sights of the agency after a 75 % rise in operations .
of the 287 cases that reached court , 266 - or 93 % - ended in a conviction , according to the agency 's annual report .
the home office rejected the claims made in the think tank 's report .
a spokesman said overall drug use was at its " lowest level " since measurements began .
" record numbers are entering and staying in treatment and recorded acquisitive crime - to which drug related crime makes a significant contribution - has fallen by 28 % since the introduction of the drug interventions programme , " he said .
the spokesman also referred to figures showing that , in 2007/08 , police and hm revenue and customs made 216,792 seizures of drugs in england and wales - an increase of 17 % since 2006/07 and the highest since records began in 1973 .

the government 's battle against uk drug use has been condemned as a " phoney war " in a report by a think tank .
the centre for policy studies document called labour 's £ 1.5bn-a-year anti-drugs policy an " expensive failure " .
it said the uk 's policy of spending most of its drug budget on treatment was less effective than spending more on prevention and enforcement .
the home office said the report " inaccurately portrays the impact of the government 's drug strategy " .
according to author kathy gyngell , spending on methadone increased threefold between 2003 and 2008 , as the government switched focus from combating illegal drug use to dealing with addicts .
she argued that this " harm-reduction approach " had failed , instead leaving 147,000 people in " state-sponsored " addiction .
the author also said class a consumption and " problem drug use " had " risen dramatically " during the past 10 years , with drug use spreading to rural areas and the age of children 's initiation into drugs falling .
labour 's war on drugs has not , despite the rhetoric to the contrary , been fought kathy gyngell centre for policy studies the report for the right-wing think tank claims more than 10 % of 11-year-olds have taken drugs , while 41 % of 15-year-olds had done so .
turning her attention to the serious organised crime agency -lrb- soca -rrb- , ms gyngell said the agency - which was set up in 2006 - had been a " failure " in its bid to tackle the drugs trade in the uk .
the report 's author said the uk 's drug policy should bear down on the illicit use of all drugs and feature a tougher enforcement programme to reduce the supply of drugs .
" labour 's war on drugs has not , despite the rhetoric to the contrary , been fought .
it has been a phoney war - and an expensive failure , " she said .
" while the uk spends the majority of its drug budget on its so-called treatment programmes , both the netherlands and sweden spend most of their drugs budget on prevention and enforcement .
drug seizures " their drugs problems are a half and a third of the size of the uk respectively . "
her comments come just days after soca said at least 5,000 criminals were now in the sights of the agency after a 75 % rise in operations .
of the 287 cases that reached court , 266 - or 93 % - ended in a conviction , according to the agency 's annual report .
the home office rejected the claims made in the think tank 's report .
a spokesman said overall drug use was at its " lowest level " since measurements began .
" record numbers are entering and staying in treatment and recorded acquisitive crime - to which drug related crime makes a significant contribution - has fallen by 28 % since the introduction of the drug interventions programme , " he said .
the spokesman also referred to figures showing that , in 2007/08 , police and hm revenue and customs made 216,792 seizures of drugs in england and wales - an increase of 17 % since 2006/07 and the highest since records began in 1973 .

for julie hayward , the news has brought back memories of her historic court victory 21 years ago when she took on her employers in what was seen at the time as the first significant challenge under the equal pay act .
in 1988 , her name was headline news - and not just in the uk .
she even made it onto the front pages of the chinese daily newspapers .
julie had just won a landmark legal victory for the right for women to equal pay .
her case took 10 years and £ 50,000 of public money to prove , but eventually after three industrial tribunals , she won an appeal at the house of lords .
" it was my andy warhol 15 minutes of fame , " she says .
margaret thatcher was in charge at number 10 when julie - a shipyard cook from birkenhead - won her historic case .
her union , the gmb , was triumphant , claiming her victory would open the floodgates to up to one million similar claims from low-paid women .
but the anticipated number of claims never materialised , although the tuc says her case " clarified the legal position for other claimants " .
for julie , it was " never about the money .
it was the principle that drove me on " .
her case centred on the fact that although she was working in a kitchen , the level of training required and the skills and demands made upon her were equivalent to many of her male colleagues in the shipyard .
the case was the first to accept the principle of equal pay for work of equal value - after the government was forced to amend the equal pay act in 1984 to bring the uk into line with the rest of the then european economic community .
stretch limo the case pushed julie reluctantly into the public eye .
she was heralded as a champion of women 's rights .
pursued by press photographers whenever she set foot outside the house , she was forced to move home briefly .
her local chip shop - run by the chinese community - produced newspapers from china with her name on the front pages .
and she was even wooed with the prospect of a stretch limo and a night at a posh hotel to appear on terry wogan 's nightly tv chat show - an invitation she turned down flat .
" this was never about me being something i 'm not , " she said .
" as soon as people found out my name at the time , they were like , ' oh you 're julie hayward ' thank you ...
they never let me get beyond that .
" and i felt if i did n't perform how people expected me to perform , i 'd be letting them down . "
anonymous julie had left school at 16 with no qualifications and limited prospects .
but buoyed by her court victory and new-found confidence , she decided to abandon the shipyard canteen for a career in youth work .
determined to go somewhere she could live a more anonymous existence , she moved to london , where she ran a successful drop-in project for young people in bromley .
from there , she moved to bexley where she is now running a £ 3m annual budget as head of the council 's youth service , dealing every day with young people 's issues from drugs to knives , teenage pregnancy and racism .
" i think i 'm very , very lucky to be doing this and sharing my passion , if you like , with people .
i like to think i do give aspiration to others , not only young women ... to people who might have had poor education , and say you can do it , you can get there .
" one of the things i learned from my shipyard experiences , being outside on the picket line and collective action sometimes works , but not always these days .
" the power of the pen is much mightier and i think that one of the reasons i 've gone into management is that i can influence and make changes and differences from within . "
the gender pay gap has narrowed since the late 1980s , when it was above 30 % , but it is still running at 23 % - if you include the average salaries of full and part-time workers .
julie remains optimistic : " it did have an impact at the time , but the glass ceiling still exists for women .
" we will continue .
people have a greater understanding of equality now , not just for women , but for all people .
" not everything 's right , but things do change and little things make a difference . "

for julie hayward , the news has brought back memories of her historic court victory 21 years ago when she took on her employers in what was seen at the time as the first significant challenge under the equal pay act .
in 1988 , her name was headline news - and not just in the uk .
she even made it onto the front pages of the chinese daily newspapers .
julie had just won a landmark legal victory for the right for women to equal pay .
her case took 10 years and £ 50,000 of public money to prove , but eventually after three industrial tribunals , she won an appeal at the house of lords .
" it was my andy warhol 15 minutes of fame , " she says .
margaret thatcher was in charge at number 10 when julie - a shipyard cook from birkenhead - won her historic case .
her union , the gmb , was triumphant , claiming her victory would open the floodgates to up to one million similar claims from low-paid women .
but the anticipated number of claims never materialised , although the tuc says her case " clarified the legal position for other claimants " .
for julie , it was " never about the money .
it was the principle that drove me on " .

click here to download the flash plugin from the macromedia website her case centred on the fact that although she was working in a kitchen , the level of training required and the skills and demands made upon her were equivalent to many of her male colleagues in the shipyard .
the case was the first to accept the principle of equal pay for work of equal value - after the government was forced to amend the equal pay act in 1984 to bring the uk into line with the rest of the then european economic community .
stretch limo the case pushed julie reluctantly into the public eye .
she was heralded as a champion of women 's rights .
pursued by press photographers whenever she set foot outside the house , she was forced to move home briefly .

julie 's fight for equal pay was filmed for newsnight in 1984 her local chip shop - run by the chinese community - produced newspapers from china with her name on the front pages .
and she was even wooed with the prospect of a stretch limo and a night at a posh hotel to appear on terry wogan 's nightly tv chat show - an invitation she turned down flat .
" this was never about me being something i 'm not , " she said .
" as soon as people found out my name at the time , they were like , ' oh you 're julie hayward ' thank you ...
they never let me get beyond that .
" and i felt if i did n't perform how people expected me to perform , i 'd be letting them down . "
anonymous julie had left school at 16 with no qualifications and limited prospects .
but buoyed by her court victory and new-found confidence , she decided to abandon the shipyard canteen for a career in youth work .
determined to go somewhere she could live a more anonymous existence , she moved to london , where she ran a successful drop-in project for young people in bromley .
from there , she moved to bexley where she is now running a £ 3m annual budget as head of the council 's youth service , dealing every day with young people 's issues from drugs to knives , teenage pregnancy and racism .

both have begun taking applications , with a closing date of 18 september .
usually about 15,000 pupils sit the official test , but it 's not known how this new system will affect numbers .
pupils will receive their results in the first week of next february .
some parents are likely to enter their children for both types of exam , but the fee of £ 35 being charged by one group , the association for quality education -lrb- aqe -rrb- , may put some people off .
the aqe says pupils receiving free school meals will not be charged but they admit that some hard-up families entitled to that benefit do not claim it .
the post-primary transfer consortium , which is made up mostly of catholic grammar schools , will not charge a fee to parents .
both organisations say their tests are based on english and maths being taught in primary schools and say no coaching should be needed .
however , many primary schools are already running extra lessons for pupils who will be sitting the tests in november and december .
application forms can be downloaded from school websites , requested by post or collected on grammar school open nights .

although the two sets of tests will have different styles and content , the organisations running them have agreed on a joint timetable .
both have begun taking applications , with a closing date of 18 september .
usually about 15,000 pupils sit the official test , but it 's not known how this new system will affect numbers .
pupils will receive their results in the first week of next february .
some parents are likely to enter their children for both types of exam , but the fee of £ 35 being charged by one group , the association for quality education -lrb- aqe -rrb- , may put some people off .
the aqe says pupils receiving free school meals will not be charged but they admit that some hard-up families entitled to that benefit do not claim it .
the post-primary transfer consortium , which is made up mostly of catholic grammar schools , will not charge a fee to parents .
both organisations say their tests are based on english and maths being taught in primary schools and say no coaching should be needed .
however , many primary schools are already running extra lessons for pupils who will be sitting the tests in november and december .
application forms can be downloaded from school websites , requested by post or collected on grammar school open nights .
