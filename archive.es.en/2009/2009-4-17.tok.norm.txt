mitchell stressed the white house 's commitment to palestinian statehood . mitchell said president barack obama regarded establishing a sovereign , independent palestinian state as being in the " national interest " of the us .
he also warned that peace talks would not move forward unless israel 's new government cooperated in efforts to forge a two-state solution .
" a two-state solution is the only solution , " mitchell said after his talks with the palestinian president .
" this conflict has gone on for far too long .
the people of this region should no longer have to wait for the just peace , " he told reporters , as he wrapped up his first visit to the region since the new israeli government of hardline conservative prime minister benjamin netanyahu was sworn in .

" we have been through a dark and painful chapter in our history , " obama said in a statement .
" but at a time of great challenges and disturbing disunity , nothing will be gained by spending our time and energy laying blame for the past . "
the white house also released several memos drafted under the bush administration that provided legal justification for the harsh interrogation methods .
techniques outlined in the memos include sleep deprivation , slamming detainees into walls , stripping them naked , and submitting them to waterboarding , a technique used to simulate drowning that human rights groups say amounts to torture .
the cia had previously acknowledged the waterboarding of three terrorism suspects , including khalid sheikh mohammed , the alleged mastermind of the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks .
obama emphasized that , in one of his first acts as president , he had already prohibited the use of such techniques , saying they " undermine our moral authority , and do not make us safer . "
but as he released these memos , obama said he wished to " assure those who carried out their duties relying in good faith upon legal advice from the department of justice that they will not be subject to prosecution . "
civil rights group aclu welcomed the release but said it still wanted an independent prosecutor to investigate allegations of torture during the bush administration .

the plan could mean hundreds of thousands of moldovans having the right to settle in the eu . romanian president traian basescu told the romanian parliament on wednesday that he would fast-track moldovans for romanian citizenship following riots in the moldovan capital chisinau against election results which led to the victory of the communist party . he also proposed that moldovans with a romanian great-grandparent should in future have the right to citizenship . currently , an estimated 120,000 moldovans have romanian citizenship , which is available to moldovans with a romanian grandparent .
sixty percent of moldova 's 4.4 million people are thought to have romanian origins .
moldova was part of romania until 1940 when it was taken over by the soviet union .
after the break-up of the soviet union it became an independent state , but it remains one of the poorest countries in europe , with an average annual income of $ 1,830 in 2008 .
tension have been increasing between romania and moldova since the election on april 5 .
the communists won almost 50 percent of the vote , and the opposition has accused the authorities of cheating .
the parliament building in chisinau was set on fire during protests , and protesters were beaten and severely injured .
one man died .
the moldovan government accuses the romanians of being behind the protests and , in response , has imposed visa restrictions on romanians . on friday , an eu commission spokesman said in brussels that the eu condemned the violence , and were concerned at the reports of excesses by the security forces .
but he said he would have to wait until real decisions had been made on the nationality issue before issuing an official response .
however , the czech presidency of the bloc publicly rebuked romania after a meeting between czech eu minister alexandr vondra and romanian foreign minister cristian diaconescu .
vondra said , according the website euobserver.com , " i told my romanian colleague about our serious concerns of the possible risks arising from adopting simplified procedures for romanian citizenship . " the website quoted an unnamed eu official as describing the plans as " frightening .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 17.04.2009 major german online companies agree to block child porn websites großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's family minister warns all child porn sites will be blocked on the internet german internet providers have grudgingly agreed to block websites containing child pornography .
critics say their deal with the government wo n't make much of a difference . five of germany 's eight major internet service providers - deutsche telekom 's t-online , vodafone 's arcor , kabel deutschland , telefonica 's o2 and alice 's hansenet - signed the legally binding agreement with the government and the federal crime office on friday , agreeing to install software to block consumer access to child pornography sites .
the five companies together cover around 75 percent of the german market .
in future , due to the software blocks installed by the internet service providers , consumers attempting to click on blacklisted websites are to be automatically redirected to a red stop sign .
the federal crime office has compiled the blacklist of 1,000 sites , which it updates daily .
the online companies have six months to reprogram thousands of servers and install the page blockers .
the government expects that , once these are in place , up to 450,000 attempts to access child pornography sites will be blocked daily .
german family minister ursula von der leyen proposed the law obliging isps to block child porn sites .
it is modeled on similar action taken years ago in scandinavia , britain and italy .
" if these countries can overcome any legal and technical issues and successfully fight child porn online , we can do the same in germany , " von der leyen said when she first presented the new measures .
" we do n't want to tolerate the rape of children , even babies , being widely available in germany , " she added .
the law is also intended to make it harder for criminals to profit from distributing banned pedophile material .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is what child porn surfers will soon see pop up on their computer screen not all on board , yet notably absent in the agreement are 1 & 1 , freenet and other internet providers who service the remaining 25 percent of the german market .
they say they do not want to take the risk of breaching the telecommunications secrecy law by blocking child pornography sites .
they also argue that they only provide the technical capacity to distribute information and are not responsible for content that flows through their networks .
limiting access to information is a sensitive subject in germany because of its nazi past and east german communist rule , but von der leyen said protecting children was the priority .
" the vulnerability and dignity of children is more important than mass communication , " the family minister said .
the german cabinet is expected to announce changes to the telecommunications law by summer that would force the remaining internet providers to block child porn sites .
no reason to believe child porn consumption is going down the notion that pedophiles are shadowy figures who consume child pornography at midnight is long since defunct .
in an embarrassing admission a few weeks , a social democrat lawmaker , joerg tauss , admitted that he possessed child porn .
he denied that he was a pedophile or doing anything wrong , saying he had collected the material for research .
as a lawmaker , he ought to know that laws also govern the " research " of child pornography websites . there 's no reliable information on the extent of child pornography , but the german government says access to video and other images of child pornography on the internet more than doubled from 2006 to 2007 .
there has also been an increase in the amount of violence against small children they show .
the size of those child porn rings that are exposed is , however , some indication of the scope of the problem .
on thursday , german police announced they had smashed a global ring of around 9,000 suspected pedophiles in 92 countries .
pornographic images of children were transmitted from more than 1,000 connections in germany to 8,000 ip addresses in countries including the united states , canada , new zealand , austria and switzerland .
the footage included " images of the most serious sexual abuse , even of toddlers , ” police said in a statement .
child porn users bypass " obvious " areas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : child pornography is often distributed via dvds not the internet critics say the new law is practically useless , because companies abroad can easily bypass the software block .
according to german computer magazine ct , a 27-second online video is already circulating showing how the block can be circumvented . only the " naive internet user " might possibly be stopped from accessing prohibited material , the magazine wrote .
" most child pornography material is available through private forums , like exchange sites , newsgroups , chat rooms , free areas of usenet and e-mail distribution lists , " says udo vetter , a lawyer who often represents people charged with possession of child pornography .
in an interview with ct , vetter said " many simply receive the videos on dvd via the mail , " adding that he doubted a major child pornography industry even exists .
vetter estimated that 98 percent of such images have been around for years and that the quality of most new material that surfaces seems to have been made by private individuals in a domestic setting .
others criticize the government deal with the isps as being too short-sighted .
" blocking internet pages containing child pornography is only one step towards preventing the abuse of children and only reaches " the lower echelons " of pedophiles , says legal expert axel stahl , head of the association of federal judges and prosecutors in the state of north rhine-westphalia .
stahl warned against excessively high expectations , saying that foreign companies that produce child pornography will surely find ways to bypass the new technical limitations . scarcity can actually increase demand " the new rules mean gaining access to child pornography will become more difficult , but it wo n't stop material from being published , " says otto vollmers , who represents fsm , a german industry organization that advocates voluntary self-control of the internet .
" making access technically more difficult can actually arouse greater interest . "
however , similar measures in other countries suggest that blocks so work .
" between 15,000 and 50,000 access attempts are blocked in norway and sweden every day , " said friedemann schindler of the german youth protection initiative jugendschutz.de.

critics say their deal with the government wo n't make much of a difference . five of germany 's eight major internet service providers - deutsche telekom 's t-online , vodafone 's arcor , kabel deutschland , telefonica 's o2 and alice 's hansenet - signed the legally binding agreement with the government and the federal crime office on friday , agreeing to install software to block consumer access to child pornography sites .
the five companies together cover around 75 percent of the german market .
in future , due to the software blocks installed by the internet service providers , consumers attempting to click on blacklisted websites are to be automatically redirected to a red stop sign .
the federal crime office has compiled the blacklist of 1,000 sites , which it updates daily .
the online companies have six months to reprogram thousands of servers and install the page blockers .
the government expects that , once these are in place , up to 450,000 attempts to access child pornography sites will be blocked daily .
german family minister ursula von der leyen proposed the law obliging isps to block child porn sites .
it is modeled on similar action taken years ago in scandinavia , britain and italy .
" if these countries can overcome any legal and technical issues and successfully fight child porn online , we can do the same in germany , " von der leyen said when she first presented the new measures .
" we do n't want to tolerate the rape of children , even babies , being widely available in germany , " she added .
the law is also intended to make it harder for criminals to profit from distributing banned pedophile material .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is what child porn surfers will soon see pop up on their computer screen not all on board , yet notably absent in the agreement are 1 & 1 , freenet and other internet providers who service the remaining 25 percent of the german market .
they say they do not want to take the risk of breaching the telecommunications secrecy law by blocking child pornography sites .
they also argue that they only provide the technical capacity to distribute information and are not responsible for content that flows through their networks .
limiting access to information is a sensitive subject in germany because of its nazi past and east german communist rule , but von der leyen said protecting children was the priority .
" the vulnerability and dignity of children is more important than mass communication , " the family minister said .
the german cabinet is expected to announce changes to the telecommunications law by summer that would force the remaining internet providers to block child porn sites .
no reason to believe child porn consumption is going down the notion that pedophiles are shadowy figures who consume child pornography at midnight is long since defunct .
in an embarrassing admission a few weeks , a social democrat lawmaker , joerg tauss , admitted that he possessed child porn .
he denied that he was a pedophile or doing anything wrong , saying he had collected the material for research .
as a lawmaker , he ought to know that laws also govern the " research " of child pornography websites . there 's no reliable information on the extent of child pornography , but the german government says access to video and other images of child pornography on the internet more than doubled from 2006 to 2007 .
there has also been an increase in the amount of violence against small children they show .
the size of those child porn rings that are exposed is , however , some indication of the scope of the problem .
on thursday , german police announced they had smashed a global ring of around 9,000 suspected pedophiles in 92 countries .
pornographic images of children were transmitted from more than 1,000 connections in germany to 8,000 ip addresses in countries including the united states , canada , new zealand , austria and switzerland .
the footage included " images of the most serious sexual abuse , even of toddlers , ” police said in a statement .
child porn users bypass " obvious " areas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : child pornography is often distributed via dvds not the internet critics say the new law is practically useless , because companies abroad can easily bypass the software block .
according to german computer magazine ct , a 27-second online video is already circulating showing how the block can be circumvented . only the " naive internet user " might possibly be stopped from accessing prohibited material , the magazine wrote .
" most child pornography material is available through private forums , like exchange sites , newsgroups , chat rooms , free areas of usenet and e-mail distribution lists , " says udo vetter , a lawyer who often represents people charged with possession of child pornography .
in an interview with ct , vetter said " many simply receive the videos on dvd via the mail , " adding that he doubted a major child pornography industry even exists .
vetter estimated that 98 percent of such images have been around for years and that the quality of most new material that surfaces seems to have been made by private individuals in a domestic setting .
others criticize the government deal with the isps as being too short-sighted .
" blocking internet pages containing child pornography is only one step towards preventing the abuse of children and only reaches " the lower echelons " of pedophiles , says legal expert axel stahl , head of the association of federal judges and prosecutors in the state of north rhine-westphalia .
stahl warned against excessively high expectations , saying that foreign companies that produce child pornography will surely find ways to bypass the new technical limitations . scarcity can actually increase demand " the new rules mean gaining access to child pornography will become more difficult , but it wo n't stop material from being published , " says otto vollmers , who represents fsm , a german industry organization that advocates voluntary self-control of the internet .
" making access technically more difficult can actually arouse greater interest . "
however , similar measures in other countries suggest that blocks so work .
" between 15,000 and 50,000 access attempts are blocked in norway and sweden every day , " said friedemann schindler of the german youth protection initiative jugendschutz.de.

the verdict could help media companies recoup revenue lost through illegal downloads . the four defendants , who ran the pirate bay , were found guilty by the stockholm district court of being accessories to the breach of copyright laws and sentenced to one year in prison . the court ordered them to pay just over 30 million swedish crowns -lrb- 2.74 million euros or $ 3.58 million -rrb- to a number of content providers , including warner bros , sony music entertainment , emi und columbia pictures . the providers had sought 117 million crowns .
the four - peter sunde , gottfrid svartholm warg , fredrik neij and carl lundstrom - were charged early last year by a swedish prosecutor .
they claim they can not be held responsible for the material exchanged via their site , which was launched in 2003 , since no copyrighted material is stored on its servers and no exchange of files actually takes place there .
but the prosecution said that by financing , programming and administering the site , the four men promoted the infringement of property rights by its users .
the defendants ' lawyer said after the trial they would appeal .
the court 's finding could affectiinternet users throughout the world , since it tries to define at what stage in the download process copyright can be infringed , and how far internet site operators can claim that they are only providing technical infrastructure .
the pirate bay , which is estimated to have 22 million users , organized the exchange of so-called bittorrent data , small packets of data which allow the transfer of much larger files direct from one computer to another . the site left it up to the person doing the downloading to clarify copyright issues , including payment .
ifpi , which represents the recording industry worldwide , hailed the decision . " the trial of the operators of the pirate bay was about defending the rights of creators , confirming the illegality of the service and creating a fair environment for legal music services that respect the rights of the creative community , " ifpi chairman john kennedy said in a statement .
but some industry specialists are skeptical about the long-term effects of the verdict .
music analyst mark mulligan of research firm forrester told reuters , " every time you get rid of one , another bigger one pops up . ...
the problem of file-sharing just keeps growing year on year , and it 's increasingly difficult for the industry to do anything about it . " mll / ncy , reuters / dpa / ap / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the verdict could help media companies recoup revenue lost through illegal downloads . the four defendants , who ran the pirate bay , were found guilty by the stockholm district court of being accessories to the breach of copyright laws and sentenced to one year in prison . the court ordered them to pay just over 30 million swedish crowns -lrb- 2.74 million euros or $ 3.58 million -rrb- to a number of content providers , including warner bros , sony music entertainment , emi und columbia pictures . the providers had sought 117 million crowns .
the four - peter sunde , gottfrid svartholm warg , fredrik neij and carl lundstrom - were charged early last year by a swedish prosecutor .
they claim they can not be held responsible for the material exchanged via their site , which was launched in 2003 , since no copyrighted material is stored on its servers and no exchange of files actually takes place there .
but the prosecution said that by financing , programming and administering the site , the four men promoted the infringement of property rights by its users .
the defendants ' lawyer said after the trial they would appeal .
the court 's finding could affectiinternet users throughout the world , since it tries to define at what stage in the download process copyright can be infringed , and how far internet site operators can claim that they are only providing technical infrastructure .
the pirate bay , which is estimated to have 22 million users , organized the exchange of so-called bittorrent data , small packets of data which allow the transfer of much larger files direct from one computer to another . the site left it up to the person doing the downloading to clarify copyright issues , including payment .
ifpi , which represents the recording industry worldwide , hailed the decision . " the trial of the operators of the pirate bay was about defending the rights of creators , confirming the illegality of the service and creating a fair environment for legal music services that respect the rights of the creative community , " ifpi chairman john kennedy said in a statement .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 17.04.2009 at 30 , germany 's liberal daily taz has grown up großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taz was meant to be a counterweight to the established press berlin 's tageszeitung , or taz , embodies the alternative green movement and is , for many , more of an escort to political change than just a daily newspaper .
now the smallest of germany 's national papers is turning 30 . a crucified soccer coach on the front page of the tageszeitung caught people 's attention on easter sunday .
the man on the cross was juergen klinsmann , the former head coach of germany 's national soccer team and now the coach of bayern munich . the responses were pre-programmed : klinsmann sues the taz and bayern munich bosses rant about the worst ethical derailment since the beginning of time . karl-heinz ruch , or kalle as he is known , sits back and smiles .
as the daily 's ceo , he 's pleased that the conflict is selling more papers . " the taz shaped its own genre of daily newspaper , " said ruch , drawing a fine line between his publication and bild , germany 's most popular mass-circulation daily . " it 's a subscription paper , which means that 80 percent of the print run goes to subscribers , " he added .
" but we also want to sell individual papers , which is why the headlines have to be powerful . " against all odds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruch says at the beginning no one thought the taz would succeed the first edition of the taz , which was published on april 17 , 1979 , featured a cover picture of a clown dancing on a pedestal .

at a press conference with azerbaijan 's president , ilham aliyev , in moscow , medvedev warned that the exercises could cause " different kinds of complications " and could threaten a recent thaw in russia-nato relations .
russia 's brief war with georgia last august over georgia 's breakaway province of south ossetia had strained the relationship and caused nato to freeze high-level contacts with russia in protest .
medvedev said that nato 's impending military exercises in georgia could damage the reconciliation process .
" this decision appears to be short-sighted , " he said .
" such decisions are disappointing and do not facilitate the resumption of full-scale contacts between the russian federation and nato . "
earlier , russia 's nato mission in brussels had said it would ask the alliance to postpone the exercises .
nato announced earlier this week that the exercises in georgia would go ahead from may 6 , to improve cooperation between the western alliance and partner countries .
the exercises have been planned since the spring of 2008 , and are to involve about 1,300 personnel from 19 nato and partner countries .

" these are serious people , " gm chief executive fritz henderson said , describing a shortlist of potential investors in opel to a conference call with reporters . " many of them are financial players , some of them are industrial players .
i would expect that work would get done in the next two to three weeks and so that process has kicked off . " gm is looking to sell off assets like opel , as well as its saab , hummer and saturn divisions , in an effort to stave off an increasingly likely bankruptcy filing . who 's buying ? henderson provided no names in the conference call , and rumors are swirling about who the investors might be - from italian carmaker fiat to sovereign wealth funds in asia and the gulf . media reports emerging from italy poured cold water on the idea fiat was among the potential buyers , as luca di montezemolo , the company 's chairman , denied any interest in opel to reporters there . fiat is currently involved in negotiations about a merger with another stricken carmaker , us-based chrysler .

she added that she was confident that all parties would approve the reworked statement and decide to attend the upcoming meeting in geneva .
" i feel very certain because this was so well deliberated by all groups that it will have an easy passage through the conference , " she told a news briefing at the un 's palais des nations complex , where the april 20-24 conference is to be held .
pillay said she therefore expected the conference to adopt the 17-page document .
references to the defamation of religions - another political hot potato - had also been deleted , pillay said .
she specifically thanked the palestinian delegation for allowing a compromise .
walk outs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are fears the conference could take on an anti-israel tone the conference , known as durban ii , has been plagued by discord , with canada and israel boycotting the event over fears that muslim nations will focus exclusively on the jewish state 's treatment of the palestinians .
germany and other eu countries are also mulling shunning the un talks amid concerns that the event may take on anti-semitic overtones , a senior official in berlin confirmed on thursday .
another government spokesman said that neither germany nor the eu could tolerate participating in the conference if it becomes a platform for " one-sided comments on the middle east conflict . "
the us and australia also objected to wording about israel in an earlier draft declaration and said they were not planning to send any envoys to the five-day meeting , though us state department deputy spokesman robert wood said on friday that washington was still weighing its options after viewing the recently reworked declaration .
decision pending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad will attend the upcoming un meeting the us has raised objections to a push by arab and muslim states to include a condemnation of " incitement to religious hatred " and to make " defamation of religion " illegal .
it feels those moves are an effort to limit freedom of expression in the wake of the highly controversial danish cartoons of the muslim prophet mohammad in 2006 .
a final decision on whether the us and european countries will attend is expected to come in the next couple of days .
iran 's president , mahmoud ahmadinejad , has already stated that he will attend .
the iranian president has come under heavy criticism for previously hosting a conference questioning the historical accuracy of the holocaust .
this conference is to be a follow up to a 2001 anti-racism meeting in south africa .
israel and the us walked out of that gathering after arab and muslim states attempted to add text defining zionism as racism . dfm / pfd , afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 17.04.2009 stuttgart , hoffenheim and the last international spot großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart have had plenty of reasons to celebrate in the second half of the season fifth place in the bundesliga means a spot in international competition .
hoffenheim , so strong in the season 's first half would settle for fifth now , but a charging stuttgart might well feel they can snatch it away . for vfb stuttgart , the low point of the season came in late november .
they 'd just lost 4-0 to wolfsburg and sat in 11th place in the table , a long fall from their last two seasons , in which they finished first and sixth , respectively .
hoping to shake things up , they fired their coach armin veh . the outlook was bleak , but in the meantime things have changed drastically .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach markus babbel has turned things around since taking over from armin veh under the leadership of new trainer markus babbel , stuttgart are sitting pretty in fifth thanks to a steady climb up the table that may not yet have reached its peak .
babbel 's squad have suffered just one loss since he took over the club in the season 's 15th week .
the swabians are currently coming off a clutch victory over hamburg that came on mario gomez 's second chance goal late in extra time . the win meant the bundesliga lead pack is now within reach of the surging stuttgart .
champions league possible stuttgart have every reason to be drooling over their prospects in the last seven weeks of the season .
they trail hertha berlin by one , and are three behind hamburg and bayern munich , who are tied on points at 51 .
the top of the table is a little more distant for stuttgart - six points to be exact - and league leaders wolfsburg are clutching dearly to the summit . even if the title remains a lofty ambition , suttgart 's situation could still improve . while fifth place would guarantee stuttgart a spot in next year 's europa league -lrb- the newly re-named successor to the uefa cup -rrb- , third place would put them in the qualifying rounds of the champions league .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gomez is stuttgart 's top scorer with 15 goals stuttgart square off this weekend with cologne , a team that 's been out-of-sorts as of late , and the critical set of games for stuttgart wo n't come until next month . they host wolfsburg four weeks before the end of the season , and then travel to bayern munich for what could be a very decisive final game of the bundesliga campaign .
hoffenheim falls from the top meanwhile , tsg hoffenheim 's season is headed precisely in the opposite direction . in the first half of the season , hoffenheim were the team to beat .
they started the season in first place , and after a couple of stumbles early on , found their form . by week nine , they regained control of the table and hardly looked back going into the winter break .
now hoffenheim ca n't seem to win a match , and have seen their dreams of a german title shrink to a struggle to salvage a uefa cup spot . hoffenheim are in sixth place , four points behind stuttgart , and with three ambitious clubs - schalke , dortmund , and leverkusen - nipping at their heels .
to fend them off , hoffenheim will have to snap its streak of nine winless matches - and soon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ibisevic , left , is still the league 's no. 2 scorer injuries and red cards perhaps hoffenheim 's biggest problem has been injuries .
especially painful was the loss of vedad ibisevic , who tore his right anterior cruciate ligament in a practice match in january . ibisevic 's role in the team 's first half success is best appreciated by looking at the current bundesliga top scorers list .
nearly four months after scoring his last league goal , ibisevic is still second on the list with 18 goals .
it 's a hole hoffenheim have been unable to fill .
discipline , too , has been a problem for hoffenheim . the worst offender is midfielder carlos eduardo , who is second on the team behind ibisevic in goals with 11 . in last weekend 's match against bochum , eduardo was given a red card for throwing an elbow at bochum 's philipp boenig .
that made two red cards this season for eduardo , who was handed a five-match suspension from the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- . he wo n't be available until hoffenheim 's penultimate game , against bayern munich .
hoffenheim 's goalie , daniel haas , was sent off shortly after eduardo against bochum for unsportsmanlike conduct and faces a three game suspension from the dfb .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after last weekend 's red card , carlos eduardo , right , is out for five matches hoffenheim needs a win to stop their free-fall in the table , and they wo n't get a better chance than this weekend against last-place karlsruhe .
after that , they 'll host hertha berlin and then face a steep uphill battle on the road against wolfsburg .
both matches provide good opportunities gain ground in the table , but the hoffenheim of the second half of the season does n't seem up to the challenge .
a spot in international competition seemed like a sure thing at the season 's midpoint , but with the way into the top five now solidly blocked by the streaking stuttgart , hoffenheim could find themselves out in the cold .

hoffenheim , so strong in the season 's first half would settle for fifth now , but a charging stuttgart might well feel they can snatch it away . for vfb stuttgart , the low point of the season came in late november .
they 'd just lost 4-0 to wolfsburg and sat in 11th place in the table , a long fall from their last two seasons , in which they finished first and sixth , respectively .
hoping to shake things up , they fired their coach armin veh . the outlook was bleak , but in the meantime things have changed drastically .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach markus babbel has turned things around since taking over from armin veh under the leadership of new trainer markus babbel , stuttgart are sitting pretty in fifth thanks to a steady climb up the table that may not yet have reached its peak .
babbel 's squad have suffered just one loss since he took over the club in the season 's 15th week .
the swabians are currently coming off a clutch victory over hamburg that came on mario gomez 's second chance goal late in extra time . the win meant the bundesliga lead pack is now within reach of the surging stuttgart .
champions league possible stuttgart have every reason to be drooling over their prospects in the last seven weeks of the season .
they trail hertha berlin by one , and are three behind hamburg and bayern munich , who are tied on points at 51 .
the top of the table is a little more distant for stuttgart - six points to be exact - and league leaders wolfsburg are clutching dearly to the summit . even if the title remains a lofty ambition , suttgart 's situation could still improve . while fifth place would guarantee stuttgart a spot in next year 's europa league -lrb- the newly re-named successor to the uefa cup -rrb- , third place would put them in the qualifying rounds of the champions league .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gomez is stuttgart 's top scorer with 15 goals stuttgart square off this weekend with cologne , a team that 's been out-of-sorts as of late , and the critical set of games for stuttgart wo n't come until next month . they host wolfsburg four weeks before the end of the season , and then travel to bayern munich for what could be a very decisive final game of the bundesliga campaign .
hoffenheim falls from the top meanwhile , tsg hoffenheim 's season is headed precisely in the opposite direction . in the first half of the season , hoffenheim were the team to beat .
they started the season in first place , and after a couple of stumbles early on , found their form . by week nine , they regained control of the table and hardly looked back going into the winter break .
now hoffenheim ca n't seem to win a match , and have seen their dreams of a german title shrink to a struggle to salvage a uefa cup spot . hoffenheim are in sixth place , four points behind stuttgart , and with three ambitious clubs - schalke , dortmund , and leverkusen - nipping at their heels .
to fend them off , hoffenheim will have to snap its streak of nine winless matches - and soon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ibisevic , left , is still the league 's no. 2 scorer injuries and red cards perhaps hoffenheim 's biggest problem has been injuries .
especially painful was the loss of vedad ibisevic , who tore his right anterior cruciate ligament in a practice match in january . ibisevic 's role in the team 's first half success is best appreciated by looking at the current bundesliga top scorers list .
nearly four months after scoring his last league goal , ibisevic is still second on the list with 18 goals .
it 's a hole hoffenheim have been unable to fill .
discipline , too , has been a problem for hoffenheim . the worst offender is midfielder carlos eduardo , who is second on the team behind ibisevic in goals with 11 . in last weekend 's match against bochum , eduardo was given a red card for throwing an elbow at bochum 's philipp boenig .
that made two red cards this season for eduardo , who was handed a five-match suspension from the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- . he wo n't be available until hoffenheim 's penultimate game , against bayern munich .
hoffenheim 's goalie , daniel haas , was sent off shortly after eduardo against bochum for unsportsmanlike conduct and faces a three game suspension from the dfb .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after last weekend 's red card , carlos eduardo , right , is out for five matches hoffenheim needs a win to stop their free-fall in the table , and they wo n't get a better chance than this weekend against last-place karlsruhe .
after that , they 'll host hertha berlin and then face a steep uphill battle on the road against wolfsburg .
both matches provide good opportunities gain ground in the table , but the hoffenheim of the second half of the season does n't seem up to the challenge .
a spot in international competition seemed like a sure thing at the season 's midpoint , but with the way into the top five now solidly blocked by the streaking stuttgart , hoffenheim could find themselves out in the cold .

that made two red cards this season for eduardo , who was handed a five-match suspension from the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- . he wo n't be available until hoffenheim 's penultimate game , against bayern munich .
hoffenheim 's goalie , daniel haas , was sent off shortly after eduardo against bochum for unsportsmanlike conduct and faces a three game suspension from the dfb .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after last weekend 's red card , carlos eduardo , right , is out for five matches hoffenheim needs a win to stop their free-fall in the table , and they wo n't get a better chance than this weekend against last-place karlsruhe .
after that , they 'll host hertha berlin and then face a steep uphill battle on the road against wolfsburg .
both matches provide good opportunities gain ground in the table , but the hoffenheim of the second half of the season does n't seem up to the challenge .
a spot in international competition seemed like a sure thing at the season 's midpoint , but with the way into the top five now solidly blocked by the streaking stuttgart , hoffenheim could find themselves out in the cold .

" we have been through a dark and painful chapter in our history , " obama said in a statement .
" but at a time of great challenges and disturbing disunity , nothing will be gained by spending our time and energy laying blame for the past . "
the white house also released several memos drafted under the bush administration that provided legal justification for the harsh interrogation methods .
techniques outlined in the memos include sleep deprivation , slamming detainees into walls , stripping them naked , and submitting them to waterboarding , a technique used to simulate drowning that human rights groups say amounts to torture .
the cia had previously acknowledged the waterboarding of three terrorism suspects , including khalid sheikh mohammed , the alleged mastermind of the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks .
obama emphasized that , in one of his first acts as president , he had already prohibited the use of such techniques , saying they " undermine our moral authority , and do not make us safer . "
but as he released these memos , obama said he wished to " assure those who carried out their duties relying in good faith upon legal advice from the department of justice that they will not be subject to prosecution . "
civil rights group aclu welcomed the release but said it still wanted an independent prosecutor to investigate allegations of torture during the bush administration .

mitchell stressed the white house 's commitment to palestinian statehood . mitchell said president barack obama regarded establishing a sovereign , independent palestinian state as being in the " national interest " of the us .
he also warned that peace talks would not move forward unless israel 's new government cooperated in efforts to forge a two-state solution .
" a two-state solution is the only solution , " mitchell said after his talks with the palestinian president .
" this conflict has gone on for far too long .
the people of this region should no longer have to wait for the just peace , " he told reporters , as he wrapped up his first visit to the region since the new israeli government of hardline conservative prime minister benjamin netanyahu was sworn in .

erekat , a top aide to abbas , also said the peace process was impossible unless israel stopped all settlement construction in the occupied west bank and house demolitions in east jerusalem .
after the talks between abbas and mitchell , erekat told reporters that abbas emphasized the palestinian commitment to both the 2003 road map peace plan and the annapolis process .
the netanyahu government has said it is bound only by the road map , but not by the annapolis process of november 2007 .

mitchell stressed the white house 's commitment to palestinian statehood . mitchell said president barack obama regarded establishing a sovereign , independent palestinian state as being in the " national interest " of the us .
he also warned that peace talks would not move forward unless israel 's new government cooperated in efforts to forge a two-state solution .
" a two-state solution is the only solution , " mitchell said after his talks with the palestinian president .
" this conflict has gone on for far too long .
the people of this region should no longer have to wait for the just peace , " he told reporters , as he wrapped up his first visit to the region since the new israeli government of hardline conservative prime minister benjamin netanyahu was sworn in .

hoffenheim , so strong in the season 's first half would settle for fifth now , but a charging stuttgart might well feel they can snatch it away . for vfb stuttgart , the low point of the season came in late november .
they 'd just lost 4-0 to wolfsburg and sat in 11th place in the table , a long fall from their last two seasons , in which they finished first and sixth , respectively .
hoping to shake things up , they fired their coach armin veh . the outlook was bleak , but in the meantime things have changed drastically .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach markus babbel has turned things around since taking over from armin veh under the leadership of new trainer markus babbel , stuttgart are sitting pretty in fifth thanks to a steady climb up the table that may not yet have reached its peak .
babbel 's squad have suffered just one loss since he took over the club in the season 's 15th week .
the swabians are currently coming off a clutch victory over hamburg that came on mario gomez 's second chance goal late in extra time . the win meant the bundesliga lead pack is now within reach of the surging stuttgart .
champions league possible stuttgart have every reason to be drooling over their prospects in the last seven weeks of the season .
they trail hertha berlin by one , and are three behind hamburg and bayern munich , who are tied on points at 51 .
the top of the table is a little more distant for stuttgart - six points to be exact - and league leaders wolfsburg are clutching dearly to the summit . even if the title remains a lofty ambition , suttgart 's situation could still improve . while fifth place would guarantee stuttgart a spot in next year 's europa league -lrb- the newly re-named successor to the uefa cup -rrb- , third place would put them in the qualifying rounds of the champions league .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gomez is stuttgart 's top scorer with 15 goals stuttgart square off this weekend with cologne , a team that 's been out-of-sorts as of late , and the critical set of games for stuttgart wo n't come until next month . they host wolfsburg four weeks before the end of the season , and then travel to bayern munich for what could be a very decisive final game of the bundesliga campaign .
hoffenheim falls from the top meanwhile , tsg hoffenheim 's season is headed precisely in the opposite direction . in the first half of the season , hoffenheim were the team to beat .
they started the season in first place , and after a couple of stumbles early on , found their form . by week nine , they regained control of the table and hardly looked back going into the winter break .
now hoffenheim ca n't seem to win a match , and have seen their dreams of a german title shrink to a struggle to salvage a uefa cup spot . hoffenheim are in sixth place , four points behind stuttgart , and with three ambitious clubs - schalke , dortmund , and leverkusen - nipping at their heels .
to fend them off , hoffenheim will have to snap its streak of nine winless matches - and soon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ibisevic , left , is still the league 's no. 2 scorer injuries and red cards perhaps hoffenheim 's biggest problem has been injuries .
especially painful was the loss of vedad ibisevic , who tore his right anterior cruciate ligament in a practice match in january . ibisevic 's role in the team 's first half success is best appreciated by looking at the current bundesliga top scorers list .
nearly four months after scoring his last league goal , ibisevic is still second on the list with 18 goals .
it 's a hole hoffenheim have been unable to fill .
discipline , too , has been a problem for hoffenheim . the worst offender is midfielder carlos eduardo , who is second on the team behind ibisevic in goals with 11 . in last weekend 's match against bochum , eduardo was given a red card for throwing an elbow at bochum 's philipp boenig .
that made two red cards this season for eduardo , who was handed a five-match suspension from the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- . he wo n't be available until hoffenheim 's penultimate game , against bayern munich .
hoffenheim 's goalie , daniel haas , was sent off shortly after eduardo against bochum for unsportsmanlike conduct and faces a three game suspension from the dfb .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after last weekend 's red card , carlos eduardo , right , is out for five matches hoffenheim needs a win to stop their free-fall in the table , and they wo n't get a better chance than this weekend against last-place karlsruhe .
after that , they 'll host hertha berlin and then face a steep uphill battle on the road against wolfsburg .
both matches provide good opportunities gain ground in the table , but the hoffenheim of the second half of the season does n't seem up to the challenge .
a spot in international competition seemed like a sure thing at the season 's midpoint , but with the way into the top five now solidly blocked by the streaking stuttgart , hoffenheim could find themselves out in the cold .

especially painful was the loss of vedad ibisevic , who tore his right anterior cruciate ligament in a practice match in january . ibisevic 's role in the team 's first half success is best appreciated by looking at the current bundesliga top scorers list .
nearly four months after scoring his last league goal , ibisevic is still second on the list with 18 goals .
it 's a hole hoffenheim have been unable to fill .
discipline , too , has been a problem for hoffenheim . the worst offender is midfielder carlos eduardo , who is second on the team behind ibisevic in goals with 11 . in last weekend 's match against bochum , eduardo was given a red card for throwing an elbow at bochum 's philipp boenig .
that made two red cards this season for eduardo , who was handed a five-match suspension from the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- . he wo n't be available until hoffenheim 's penultimate game , against bayern munich .
hoffenheim 's goalie , daniel haas , was sent off shortly after eduardo against bochum for unsportsmanlike conduct and faces a three game suspension from the dfb .

after that , they 'll host hertha berlin and then face a steep uphill battle on the road against wolfsburg .
both matches provide good opportunities gain ground in the table , but the hoffenheim of the second half of the season does n't seem up to the challenge .

the top of the table is a little more distant for stuttgart - six points to be exact - and league leaders wolfsburg are clutching dearly to the summit . even if the title remains a lofty ambition , suttgart 's situation could still improve . while fifth place would guarantee stuttgart a spot in next year 's europa league -lrb- the newly re-named successor to the uefa cup -rrb- , third place would put them in the qualifying rounds of the champions league .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gomez is stuttgart 's top scorer with 15 goals stuttgart square off this weekend with cologne , a team that 's been out-of-sorts as of late , and the critical set of games for stuttgart wo n't come until next month . they host wolfsburg four weeks before the end of the season , and then travel to bayern munich for what could be a very decisive final game of the bundesliga campaign .
hoffenheim falls from the top meanwhile , tsg hoffenheim 's season is headed precisely in the opposite direction . in the first half of the season , hoffenheim were the team to beat .
they started the season in first place , and after a couple of stumbles early on , found their form . by week nine , they regained control of the table and hardly looked back going into the winter break .
now hoffenheim ca n't seem to win a match , and have seen their dreams of a german title shrink to a struggle to salvage a uefa cup spot . hoffenheim are in sixth place , four points behind stuttgart , and with three ambitious clubs - schalke , dortmund , and leverkusen - nipping at their heels .
to fend them off , hoffenheim will have to snap its streak of nine winless matches - and soon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ibisevic , left , is still the league 's no. 2 scorer injuries and red cards perhaps hoffenheim 's biggest problem has been injuries .
especially painful was the loss of vedad ibisevic , who tore his right anterior cruciate ligament in a practice match in january . ibisevic 's role in the team 's first half success is best appreciated by looking at the current bundesliga top scorers list .
nearly four months after scoring his last league goal , ibisevic is still second on the list with 18 goals .
it 's a hole hoffenheim have been unable to fill .
discipline , too , has been a problem for hoffenheim . the worst offender is midfielder carlos eduardo , who is second on the team behind ibisevic in goals with 11 . in last weekend 's match against bochum , eduardo was given a red card for throwing an elbow at bochum 's philipp boenig .
that made two red cards this season for eduardo , who was handed a five-match suspension from the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- . he wo n't be available until hoffenheim 's penultimate game , against bayern munich .
hoffenheim 's goalie , daniel haas , was sent off shortly after eduardo against bochum for unsportsmanlike conduct and faces a three game suspension from the dfb .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after last weekend 's red card , carlos eduardo , right , is out for five matches hoffenheim needs a win to stop their free-fall in the table , and they wo n't get a better chance than this weekend against last-place karlsruhe .
after that , they 'll host hertha berlin and then face a steep uphill battle on the road against wolfsburg .
both matches provide good opportunities gain ground in the table , but the hoffenheim of the second half of the season does n't seem up to the challenge .
a spot in international competition seemed like a sure thing at the season 's midpoint , but with the way into the top five now solidly blocked by the streaking stuttgart , hoffenheim could find themselves out in the cold .

at a press conference with azerbaijan 's president , ilham aliyev , in moscow , medvedev warned that the exercises could cause " different kinds of complications " and could threaten a recent thaw in russia-nato relations .
russia 's brief war with georgia last august over georgia 's breakaway province of south ossetia had strained the relationship and caused nato to freeze high-level contacts with russia in protest .
medvedev said that nato 's impending military exercises in georgia could damage the reconciliation process .
" this decision appears to be short-sighted , " he said .
" such decisions are disappointing and do not facilitate the resumption of full-scale contacts between the russian federation and nato . "
earlier , russia 's nato mission in brussels had said it would ask the alliance to postpone the exercises .
nato announced earlier this week that the exercises in georgia would go ahead from may 6 , to improve cooperation between the western alliance and partner countries .
the exercises have been planned since the spring of 2008 , and are to involve about 1,300 personnel from 19 nato and partner countries .

at a press conference with azerbaijan 's president , ilham aliyev , in moscow , medvedev warned that the exercises could cause " different kinds of complications " and could threaten a recent thaw in russia-nato relations .
russia 's brief war with georgia last august over georgia 's breakaway province of south ossetia had strained the relationship and caused nato to freeze high-level contacts with russia in protest .
medvedev said that nato 's impending military exercises in georgia could damage the reconciliation process .
" this decision appears to be short-sighted , " he said .
" such decisions are disappointing and do not facilitate the resumption of full-scale contacts between the russian federation and nato . "

now the smallest of germany 's national papers is turning 30 . a crucified soccer coach on the front page of the tageszeitung caught people 's attention on easter sunday .
the man on the cross was juergen klinsmann , the former head coach of germany 's national soccer team and now the coach of bayern munich . the responses were pre-programmed : klinsmann sues the taz and bayern munich bosses rant about the worst ethical derailment since the beginning of time . karl-heinz ruch , or kalle as he is known , sits back and smiles .
as the daily 's ceo , he 's pleased that the conflict is selling more papers . " the taz shaped its own genre of daily newspaper , " said ruch , drawing a fine line between his publication and bild , germany 's most popular mass-circulation daily . " it 's a subscription paper , which means that 80 percent of the print run goes to subscribers , " he added .
" but we also want to sell individual papers , which is why the headlines have to be powerful . " against all odds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruch says at the beginning no one thought the taz would succeed the first edition of the taz , which was published on april 17 , 1979 , featured a cover picture of a clown dancing on a pedestal .
from the start , it was clear that provocation rather than political correctness was its mandate . the quality of the paper back then was poor , with topics strewn randomly throughout .
one particular front page juxtaposed articles on an earthquake in yugoslavia , a wave of arrests in iran and the political critic robert havemann , who was sentenced to house arrest by the east german regime . the taz was founded as a kind of anti-press - a counterweight to the established middle-class newspapers .
for some , however , it did n't go far enough .
hermann gremlitza , of the monthly left-wing publication konkret , called the fledgling paper " baby-faz , " implying that it was n't very different from the bourgeoisie frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . " no one thought that much would become of the paper , " said ruch .
" there were n't even any experts there , it was just students , and only a handful of them had any journalism experience .
there was n't anybody from the publishing field . " riding political winds but those students had plenty to report on .
when the newspaper was founded in 1979 , it was a time of arms races , peace movements , squatters , and women 's liberation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now , a paper is n't necessarily radical for writing about the environment the taz thrust these issues into the spotlight , along with environmental protection .
while green topics may be common these days in media across the spectrum , it was the taz which played a key role back then in the rise of germany 's green party , which was also founded in 1979 . in the beginning , the left-leaning paper lived from its dedicated , if not exactly professional , style of writing .
now , however , the taz is referred to as the country 's school of journalism , since many who now write for large national publications like sueddeutsche zeitung or die zeit started at the taz . " here , everyone participates in the editorial conferences , whereas at other papers only the department heads are included , " said ruch , naming the advantages of working for the taz .
" everyone has the opportunity to play a part and even write commentaries .
the important thing is that you have talent . " the taz grows up randy kaufman , an american who has worked for the taz as an archivist since 1983 , said the once leftist paper has gradually slid toward the center of the spectrum . " we 've gotten older , had kids and the taz has moved more to the middle of society , " he said .
" many issues that the taz made public at the beginning have now become mainstream . " today , nearly all taz employees are between the ages of 30 and 40 .

now the smallest of germany 's national papers is turning 30 . a crucified soccer coach on the front page of the tageszeitung caught people 's attention on easter sunday .
the man on the cross was juergen klinsmann , the former head coach of germany 's national soccer team and now the coach of bayern munich . the responses were pre-programmed : klinsmann sues the taz and bayern munich bosses rant about the worst ethical derailment since the beginning of time . karl-heinz ruch , or kalle as he is known , sits back and smiles .
as the daily 's ceo , he 's pleased that the conflict is selling more papers . " the taz shaped its own genre of daily newspaper , " said ruch , drawing a fine line between his publication and bild , germany 's most popular mass-circulation daily . " it 's a subscription paper , which means that 80 percent of the print run goes to subscribers , " he added .
" but we also want to sell individual papers , which is why the headlines have to be powerful . " against all odds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruch says at the beginning no one thought the taz would succeed the first edition of the taz , which was published on april 17 , 1979 , featured a cover picture of a clown dancing on a pedestal .
from the start , it was clear that provocation rather than political correctness was its mandate . the quality of the paper back then was poor , with topics strewn randomly throughout .
one particular front page juxtaposed articles on an earthquake in yugoslavia , a wave of arrests in iran and the political critic robert havemann , who was sentenced to house arrest by the east german regime . the taz was founded as a kind of anti-press - a counterweight to the established middle-class newspapers .
for some , however , it did n't go far enough .
hermann gremlitza , of the monthly left-wing publication konkret , called the fledgling paper " baby-faz , " implying that it was n't very different from the bourgeoisie frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . " no one thought that much would become of the paper , " said ruch .
" there were n't even any experts there , it was just students , and only a handful of them had any journalism experience .
there was n't anybody from the publishing field . " riding political winds but those students had plenty to report on .
when the newspaper was founded in 1979 , it was a time of arms races , peace movements , squatters , and women 's liberation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now , a paper is n't necessarily radical for writing about the environment the taz thrust these issues into the spotlight , along with environmental protection .
while green topics may be common these days in media across the spectrum , it was the taz which played a key role back then in the rise of germany 's green party , which was also founded in 1979 . in the beginning , the left-leaning paper lived from its dedicated , if not exactly professional , style of writing .
now , however , the taz is referred to as the country 's school of journalism , since many who now write for large national publications like sueddeutsche zeitung or die zeit started at the taz . " here , everyone participates in the editorial conferences , whereas at other papers only the department heads are included , " said ruch , naming the advantages of working for the taz .
" everyone has the opportunity to play a part and even write commentaries .
the important thing is that you have talent . " the taz grows up randy kaufman , an american who has worked for the taz as an archivist since 1983 , said the once leftist paper has gradually slid toward the center of the spectrum . " we 've gotten older , had kids and the taz has moved more to the middle of society , " he said .
" many issues that the taz made public at the beginning have now become mainstream . " today , nearly all taz employees are between the ages of 30 and 40 .
it 's become something of a mix between a satirical and a serious newspaper - a high-gloss publication for those who do n't quite fit in . nevertheless , 30 years on , the taz can still get away with a sometimes disrespectful , radical or subversive approach to topics that other papers would n't touch with a 10-foot pole . author : christoph richter / kate bowen editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while green topics may be common these days in media across the spectrum , it was the taz which played a key role back then in the rise of germany 's green party , which was also founded in 1979 . in the beginning , the left-leaning paper lived from its dedicated , if not exactly professional , style of writing .
now , however , the taz is referred to as the country 's school of journalism , since many who now write for large national publications like sueddeutsche zeitung or die zeit started at the taz . " here , everyone participates in the editorial conferences , whereas at other papers only the department heads are included , " said ruch , naming the advantages of working for the taz .
" everyone has the opportunity to play a part and even write commentaries .
the important thing is that you have talent . " the taz grows up randy kaufman , an american who has worked for the taz as an archivist since 1983 , said the once leftist paper has gradually slid toward the center of the spectrum . " we 've gotten older , had kids and the taz has moved more to the middle of society , " he said .
" many issues that the taz made public at the beginning have now become mainstream . " today , nearly all taz employees are between the ages of 30 and 40 .
it 's become something of a mix between a satirical and a serious newspaper - a high-gloss publication for those who do n't quite fit in . nevertheless , 30 years on , the taz can still get away with a sometimes disrespectful , radical or subversive approach to topics that other papers would n't touch with a 10-foot pole . author : christoph richter / kate bowen editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the verdict could help media companies recoup revenue lost through illegal downloads . the four defendants , who ran the pirate bay , were found guilty by the stockholm district court of being accessories to the breach of copyright laws and sentenced to one year in prison . the court ordered them to pay just over 30 million swedish crowns -lrb- 2.74 million euros or $ 3.58 million -rrb- to a number of content providers , including warner bros , sony music entertainment , emi und columbia pictures . the providers had sought 117 million crowns .
the four - peter sunde , gottfrid svartholm warg , fredrik neij and carl lundstrom - were charged early last year by a swedish prosecutor .
they claim they can not be held responsible for the material exchanged via their site , which was launched in 2003 , since no copyrighted material is stored on its servers and no exchange of files actually takes place there .
but the prosecution said that by financing , programming and administering the site , the four men promoted the infringement of property rights by its users .
the defendants ' lawyer said after the trial they would appeal .
the court 's finding could affectiinternet users throughout the world , since it tries to define at what stage in the download process copyright can be infringed , and how far internet site operators can claim that they are only providing technical infrastructure .
the pirate bay , which is estimated to have 22 million users , organized the exchange of so-called bittorrent data , small packets of data which allow the transfer of much larger files direct from one computer to another . the site left it up to the person doing the downloading to clarify copyright issues , including payment .
ifpi , which represents the recording industry worldwide , hailed the decision . " the trial of the operators of the pirate bay was about defending the rights of creators , confirming the illegality of the service and creating a fair environment for legal music services that respect the rights of the creative community , " ifpi chairman john kennedy said in a statement .

the verdict could help media companies recoup revenue lost through illegal downloads . the four defendants , who ran the pirate bay , were found guilty by the stockholm district court of being accessories to the breach of copyright laws and sentenced to one year in prison . the court ordered them to pay just over 30 million swedish crowns -lrb- 2.74 million euros or $ 3.58 million -rrb- to a number of content providers , including warner bros , sony music entertainment , emi und columbia pictures . the providers had sought 117 million crowns .
the four - peter sunde , gottfrid svartholm warg , fredrik neij and carl lundstrom - were charged early last year by a swedish prosecutor .
they claim they can not be held responsible for the material exchanged via their site , which was launched in 2003 , since no copyrighted material is stored on its servers and no exchange of files actually takes place there .
but the prosecution said that by financing , programming and administering the site , the four men promoted the infringement of property rights by its users .
the defendants ' lawyer said after the trial they would appeal .
the court 's finding could affectiinternet users throughout the world , since it tries to define at what stage in the download process copyright can be infringed , and how far internet site operators can claim that they are only providing technical infrastructure .
the pirate bay , which is estimated to have 22 million users , organized the exchange of so-called bittorrent data , small packets of data which allow the transfer of much larger files direct from one computer to another . the site left it up to the person doing the downloading to clarify copyright issues , including payment .
ifpi , which represents the recording industry worldwide , hailed the decision . " the trial of the operators of the pirate bay was about defending the rights of creators , confirming the illegality of the service and creating a fair environment for legal music services that respect the rights of the creative community , " ifpi chairman john kennedy said in a statement .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 17.04.2009 major german online companies agree to block child porn websites großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's family minister warns all child porn sites will be blocked on the internet german internet providers have grudgingly agreed to block websites containing child pornography .
critics say their deal with the government wo n't make much of a difference . five of germany 's eight major internet service providers - deutsche telekom 's t-online , vodafone 's arcor , kabel deutschland , telefonica 's o2 and alice 's hansenet - signed the legally binding agreement with the government and the federal crime office on friday , agreeing to install software to block consumer access to child pornography sites .
the five companies together cover around 75 percent of the german market .
in future , due to the software blocks installed by the internet service providers , consumers attempting to click on blacklisted websites are to be automatically redirected to a red stop sign .
the federal crime office has compiled the blacklist of 1,000 sites , which it updates daily .
the online companies have six months to reprogram thousands of servers and install the page blockers .
the government expects that , once these are in place , up to 450,000 attempts to access child pornography sites will be blocked daily .
german family minister ursula von der leyen proposed the law obliging isps to block child porn sites .
it is modeled on similar action taken years ago in scandinavia , britain and italy .
" if these countries can overcome any legal and technical issues and successfully fight child porn online , we can do the same in germany , " von der leyen said when she first presented the new measures .
" we do n't want to tolerate the rape of children , even babies , being widely available in germany , " she added .
the law is also intended to make it harder for criminals to profit from distributing banned pedophile material .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is what child porn surfers will soon see pop up on their computer screen not all on board , yet notably absent in the agreement are 1 & 1 , freenet and other internet providers who service the remaining 25 percent of the german market .
they say they do not want to take the risk of breaching the telecommunications secrecy law by blocking child pornography sites .
they also argue that they only provide the technical capacity to distribute information and are not responsible for content that flows through their networks .
limiting access to information is a sensitive subject in germany because of its nazi past and east german communist rule , but von der leyen said protecting children was the priority .
" the vulnerability and dignity of children is more important than mass communication , " the family minister said .
the german cabinet is expected to announce changes to the telecommunications law by summer that would force the remaining internet providers to block child porn sites .
no reason to believe child porn consumption is going down the notion that pedophiles are shadowy figures who consume child pornography at midnight is long since defunct .
in an embarrassing admission a few weeks , a social democrat lawmaker , joerg tauss , admitted that he possessed child porn .
he denied that he was a pedophile or doing anything wrong , saying he had collected the material for research .
as a lawmaker , he ought to know that laws also govern the " research " of child pornography websites . there 's no reliable information on the extent of child pornography , but the german government says access to video and other images of child pornography on the internet more than doubled from 2006 to 2007 .
there has also been an increase in the amount of violence against small children they show .
the size of those child porn rings that are exposed is , however , some indication of the scope of the problem .
on thursday , german police announced they had smashed a global ring of around 9,000 suspected pedophiles in 92 countries .
pornographic images of children were transmitted from more than 1,000 connections in germany to 8,000 ip addresses in countries including the united states , canada , new zealand , austria and switzerland .
the footage included " images of the most serious sexual abuse , even of toddlers , ” police said in a statement .
child porn users bypass " obvious " areas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : child pornography is often distributed via dvds not the internet critics say the new law is practically useless , because companies abroad can easily bypass the software block .
according to german computer magazine ct , a 27-second online video is already circulating showing how the block can be circumvented . only the " naive internet user " might possibly be stopped from accessing prohibited material , the magazine wrote .
" most child pornography material is available through private forums , like exchange sites , newsgroups , chat rooms , free areas of usenet and e-mail distribution lists , " says udo vetter , a lawyer who often represents people charged with possession of child pornography .
in an interview with ct , vetter said " many simply receive the videos on dvd via the mail , " adding that he doubted a major child pornography industry even exists .
vetter estimated that 98 percent of such images have been around for years and that the quality of most new material that surfaces seems to have been made by private individuals in a domestic setting .
others criticize the government deal with the isps as being too short-sighted .
" blocking internet pages containing child pornography is only one step towards preventing the abuse of children and only reaches " the lower echelons " of pedophiles , says legal expert axel stahl , head of the association of federal judges and prosecutors in the state of north rhine-westphalia .
stahl warned against excessively high expectations , saying that foreign companies that produce child pornography will surely find ways to bypass the new technical limitations . scarcity can actually increase demand " the new rules mean gaining access to child pornography will become more difficult , but it wo n't stop material from being published , " says otto vollmers , who represents fsm , a german industry organization that advocates voluntary self-control of the internet .
" making access technically more difficult can actually arouse greater interest . "
however , similar measures in other countries suggest that blocks so work .
" between 15,000 and 50,000 access attempts are blocked in norway and sweden every day , " said friedemann schindler of the german youth protection initiative jugendschutz.de.
" this is undermining demand and is breaking the commercial cycle . " lyf / ncy , reuters / afp / epd send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

critics say their deal with the government wo n't make much of a difference . five of germany 's eight major internet service providers - deutsche telekom 's t-online , vodafone 's arcor , kabel deutschland , telefonica 's o2 and alice 's hansenet - signed the legally binding agreement with the government and the federal crime office on friday , agreeing to install software to block consumer access to child pornography sites .
the five companies together cover around 75 percent of the german market .
in future , due to the software blocks installed by the internet service providers , consumers attempting to click on blacklisted websites are to be automatically redirected to a red stop sign .
the federal crime office has compiled the blacklist of 1,000 sites , which it updates daily .
the online companies have six months to reprogram thousands of servers and install the page blockers .
the government expects that , once these are in place , up to 450,000 attempts to access child pornography sites will be blocked daily .
german family minister ursula von der leyen proposed the law obliging isps to block child porn sites .
it is modeled on similar action taken years ago in scandinavia , britain and italy .
" if these countries can overcome any legal and technical issues and successfully fight child porn online , we can do the same in germany , " von der leyen said when she first presented the new measures .
" we do n't want to tolerate the rape of children , even babies , being widely available in germany , " she added .
the law is also intended to make it harder for criminals to profit from distributing banned pedophile material .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is what child porn surfers will soon see pop up on their computer screen not all on board , yet notably absent in the agreement are 1 & 1 , freenet and other internet providers who service the remaining 25 percent of the german market .
they say they do not want to take the risk of breaching the telecommunications secrecy law by blocking child pornography sites .
they also argue that they only provide the technical capacity to distribute information and are not responsible for content that flows through their networks .
limiting access to information is a sensitive subject in germany because of its nazi past and east german communist rule , but von der leyen said protecting children was the priority .
" the vulnerability and dignity of children is more important than mass communication , " the family minister said .
the german cabinet is expected to announce changes to the telecommunications law by summer that would force the remaining internet providers to block child porn sites .
no reason to believe child porn consumption is going down the notion that pedophiles are shadowy figures who consume child pornography at midnight is long since defunct .
in an embarrassing admission a few weeks , a social democrat lawmaker , joerg tauss , admitted that he possessed child porn .
he denied that he was a pedophile or doing anything wrong , saying he had collected the material for research .
as a lawmaker , he ought to know that laws also govern the " research " of child pornography websites . there 's no reliable information on the extent of child pornography , but the german government says access to video and other images of child pornography on the internet more than doubled from 2006 to 2007 .
there has also been an increase in the amount of violence against small children they show .
the size of those child porn rings that are exposed is , however , some indication of the scope of the problem .
on thursday , german police announced they had smashed a global ring of around 9,000 suspected pedophiles in 92 countries .
pornographic images of children were transmitted from more than 1,000 connections in germany to 8,000 ip addresses in countries including the united states , canada , new zealand , austria and switzerland .
the footage included " images of the most serious sexual abuse , even of toddlers , ” police said in a statement .
child porn users bypass " obvious " areas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : child pornography is often distributed via dvds not the internet critics say the new law is practically useless , because companies abroad can easily bypass the software block .
according to german computer magazine ct , a 27-second online video is already circulating showing how the block can be circumvented . only the " naive internet user " might possibly be stopped from accessing prohibited material , the magazine wrote .

in future , due to the software blocks installed by the internet service providers , consumers attempting to click on blacklisted websites are to be automatically redirected to a red stop sign .
the federal crime office has compiled the blacklist of 1,000 sites , which it updates daily .
the online companies have six months to reprogram thousands of servers and install the page blockers .
the government expects that , once these are in place , up to 450,000 attempts to access child pornography sites will be blocked daily .
german family minister ursula von der leyen proposed the law obliging isps to block child porn sites .
it is modeled on similar action taken years ago in scandinavia , britain and italy .
" if these countries can overcome any legal and technical issues and successfully fight child porn online , we can do the same in germany , " von der leyen said when she first presented the new measures .
" we do n't want to tolerate the rape of children , even babies , being widely available in germany , " she added .
the law is also intended to make it harder for criminals to profit from distributing banned pedophile material .

they say they do not want to take the risk of breaching the telecommunications secrecy law by blocking child pornography sites .
they also argue that they only provide the technical capacity to distribute information and are not responsible for content that flows through their networks .
limiting access to information is a sensitive subject in germany because of its nazi past and east german communist rule , but von der leyen said protecting children was the priority .
" the vulnerability and dignity of children is more important than mass communication , " the family minister said .
the german cabinet is expected to announce changes to the telecommunications law by summer that would force the remaining internet providers to block child porn sites .
no reason to believe child porn consumption is going down the notion that pedophiles are shadowy figures who consume child pornography at midnight is long since defunct .
in an embarrassing admission a few weeks , a social democrat lawmaker , joerg tauss , admitted that he possessed child porn .
he denied that he was a pedophile or doing anything wrong , saying he had collected the material for research .
as a lawmaker , he ought to know that laws also govern the " research " of child pornography websites . there 's no reliable information on the extent of child pornography , but the german government says access to video and other images of child pornography on the internet more than doubled from 2006 to 2007 .
there has also been an increase in the amount of violence against small children they show .
the size of those child porn rings that are exposed is , however , some indication of the scope of the problem .
on thursday , german police announced they had smashed a global ring of around 9,000 suspected pedophiles in 92 countries .
pornographic images of children were transmitted from more than 1,000 connections in germany to 8,000 ip addresses in countries including the united states , canada , new zealand , austria and switzerland .
the footage included " images of the most serious sexual abuse , even of toddlers , ” police said in a statement .

" most child pornography material is available through private forums , like exchange sites , newsgroups , chat rooms , free areas of usenet and e-mail distribution lists , " says udo vetter , a lawyer who often represents people charged with possession of child pornography .
in an interview with ct , vetter said " many simply receive the videos on dvd via the mail , " adding that he doubted a major child pornography industry even exists .
vetter estimated that 98 percent of such images have been around for years and that the quality of most new material that surfaces seems to have been made by private individuals in a domestic setting .
others criticize the government deal with the isps as being too short-sighted .
" blocking internet pages containing child pornography is only one step towards preventing the abuse of children and only reaches " the lower echelons " of pedophiles , says legal expert axel stahl , head of the association of federal judges and prosecutors in the state of north rhine-westphalia .
stahl warned against excessively high expectations , saying that foreign companies that produce child pornography will surely find ways to bypass the new technical limitations . scarcity can actually increase demand " the new rules mean gaining access to child pornography will become more difficult , but it wo n't stop material from being published , " says otto vollmers , who represents fsm , a german industry organization that advocates voluntary self-control of the internet .

the plan could mean hundreds of thousands of moldovans having the right to settle in the eu . romanian president traian basescu told the romanian parliament on wednesday that he would fast-track moldovans for romanian citizenship following riots in the moldovan capital chisinau against election results which led to the victory of the communist party . he also proposed that moldovans with a romanian great-grandparent should in future have the right to citizenship . currently , an estimated 120,000 moldovans have romanian citizenship , which is available to moldovans with a romanian grandparent .
sixty percent of moldova 's 4.4 million people are thought to have romanian origins .
moldova was part of romania until 1940 when it was taken over by the soviet union .
after the break-up of the soviet union it became an independent state , but it remains one of the poorest countries in europe , with an average annual income of $ 1,830 in 2008 .
tension have been increasing between romania and moldova since the election on april 5 .
the communists won almost 50 percent of the vote , and the opposition has accused the authorities of cheating .
the parliament building in chisinau was set on fire during protests , and protesters were beaten and severely injured .
one man died .
the moldovan government accuses the romanians of being behind the protests and , in response , has imposed visa restrictions on romanians . on friday , an eu commission spokesman said in brussels that the eu condemned the violence , and were concerned at the reports of excesses by the security forces .
but he said he would have to wait until real decisions had been made on the nationality issue before issuing an official response .
however , the czech presidency of the bloc publicly rebuked romania after a meeting between czech eu minister alexandr vondra and romanian foreign minister cristian diaconescu .
vondra said , according the website euobserver.com , " i told my romanian colleague about our serious concerns of the possible risks arising from adopting simplified procedures for romanian citizenship . " the website quoted an unnamed eu official as describing the plans as " frightening .

the white house also released several memos drafted under the bush administration that provided legal justification for the harsh interrogation methods .
techniques outlined in the memos include sleep deprivation , slamming detainees into walls , stripping them naked , and submitting them to waterboarding , a technique used to simulate drowning that human rights groups say amounts to torture .
the cia had previously acknowledged the waterboarding of three terrorism suspects , including khalid sheikh mohammed , the alleged mastermind of the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks .
obama emphasized that , in one of his first acts as president , he had already prohibited the use of such techniques , saying they " undermine our moral authority , and do not make us safer . "

police said the footage included " images of the most serious sexual abuse , even of toddlers . "
on thursday they seized more than 500 computers throughout germany , as well as more than 43,000 data storage devices and nearly 800 hard drives .
police investigations were based on internet connection records which service providers are required by law to keep . the law has been attacked by critics as an invasion of privacy . however , the police said that 377 suspects could not be identified since their connection records were deleted before the law came into effect .
most suspects have been released while the evidence is examined , but police in the northern german state of lower saxony said that one man in his 40s has been arrested on suspicion of sexually abusing two children , aged seven and 11 , in his family .
police said they had forwarded their findings to the authorities in 91 countries , and their investigations had already led to arrests abroad .

at a press conference with azerbaijan 's president , ilham aliyev , in moscow , medvedev warned that the exercises could cause " different kinds of complications " and could threaten a recent thaw in russia-nato relations .
russia 's brief war with georgia last august over georgia 's breakaway province of south ossetia had strained the relationship and caused nato to freeze high-level contacts with russia in protest .
medvedev said that nato 's impending military exercises in georgia could damage the reconciliation process .
" this decision appears to be short-sighted , " he said .
" such decisions are disappointing and do not facilitate the resumption of full-scale contacts between the russian federation and nato . "
earlier , russia 's nato mission in brussels had said it would ask the alliance to postpone the exercises .
nato announced earlier this week that the exercises in georgia would go ahead from may 6 , to improve cooperation between the western alliance and partner countries .
the exercises have been planned since the spring of 2008 , and are to involve about 1,300 personnel from 19 nato and partner countries .
moscow treats any cooperation between nato and georgia with suspicion .
the pro-western government of the former soviet republic has pushed hard to join the alliance , but this has been met with mixed responses from current members . ch / pfd , afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at a press conference with azerbaijan 's president , ilham aliyev , in moscow , medvedev warned that the exercises could cause " different kinds of complications " and could threaten a recent thaw in russia-nato relations .
russia 's brief war with georgia last august over georgia 's breakaway province of south ossetia had strained the relationship and caused nato to freeze high-level contacts with russia in protest .
medvedev said that nato 's impending military exercises in georgia could damage the reconciliation process .
" this decision appears to be short-sighted , " he said .
" such decisions are disappointing and do not facilitate the resumption of full-scale contacts between the russian federation and nato . "
earlier , russia 's nato mission in brussels had said it would ask the alliance to postpone the exercises .
nato announced earlier this week that the exercises in georgia would go ahead from may 6 , to improve cooperation between the western alliance and partner countries .
the exercises have been planned since the spring of 2008 , and are to involve about 1,300 personnel from 19 nato and partner countries .

now the smallest of germany 's national papers is turning 30 . a crucified soccer coach on the front page of the tageszeitung caught people 's attention on easter sunday .
the man on the cross was juergen klinsmann , the former head coach of germany 's national soccer team and now the coach of bayern munich . the responses were pre-programmed : klinsmann sues the taz and bayern munich bosses rant about the worst ethical derailment since the beginning of time . karl-heinz ruch , or kalle as he is known , sits back and smiles .
as the daily 's ceo , he 's pleased that the conflict is selling more papers . " the taz shaped its own genre of daily newspaper , " said ruch , drawing a fine line between his publication and bild , germany 's most popular mass-circulation daily . " it 's a subscription paper , which means that 80 percent of the print run goes to subscribers , " he added .
" but we also want to sell individual papers , which is why the headlines have to be powerful . " against all odds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruch says at the beginning no one thought the taz would succeed the first edition of the taz , which was published on april 17 , 1979 , featured a cover picture of a clown dancing on a pedestal .
from the start , it was clear that provocation rather than political correctness was its mandate . the quality of the paper back then was poor , with topics strewn randomly throughout .
one particular front page juxtaposed articles on an earthquake in yugoslavia , a wave of arrests in iran and the political critic robert havemann , who was sentenced to house arrest by the east german regime . the taz was founded as a kind of anti-press - a counterweight to the established middle-class newspapers .
for some , however , it did n't go far enough .
hermann gremlitza , of the monthly left-wing publication konkret , called the fledgling paper " baby-faz , " implying that it was n't very different from the bourgeoisie frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . " no one thought that much would become of the paper , " said ruch .
" there were n't even any experts there , it was just students , and only a handful of them had any journalism experience .
there was n't anybody from the publishing field . " riding political winds but those students had plenty to report on .
when the newspaper was founded in 1979 , it was a time of arms races , peace movements , squatters , and women 's liberation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now , a paper is n't necessarily radical for writing about the environment the taz thrust these issues into the spotlight , along with environmental protection .
while green topics may be common these days in media across the spectrum , it was the taz which played a key role back then in the rise of germany 's green party , which was also founded in 1979 . in the beginning , the left-leaning paper lived from its dedicated , if not exactly professional , style of writing .
now , however , the taz is referred to as the country 's school of journalism , since many who now write for large national publications like sueddeutsche zeitung or die zeit started at the taz . " here , everyone participates in the editorial conferences , whereas at other papers only the department heads are included , " said ruch , naming the advantages of working for the taz .
" everyone has the opportunity to play a part and even write commentaries .
the important thing is that you have talent . " the taz grows up randy kaufman , an american who has worked for the taz as an archivist since 1983 , said the once leftist paper has gradually slid toward the center of the spectrum . " we 've gotten older , had kids and the taz has moved more to the middle of society , " he said .
" many issues that the taz made public at the beginning have now become mainstream . " today , nearly all taz employees are between the ages of 30 and 40 .
it 's become something of a mix between a satirical and a serious newspaper - a high-gloss publication for those who do n't quite fit in . nevertheless , 30 years on , the taz can still get away with a sometimes disrespectful , radical or subversive approach to topics that other papers would n't touch with a 10-foot pole . author : christoph richter / kate bowen editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on thursday they seized more than 500 computers throughout germany , as well as more than 43,000 data storage devices and nearly 800 hard drives .
police investigations were based on internet connection records which service providers are required by law to keep . the law has been attacked by critics as an invasion of privacy . however , the police said that 377 suspects could not be identified since their connection records were deleted before the law came into effect .
most suspects have been released while the evidence is examined , but police in the northern german state of lower saxony said that one man in his 40s has been arrested on suspicion of sexually abusing two children , aged seven and 11 , in his family .
police said they had forwarded their findings to the authorities in 91 countries , and their investigations had already led to arrests abroad .
the move comes as german police prepare to sign agreements with internet service providers on friday to make it harder to access websites posting child pornography . mll / ncy , afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we have been through a dark and painful chapter in our history , " obama said in a statement .
" but at a time of great challenges and disturbing disunity , nothing will be gained by spending our time and energy laying blame for the past . "
the white house also released several memos drafted under the bush administration that provided legal justification for the harsh interrogation methods .
techniques outlined in the memos include sleep deprivation , slamming detainees into walls , stripping them naked , and submitting them to waterboarding , a technique used to simulate drowning that human rights groups say amounts to torture .
the cia had previously acknowledged the waterboarding of three terrorism suspects , including khalid sheikh mohammed , the alleged mastermind of the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks .
obama emphasized that , in one of his first acts as president , he had already prohibited the use of such techniques , saying they " undermine our moral authority , and do not make us safer . "
but as he released these memos , obama said he wished to " assure those who carried out their duties relying in good faith upon legal advice from the department of justice that they will not be subject to prosecution . "
civil rights group aclu welcomed the release but said it still wanted an independent prosecutor to investigate allegations of torture during the bush administration .

" we have been through a dark and painful chapter in our history , " obama said in a statement .
" but at a time of great challenges and disturbing disunity , nothing will be gained by spending our time and energy laying blame for the past . "
the white house also released several memos drafted under the bush administration that provided legal justification for the harsh interrogation methods .
techniques outlined in the memos include sleep deprivation , slamming detainees into walls , stripping them naked , and submitting them to waterboarding , a technique used to simulate drowning that human rights groups say amounts to torture .
the cia had previously acknowledged the waterboarding of three terrorism suspects , including khalid sheikh mohammed , the alleged mastermind of the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks .
obama emphasized that , in one of his first acts as president , he had already prohibited the use of such techniques , saying they " undermine our moral authority , and do not make us safer . "
but as he released these memos , obama said he wished to " assure those who carried out their duties relying in good faith upon legal advice from the department of justice that they will not be subject to prosecution . "
civil rights group aclu welcomed the release but said it still wanted an independent prosecutor to investigate allegations of torture during the bush administration .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 17.04.2009 at 30 , germany 's liberal daily taz has grown up großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taz was meant to be a counterweight to the established press berlin 's tageszeitung , or taz , embodies the alternative green movement and is , for many , more of an escort to political change than just a daily newspaper .
now the smallest of germany 's national papers is turning 30 . a crucified soccer coach on the front page of the tageszeitung caught people 's attention on easter sunday .
the man on the cross was juergen klinsmann , the former head coach of germany 's national soccer team and now the coach of bayern munich . the responses were pre-programmed : klinsmann sues the taz and bayern munich bosses rant about the worst ethical derailment since the beginning of time . karl-heinz ruch , or kalle as he is known , sits back and smiles .
as the daily 's ceo , he 's pleased that the conflict is selling more papers . " the taz shaped its own genre of daily newspaper , " said ruch , drawing a fine line between his publication and bild , germany 's most popular mass-circulation daily . " it 's a subscription paper , which means that 80 percent of the print run goes to subscribers , " he added .
" but we also want to sell individual papers , which is why the headlines have to be powerful .

the verdict could help media companies recoup revenue lost through illegal downloads . the four defendants , who ran the pirate bay , were found guilty by the stockholm district court of being accessories to the breach of copyright laws and sentenced to one year in prison . the court ordered them to pay just over 30 million swedish crowns -lrb- 2.74 million euros or $ 3.58 million -rrb- to a number of content providers , including warner bros , sony music entertainment , emi und columbia pictures . the providers had sought 117 million crowns .
the four - peter sunde , gottfrid svartholm warg , fredrik neij and carl lundstrom - were charged early last year by a swedish prosecutor .
they claim they can not be held responsible for the material exchanged via their site , which was launched in 2003 , since no copyrighted material is stored on its servers and no exchange of files actually takes place there .
but the prosecution said that by financing , programming and administering the site , the four men promoted the infringement of property rights by its users .
the defendants ' lawyer said after the trial they would appeal .
the court 's finding could affectiinternet users throughout the world , since it tries to define at what stage in the download process copyright can be infringed , and how far internet site operators can claim that they are only providing technical infrastructure .
the pirate bay , which is estimated to have 22 million users , organized the exchange of so-called bittorrent data , small packets of data which allow the transfer of much larger files direct from one computer to another . the site left it up to the person doing the downloading to clarify copyright issues , including payment .
ifpi , which represents the recording industry worldwide , hailed the decision . " the trial of the operators of the pirate bay was about defending the rights of creators , confirming the illegality of the service and creating a fair environment for legal music services that respect the rights of the creative community , " ifpi chairman john kennedy said in a statement .
but some industry specialists are skeptical about the long-term effects of the verdict .
music analyst mark mulligan of research firm forrester told reuters , " every time you get rid of one , another bigger one pops up . ...
the problem of file-sharing just keeps growing year on year , and it 's increasingly difficult for the industry to do anything about it . " mll / ncy , reuters / dpa / ap / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the verdict could help media companies recoup revenue lost through illegal downloads . the four defendants , who ran the pirate bay , were found guilty by the stockholm district court of being accessories to the breach of copyright laws and sentenced to one year in prison . the court ordered them to pay just over 30 million swedish crowns -lrb- 2.74 million euros or $ 3.58 million -rrb- to a number of content providers , including warner bros , sony music entertainment , emi und columbia pictures . the providers had sought 117 million crowns .
the four - peter sunde , gottfrid svartholm warg , fredrik neij and carl lundstrom - were charged early last year by a swedish prosecutor .
they claim they can not be held responsible for the material exchanged via their site , which was launched in 2003 , since no copyrighted material is stored on its servers and no exchange of files actually takes place there .
but the prosecution said that by financing , programming and administering the site , the four men promoted the infringement of property rights by its users .
the defendants ' lawyer said after the trial they would appeal .
the court 's finding could affectiinternet users throughout the world , since it tries to define at what stage in the download process copyright can be infringed , and how far internet site operators can claim that they are only providing technical infrastructure .
the pirate bay , which is estimated to have 22 million users , organized the exchange of so-called bittorrent data , small packets of data which allow the transfer of much larger files direct from one computer to another . the site left it up to the person doing the downloading to clarify copyright issues , including payment .
ifpi , which represents the recording industry worldwide , hailed the decision . " the trial of the operators of the pirate bay was about defending the rights of creators , confirming the illegality of the service and creating a fair environment for legal music services that respect the rights of the creative community , " ifpi chairman john kennedy said in a statement .
but some industry specialists are skeptical about the long-term effects of the verdict .
music analyst mark mulligan of research firm forrester told reuters , " every time you get rid of one , another bigger one pops up . ...

mitchell stressed the white house 's commitment to palestinian statehood . mitchell said president barack obama regarded establishing a sovereign , independent palestinian state as being in the " national interest " of the us .
he also warned that peace talks would not move forward unless israel 's new government cooperated in efforts to forge a two-state solution .
" a two-state solution is the only solution , " mitchell said after his talks with the palestinian president .
" this conflict has gone on for far too long .
the people of this region should no longer have to wait for the just peace , " he told reporters , as he wrapped up his first visit to the region since the new israeli government of hardline conservative prime minister benjamin netanyahu was sworn in .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel has been reluctant to halt settlement building activity in the west bank so far that government has refused to openly endorse a two-state solution . " until the netanyahu government unequivocally affirms its support for the two-state solution , implements israel 's " road map " obligations and abides by previous agreements , palestinians have no partner for peace , " top negotiator saeb erakat said after mitchell 's meeting in ramallah .
erekat , a top aide to abbas , also said the peace process was impossible unless israel stopped all settlement construction in the occupied west bank and house demolitions in east jerusalem .
after the talks between abbas and mitchell , erekat told reporters that abbas emphasized the palestinian commitment to both the 2003 road map peace plan and the annapolis process .
the netanyahu government has said it is bound only by the road map , but not by the annapolis process of november 2007 .

at a press conference with azerbaijan 's president , ilham aliyev , in moscow , medvedev warned that the exercises could cause " different kinds of complications " and could threaten a recent thaw in russia-nato relations .
russia 's brief war with georgia last august over georgia 's breakaway province of south ossetia had strained the relationship and caused nato to freeze high-level contacts with russia in protest .
medvedev said that nato 's impending military exercises in georgia could damage the reconciliation process .
" this decision appears to be short-sighted , " he said .
" such decisions are disappointing and do not facilitate the resumption of full-scale contacts between the russian federation and nato . "
earlier , russia 's nato mission in brussels had said it would ask the alliance to postpone the exercises .
nato announced earlier this week that the exercises in georgia would go ahead from may 6 , to improve cooperation between the western alliance and partner countries .
the exercises have been planned since the spring of 2008 , and are to involve about 1,300 personnel from 19 nato and partner countries .

the belarusian president , however , did not say whether he intended to travel to prague .
" the president did not confirm his attendance , " schwarzenberg said .
" he accepted the invitation .
it is now for him to decide who will represent belarus at the summit . "
the invitation on behalf of the eu appears to be a policy reversal from the czech republic , which has long actively backed the anti-lukashenko political opposition .
in 2002 , prague denied lukashenko a visa for a nato summit in the czech capital .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the belarusian president has been described as europe 's last dictator the belarusian leader is set to visit italy and meet pope benedict xvi in late april , a further sign of a potential thaw in relations with the west .
it will be lukashenko 's first official trip to a western country since the mid-1990s .
the administration of former us president george w. bush described belarus , under president lukashenko , europe 's " last dictatorship " .
lukashenko has been trying to improve ties with the west since quarrelling with his traditional ally russia two years ago over energy prices .
in a joint statement several belarusian opposition leaders warned the eu that inviting lukashenko to prague was a show of support for a lawless regime , and would legitimize his dictatorship .
the aim of the eastern partnership is to bind six former soviet republics closer to the 27-member eu .
the eu hopes to bring armenia , azerbaijan , belarus , georgia , moldova and ukraine closer , through increased aid and partnership deals , in return for democratic and pro-market reforms .
the plan , however , does not offer full eu membership to any of the six countries . ch / pfd , reuters / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she added that she was confident that all parties would approve the reworked statement and decide to attend the upcoming meeting in geneva .
" i feel very certain because this was so well deliberated by all groups that it will have an easy passage through the conference , " she told a news briefing at the un 's palais des nations complex , where the april 20-24 conference is to be held .
pillay said she therefore expected the conference to adopt the 17-page document .
references to the defamation of religions - another political hot potato - had also been deleted , pillay said .
she specifically thanked the palestinian delegation for allowing a compromise .
walk outs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are fears the conference could take on an anti-israel tone the conference , known as durban ii , has been plagued by discord , with canada and israel boycotting the event over fears that muslim nations will focus exclusively on the jewish state 's treatment of the palestinians .
germany and other eu countries are also mulling shunning the un talks amid concerns that the event may take on anti-semitic overtones , a senior official in berlin confirmed on thursday .
another government spokesman said that neither germany nor the eu could tolerate participating in the conference if it becomes a platform for " one-sided comments on the middle east conflict . "
the us and australia also objected to wording about israel in an earlier draft declaration and said they were not planning to send any envoys to the five-day meeting , though us state department deputy spokesman robert wood said on friday that washington was still weighing its options after viewing the recently reworked declaration .
decision pending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad will attend the upcoming un meeting the us has raised objections to a push by arab and muslim states to include a condemnation of " incitement to religious hatred " and to make " defamation of religion " illegal .
it feels those moves are an effort to limit freedom of expression in the wake of the highly controversial danish cartoons of the muslim prophet mohammad in 2006 .
a final decision on whether the us and european countries will attend is expected to come in the next couple of days .
iran 's president , mahmoud ahmadinejad , has already stated that he will attend .
the iranian president has come under heavy criticism for previously hosting a conference questioning the historical accuracy of the holocaust .
this conference is to be a follow up to a 2001 anti-racism meeting in south africa .
israel and the us walked out of that gathering after arab and muslim states attempted to add text defining zionism as racism . dfm / pfd , afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the verdict could help media companies recoup revenue lost through illegal downloads . the four defendants , who ran the pirate bay , were found guilty by the stockholm district court of being accessories to the breach of copyright laws and sentenced to one year in prison . the court ordered them to pay just over 30 million swedish crowns -lrb- 2.74 million euros or $ 3.58 million -rrb- to a number of content providers , including warner bros , sony music entertainment , emi und columbia pictures . the providers had sought 117 million crowns .
the four - peter sunde , gottfrid svartholm warg , fredrik neij and carl lundstrom - were charged early last year by a swedish prosecutor .
they claim they can not be held responsible for the material exchanged via their site , which was launched in 2003 , since no copyrighted material is stored on its servers and no exchange of files actually takes place there .
but the prosecution said that by financing , programming and administering the site , the four men promoted the infringement of property rights by its users .
the defendants ' lawyer said after the trial they would appeal .
the court 's finding could affectiinternet users throughout the world , since it tries to define at what stage in the download process copyright can be infringed , and how far internet site operators can claim that they are only providing technical infrastructure .
the pirate bay , which is estimated to have 22 million users , organized the exchange of so-called bittorrent data , small packets of data which allow the transfer of much larger files direct from one computer to another . the site left it up to the person doing the downloading to clarify copyright issues , including payment .
ifpi , which represents the recording industry worldwide , hailed the decision . " the trial of the operators of the pirate bay was about defending the rights of creators , confirming the illegality of the service and creating a fair environment for legal music services that respect the rights of the creative community , " ifpi chairman john kennedy said in a statement .

but the prosecution said that by financing , programming and administering the site , the four men promoted the infringement of property rights by its users .
the defendants ' lawyer said after the trial they would appeal .
the court 's finding could affectiinternet users throughout the world , since it tries to define at what stage in the download process copyright can be infringed , and how far internet site operators can claim that they are only providing technical infrastructure .
the pirate bay , which is estimated to have 22 million users , organized the exchange of so-called bittorrent data , small packets of data which allow the transfer of much larger files direct from one computer to another . the site left it up to the person doing the downloading to clarify copyright issues , including payment .
ifpi , which represents the recording industry worldwide , hailed the decision . " the trial of the operators of the pirate bay was about defending the rights of creators , confirming the illegality of the service and creating a fair environment for legal music services that respect the rights of the creative community , " ifpi chairman john kennedy said in a statement .
but some industry specialists are skeptical about the long-term effects of the verdict .
music analyst mark mulligan of research firm forrester told reuters , " every time you get rid of one , another bigger one pops up . ...
the problem of file-sharing just keeps growing year on year , and it 's increasingly difficult for the industry to do anything about it . " mll / ncy , reuters / dpa / ap / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in future , due to the software blocks installed by the internet service providers , consumers attempting to click on blacklisted websites are to be automatically redirected to a red stop sign .
the federal crime office has compiled the blacklist of 1,000 sites , which it updates daily .
the online companies have six months to reprogram thousands of servers and install the page blockers .
the government expects that , once these are in place , up to 450,000 attempts to access child pornography sites will be blocked daily .
german family minister ursula von der leyen proposed the law obliging isps to block child porn sites .
it is modeled on similar action taken years ago in scandinavia , britain and italy .
" if these countries can overcome any legal and technical issues and successfully fight child porn online , we can do the same in germany , " von der leyen said when she first presented the new measures .
" we do n't want to tolerate the rape of children , even babies , being widely available in germany , " she added .
the law is also intended to make it harder for criminals to profit from distributing banned pedophile material .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is what child porn surfers will soon see pop up on their computer screen not all on board , yet notably absent in the agreement are 1 & 1 , freenet and other internet providers who service the remaining 25 percent of the german market .
they say they do not want to take the risk of breaching the telecommunications secrecy law by blocking child pornography sites .
they also argue that they only provide the technical capacity to distribute information and are not responsible for content that flows through their networks .
limiting access to information is a sensitive subject in germany because of its nazi past and east german communist rule , but von der leyen said protecting children was the priority .
" the vulnerability and dignity of children is more important than mass communication , " the family minister said .
the german cabinet is expected to announce changes to the telecommunications law by summer that would force the remaining internet providers to block child porn sites .
no reason to believe child porn consumption is going down the notion that pedophiles are shadowy figures who consume child pornography at midnight is long since defunct .
in an embarrassing admission a few weeks , a social democrat lawmaker , joerg tauss , admitted that he possessed child porn .
he denied that he was a pedophile or doing anything wrong , saying he had collected the material for research .
as a lawmaker , he ought to know that laws also govern the " research " of child pornography websites . there 's no reliable information on the extent of child pornography , but the german government says access to video and other images of child pornography on the internet more than doubled from 2006 to 2007 .
there has also been an increase in the amount of violence against small children they show .
the size of those child porn rings that are exposed is , however , some indication of the scope of the problem .
on thursday , german police announced they had smashed a global ring of around 9,000 suspected pedophiles in 92 countries .
pornographic images of children were transmitted from more than 1,000 connections in germany to 8,000 ip addresses in countries including the united states , canada , new zealand , austria and switzerland .
the footage included " images of the most serious sexual abuse , even of toddlers , ” police said in a statement .
child porn users bypass " obvious " areas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : child pornography is often distributed via dvds not the internet critics say the new law is practically useless , because companies abroad can easily bypass the software block .
according to german computer magazine ct , a 27-second online video is already circulating showing how the block can be circumvented . only the " naive internet user " might possibly be stopped from accessing prohibited material , the magazine wrote .
" most child pornography material is available through private forums , like exchange sites , newsgroups , chat rooms , free areas of usenet and e-mail distribution lists , " says udo vetter , a lawyer who often represents people charged with possession of child pornography .
in an interview with ct , vetter said " many simply receive the videos on dvd via the mail , " adding that he doubted a major child pornography industry even exists .
vetter estimated that 98 percent of such images have been around for years and that the quality of most new material that surfaces seems to have been made by private individuals in a domestic setting .
others criticize the government deal with the isps as being too short-sighted .
" blocking internet pages containing child pornography is only one step towards preventing the abuse of children and only reaches " the lower echelons " of pedophiles , says legal expert axel stahl , head of the association of federal judges and prosecutors in the state of north rhine-westphalia .
stahl warned against excessively high expectations , saying that foreign companies that produce child pornography will surely find ways to bypass the new technical limitations . scarcity can actually increase demand " the new rules mean gaining access to child pornography will become more difficult , but it wo n't stop material from being published , " says otto vollmers , who represents fsm , a german industry organization that advocates voluntary self-control of the internet .
" making access technically more difficult can actually arouse greater interest . "
however , similar measures in other countries suggest that blocks so work .

she added that she was confident that all parties would approve the reworked statement and decide to attend the upcoming meeting in geneva .
" i feel very certain because this was so well deliberated by all groups that it will have an easy passage through the conference , " she told a news briefing at the un 's palais des nations complex , where the april 20-24 conference is to be held .
pillay said she therefore expected the conference to adopt the 17-page document .
references to the defamation of religions - another political hot potato - had also been deleted , pillay said .
she specifically thanked the palestinian delegation for allowing a compromise .
walk outs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are fears the conference could take on an anti-israel tone the conference , known as durban ii , has been plagued by discord , with canada and israel boycotting the event over fears that muslim nations will focus exclusively on the jewish state 's treatment of the palestinians .
germany and other eu countries are also mulling shunning the un talks amid concerns that the event may take on anti-semitic overtones , a senior official in berlin confirmed on thursday .
another government spokesman said that neither germany nor the eu could tolerate participating in the conference if it becomes a platform for " one-sided comments on the middle east conflict . "
the us and australia also objected to wording about israel in an earlier draft declaration and said they were not planning to send any envoys to the five-day meeting , though us state department deputy spokesman robert wood said on friday that washington was still weighing its options after viewing the recently reworked declaration .
decision pending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad will attend the upcoming un meeting the us has raised objections to a push by arab and muslim states to include a condemnation of " incitement to religious hatred " and to make " defamation of religion " illegal .
it feels those moves are an effort to limit freedom of expression in the wake of the highly controversial danish cartoons of the muslim prophet mohammad in 2006 .
a final decision on whether the us and european countries will attend is expected to come in the next couple of days .
iran 's president , mahmoud ahmadinejad , has already stated that he will attend .
the iranian president has come under heavy criticism for previously hosting a conference questioning the historical accuracy of the holocaust .
this conference is to be a follow up to a 2001 anti-racism meeting in south africa .
israel and the us walked out of that gathering after arab and muslim states attempted to add text defining zionism as racism . dfm / pfd , afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 17.04.2009 major german online companies agree to block child porn websites großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's family minister warns all child porn sites will be blocked on the internet german internet providers have grudgingly agreed to block websites containing child pornography .
critics say their deal with the government wo n't make much of a difference . five of germany 's eight major internet service providers - deutsche telekom 's t-online , vodafone 's arcor , kabel deutschland , telefonica 's o2 and alice 's hansenet - signed the legally binding agreement with the government and the federal crime office on friday , agreeing to install software to block consumer access to child pornography sites .
the five companies together cover around 75 percent of the german market .
in future , due to the software blocks installed by the internet service providers , consumers attempting to click on blacklisted websites are to be automatically redirected to a red stop sign .
the federal crime office has compiled the blacklist of 1,000 sites , which it updates daily .
the online companies have six months to reprogram thousands of servers and install the page blockers .
the government expects that , once these are in place , up to 450,000 attempts to access child pornography sites will be blocked daily .
german family minister ursula von der leyen proposed the law obliging isps to block child porn sites .
it is modeled on similar action taken years ago in scandinavia , britain and italy .
" if these countries can overcome any legal and technical issues and successfully fight child porn online , we can do the same in germany , " von der leyen said when she first presented the new measures .
" we do n't want to tolerate the rape of children , even babies , being widely available in germany , " she added .
the law is also intended to make it harder for criminals to profit from distributing banned pedophile material .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is what child porn surfers will soon see pop up on their computer screen not all on board , yet notably absent in the agreement are 1 & 1 , freenet and other internet providers who service the remaining 25 percent of the german market .
they say they do not want to take the risk of breaching the telecommunications secrecy law by blocking child pornography sites .
they also argue that they only provide the technical capacity to distribute information and are not responsible for content that flows through their networks .
limiting access to information is a sensitive subject in germany because of its nazi past and east german communist rule , but von der leyen said protecting children was the priority .
" the vulnerability and dignity of children is more important than mass communication , " the family minister said .
the german cabinet is expected to announce changes to the telecommunications law by summer that would force the remaining internet providers to block child porn sites .
no reason to believe child porn consumption is going down the notion that pedophiles are shadowy figures who consume child pornography at midnight is long since defunct .
in an embarrassing admission a few weeks , a social democrat lawmaker , joerg tauss , admitted that he possessed child porn .
he denied that he was a pedophile or doing anything wrong , saying he had collected the material for research .
as a lawmaker , he ought to know that laws also govern the " research " of child pornography websites . there 's no reliable information on the extent of child pornography , but the german government says access to video and other images of child pornography on the internet more than doubled from 2006 to 2007 .
there has also been an increase in the amount of violence against small children they show .
the size of those child porn rings that are exposed is , however , some indication of the scope of the problem .
on thursday , german police announced they had smashed a global ring of around 9,000 suspected pedophiles in 92 countries .
pornographic images of children were transmitted from more than 1,000 connections in germany to 8,000 ip addresses in countries including the united states , canada , new zealand , austria and switzerland .
the footage included " images of the most serious sexual abuse , even of toddlers , ” police said in a statement .
child porn users bypass " obvious " areas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : child pornography is often distributed via dvds not the internet critics say the new law is practically useless , because companies abroad can easily bypass the software block .
according to german computer magazine ct , a 27-second online video is already circulating showing how the block can be circumvented . only the " naive internet user " might possibly be stopped from accessing prohibited material , the magazine wrote .
" most child pornography material is available through private forums , like exchange sites , newsgroups , chat rooms , free areas of usenet and e-mail distribution lists , " says udo vetter , a lawyer who often represents people charged with possession of child pornography .
in an interview with ct , vetter said " many simply receive the videos on dvd via the mail , " adding that he doubted a major child pornography industry even exists .
vetter estimated that 98 percent of such images have been around for years and that the quality of most new material that surfaces seems to have been made by private individuals in a domestic setting .
others criticize the government deal with the isps as being too short-sighted .
" blocking internet pages containing child pornography is only one step towards preventing the abuse of children and only reaches " the lower echelons " of pedophiles , says legal expert axel stahl , head of the association of federal judges and prosecutors in the state of north rhine-westphalia .
stahl warned against excessively high expectations , saying that foreign companies that produce child pornography will surely find ways to bypass the new technical limitations . scarcity can actually increase demand " the new rules mean gaining access to child pornography will become more difficult , but it wo n't stop material from being published , " says otto vollmers , who represents fsm , a german industry organization that advocates voluntary self-control of the internet .
" making access technically more difficult can actually arouse greater interest . "
however , similar measures in other countries suggest that blocks so work .
" between 15,000 and 50,000 access attempts are blocked in norway and sweden every day , " said friedemann schindler of the german youth protection initiative jugendschutz.de.
" this is undermining demand and is breaking the commercial cycle . " lyf / ncy , reuters / afp / epd send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the plan could mean hundreds of thousands of moldovans having the right to settle in the eu . romanian president traian basescu told the romanian parliament on wednesday that he would fast-track moldovans for romanian citizenship following riots in the moldovan capital chisinau against election results which led to the victory of the communist party . he also proposed that moldovans with a romanian great-grandparent should in future have the right to citizenship . currently , an estimated 120,000 moldovans have romanian citizenship , which is available to moldovans with a romanian grandparent .
sixty percent of moldova 's 4.4 million people are thought to have romanian origins .
moldova was part of romania until 1940 when it was taken over by the soviet union .
after the break-up of the soviet union it became an independent state , but it remains one of the poorest countries in europe , with an average annual income of $ 1,830 in 2008 .
tension have been increasing between romania and moldova since the election on april 5 .
the communists won almost 50 percent of the vote , and the opposition has accused the authorities of cheating .
the parliament building in chisinau was set on fire during protests , and protesters were beaten and severely injured .
one man died .
the moldovan government accuses the romanians of being behind the protests and , in response , has imposed visa restrictions on romanians . on friday , an eu commission spokesman said in brussels that the eu condemned the violence , and were concerned at the reports of excesses by the security forces .
but he said he would have to wait until real decisions had been made on the nationality issue before issuing an official response .
however , the czech presidency of the bloc publicly rebuked romania after a meeting between czech eu minister alexandr vondra and romanian foreign minister cristian diaconescu .
vondra said , according the website euobserver.com , " i told my romanian colleague about our serious concerns of the possible risks arising from adopting simplified procedures for romanian citizenship . " the website quoted an unnamed eu official as describing the plans as " frightening .

" many of them are financial players , some of them are industrial players .
i would expect that work would get done in the next two to three weeks and so that process has kicked off . " gm is looking to sell off assets like opel , as well as its saab , hummer and saturn divisions , in an effort to stave off an increasingly likely bankruptcy filing . who 's buying ? henderson provided no names in the conference call , and rumors are swirling about who the investors might be - from italian carmaker fiat to sovereign wealth funds in asia and the gulf . media reports emerging from italy poured cold water on the idea fiat was among the potential buyers , as luca di montezemolo , the company 's chairman , denied any interest in opel to reporters there . fiat is currently involved in negotiations about a merger with another stricken carmaker , us-based chrysler .

at a press conference with azerbaijan 's president , ilham aliyev , in moscow , medvedev warned that the exercises could cause " different kinds of complications " and could threaten a recent thaw in russia-nato relations .
russia 's brief war with georgia last august over georgia 's breakaway province of south ossetia had strained the relationship and caused nato to freeze high-level contacts with russia in protest .
medvedev said that nato 's impending military exercises in georgia could damage the reconciliation process .
" this decision appears to be short-sighted , " he said .
" such decisions are disappointing and do not facilitate the resumption of full-scale contacts between the russian federation and nato . "
earlier , russia 's nato mission in brussels had said it would ask the alliance to postpone the exercises .
nato announced earlier this week that the exercises in georgia would go ahead from may 6 , to improve cooperation between the western alliance and partner countries .
the exercises have been planned since the spring of 2008 , and are to involve about 1,300 personnel from 19 nato and partner countries .
moscow treats any cooperation between nato and georgia with suspicion .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 17.04.2009 stuttgart , hoffenheim and the last international spot großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart have had plenty of reasons to celebrate in the second half of the season fifth place in the bundesliga means a spot in international competition .
hoffenheim , so strong in the season 's first half would settle for fifth now , but a charging stuttgart might well feel they can snatch it away . for vfb stuttgart , the low point of the season came in late november .
they 'd just lost 4-0 to wolfsburg and sat in 11th place in the table , a long fall from their last two seasons , in which they finished first and sixth , respectively .
hoping to shake things up , they fired their coach armin veh . the outlook was bleak , but in the meantime things have changed drastically .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach markus babbel has turned things around since taking over from armin veh under the leadership of new trainer markus babbel , stuttgart are sitting pretty in fifth thanks to a steady climb up the table that may not yet have reached its peak .
babbel 's squad have suffered just one loss since he took over the club in the season 's 15th week .
the swabians are currently coming off a clutch victory over hamburg that came on mario gomez 's second chance goal late in extra time . the win meant the bundesliga lead pack is now within reach of the surging stuttgart .
champions league possible stuttgart have every reason to be drooling over their prospects in the last seven weeks of the season .
they trail hertha berlin by one , and are three behind hamburg and bayern munich , who are tied on points at 51 .
the top of the table is a little more distant for stuttgart - six points to be exact - and league leaders wolfsburg are clutching dearly to the summit . even if the title remains a lofty ambition , suttgart 's situation could still improve . while fifth place would guarantee stuttgart a spot in next year 's europa league -lrb- the newly re-named successor to the uefa cup -rrb- , third place would put them in the qualifying rounds of the champions league .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gomez is stuttgart 's top scorer with 15 goals stuttgart square off this weekend with cologne , a team that 's been out-of-sorts as of late , and the critical set of games for stuttgart wo n't come until next month . they host wolfsburg four weeks before the end of the season , and then travel to bayern munich for what could be a very decisive final game of the bundesliga campaign .
hoffenheim falls from the top meanwhile , tsg hoffenheim 's season is headed precisely in the opposite direction . in the first half of the season , hoffenheim were the team to beat .
they started the season in first place , and after a couple of stumbles early on , found their form . by week nine , they regained control of the table and hardly looked back going into the winter break .
now hoffenheim ca n't seem to win a match , and have seen their dreams of a german title shrink to a struggle to salvage a uefa cup spot . hoffenheim are in sixth place , four points behind stuttgart , and with three ambitious clubs - schalke , dortmund , and leverkusen - nipping at their heels .
to fend them off , hoffenheim will have to snap its streak of nine winless matches - and soon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ibisevic , left , is still the league 's no. 2 scorer injuries and red cards perhaps hoffenheim 's biggest problem has been injuries .
especially painful was the loss of vedad ibisevic , who tore his right anterior cruciate ligament in a practice match in january . ibisevic 's role in the team 's first half success is best appreciated by looking at the current bundesliga top scorers list .
nearly four months after scoring his last league goal , ibisevic is still second on the list with 18 goals .
it 's a hole hoffenheim have been unable to fill .
discipline , too , has been a problem for hoffenheim . the worst offender is midfielder carlos eduardo , who is second on the team behind ibisevic in goals with 11 . in last weekend 's match against bochum , eduardo was given a red card for throwing an elbow at bochum 's philipp boenig .
that made two red cards this season for eduardo , who was handed a five-match suspension from the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- . he wo n't be available until hoffenheim 's penultimate game , against bayern munich .
hoffenheim 's goalie , daniel haas , was sent off shortly after eduardo against bochum for unsportsmanlike conduct and faces a three game suspension from the dfb .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after last weekend 's red card , carlos eduardo , right , is out for five matches hoffenheim needs a win to stop their free-fall in the table , and they wo n't get a better chance than this weekend against last-place karlsruhe .
after that , they 'll host hertha berlin and then face a steep uphill battle on the road against wolfsburg .
both matches provide good opportunities gain ground in the table , but the hoffenheim of the second half of the season does n't seem up to the challenge .
a spot in international competition seemed like a sure thing at the season 's midpoint , but with the way into the top five now solidly blocked by the streaking stuttgart , hoffenheim could find themselves out in the cold .

the plan could mean hundreds of thousands of moldovans having the right to settle in the eu . romanian president traian basescu told the romanian parliament on wednesday that he would fast-track moldovans for romanian citizenship following riots in the moldovan capital chisinau against election results which led to the victory of the communist party . he also proposed that moldovans with a romanian great-grandparent should in future have the right to citizenship . currently , an estimated 120,000 moldovans have romanian citizenship , which is available to moldovans with a romanian grandparent .
sixty percent of moldova 's 4.4 million people are thought to have romanian origins .
moldova was part of romania until 1940 when it was taken over by the soviet union .

but he said he would have to wait until real decisions had been made on the nationality issue before issuing an official response .
however , the czech presidency of the bloc publicly rebuked romania after a meeting between czech eu minister alexandr vondra and romanian foreign minister cristian diaconescu .
vondra said , according the website euobserver.com , " i told my romanian colleague about our serious concerns of the possible risks arising from adopting simplified procedures for romanian citizenship .

critics say their deal with the government wo n't make much of a difference . five of germany 's eight major internet service providers - deutsche telekom 's t-online , vodafone 's arcor , kabel deutschland , telefonica 's o2 and alice 's hansenet - signed the legally binding agreement with the government and the federal crime office on friday , agreeing to install software to block consumer access to child pornography sites .
the five companies together cover around 75 percent of the german market .
in future , due to the software blocks installed by the internet service providers , consumers attempting to click on blacklisted websites are to be automatically redirected to a red stop sign .
the federal crime office has compiled the blacklist of 1,000 sites , which it updates daily .
the online companies have six months to reprogram thousands of servers and install the page blockers .
the government expects that , once these are in place , up to 450,000 attempts to access child pornography sites will be blocked daily .
german family minister ursula von der leyen proposed the law obliging isps to block child porn sites .
it is modeled on similar action taken years ago in scandinavia , britain and italy .
" if these countries can overcome any legal and technical issues and successfully fight child porn online , we can do the same in germany , " von der leyen said when she first presented the new measures .
" we do n't want to tolerate the rape of children , even babies , being widely available in germany , " she added .
the law is also intended to make it harder for criminals to profit from distributing banned pedophile material .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is what child porn surfers will soon see pop up on their computer screen not all on board , yet notably absent in the agreement are 1 & 1 , freenet and other internet providers who service the remaining 25 percent of the german market .
they say they do not want to take the risk of breaching the telecommunications secrecy law by blocking child pornography sites .
they also argue that they only provide the technical capacity to distribute information and are not responsible for content that flows through their networks .
limiting access to information is a sensitive subject in germany because of its nazi past and east german communist rule , but von der leyen said protecting children was the priority .
" the vulnerability and dignity of children is more important than mass communication , " the family minister said .
the german cabinet is expected to announce changes to the telecommunications law by summer that would force the remaining internet providers to block child porn sites .
no reason to believe child porn consumption is going down the notion that pedophiles are shadowy figures who consume child pornography at midnight is long since defunct .
in an embarrassing admission a few weeks , a social democrat lawmaker , joerg tauss , admitted that he possessed child porn .
he denied that he was a pedophile or doing anything wrong , saying he had collected the material for research .
as a lawmaker , he ought to know that laws also govern the " research " of child pornography websites . there 's no reliable information on the extent of child pornography , but the german government says access to video and other images of child pornography on the internet more than doubled from 2006 to 2007 .
there has also been an increase in the amount of violence against small children they show .
the size of those child porn rings that are exposed is , however , some indication of the scope of the problem .
on thursday , german police announced they had smashed a global ring of around 9,000 suspected pedophiles in 92 countries .
pornographic images of children were transmitted from more than 1,000 connections in germany to 8,000 ip addresses in countries including the united states , canada , new zealand , austria and switzerland .
the footage included " images of the most serious sexual abuse , even of toddlers , ” police said in a statement .
child porn users bypass " obvious " areas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : child pornography is often distributed via dvds not the internet critics say the new law is practically useless , because companies abroad can easily bypass the software block .
according to german computer magazine ct , a 27-second online video is already circulating showing how the block can be circumvented . only the " naive internet user " might possibly be stopped from accessing prohibited material , the magazine wrote .
" most child pornography material is available through private forums , like exchange sites , newsgroups , chat rooms , free areas of usenet and e-mail distribution lists , " says udo vetter , a lawyer who often represents people charged with possession of child pornography .
in an interview with ct , vetter said " many simply receive the videos on dvd via the mail , " adding that he doubted a major child pornography industry even exists .
vetter estimated that 98 percent of such images have been around for years and that the quality of most new material that surfaces seems to have been made by private individuals in a domestic setting .
others criticize the government deal with the isps as being too short-sighted .
" blocking internet pages containing child pornography is only one step towards preventing the abuse of children and only reaches " the lower echelons " of pedophiles , says legal expert axel stahl , head of the association of federal judges and prosecutors in the state of north rhine-westphalia .
stahl warned against excessively high expectations , saying that foreign companies that produce child pornography will surely find ways to bypass the new technical limitations . scarcity can actually increase demand " the new rules mean gaining access to child pornography will become more difficult , but it wo n't stop material from being published , " says otto vollmers , who represents fsm , a german industry organization that advocates voluntary self-control of the internet .
" making access technically more difficult can actually arouse greater interest . "
however , similar measures in other countries suggest that blocks so work .
" between 15,000 and 50,000 access attempts are blocked in norway and sweden every day , " said friedemann schindler of the german youth protection initiative jugendschutz.de.

the plan could mean hundreds of thousands of moldovans having the right to settle in the eu . romanian president traian basescu told the romanian parliament on wednesday that he would fast-track moldovans for romanian citizenship following riots in the moldovan capital chisinau against election results which led to the victory of the communist party . he also proposed that moldovans with a romanian great-grandparent should in future have the right to citizenship . currently , an estimated 120,000 moldovans have romanian citizenship , which is available to moldovans with a romanian grandparent .
sixty percent of moldova 's 4.4 million people are thought to have romanian origins .
moldova was part of romania until 1940 when it was taken over by the soviet union .
after the break-up of the soviet union it became an independent state , but it remains one of the poorest countries in europe , with an average annual income of $ 1,830 in 2008 .
tension have been increasing between romania and moldova since the election on april 5 .
the communists won almost 50 percent of the vote , and the opposition has accused the authorities of cheating .
the parliament building in chisinau was set on fire during protests , and protesters were beaten and severely injured .
one man died .
the moldovan government accuses the romanians of being behind the protests and , in response , has imposed visa restrictions on romanians . on friday , an eu commission spokesman said in brussels that the eu condemned the violence , and were concerned at the reports of excesses by the security forces .
but he said he would have to wait until real decisions had been made on the nationality issue before issuing an official response .
however , the czech presidency of the bloc publicly rebuked romania after a meeting between czech eu minister alexandr vondra and romanian foreign minister cristian diaconescu .
vondra said , according the website euobserver.com , " i told my romanian colleague about our serious concerns of the possible risks arising from adopting simplified procedures for romanian citizenship . " the website quoted an unnamed eu official as describing the plans as " frightening .

the plan could mean hundreds of thousands of moldovans having the right to settle in the eu . romanian president traian basescu told the romanian parliament on wednesday that he would fast-track moldovans for romanian citizenship following riots in the moldovan capital chisinau against election results which led to the victory of the communist party . he also proposed that moldovans with a romanian great-grandparent should in future have the right to citizenship . currently , an estimated 120,000 moldovans have romanian citizenship , which is available to moldovans with a romanian grandparent .

but he said he would have to wait until real decisions had been made on the nationality issue before issuing an official response .
however , the czech presidency of the bloc publicly rebuked romania after a meeting between czech eu minister alexandr vondra and romanian foreign minister cristian diaconescu .
vondra said , according the website euobserver.com , " i told my romanian colleague about our serious concerns of the possible risks arising from adopting simplified procedures for romanian citizenship .

she added that she was confident that all parties would approve the reworked statement and decide to attend the upcoming meeting in geneva .
" i feel very certain because this was so well deliberated by all groups that it will have an easy passage through the conference , " she told a news briefing at the un 's palais des nations complex , where the april 20-24 conference is to be held .
pillay said she therefore expected the conference to adopt the 17-page document .
references to the defamation of religions - another political hot potato - had also been deleted , pillay said .
she specifically thanked the palestinian delegation for allowing a compromise .
walk outs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are fears the conference could take on an anti-israel tone the conference , known as durban ii , has been plagued by discord , with canada and israel boycotting the event over fears that muslim nations will focus exclusively on the jewish state 's treatment of the palestinians .
germany and other eu countries are also mulling shunning the un talks amid concerns that the event may take on anti-semitic overtones , a senior official in berlin confirmed on thursday .
another government spokesman said that neither germany nor the eu could tolerate participating in the conference if it becomes a platform for " one-sided comments on the middle east conflict . "
the us and australia also objected to wording about israel in an earlier draft declaration and said they were not planning to send any envoys to the five-day meeting , though us state department deputy spokesman robert wood said on friday that washington was still weighing its options after viewing the recently reworked declaration .
decision pending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad will attend the upcoming un meeting the us has raised objections to a push by arab and muslim states to include a condemnation of " incitement to religious hatred " and to make " defamation of religion " illegal .
it feels those moves are an effort to limit freedom of expression in the wake of the highly controversial danish cartoons of the muslim prophet mohammad in 2006 .
a final decision on whether the us and european countries will attend is expected to come in the next couple of days .
iran 's president , mahmoud ahmadinejad , has already stated that he will attend .
the iranian president has come under heavy criticism for previously hosting a conference questioning the historical accuracy of the holocaust .
this conference is to be a follow up to a 2001 anti-racism meeting in south africa .

he also warned that peace talks would not move forward unless israel 's new government cooperated in efforts to forge a two-state solution .
" a two-state solution is the only solution , " mitchell said after his talks with the palestinian president .
" this conflict has gone on for far too long .

mitchell stressed the white house 's commitment to palestinian statehood . mitchell said president barack obama regarded establishing a sovereign , independent palestinian state as being in the " national interest " of the us .
he also warned that peace talks would not move forward unless israel 's new government cooperated in efforts to forge a two-state solution .
" a two-state solution is the only solution , " mitchell said after his talks with the palestinian president .
" this conflict has gone on for far too long .
the people of this region should no longer have to wait for the just peace , " he told reporters , as he wrapped up his first visit to the region since the new israeli government of hardline conservative prime minister benjamin netanyahu was sworn in .

" until the netanyahu government unequivocally affirms its support for the two-state solution , implements israel 's " road map " obligations and abides by previous agreements , palestinians have no partner for peace , " top negotiator saeb erakat said after mitchell 's meeting in ramallah .
erekat , a top aide to abbas , also said the peace process was impossible unless israel stopped all settlement construction in the occupied west bank and house demolitions in east jerusalem .
after the talks between abbas and mitchell , erekat told reporters that abbas emphasized the palestinian commitment to both the 2003 road map peace plan and the annapolis process .
the netanyahu government has said it is bound only by the road map , but not by the annapolis process of november 2007 .

" we have been through a dark and painful chapter in our history , " obama said in a statement .
" but at a time of great challenges and disturbing disunity , nothing will be gained by spending our time and energy laying blame for the past . "
the white house also released several memos drafted under the bush administration that provided legal justification for the harsh interrogation methods .
techniques outlined in the memos include sleep deprivation , slamming detainees into walls , stripping them naked , and submitting them to waterboarding , a technique used to simulate drowning that human rights groups say amounts to torture .
the cia had previously acknowledged the waterboarding of three terrorism suspects , including khalid sheikh mohammed , the alleged mastermind of the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks .
obama emphasized that , in one of his first acts as president , he had already prohibited the use of such techniques , saying they " undermine our moral authority , and do not make us safer . "
but as he released these memos , obama said he wished to " assure those who carried out their duties relying in good faith upon legal advice from the department of justice that they will not be subject to prosecution . "
civil rights group aclu welcomed the release but said it still wanted an independent prosecutor to investigate allegations of torture during the bush administration .

" we have been through a dark and painful chapter in our history , " obama said in a statement .
" but at a time of great challenges and disturbing disunity , nothing will be gained by spending our time and energy laying blame for the past . "
the white house also released several memos drafted under the bush administration that provided legal justification for the harsh interrogation methods .
techniques outlined in the memos include sleep deprivation , slamming detainees into walls , stripping them naked , and submitting them to waterboarding , a technique used to simulate drowning that human rights groups say amounts to torture .
the cia had previously acknowledged the waterboarding of three terrorism suspects , including khalid sheikh mohammed , the alleged mastermind of the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks .
obama emphasized that , in one of his first acts as president , he had already prohibited the use of such techniques , saying they " undermine our moral authority , and do not make us safer . "
but as he released these memos , obama said he wished to " assure those who carried out their duties relying in good faith upon legal advice from the department of justice that they will not be subject to prosecution . "
civil rights group aclu welcomed the release but said it still wanted an independent prosecutor to investigate allegations of torture during the bush administration .

at a press conference with azerbaijan 's president , ilham aliyev , in moscow , medvedev warned that the exercises could cause " different kinds of complications " and could threaten a recent thaw in russia-nato relations .
russia 's brief war with georgia last august over georgia 's breakaway province of south ossetia had strained the relationship and caused nato to freeze high-level contacts with russia in protest .
medvedev said that nato 's impending military exercises in georgia could damage the reconciliation process .
" this decision appears to be short-sighted , " he said .
" such decisions are disappointing and do not facilitate the resumption of full-scale contacts between the russian federation and nato . "
earlier , russia 's nato mission in brussels had said it would ask the alliance to postpone the exercises .
nato announced earlier this week that the exercises in georgia would go ahead from may 6 , to improve cooperation between the western alliance and partner countries .
the exercises have been planned since the spring of 2008 , and are to involve about 1,300 personnel from 19 nato and partner countries .

at a press conference with azerbaijan 's president , ilham aliyev , in moscow , medvedev warned that the exercises could cause " different kinds of complications " and could threaten a recent thaw in russia-nato relations .
russia 's brief war with georgia last august over georgia 's breakaway province of south ossetia had strained the relationship and caused nato to freeze high-level contacts with russia in protest .
medvedev said that nato 's impending military exercises in georgia could damage the reconciliation process .
" this decision appears to be short-sighted , " he said .
" such decisions are disappointing and do not facilitate the resumption of full-scale contacts between the russian federation and nato . "
earlier , russia 's nato mission in brussels had said it would ask the alliance to postpone the exercises .
nato announced earlier this week that the exercises in georgia would go ahead from may 6 , to improve cooperation between the western alliance and partner countries .
the exercises have been planned since the spring of 2008 , and are to involve about 1,300 personnel from 19 nato and partner countries .
moscow treats any cooperation between nato and georgia with suspicion .
the pro-western government of the former soviet republic has pushed hard to join the alliance , but this has been met with mixed responses from current members . ch / pfd , afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the plan could mean hundreds of thousands of moldovans having the right to settle in the eu . romanian president traian basescu told the romanian parliament on wednesday that he would fast-track moldovans for romanian citizenship following riots in the moldovan capital chisinau against election results which led to the victory of the communist party . he also proposed that moldovans with a romanian great-grandparent should in future have the right to citizenship . currently , an estimated 120,000 moldovans have romanian citizenship , which is available to moldovans with a romanian grandparent .
sixty percent of moldova 's 4.4 million people are thought to have romanian origins .
moldova was part of romania until 1940 when it was taken over by the soviet union .
after the break-up of the soviet union it became an independent state , but it remains one of the poorest countries in europe , with an average annual income of $ 1,830 in 2008 .

the communists won almost 50 percent of the vote , and the opposition has accused the authorities of cheating .

but he said he would have to wait until real decisions had been made on the nationality issue before issuing an official response .
however , the czech presidency of the bloc publicly rebuked romania after a meeting between czech eu minister alexandr vondra and romanian foreign minister cristian diaconescu .
vondra said , according the website euobserver.com , " i told my romanian colleague about our serious concerns of the possible risks arising from adopting simplified procedures for romanian citizenship .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 17.04.2009 at 30 , germany 's liberal daily taz has grown up großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taz was meant to be a counterweight to the established press berlin 's tageszeitung , or taz , embodies the alternative green movement and is , for many , more of an escort to political change than just a daily newspaper .
now the smallest of germany 's national papers is turning 30 . a crucified soccer coach on the front page of the tageszeitung caught people 's attention on easter sunday .
the man on the cross was juergen klinsmann , the former head coach of germany 's national soccer team and now the coach of bayern munich . the responses were pre-programmed : klinsmann sues the taz and bayern munich bosses rant about the worst ethical derailment since the beginning of time . karl-heinz ruch , or kalle as he is known , sits back and smiles .
as the daily 's ceo , he 's pleased that the conflict is selling more papers . " the taz shaped its own genre of daily newspaper , " said ruch , drawing a fine line between his publication and bild , germany 's most popular mass-circulation daily . " it 's a subscription paper , which means that 80 percent of the print run goes to subscribers , " he added .
" but we also want to sell individual papers , which is why the headlines have to be powerful . " against all odds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruch says at the beginning no one thought the taz would succeed the first edition of the taz , which was published on april 17 , 1979 , featured a cover picture of a clown dancing on a pedestal .
from the start , it was clear that provocation rather than political correctness was its mandate . the quality of the paper back then was poor , with topics strewn randomly throughout .
one particular front page juxtaposed articles on an earthquake in yugoslavia , a wave of arrests in iran and the political critic robert havemann , who was sentenced to house arrest by the east german regime . the taz was founded as a kind of anti-press - a counterweight to the established middle-class newspapers .
for some , however , it did n't go far enough .
hermann gremlitza , of the monthly left-wing publication konkret , called the fledgling paper " baby-faz , " implying that it was n't very different from the bourgeoisie frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . " no one thought that much would become of the paper , " said ruch .
" there were n't even any experts there , it was just students , and only a handful of them had any journalism experience .
there was n't anybody from the publishing field . " riding political winds but those students had plenty to report on .
when the newspaper was founded in 1979 , it was a time of arms races , peace movements , squatters , and women 's liberation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now , a paper is n't necessarily radical for writing about the environment the taz thrust these issues into the spotlight , along with environmental protection .

now the smallest of germany 's national papers is turning 30 . a crucified soccer coach on the front page of the tageszeitung caught people 's attention on easter sunday .
the man on the cross was juergen klinsmann , the former head coach of germany 's national soccer team and now the coach of bayern munich . the responses were pre-programmed : klinsmann sues the taz and bayern munich bosses rant about the worst ethical derailment since the beginning of time . karl-heinz ruch , or kalle as he is known , sits back and smiles .
as the daily 's ceo , he 's pleased that the conflict is selling more papers .

as the daily 's ceo , he 's pleased that the conflict is selling more papers . " the taz shaped its own genre of daily newspaper , " said ruch , drawing a fine line between his publication and bild , germany 's most popular mass-circulation daily . " it 's a subscription paper , which means that 80 percent of the print run goes to subscribers , " he added .
" but we also want to sell individual papers , which is why the headlines have to be powerful . " against all odds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruch says at the beginning no one thought the taz would succeed the first edition of the taz , which was published on april 17 , 1979 , featured a cover picture of a clown dancing on a pedestal .
from the start , it was clear that provocation rather than political correctness was its mandate . the quality of the paper back then was poor , with topics strewn randomly throughout .
one particular front page juxtaposed articles on an earthquake in yugoslavia , a wave of arrests in iran and the political critic robert havemann , who was sentenced to house arrest by the east german regime . the taz was founded as a kind of anti-press - a counterweight to the established middle-class newspapers .
for some , however , it did n't go far enough .
hermann gremlitza , of the monthly left-wing publication konkret , called the fledgling paper " baby-faz , " implying that it was n't very different from the bourgeoisie frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . " no one thought that much would become of the paper , " said ruch .
" there were n't even any experts there , it was just students , and only a handful of them had any journalism experience .
there was n't anybody from the publishing field . " riding political winds but those students had plenty to report on .
when the newspaper was founded in 1979 , it was a time of arms races , peace movements , squatters , and women 's liberation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now , a paper is n't necessarily radical for writing about the environment the taz thrust these issues into the spotlight , along with environmental protection .
while green topics may be common these days in media across the spectrum , it was the taz which played a key role back then in the rise of germany 's green party , which was also founded in 1979 . in the beginning , the left-leaning paper lived from its dedicated , if not exactly professional , style of writing .
now , however , the taz is referred to as the country 's school of journalism , since many who now write for large national publications like sueddeutsche zeitung or die zeit started at the taz . " here , everyone participates in the editorial conferences , whereas at other papers only the department heads are included , " said ruch , naming the advantages of working for the taz .
" everyone has the opportunity to play a part and even write commentaries .
the important thing is that you have talent .

" we 've gotten older , had kids and the taz has moved more to the middle of society , " he said .
" many issues that the taz made public at the beginning have now become mainstream . " today , nearly all taz employees are between the ages of 30 and 40 .
it 's become something of a mix between a satirical and a serious newspaper - a high-gloss publication for those who do n't quite fit in . nevertheless , 30 years on , the taz can still get away with a sometimes disrespectful , radical or subversive approach to topics that other papers would n't touch with a 10-foot pole . author : christoph richter / kate bowen editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the verdict could help media companies recoup revenue lost through illegal downloads . the four defendants , who ran the pirate bay , were found guilty by the stockholm district court of being accessories to the breach of copyright laws and sentenced to one year in prison . the court ordered them to pay just over 30 million swedish crowns -lrb- 2.74 million euros or $ 3.58 million -rrb- to a number of content providers , including warner bros , sony music entertainment , emi und columbia pictures . the providers had sought 117 million crowns .
the four - peter sunde , gottfrid svartholm warg , fredrik neij and carl lundstrom - were charged early last year by a swedish prosecutor .
they claim they can not be held responsible for the material exchanged via their site , which was launched in 2003 , since no copyrighted material is stored on its servers and no exchange of files actually takes place there .
but the prosecution said that by financing , programming and administering the site , the four men promoted the infringement of property rights by its users .
the defendants ' lawyer said after the trial they would appeal .
the court 's finding could affectiinternet users throughout the world , since it tries to define at what stage in the download process copyright can be infringed , and how far internet site operators can claim that they are only providing technical infrastructure .
the pirate bay , which is estimated to have 22 million users , organized the exchange of so-called bittorrent data , small packets of data which allow the transfer of much larger files direct from one computer to another . the site left it up to the person doing the downloading to clarify copyright issues , including payment .
ifpi , which represents the recording industry worldwide , hailed the decision . " the trial of the operators of the pirate bay was about defending the rights of creators , confirming the illegality of the service and creating a fair environment for legal music services that respect the rights of the creative community , " ifpi chairman john kennedy said in a statement .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 17.04.2009 stuttgart , hoffenheim and the last international spot großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart have had plenty of reasons to celebrate in the second half of the season fifth place in the bundesliga means a spot in international competition .
hoffenheim , so strong in the season 's first half would settle for fifth now , but a charging stuttgart might well feel they can snatch it away . for vfb stuttgart , the low point of the season came in late november .
they 'd just lost 4-0 to wolfsburg and sat in 11th place in the table , a long fall from their last two seasons , in which they finished first and sixth , respectively .
hoping to shake things up , they fired their coach armin veh . the outlook was bleak , but in the meantime things have changed drastically .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach markus babbel has turned things around since taking over from armin veh under the leadership of new trainer markus babbel , stuttgart are sitting pretty in fifth thanks to a steady climb up the table that may not yet have reached its peak .
babbel 's squad have suffered just one loss since he took over the club in the season 's 15th week .
the swabians are currently coming off a clutch victory over hamburg that came on mario gomez 's second chance goal late in extra time . the win meant the bundesliga lead pack is now within reach of the surging stuttgart .
champions league possible stuttgart have every reason to be drooling over their prospects in the last seven weeks of the season .
they trail hertha berlin by one , and are three behind hamburg and bayern munich , who are tied on points at 51 .
the top of the table is a little more distant for stuttgart - six points to be exact - and league leaders wolfsburg are clutching dearly to the summit . even if the title remains a lofty ambition , suttgart 's situation could still improve . while fifth place would guarantee stuttgart a spot in next year 's europa league -lrb- the newly re-named successor to the uefa cup -rrb- , third place would put them in the qualifying rounds of the champions league .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gomez is stuttgart 's top scorer with 15 goals stuttgart square off this weekend with cologne , a team that 's been out-of-sorts as of late , and the critical set of games for stuttgart wo n't come until next month . they host wolfsburg four weeks before the end of the season , and then travel to bayern munich for what could be a very decisive final game of the bundesliga campaign .
hoffenheim falls from the top meanwhile , tsg hoffenheim 's season is headed precisely in the opposite direction . in the first half of the season , hoffenheim were the team to beat .
they started the season in first place , and after a couple of stumbles early on , found their form . by week nine , they regained control of the table and hardly looked back going into the winter break .
now hoffenheim ca n't seem to win a match , and have seen their dreams of a german title shrink to a struggle to salvage a uefa cup spot . hoffenheim are in sixth place , four points behind stuttgart , and with three ambitious clubs - schalke , dortmund , and leverkusen - nipping at their heels .
to fend them off , hoffenheim will have to snap its streak of nine winless matches - and soon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ibisevic , left , is still the league 's no. 2 scorer injuries and red cards perhaps hoffenheim 's biggest problem has been injuries .
especially painful was the loss of vedad ibisevic , who tore his right anterior cruciate ligament in a practice match in january . ibisevic 's role in the team 's first half success is best appreciated by looking at the current bundesliga top scorers list .
nearly four months after scoring his last league goal , ibisevic is still second on the list with 18 goals .
it 's a hole hoffenheim have been unable to fill .
discipline , too , has been a problem for hoffenheim . the worst offender is midfielder carlos eduardo , who is second on the team behind ibisevic in goals with 11 . in last weekend 's match against bochum , eduardo was given a red card for throwing an elbow at bochum 's philipp boenig .
that made two red cards this season for eduardo , who was handed a five-match suspension from the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- . he wo n't be available until hoffenheim 's penultimate game , against bayern munich .
hoffenheim 's goalie , daniel haas , was sent off shortly after eduardo against bochum for unsportsmanlike conduct and faces a three game suspension from the dfb .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after last weekend 's red card , carlos eduardo , right , is out for five matches hoffenheim needs a win to stop their free-fall in the table , and they wo n't get a better chance than this weekend against last-place karlsruhe .
after that , they 'll host hertha berlin and then face a steep uphill battle on the road against wolfsburg .
both matches provide good opportunities gain ground in the table , but the hoffenheim of the second half of the season does n't seem up to the challenge .
a spot in international competition seemed like a sure thing at the season 's midpoint , but with the way into the top five now solidly blocked by the streaking stuttgart , hoffenheim could find themselves out in the cold .

hoffenheim , so strong in the season 's first half would settle for fifth now , but a charging stuttgart might well feel they can snatch it away . for vfb stuttgart , the low point of the season came in late november .
they 'd just lost 4-0 to wolfsburg and sat in 11th place in the table , a long fall from their last two seasons , in which they finished first and sixth , respectively .
hoping to shake things up , they fired their coach armin veh . the outlook was bleak , but in the meantime things have changed drastically .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach markus babbel has turned things around since taking over from armin veh under the leadership of new trainer markus babbel , stuttgart are sitting pretty in fifth thanks to a steady climb up the table that may not yet have reached its peak .
babbel 's squad have suffered just one loss since he took over the club in the season 's 15th week .
the swabians are currently coming off a clutch victory over hamburg that came on mario gomez 's second chance goal late in extra time . the win meant the bundesliga lead pack is now within reach of the surging stuttgart .
champions league possible stuttgart have every reason to be drooling over their prospects in the last seven weeks of the season .
they trail hertha berlin by one , and are three behind hamburg and bayern munich , who are tied on points at 51 .
the top of the table is a little more distant for stuttgart - six points to be exact - and league leaders wolfsburg are clutching dearly to the summit . even if the title remains a lofty ambition , suttgart 's situation could still improve . while fifth place would guarantee stuttgart a spot in next year 's europa league -lrb- the newly re-named successor to the uefa cup -rrb- , third place would put them in the qualifying rounds of the champions league .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gomez is stuttgart 's top scorer with 15 goals stuttgart square off this weekend with cologne , a team that 's been out-of-sorts as of late , and the critical set of games for stuttgart wo n't come until next month . they host wolfsburg four weeks before the end of the season , and then travel to bayern munich for what could be a very decisive final game of the bundesliga campaign .
hoffenheim falls from the top meanwhile , tsg hoffenheim 's season is headed precisely in the opposite direction . in the first half of the season , hoffenheim were the team to beat .
they started the season in first place , and after a couple of stumbles early on , found their form . by week nine , they regained control of the table and hardly looked back going into the winter break .
now hoffenheim ca n't seem to win a match , and have seen their dreams of a german title shrink to a struggle to salvage a uefa cup spot . hoffenheim are in sixth place , four points behind stuttgart , and with three ambitious clubs - schalke , dortmund , and leverkusen - nipping at their heels .
to fend them off , hoffenheim will have to snap its streak of nine winless matches - and soon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ibisevic , left , is still the league 's no. 2 scorer injuries and red cards perhaps hoffenheim 's biggest problem has been injuries .
especially painful was the loss of vedad ibisevic , who tore his right anterior cruciate ligament in a practice match in january . ibisevic 's role in the team 's first half success is best appreciated by looking at the current bundesliga top scorers list .
nearly four months after scoring his last league goal , ibisevic is still second on the list with 18 goals .
it 's a hole hoffenheim have been unable to fill .
discipline , too , has been a problem for hoffenheim . the worst offender is midfielder carlos eduardo , who is second on the team behind ibisevic in goals with 11 . in last weekend 's match against bochum , eduardo was given a red card for throwing an elbow at bochum 's philipp boenig .
that made two red cards this season for eduardo , who was handed a five-match suspension from the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- . he wo n't be available until hoffenheim 's penultimate game , against bayern munich .
hoffenheim 's goalie , daniel haas , was sent off shortly after eduardo against bochum for unsportsmanlike conduct and faces a three game suspension from the dfb .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after last weekend 's red card , carlos eduardo , right , is out for five matches hoffenheim needs a win to stop their free-fall in the table , and they wo n't get a better chance than this weekend against last-place karlsruhe .
after that , they 'll host hertha berlin and then face a steep uphill battle on the road against wolfsburg .
both matches provide good opportunities gain ground in the table , but the hoffenheim of the second half of the season does n't seem up to the challenge .
a spot in international competition seemed like a sure thing at the season 's midpoint , but with the way into the top five now solidly blocked by the streaking stuttgart , hoffenheim could find themselves out in the cold .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 17.04.2009 major german online companies agree to block child porn websites großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's family minister warns all child porn sites will be blocked on the internet german internet providers have grudgingly agreed to block websites containing child pornography .
critics say their deal with the government wo n't make much of a difference . five of germany 's eight major internet service providers - deutsche telekom 's t-online , vodafone 's arcor , kabel deutschland , telefonica 's o2 and alice 's hansenet - signed the legally binding agreement with the government and the federal crime office on friday , agreeing to install software to block consumer access to child pornography sites .
the five companies together cover around 75 percent of the german market .
in future , due to the software blocks installed by the internet service providers , consumers attempting to click on blacklisted websites are to be automatically redirected to a red stop sign .
the federal crime office has compiled the blacklist of 1,000 sites , which it updates daily .
the online companies have six months to reprogram thousands of servers and install the page blockers .
the government expects that , once these are in place , up to 450,000 attempts to access child pornography sites will be blocked daily .
german family minister ursula von der leyen proposed the law obliging isps to block child porn sites .
it is modeled on similar action taken years ago in scandinavia , britain and italy .
" if these countries can overcome any legal and technical issues and successfully fight child porn online , we can do the same in germany , " von der leyen said when she first presented the new measures .
" we do n't want to tolerate the rape of children , even babies , being widely available in germany , " she added .
the law is also intended to make it harder for criminals to profit from distributing banned pedophile material .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is what child porn surfers will soon see pop up on their computer screen not all on board , yet notably absent in the agreement are 1 & 1 , freenet and other internet providers who service the remaining 25 percent of the german market .
they say they do not want to take the risk of breaching the telecommunications secrecy law by blocking child pornography sites .
they also argue that they only provide the technical capacity to distribute information and are not responsible for content that flows through their networks .
limiting access to information is a sensitive subject in germany because of its nazi past and east german communist rule , but von der leyen said protecting children was the priority .
" the vulnerability and dignity of children is more important than mass communication , " the family minister said .
the german cabinet is expected to announce changes to the telecommunications law by summer that would force the remaining internet providers to block child porn sites .
no reason to believe child porn consumption is going down the notion that pedophiles are shadowy figures who consume child pornography at midnight is long since defunct .
in an embarrassing admission a few weeks , a social democrat lawmaker , joerg tauss , admitted that he possessed child porn .
he denied that he was a pedophile or doing anything wrong , saying he had collected the material for research .
as a lawmaker , he ought to know that laws also govern the " research " of child pornography websites . there 's no reliable information on the extent of child pornography , but the german government says access to video and other images of child pornography on the internet more than doubled from 2006 to 2007 .
there has also been an increase in the amount of violence against small children they show .
the size of those child porn rings that are exposed is , however , some indication of the scope of the problem .
on thursday , german police announced they had smashed a global ring of around 9,000 suspected pedophiles in 92 countries .
pornographic images of children were transmitted from more than 1,000 connections in germany to 8,000 ip addresses in countries including the united states , canada , new zealand , austria and switzerland .
the footage included " images of the most serious sexual abuse , even of toddlers , ” police said in a statement .
child porn users bypass " obvious " areas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : child pornography is often distributed via dvds not the internet critics say the new law is practically useless , because companies abroad can easily bypass the software block .
according to german computer magazine ct , a 27-second online video is already circulating showing how the block can be circumvented . only the " naive internet user " might possibly be stopped from accessing prohibited material , the magazine wrote .
" most child pornography material is available through private forums , like exchange sites , newsgroups , chat rooms , free areas of usenet and e-mail distribution lists , " says udo vetter , a lawyer who often represents people charged with possession of child pornography .
in an interview with ct , vetter said " many simply receive the videos on dvd via the mail , " adding that he doubted a major child pornography industry even exists .
vetter estimated that 98 percent of such images have been around for years and that the quality of most new material that surfaces seems to have been made by private individuals in a domestic setting .
others criticize the government deal with the isps as being too short-sighted .
" blocking internet pages containing child pornography is only one step towards preventing the abuse of children and only reaches " the lower echelons " of pedophiles , says legal expert axel stahl , head of the association of federal judges and prosecutors in the state of north rhine-westphalia .
stahl warned against excessively high expectations , saying that foreign companies that produce child pornography will surely find ways to bypass the new technical limitations . scarcity can actually increase demand " the new rules mean gaining access to child pornography will become more difficult , but it wo n't stop material from being published , " says otto vollmers , who represents fsm , a german industry organization that advocates voluntary self-control of the internet .
" making access technically more difficult can actually arouse greater interest . "
however , similar measures in other countries suggest that blocks so work .
" between 15,000 and 50,000 access attempts are blocked in norway and sweden every day , " said friedemann schindler of the german youth protection initiative jugendschutz.de.

critics say their deal with the government wo n't make much of a difference . five of germany 's eight major internet service providers - deutsche telekom 's t-online , vodafone 's arcor , kabel deutschland , telefonica 's o2 and alice 's hansenet - signed the legally binding agreement with the government and the federal crime office on friday , agreeing to install software to block consumer access to child pornography sites .
the five companies together cover around 75 percent of the german market .
in future , due to the software blocks installed by the internet service providers , consumers attempting to click on blacklisted websites are to be automatically redirected to a red stop sign .
the federal crime office has compiled the blacklist of 1,000 sites , which it updates daily .
the online companies have six months to reprogram thousands of servers and install the page blockers .
the government expects that , once these are in place , up to 450,000 attempts to access child pornography sites will be blocked daily .
german family minister ursula von der leyen proposed the law obliging isps to block child porn sites .
it is modeled on similar action taken years ago in scandinavia , britain and italy .
" if these countries can overcome any legal and technical issues and successfully fight child porn online , we can do the same in germany , " von der leyen said when she first presented the new measures .
" we do n't want to tolerate the rape of children , even babies , being widely available in germany , " she added .
the law is also intended to make it harder for criminals to profit from distributing banned pedophile material .

they say they do not want to take the risk of breaching the telecommunications secrecy law by blocking child pornography sites .
they also argue that they only provide the technical capacity to distribute information and are not responsible for content that flows through their networks .
limiting access to information is a sensitive subject in germany because of its nazi past and east german communist rule , but von der leyen said protecting children was the priority .
" the vulnerability and dignity of children is more important than mass communication , " the family minister said .
the german cabinet is expected to announce changes to the telecommunications law by summer that would force the remaining internet providers to block child porn sites .
no reason to believe child porn consumption is going down the notion that pedophiles are shadowy figures who consume child pornography at midnight is long since defunct .
in an embarrassing admission a few weeks , a social democrat lawmaker , joerg tauss , admitted that he possessed child porn .
he denied that he was a pedophile or doing anything wrong , saying he had collected the material for research .
as a lawmaker , he ought to know that laws also govern the " research " of child pornography websites . there 's no reliable information on the extent of child pornography , but the german government says access to video and other images of child pornography on the internet more than doubled from 2006 to 2007 .
there has also been an increase in the amount of violence against small children they show .
the size of those child porn rings that are exposed is , however , some indication of the scope of the problem .
on thursday , german police announced they had smashed a global ring of around 9,000 suspected pedophiles in 92 countries .
pornographic images of children were transmitted from more than 1,000 connections in germany to 8,000 ip addresses in countries including the united states , canada , new zealand , austria and switzerland .

according to german computer magazine ct , a 27-second online video is already circulating showing how the block can be circumvented . only the " naive internet user " might possibly be stopped from accessing prohibited material , the magazine wrote .
" most child pornography material is available through private forums , like exchange sites , newsgroups , chat rooms , free areas of usenet and e-mail distribution lists , " says udo vetter , a lawyer who often represents people charged with possession of child pornography .
in an interview with ct , vetter said " many simply receive the videos on dvd via the mail , " adding that he doubted a major child pornography industry even exists .
vetter estimated that 98 percent of such images have been around for years and that the quality of most new material that surfaces seems to have been made by private individuals in a domestic setting .
others criticize the government deal with the isps as being too short-sighted .

police said the footage included " images of the most serious sexual abuse , even of toddlers . "
on thursday they seized more than 500 computers throughout germany , as well as more than 43,000 data storage devices and nearly 800 hard drives .
police investigations were based on internet connection records which service providers are required by law to keep . the law has been attacked by critics as an invasion of privacy . however , the police said that 377 suspects could not be identified since their connection records were deleted before the law came into effect .
most suspects have been released while the evidence is examined , but police in the northern german state of lower saxony said that one man in his 40s has been arrested on suspicion of sexually abusing two children , aged seven and 11 , in his family .
police said they had forwarded their findings to the authorities in 91 countries , and their investigations had already led to arrests abroad .

" we have been through a dark and painful chapter in our history , " obama said in a statement .
" but at a time of great challenges and disturbing disunity , nothing will be gained by spending our time and energy laying blame for the past . "
the white house also released several memos drafted under the bush administration that provided legal justification for the harsh interrogation methods .
techniques outlined in the memos include sleep deprivation , slamming detainees into walls , stripping them naked , and submitting them to waterboarding , a technique used to simulate drowning that human rights groups say amounts to torture .
the cia had previously acknowledged the waterboarding of three terrorism suspects , including khalid sheikh mohammed , the alleged mastermind of the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks .
obama emphasized that , in one of his first acts as president , he had already prohibited the use of such techniques , saying they " undermine our moral authority , and do not make us safer . "
but as he released these memos , obama said he wished to " assure those who carried out their duties relying in good faith upon legal advice from the department of justice that they will not be subject to prosecution . "
civil rights group aclu welcomed the release but said it still wanted an independent prosecutor to investigate allegations of torture during the bush administration .
" we have to look back before we can move forward as a nation , " said anthony romero , executive director of the aclu .

she added that she was confident that all parties would approve the reworked statement and decide to attend the upcoming meeting in geneva .
" i feel very certain because this was so well deliberated by all groups that it will have an easy passage through the conference , " she told a news briefing at the un 's palais des nations complex , where the april 20-24 conference is to be held .
pillay said she therefore expected the conference to adopt the 17-page document .
references to the defamation of religions - another political hot potato - had also been deleted , pillay said .
she specifically thanked the palestinian delegation for allowing a compromise .
walk outs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are fears the conference could take on an anti-israel tone the conference , known as durban ii , has been plagued by discord , with canada and israel boycotting the event over fears that muslim nations will focus exclusively on the jewish state 's treatment of the palestinians .
germany and other eu countries are also mulling shunning the un talks amid concerns that the event may take on anti-semitic overtones , a senior official in berlin confirmed on thursday .
another government spokesman said that neither germany nor the eu could tolerate participating in the conference if it becomes a platform for " one-sided comments on the middle east conflict . "
the us and australia also objected to wording about israel in an earlier draft declaration and said they were not planning to send any envoys to the five-day meeting , though us state department deputy spokesman robert wood said on friday that washington was still weighing its options after viewing the recently reworked declaration .
decision pending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad will attend the upcoming un meeting the us has raised objections to a push by arab and muslim states to include a condemnation of " incitement to religious hatred " and to make " defamation of religion " illegal .
it feels those moves are an effort to limit freedom of expression in the wake of the highly controversial danish cartoons of the muslim prophet mohammad in 2006 .
a final decision on whether the us and european countries will attend is expected to come in the next couple of days .
iran 's president , mahmoud ahmadinejad , has already stated that he will attend .
the iranian president has come under heavy criticism for previously hosting a conference questioning the historical accuracy of the holocaust .
this conference is to be a follow up to a 2001 anti-racism meeting in south africa .
israel and the us walked out of that gathering after arab and muslim states attempted to add text defining zionism as racism . dfm / pfd , afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we have been through a dark and painful chapter in our history , " obama said in a statement .
" but at a time of great challenges and disturbing disunity , nothing will be gained by spending our time and energy laying blame for the past . "
the white house also released several memos drafted under the bush administration that provided legal justification for the harsh interrogation methods .
techniques outlined in the memos include sleep deprivation , slamming detainees into walls , stripping them naked , and submitting them to waterboarding , a technique used to simulate drowning that human rights groups say amounts to torture .
the cia had previously acknowledged the waterboarding of three terrorism suspects , including khalid sheikh mohammed , the alleged mastermind of the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks .
obama emphasized that , in one of his first acts as president , he had already prohibited the use of such techniques , saying they " undermine our moral authority , and do not make us safer . "
but as he released these memos , obama said he wished to " assure those who carried out their duties relying in good faith upon legal advice from the department of justice that they will not be subject to prosecution . "

she added that she was confident that all parties would approve the reworked statement and decide to attend the upcoming meeting in geneva .
" i feel very certain because this was so well deliberated by all groups that it will have an easy passage through the conference , " she told a news briefing at the un 's palais des nations complex , where the april 20-24 conference is to be held .
pillay said she therefore expected the conference to adopt the 17-page document .
references to the defamation of religions - another political hot potato - had also been deleted , pillay said .
she specifically thanked the palestinian delegation for allowing a compromise .
walk outs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are fears the conference could take on an anti-israel tone the conference , known as durban ii , has been plagued by discord , with canada and israel boycotting the event over fears that muslim nations will focus exclusively on the jewish state 's treatment of the palestinians .
germany and other eu countries are also mulling shunning the un talks amid concerns that the event may take on anti-semitic overtones , a senior official in berlin confirmed on thursday .
another government spokesman said that neither germany nor the eu could tolerate participating in the conference if it becomes a platform for " one-sided comments on the middle east conflict . "
the us and australia also objected to wording about israel in an earlier draft declaration and said they were not planning to send any envoys to the five-day meeting , though us state department deputy spokesman robert wood said on friday that washington was still weighing its options after viewing the recently reworked declaration .
decision pending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad will attend the upcoming un meeting the us has raised objections to a push by arab and muslim states to include a condemnation of " incitement to religious hatred " and to make " defamation of religion " illegal .
it feels those moves are an effort to limit freedom of expression in the wake of the highly controversial danish cartoons of the muslim prophet mohammad in 2006 .
a final decision on whether the us and european countries will attend is expected to come in the next couple of days .
iran 's president , mahmoud ahmadinejad , has already stated that he will attend .
the iranian president has come under heavy criticism for previously hosting a conference questioning the historical accuracy of the holocaust .
this conference is to be a follow up to a 2001 anti-racism meeting in south africa .

at a press conference with azerbaijan 's president , ilham aliyev , in moscow , medvedev warned that the exercises could cause " different kinds of complications " and could threaten a recent thaw in russia-nato relations .
russia 's brief war with georgia last august over georgia 's breakaway province of south ossetia had strained the relationship and caused nato to freeze high-level contacts with russia in protest .
medvedev said that nato 's impending military exercises in georgia could damage the reconciliation process .
" this decision appears to be short-sighted , " he said .
" such decisions are disappointing and do not facilitate the resumption of full-scale contacts between the russian federation and nato . "
earlier , russia 's nato mission in brussels had said it would ask the alliance to postpone the exercises .
nato announced earlier this week that the exercises in georgia would go ahead from may 6 , to improve cooperation between the western alliance and partner countries .
the exercises have been planned since the spring of 2008 , and are to involve about 1,300 personnel from 19 nato and partner countries .

at a press conference with azerbaijan 's president , ilham aliyev , in moscow , medvedev warned that the exercises could cause " different kinds of complications " and could threaten a recent thaw in russia-nato relations .
russia 's brief war with georgia last august over georgia 's breakaway province of south ossetia had strained the relationship and caused nato to freeze high-level contacts with russia in protest .
medvedev said that nato 's impending military exercises in georgia could damage the reconciliation process .
" this decision appears to be short-sighted , " he said .
" such decisions are disappointing and do not facilitate the resumption of full-scale contacts between the russian federation and nato . "
earlier , russia 's nato mission in brussels had said it would ask the alliance to postpone the exercises .
nato announced earlier this week that the exercises in georgia would go ahead from may 6 , to improve cooperation between the western alliance and partner countries .
the exercises have been planned since the spring of 2008 , and are to involve about 1,300 personnel from 19 nato and partner countries .

she added that she was confident that all parties would approve the reworked statement and decide to attend the upcoming meeting in geneva .
" i feel very certain because this was so well deliberated by all groups that it will have an easy passage through the conference , " she told a news briefing at the un 's palais des nations complex , where the april 20-24 conference is to be held .
pillay said she therefore expected the conference to adopt the 17-page document .
references to the defamation of religions - another political hot potato - had also been deleted , pillay said .
she specifically thanked the palestinian delegation for allowing a compromise .
walk outs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are fears the conference could take on an anti-israel tone the conference , known as durban ii , has been plagued by discord , with canada and israel boycotting the event over fears that muslim nations will focus exclusively on the jewish state 's treatment of the palestinians .
germany and other eu countries are also mulling shunning the un talks amid concerns that the event may take on anti-semitic overtones , a senior official in berlin confirmed on thursday .
another government spokesman said that neither germany nor the eu could tolerate participating in the conference if it becomes a platform for " one-sided comments on the middle east conflict . "
the us and australia also objected to wording about israel in an earlier draft declaration and said they were not planning to send any envoys to the five-day meeting , though us state department deputy spokesman robert wood said on friday that washington was still weighing its options after viewing the recently reworked declaration .
decision pending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad will attend the upcoming un meeting the us has raised objections to a push by arab and muslim states to include a condemnation of " incitement to religious hatred " and to make " defamation of religion " illegal .
it feels those moves are an effort to limit freedom of expression in the wake of the highly controversial danish cartoons of the muslim prophet mohammad in 2006 .
a final decision on whether the us and european countries will attend is expected to come in the next couple of days .
iran 's president , mahmoud ahmadinejad , has already stated that he will attend .
the iranian president has come under heavy criticism for previously hosting a conference questioning the historical accuracy of the holocaust .
this conference is to be a follow up to a 2001 anti-racism meeting in south africa .

mitchell stressed the white house 's commitment to palestinian statehood . mitchell said president barack obama regarded establishing a sovereign , independent palestinian state as being in the " national interest " of the us .
he also warned that peace talks would not move forward unless israel 's new government cooperated in efforts to forge a two-state solution .
" a two-state solution is the only solution , " mitchell said after his talks with the palestinian president .
" this conflict has gone on for far too long .

the belarusian president , however , did not say whether he intended to travel to prague .
" the president did not confirm his attendance , " schwarzenberg said .
" he accepted the invitation .
it is now for him to decide who will represent belarus at the summit . "
the invitation on behalf of the eu appears to be a policy reversal from the czech republic , which has long actively backed the anti-lukashenko political opposition .
in 2002 , prague denied lukashenko a visa for a nato summit in the czech capital .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the belarusian president has been described as europe 's last dictator the belarusian leader is set to visit italy and meet pope benedict xvi in late april , a further sign of a potential thaw in relations with the west .
it will be lukashenko 's first official trip to a western country since the mid-1990s .
the administration of former us president george w. bush described belarus , under president lukashenko , europe 's " last dictatorship " .
lukashenko has been trying to improve ties with the west since quarrelling with his traditional ally russia two years ago over energy prices .
in a joint statement several belarusian opposition leaders warned the eu that inviting lukashenko to prague was a show of support for a lawless regime , and would legitimize his dictatorship .
the aim of the eastern partnership is to bind six former soviet republics closer to the 27-member eu .
the eu hopes to bring armenia , azerbaijan , belarus , georgia , moldova and ukraine closer , through increased aid and partnership deals , in return for democratic and pro-market reforms .
the plan , however , does not offer full eu membership to any of the six countries . ch / pfd , reuters / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hoffenheim , so strong in the season 's first half would settle for fifth now , but a charging stuttgart might well feel they can snatch it away . for vfb stuttgart , the low point of the season came in late november .
they 'd just lost 4-0 to wolfsburg and sat in 11th place in the table , a long fall from their last two seasons , in which they finished first and sixth , respectively .
hoping to shake things up , they fired their coach armin veh . the outlook was bleak , but in the meantime things have changed drastically .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach markus babbel has turned things around since taking over from armin veh under the leadership of new trainer markus babbel , stuttgart are sitting pretty in fifth thanks to a steady climb up the table that may not yet have reached its peak .
babbel 's squad have suffered just one loss since he took over the club in the season 's 15th week .
the swabians are currently coming off a clutch victory over hamburg that came on mario gomez 's second chance goal late in extra time . the win meant the bundesliga lead pack is now within reach of the surging stuttgart .
champions league possible stuttgart have every reason to be drooling over their prospects in the last seven weeks of the season .
they trail hertha berlin by one , and are three behind hamburg and bayern munich , who are tied on points at 51 .
the top of the table is a little more distant for stuttgart - six points to be exact - and league leaders wolfsburg are clutching dearly to the summit . even if the title remains a lofty ambition , suttgart 's situation could still improve . while fifth place would guarantee stuttgart a spot in next year 's europa league -lrb- the newly re-named successor to the uefa cup -rrb- , third place would put them in the qualifying rounds of the champions league .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gomez is stuttgart 's top scorer with 15 goals stuttgart square off this weekend with cologne , a team that 's been out-of-sorts as of late , and the critical set of games for stuttgart wo n't come until next month . they host wolfsburg four weeks before the end of the season , and then travel to bayern munich for what could be a very decisive final game of the bundesliga campaign .
hoffenheim falls from the top meanwhile , tsg hoffenheim 's season is headed precisely in the opposite direction . in the first half of the season , hoffenheim were the team to beat .
they started the season in first place , and after a couple of stumbles early on , found their form . by week nine , they regained control of the table and hardly looked back going into the winter break .
now hoffenheim ca n't seem to win a match , and have seen their dreams of a german title shrink to a struggle to salvage a uefa cup spot . hoffenheim are in sixth place , four points behind stuttgart , and with three ambitious clubs - schalke , dortmund , and leverkusen - nipping at their heels .
to fend them off , hoffenheim will have to snap its streak of nine winless matches - and soon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ibisevic , left , is still the league 's no. 2 scorer injuries and red cards perhaps hoffenheim 's biggest problem has been injuries .
especially painful was the loss of vedad ibisevic , who tore his right anterior cruciate ligament in a practice match in january . ibisevic 's role in the team 's first half success is best appreciated by looking at the current bundesliga top scorers list .
nearly four months after scoring his last league goal , ibisevic is still second on the list with 18 goals .
it 's a hole hoffenheim have been unable to fill .
discipline , too , has been a problem for hoffenheim . the worst offender is midfielder carlos eduardo , who is second on the team behind ibisevic in goals with 11 . in last weekend 's match against bochum , eduardo was given a red card for throwing an elbow at bochum 's philipp boenig .
that made two red cards this season for eduardo , who was handed a five-match suspension from the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- . he wo n't be available until hoffenheim 's penultimate game , against bayern munich .
hoffenheim 's goalie , daniel haas , was sent off shortly after eduardo against bochum for unsportsmanlike conduct and faces a three game suspension from the dfb .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after last weekend 's red card , carlos eduardo , right , is out for five matches hoffenheim needs a win to stop their free-fall in the table , and they wo n't get a better chance than this weekend against last-place karlsruhe .
after that , they 'll host hertha berlin and then face a steep uphill battle on the road against wolfsburg .
both matches provide good opportunities gain ground in the table , but the hoffenheim of the second half of the season does n't seem up to the challenge .
a spot in international competition seemed like a sure thing at the season 's midpoint , but with the way into the top five now solidly blocked by the streaking stuttgart , hoffenheim could find themselves out in the cold .

police said the footage included " images of the most serious sexual abuse , even of toddlers . "
on thursday they seized more than 500 computers throughout germany , as well as more than 43,000 data storage devices and nearly 800 hard drives .
police investigations were based on internet connection records which service providers are required by law to keep . the law has been attacked by critics as an invasion of privacy . however , the police said that 377 suspects could not be identified since their connection records were deleted before the law came into effect .
most suspects have been released while the evidence is examined , but police in the northern german state of lower saxony said that one man in his 40s has been arrested on suspicion of sexually abusing two children , aged seven and 11 , in his family .
police said they had forwarded their findings to the authorities in 91 countries , and their investigations had already led to arrests abroad .
the move comes as german police prepare to sign agreements with internet service providers on friday to make it harder to access websites posting child pornography . mll / ncy , afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now the smallest of germany 's national papers is turning 30 . a crucified soccer coach on the front page of the tageszeitung caught people 's attention on easter sunday .
the man on the cross was juergen klinsmann , the former head coach of germany 's national soccer team and now the coach of bayern munich . the responses were pre-programmed : klinsmann sues the taz and bayern munich bosses rant about the worst ethical derailment since the beginning of time . karl-heinz ruch , or kalle as he is known , sits back and smiles .
as the daily 's ceo , he 's pleased that the conflict is selling more papers . " the taz shaped its own genre of daily newspaper , " said ruch , drawing a fine line between his publication and bild , germany 's most popular mass-circulation daily . " it 's a subscription paper , which means that 80 percent of the print run goes to subscribers , " he added .
" but we also want to sell individual papers , which is why the headlines have to be powerful . " against all odds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruch says at the beginning no one thought the taz would succeed the first edition of the taz , which was published on april 17 , 1979 , featured a cover picture of a clown dancing on a pedestal .
from the start , it was clear that provocation rather than political correctness was its mandate . the quality of the paper back then was poor , with topics strewn randomly throughout .
one particular front page juxtaposed articles on an earthquake in yugoslavia , a wave of arrests in iran and the political critic robert havemann , who was sentenced to house arrest by the east german regime . the taz was founded as a kind of anti-press - a counterweight to the established middle-class newspapers .
for some , however , it did n't go far enough .
hermann gremlitza , of the monthly left-wing publication konkret , called the fledgling paper " baby-faz , " implying that it was n't very different from the bourgeoisie frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . " no one thought that much would become of the paper , " said ruch .
" there were n't even any experts there , it was just students , and only a handful of them had any journalism experience .
there was n't anybody from the publishing field . " riding political winds but those students had plenty to report on .
when the newspaper was founded in 1979 , it was a time of arms races , peace movements , squatters , and women 's liberation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now , a paper is n't necessarily radical for writing about the environment the taz thrust these issues into the spotlight , along with environmental protection .
while green topics may be common these days in media across the spectrum , it was the taz which played a key role back then in the rise of germany 's green party , which was also founded in 1979 . in the beginning , the left-leaning paper lived from its dedicated , if not exactly professional , style of writing .
now , however , the taz is referred to as the country 's school of journalism , since many who now write for large national publications like sueddeutsche zeitung or die zeit started at the taz . " here , everyone participates in the editorial conferences , whereas at other papers only the department heads are included , " said ruch , naming the advantages of working for the taz .
" everyone has the opportunity to play a part and even write commentaries .
the important thing is that you have talent . " the taz grows up randy kaufman , an american who has worked for the taz as an archivist since 1983 , said the once leftist paper has gradually slid toward the center of the spectrum . " we 've gotten older , had kids and the taz has moved more to the middle of society , " he said .
" many issues that the taz made public at the beginning have now become mainstream . " today , nearly all taz employees are between the ages of 30 and 40 .
it 's become something of a mix between a satirical and a serious newspaper - a high-gloss publication for those who do n't quite fit in . nevertheless , 30 years on , the taz can still get away with a sometimes disrespectful , radical or subversive approach to topics that other papers would n't touch with a 10-foot pole . author : christoph richter / kate bowen editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now the smallest of germany 's national papers is turning 30 . a crucified soccer coach on the front page of the tageszeitung caught people 's attention on easter sunday .
the man on the cross was juergen klinsmann , the former head coach of germany 's national soccer team and now the coach of bayern munich . the responses were pre-programmed : klinsmann sues the taz and bayern munich bosses rant about the worst ethical derailment since the beginning of time . karl-heinz ruch , or kalle as he is known , sits back and smiles .
as the daily 's ceo , he 's pleased that the conflict is selling more papers . " the taz shaped its own genre of daily newspaper , " said ruch , drawing a fine line between his publication and bild , germany 's most popular mass-circulation daily . " it 's a subscription paper , which means that 80 percent of the print run goes to subscribers , " he added .
" but we also want to sell individual papers , which is why the headlines have to be powerful .

the verdict could help media companies recoup revenue lost through illegal downloads . the four defendants , who ran the pirate bay , were found guilty by the stockholm district court of being accessories to the breach of copyright laws and sentenced to one year in prison . the court ordered them to pay just over 30 million swedish crowns -lrb- 2.74 million euros or $ 3.58 million -rrb- to a number of content providers , including warner bros , sony music entertainment , emi und columbia pictures . the providers had sought 117 million crowns .
the four - peter sunde , gottfrid svartholm warg , fredrik neij and carl lundstrom - were charged early last year by a swedish prosecutor .
they claim they can not be held responsible for the material exchanged via their site , which was launched in 2003 , since no copyrighted material is stored on its servers and no exchange of files actually takes place there .
but the prosecution said that by financing , programming and administering the site , the four men promoted the infringement of property rights by its users .
the defendants ' lawyer said after the trial they would appeal .
the court 's finding could affectiinternet users throughout the world , since it tries to define at what stage in the download process copyright can be infringed , and how far internet site operators can claim that they are only providing technical infrastructure .
the pirate bay , which is estimated to have 22 million users , organized the exchange of so-called bittorrent data , small packets of data which allow the transfer of much larger files direct from one computer to another . the site left it up to the person doing the downloading to clarify copyright issues , including payment .
ifpi , which represents the recording industry worldwide , hailed the decision . " the trial of the operators of the pirate bay was about defending the rights of creators , confirming the illegality of the service and creating a fair environment for legal music services that respect the rights of the creative community , " ifpi chairman john kennedy said in a statement .

the verdict could help media companies recoup revenue lost through illegal downloads . the four defendants , who ran the pirate bay , were found guilty by the stockholm district court of being accessories to the breach of copyright laws and sentenced to one year in prison . the court ordered them to pay just over 30 million swedish crowns -lrb- 2.74 million euros or $ 3.58 million -rrb- to a number of content providers , including warner bros , sony music entertainment , emi und columbia pictures . the providers had sought 117 million crowns .
the four - peter sunde , gottfrid svartholm warg , fredrik neij and carl lundstrom - were charged early last year by a swedish prosecutor .
they claim they can not be held responsible for the material exchanged via their site , which was launched in 2003 , since no copyrighted material is stored on its servers and no exchange of files actually takes place there .
but the prosecution said that by financing , programming and administering the site , the four men promoted the infringement of property rights by its users .
the defendants ' lawyer said after the trial they would appeal .
the court 's finding could affectiinternet users throughout the world , since it tries to define at what stage in the download process copyright can be infringed , and how far internet site operators can claim that they are only providing technical infrastructure .
the pirate bay , which is estimated to have 22 million users , organized the exchange of so-called bittorrent data , small packets of data which allow the transfer of much larger files direct from one computer to another . the site left it up to the person doing the downloading to clarify copyright issues , including payment .
ifpi , which represents the recording industry worldwide , hailed the decision . " the trial of the operators of the pirate bay was about defending the rights of creators , confirming the illegality of the service and creating a fair environment for legal music services that respect the rights of the creative community , " ifpi chairman john kennedy said in a statement .
but some industry specialists are skeptical about the long-term effects of the verdict .
music analyst mark mulligan of research firm forrester told reuters , " every time you get rid of one , another bigger one pops up . ...

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 17.04.2009 stuttgart , hoffenheim and the last international spot großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart have had plenty of reasons to celebrate in the second half of the season fifth place in the bundesliga means a spot in international competition .
hoffenheim , so strong in the season 's first half would settle for fifth now , but a charging stuttgart might well feel they can snatch it away . for vfb stuttgart , the low point of the season came in late november .
they 'd just lost 4-0 to wolfsburg and sat in 11th place in the table , a long fall from their last two seasons , in which they finished first and sixth , respectively .
hoping to shake things up , they fired their coach armin veh . the outlook was bleak , but in the meantime things have changed drastically .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach markus babbel has turned things around since taking over from armin veh under the leadership of new trainer markus babbel , stuttgart are sitting pretty in fifth thanks to a steady climb up the table that may not yet have reached its peak .
babbel 's squad have suffered just one loss since he took over the club in the season 's 15th week .
the swabians are currently coming off a clutch victory over hamburg that came on mario gomez 's second chance goal late in extra time . the win meant the bundesliga lead pack is now within reach of the surging stuttgart .
champions league possible stuttgart have every reason to be drooling over their prospects in the last seven weeks of the season .
they trail hertha berlin by one , and are three behind hamburg and bayern munich , who are tied on points at 51 .
the top of the table is a little more distant for stuttgart - six points to be exact - and league leaders wolfsburg are clutching dearly to the summit . even if the title remains a lofty ambition , suttgart 's situation could still improve . while fifth place would guarantee stuttgart a spot in next year 's europa league -lrb- the newly re-named successor to the uefa cup -rrb- , third place would put them in the qualifying rounds of the champions league .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gomez is stuttgart 's top scorer with 15 goals stuttgart square off this weekend with cologne , a team that 's been out-of-sorts as of late , and the critical set of games for stuttgart wo n't come until next month . they host wolfsburg four weeks before the end of the season , and then travel to bayern munich for what could be a very decisive final game of the bundesliga campaign .
hoffenheim falls from the top meanwhile , tsg hoffenheim 's season is headed precisely in the opposite direction . in the first half of the season , hoffenheim were the team to beat .
they started the season in first place , and after a couple of stumbles early on , found their form . by week nine , they regained control of the table and hardly looked back going into the winter break .
now hoffenheim ca n't seem to win a match , and have seen their dreams of a german title shrink to a struggle to salvage a uefa cup spot . hoffenheim are in sixth place , four points behind stuttgart , and with three ambitious clubs - schalke , dortmund , and leverkusen - nipping at their heels .
to fend them off , hoffenheim will have to snap its streak of nine winless matches - and soon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ibisevic , left , is still the league 's no. 2 scorer injuries and red cards perhaps hoffenheim 's biggest problem has been injuries .
especially painful was the loss of vedad ibisevic , who tore his right anterior cruciate ligament in a practice match in january . ibisevic 's role in the team 's first half success is best appreciated by looking at the current bundesliga top scorers list .
nearly four months after scoring his last league goal , ibisevic is still second on the list with 18 goals .
it 's a hole hoffenheim have been unable to fill .
discipline , too , has been a problem for hoffenheim . the worst offender is midfielder carlos eduardo , who is second on the team behind ibisevic in goals with 11 . in last weekend 's match against bochum , eduardo was given a red card for throwing an elbow at bochum 's philipp boenig .
that made two red cards this season for eduardo , who was handed a five-match suspension from the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- . he wo n't be available until hoffenheim 's penultimate game , against bayern munich .
hoffenheim 's goalie , daniel haas , was sent off shortly after eduardo against bochum for unsportsmanlike conduct and faces a three game suspension from the dfb .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after last weekend 's red card , carlos eduardo , right , is out for five matches hoffenheim needs a win to stop their free-fall in the table , and they wo n't get a better chance than this weekend against last-place karlsruhe .
after that , they 'll host hertha berlin and then face a steep uphill battle on the road against wolfsburg .
both matches provide good opportunities gain ground in the table , but the hoffenheim of the second half of the season does n't seem up to the challenge .
a spot in international competition seemed like a sure thing at the season 's midpoint , but with the way into the top five now solidly blocked by the streaking stuttgart , hoffenheim could find themselves out in the cold .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 17.04.2009 stuttgart , hoffenheim and the last international spot großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart have had plenty of reasons to celebrate in the second half of the season fifth place in the bundesliga means a spot in international competition .
hoffenheim , so strong in the season 's first half would settle for fifth now , but a charging stuttgart might well feel they can snatch it away . for vfb stuttgart , the low point of the season came in late november .
they 'd just lost 4-0 to wolfsburg and sat in 11th place in the table , a long fall from their last two seasons , in which they finished first and sixth , respectively .
hoping to shake things up , they fired their coach armin veh . the outlook was bleak , but in the meantime things have changed drastically .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach markus babbel has turned things around since taking over from armin veh under the leadership of new trainer markus babbel , stuttgart are sitting pretty in fifth thanks to a steady climb up the table that may not yet have reached its peak .
babbel 's squad have suffered just one loss since he took over the club in the season 's 15th week .
the swabians are currently coming off a clutch victory over hamburg that came on mario gomez 's second chance goal late in extra time . the win meant the bundesliga lead pack is now within reach of the surging stuttgart .
champions league possible stuttgart have every reason to be drooling over their prospects in the last seven weeks of the season .
they trail hertha berlin by one , and are three behind hamburg and bayern munich , who are tied on points at 51 .
the top of the table is a little more distant for stuttgart - six points to be exact - and league leaders wolfsburg are clutching dearly to the summit . even if the title remains a lofty ambition , suttgart 's situation could still improve . while fifth place would guarantee stuttgart a spot in next year 's europa league -lrb- the newly re-named successor to the uefa cup -rrb- , third place would put them in the qualifying rounds of the champions league .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gomez is stuttgart 's top scorer with 15 goals stuttgart square off this weekend with cologne , a team that 's been out-of-sorts as of late , and the critical set of games for stuttgart wo n't come until next month . they host wolfsburg four weeks before the end of the season , and then travel to bayern munich for what could be a very decisive final game of the bundesliga campaign .
hoffenheim falls from the top meanwhile , tsg hoffenheim 's season is headed precisely in the opposite direction . in the first half of the season , hoffenheim were the team to beat .
they started the season in first place , and after a couple of stumbles early on , found their form . by week nine , they regained control of the table and hardly looked back going into the winter break .
now hoffenheim ca n't seem to win a match , and have seen their dreams of a german title shrink to a struggle to salvage a uefa cup spot . hoffenheim are in sixth place , four points behind stuttgart , and with three ambitious clubs - schalke , dortmund , and leverkusen - nipping at their heels .
to fend them off , hoffenheim will have to snap its streak of nine winless matches - and soon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ibisevic , left , is still the league 's no. 2 scorer injuries and red cards perhaps hoffenheim 's biggest problem has been injuries .
especially painful was the loss of vedad ibisevic , who tore his right anterior cruciate ligament in a practice match in january . ibisevic 's role in the team 's first half success is best appreciated by looking at the current bundesliga top scorers list .
nearly four months after scoring his last league goal , ibisevic is still second on the list with 18 goals .
it 's a hole hoffenheim have been unable to fill .
discipline , too , has been a problem for hoffenheim . the worst offender is midfielder carlos eduardo , who is second on the team behind ibisevic in goals with 11 . in last weekend 's match against bochum , eduardo was given a red card for throwing an elbow at bochum 's philipp boenig .
that made two red cards this season for eduardo , who was handed a five-match suspension from the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- . he wo n't be available until hoffenheim 's penultimate game , against bayern munich .
hoffenheim 's goalie , daniel haas , was sent off shortly after eduardo against bochum for unsportsmanlike conduct and faces a three game suspension from the dfb .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after last weekend 's red card , carlos eduardo , right , is out for five matches hoffenheim needs a win to stop their free-fall in the table , and they wo n't get a better chance than this weekend against last-place karlsruhe .
after that , they 'll host hertha berlin and then face a steep uphill battle on the road against wolfsburg .
both matches provide good opportunities gain ground in the table , but the hoffenheim of the second half of the season does n't seem up to the challenge .
a spot in international competition seemed like a sure thing at the season 's midpoint , but with the way into the top five now solidly blocked by the streaking stuttgart , hoffenheim could find themselves out in the cold .

she added that she was confident that all parties would approve the reworked statement and decide to attend the upcoming meeting in geneva .
" i feel very certain because this was so well deliberated by all groups that it will have an easy passage through the conference , " she told a news briefing at the un 's palais des nations complex , where the april 20-24 conference is to be held .
pillay said she therefore expected the conference to adopt the 17-page document .
references to the defamation of religions - another political hot potato - had also been deleted , pillay said .
she specifically thanked the palestinian delegation for allowing a compromise .
walk outs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are fears the conference could take on an anti-israel tone the conference , known as durban ii , has been plagued by discord , with canada and israel boycotting the event over fears that muslim nations will focus exclusively on the jewish state 's treatment of the palestinians .
germany and other eu countries are also mulling shunning the un talks amid concerns that the event may take on anti-semitic overtones , a senior official in berlin confirmed on thursday .
another government spokesman said that neither germany nor the eu could tolerate participating in the conference if it becomes a platform for " one-sided comments on the middle east conflict . "
the us and australia also objected to wording about israel in an earlier draft declaration and said they were not planning to send any envoys to the five-day meeting , though us state department deputy spokesman robert wood said on friday that washington was still weighing its options after viewing the recently reworked declaration .
decision pending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad will attend the upcoming un meeting the us has raised objections to a push by arab and muslim states to include a condemnation of " incitement to religious hatred " and to make " defamation of religion " illegal .
it feels those moves are an effort to limit freedom of expression in the wake of the highly controversial danish cartoons of the muslim prophet mohammad in 2006 .
a final decision on whether the us and european countries will attend is expected to come in the next couple of days .
iran 's president , mahmoud ahmadinejad , has already stated that he will attend .
the iranian president has come under heavy criticism for previously hosting a conference questioning the historical accuracy of the holocaust .
this conference is to be a follow up to a 2001 anti-racism meeting in south africa .

critics say their deal with the government wo n't make much of a difference . five of germany 's eight major internet service providers - deutsche telekom 's t-online , vodafone 's arcor , kabel deutschland , telefonica 's o2 and alice 's hansenet - signed the legally binding agreement with the government and the federal crime office on friday , agreeing to install software to block consumer access to child pornography sites .
the five companies together cover around 75 percent of the german market .
in future , due to the software blocks installed by the internet service providers , consumers attempting to click on blacklisted websites are to be automatically redirected to a red stop sign .
the federal crime office has compiled the blacklist of 1,000 sites , which it updates daily .
the online companies have six months to reprogram thousands of servers and install the page blockers .
the government expects that , once these are in place , up to 450,000 attempts to access child pornography sites will be blocked daily .
german family minister ursula von der leyen proposed the law obliging isps to block child porn sites .
it is modeled on similar action taken years ago in scandinavia , britain and italy .
" if these countries can overcome any legal and technical issues and successfully fight child porn online , we can do the same in germany , " von der leyen said when she first presented the new measures .
" we do n't want to tolerate the rape of children , even babies , being widely available in germany , " she added .
the law is also intended to make it harder for criminals to profit from distributing banned pedophile material .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is what child porn surfers will soon see pop up on their computer screen not all on board , yet notably absent in the agreement are 1 & 1 , freenet and other internet providers who service the remaining 25 percent of the german market .
they say they do not want to take the risk of breaching the telecommunications secrecy law by blocking child pornography sites .
they also argue that they only provide the technical capacity to distribute information and are not responsible for content that flows through their networks .
limiting access to information is a sensitive subject in germany because of its nazi past and east german communist rule , but von der leyen said protecting children was the priority .
" the vulnerability and dignity of children is more important than mass communication , " the family minister said .
the german cabinet is expected to announce changes to the telecommunications law by summer that would force the remaining internet providers to block child porn sites .
no reason to believe child porn consumption is going down the notion that pedophiles are shadowy figures who consume child pornography at midnight is long since defunct .
in an embarrassing admission a few weeks , a social democrat lawmaker , joerg tauss , admitted that he possessed child porn .
he denied that he was a pedophile or doing anything wrong , saying he had collected the material for research .
as a lawmaker , he ought to know that laws also govern the " research " of child pornography websites . there 's no reliable information on the extent of child pornography , but the german government says access to video and other images of child pornography on the internet more than doubled from 2006 to 2007 .
there has also been an increase in the amount of violence against small children they show .
the size of those child porn rings that are exposed is , however , some indication of the scope of the problem .
on thursday , german police announced they had smashed a global ring of around 9,000 suspected pedophiles in 92 countries .
pornographic images of children were transmitted from more than 1,000 connections in germany to 8,000 ip addresses in countries including the united states , canada , new zealand , austria and switzerland .
the footage included " images of the most serious sexual abuse , even of toddlers , ” police said in a statement .
child porn users bypass " obvious " areas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : child pornography is often distributed via dvds not the internet critics say the new law is practically useless , because companies abroad can easily bypass the software block .
according to german computer magazine ct , a 27-second online video is already circulating showing how the block can be circumvented . only the " naive internet user " might possibly be stopped from accessing prohibited material , the magazine wrote .
" most child pornography material is available through private forums , like exchange sites , newsgroups , chat rooms , free areas of usenet and e-mail distribution lists , " says udo vetter , a lawyer who often represents people charged with possession of child pornography .
in an interview with ct , vetter said " many simply receive the videos on dvd via the mail , " adding that he doubted a major child pornography industry even exists .
vetter estimated that 98 percent of such images have been around for years and that the quality of most new material that surfaces seems to have been made by private individuals in a domestic setting .
others criticize the government deal with the isps as being too short-sighted .
" blocking internet pages containing child pornography is only one step towards preventing the abuse of children and only reaches " the lower echelons " of pedophiles , says legal expert axel stahl , head of the association of federal judges and prosecutors in the state of north rhine-westphalia .
stahl warned against excessively high expectations , saying that foreign companies that produce child pornography will surely find ways to bypass the new technical limitations . scarcity can actually increase demand " the new rules mean gaining access to child pornography will become more difficult , but it wo n't stop material from being published , " says otto vollmers , who represents fsm , a german industry organization that advocates voluntary self-control of the internet .
" making access technically more difficult can actually arouse greater interest . "
however , similar measures in other countries suggest that blocks so work .
" between 15,000 and 50,000 access attempts are blocked in norway and sweden every day , " said friedemann schindler of the german youth protection initiative jugendschutz.de.
" this is undermining demand and is breaking the commercial cycle . " lyf / ncy , reuters / afp / epd send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

critics say their deal with the government wo n't make much of a difference . five of germany 's eight major internet service providers - deutsche telekom 's t-online , vodafone 's arcor , kabel deutschland , telefonica 's o2 and alice 's hansenet - signed the legally binding agreement with the government and the federal crime office on friday , agreeing to install software to block consumer access to child pornography sites .
the five companies together cover around 75 percent of the german market .
in future , due to the software blocks installed by the internet service providers , consumers attempting to click on blacklisted websites are to be automatically redirected to a red stop sign .
the federal crime office has compiled the blacklist of 1,000 sites , which it updates daily .
the online companies have six months to reprogram thousands of servers and install the page blockers .
the government expects that , once these are in place , up to 450,000 attempts to access child pornography sites will be blocked daily .
german family minister ursula von der leyen proposed the law obliging isps to block child porn sites .
it is modeled on similar action taken years ago in scandinavia , britain and italy .
" if these countries can overcome any legal and technical issues and successfully fight child porn online , we can do the same in germany , " von der leyen said when she first presented the new measures .
" we do n't want to tolerate the rape of children , even babies , being widely available in germany , " she added .
the law is also intended to make it harder for criminals to profit from distributing banned pedophile material .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is what child porn surfers will soon see pop up on their computer screen not all on board , yet notably absent in the agreement are 1 & 1 , freenet and other internet providers who service the remaining 25 percent of the german market .
they say they do not want to take the risk of breaching the telecommunications secrecy law by blocking child pornography sites .
they also argue that they only provide the technical capacity to distribute information and are not responsible for content that flows through their networks .
limiting access to information is a sensitive subject in germany because of its nazi past and east german communist rule , but von der leyen said protecting children was the priority .
" the vulnerability and dignity of children is more important than mass communication , " the family minister said .
the german cabinet is expected to announce changes to the telecommunications law by summer that would force the remaining internet providers to block child porn sites .
no reason to believe child porn consumption is going down the notion that pedophiles are shadowy figures who consume child pornography at midnight is long since defunct .
in an embarrassing admission a few weeks , a social democrat lawmaker , joerg tauss , admitted that he possessed child porn .
he denied that he was a pedophile or doing anything wrong , saying he had collected the material for research .
as a lawmaker , he ought to know that laws also govern the " research " of child pornography websites . there 's no reliable information on the extent of child pornography , but the german government says access to video and other images of child pornography on the internet more than doubled from 2006 to 2007 .
there has also been an increase in the amount of violence against small children they show .
the size of those child porn rings that are exposed is , however , some indication of the scope of the problem .
on thursday , german police announced they had smashed a global ring of around 9,000 suspected pedophiles in 92 countries .
pornographic images of children were transmitted from more than 1,000 connections in germany to 8,000 ip addresses in countries including the united states , canada , new zealand , austria and switzerland .
the footage included " images of the most serious sexual abuse , even of toddlers , ” police said in a statement .
child porn users bypass " obvious " areas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : child pornography is often distributed via dvds not the internet critics say the new law is practically useless , because companies abroad can easily bypass the software block .
according to german computer magazine ct , a 27-second online video is already circulating showing how the block can be circumvented . only the " naive internet user " might possibly be stopped from accessing prohibited material , the magazine wrote .
" most child pornography material is available through private forums , like exchange sites , newsgroups , chat rooms , free areas of usenet and e-mail distribution lists , " says udo vetter , a lawyer who often represents people charged with possession of child pornography .
in an interview with ct , vetter said " many simply receive the videos on dvd via the mail , " adding that he doubted a major child pornography industry even exists .
vetter estimated that 98 percent of such images have been around for years and that the quality of most new material that surfaces seems to have been made by private individuals in a domestic setting .
others criticize the government deal with the isps as being too short-sighted .
" blocking internet pages containing child pornography is only one step towards preventing the abuse of children and only reaches " the lower echelons " of pedophiles , says legal expert axel stahl , head of the association of federal judges and prosecutors in the state of north rhine-westphalia .
stahl warned against excessively high expectations , saying that foreign companies that produce child pornography will surely find ways to bypass the new technical limitations . scarcity can actually increase demand " the new rules mean gaining access to child pornography will become more difficult , but it wo n't stop material from being published , " says otto vollmers , who represents fsm , a german industry organization that advocates voluntary self-control of the internet .
" making access technically more difficult can actually arouse greater interest . "
however , similar measures in other countries suggest that blocks so work .
" between 15,000 and 50,000 access attempts are blocked in norway and sweden every day , " said friedemann schindler of the german youth protection initiative jugendschutz.de.
" this is undermining demand and is breaking the commercial cycle . " lyf / ncy , reuters / afp / epd send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the plan could mean hundreds of thousands of moldovans having the right to settle in the eu . romanian president traian basescu told the romanian parliament on wednesday that he would fast-track moldovans for romanian citizenship following riots in the moldovan capital chisinau against election results which led to the victory of the communist party . he also proposed that moldovans with a romanian great-grandparent should in future have the right to citizenship . currently , an estimated 120,000 moldovans have romanian citizenship , which is available to moldovans with a romanian grandparent .
sixty percent of moldova 's 4.4 million people are thought to have romanian origins .
moldova was part of romania until 1940 when it was taken over by the soviet union .

the plan could mean hundreds of thousands of moldovans having the right to settle in the eu . romanian president traian basescu told the romanian parliament on wednesday that he would fast-track moldovans for romanian citizenship following riots in the moldovan capital chisinau against election results which led to the victory of the communist party . he also proposed that moldovans with a romanian great-grandparent should in future have the right to citizenship . currently , an estimated 120,000 moldovans have romanian citizenship , which is available to moldovans with a romanian grandparent .
sixty percent of moldova 's 4.4 million people are thought to have romanian origins .
moldova was part of romania until 1940 when it was taken over by the soviet union .
after the break-up of the soviet union it became an independent state , but it remains one of the poorest countries in europe , with an average annual income of $ 1,830 in 2008 .
tension have been increasing between romania and moldova since the election on april 5 .
the communists won almost 50 percent of the vote , and the opposition has accused the authorities of cheating .
the parliament building in chisinau was set on fire during protests , and protesters were beaten and severely injured .
one man died .
the moldovan government accuses the romanians of being behind the protests and , in response , has imposed visa restrictions on romanians . on friday , an eu commission spokesman said in brussels that the eu condemned the violence , and were concerned at the reports of excesses by the security forces .
but he said he would have to wait until real decisions had been made on the nationality issue before issuing an official response .
however , the czech presidency of the bloc publicly rebuked romania after a meeting between czech eu minister alexandr vondra and romanian foreign minister cristian diaconescu .
vondra said , according the website euobserver.com , " i told my romanian colleague about our serious concerns of the possible risks arising from adopting simplified procedures for romanian citizenship . " the website quoted an unnamed eu official as describing the plans as " frightening .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 17.04.2009 stuttgart , hoffenheim and the last international spot großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart have had plenty of reasons to celebrate in the second half of the season fifth place in the bundesliga means a spot in international competition .
hoffenheim , so strong in the season 's first half would settle for fifth now , but a charging stuttgart might well feel they can snatch it away . for vfb stuttgart , the low point of the season came in late november .
they 'd just lost 4-0 to wolfsburg and sat in 11th place in the table , a long fall from their last two seasons , in which they finished first and sixth , respectively .
hoping to shake things up , they fired their coach armin veh . the outlook was bleak , but in the meantime things have changed drastically .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach markus babbel has turned things around since taking over from armin veh under the leadership of new trainer markus babbel , stuttgart are sitting pretty in fifth thanks to a steady climb up the table that may not yet have reached its peak .
babbel 's squad have suffered just one loss since he took over the club in the season 's 15th week .
the swabians are currently coming off a clutch victory over hamburg that came on mario gomez 's second chance goal late in extra time . the win meant the bundesliga lead pack is now within reach of the surging stuttgart .
champions league possible stuttgart have every reason to be drooling over their prospects in the last seven weeks of the season .
they trail hertha berlin by one , and are three behind hamburg and bayern munich , who are tied on points at 51 .
the top of the table is a little more distant for stuttgart - six points to be exact - and league leaders wolfsburg are clutching dearly to the summit . even if the title remains a lofty ambition , suttgart 's situation could still improve . while fifth place would guarantee stuttgart a spot in next year 's europa league -lrb- the newly re-named successor to the uefa cup -rrb- , third place would put them in the qualifying rounds of the champions league .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gomez is stuttgart 's top scorer with 15 goals stuttgart square off this weekend with cologne , a team that 's been out-of-sorts as of late , and the critical set of games for stuttgart wo n't come until next month . they host wolfsburg four weeks before the end of the season , and then travel to bayern munich for what could be a very decisive final game of the bundesliga campaign .
hoffenheim falls from the top meanwhile , tsg hoffenheim 's season is headed precisely in the opposite direction . in the first half of the season , hoffenheim were the team to beat .
they started the season in first place , and after a couple of stumbles early on , found their form . by week nine , they regained control of the table and hardly looked back going into the winter break .
now hoffenheim ca n't seem to win a match , and have seen their dreams of a german title shrink to a struggle to salvage a uefa cup spot . hoffenheim are in sixth place , four points behind stuttgart , and with three ambitious clubs - schalke , dortmund , and leverkusen - nipping at their heels .
to fend them off , hoffenheim will have to snap its streak of nine winless matches - and soon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ibisevic , left , is still the league 's no. 2 scorer injuries and red cards perhaps hoffenheim 's biggest problem has been injuries .
especially painful was the loss of vedad ibisevic , who tore his right anterior cruciate ligament in a practice match in january . ibisevic 's role in the team 's first half success is best appreciated by looking at the current bundesliga top scorers list .
nearly four months after scoring his last league goal , ibisevic is still second on the list with 18 goals .
it 's a hole hoffenheim have been unable to fill .
discipline , too , has been a problem for hoffenheim . the worst offender is midfielder carlos eduardo , who is second on the team behind ibisevic in goals with 11 . in last weekend 's match against bochum , eduardo was given a red card for throwing an elbow at bochum 's philipp boenig .
that made two red cards this season for eduardo , who was handed a five-match suspension from the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- . he wo n't be available until hoffenheim 's penultimate game , against bayern munich .
hoffenheim 's goalie , daniel haas , was sent off shortly after eduardo against bochum for unsportsmanlike conduct and faces a three game suspension from the dfb .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after last weekend 's red card , carlos eduardo , right , is out for five matches hoffenheim needs a win to stop their free-fall in the table , and they wo n't get a better chance than this weekend against last-place karlsruhe .
after that , they 'll host hertha berlin and then face a steep uphill battle on the road against wolfsburg .
both matches provide good opportunities gain ground in the table , but the hoffenheim of the second half of the season does n't seem up to the challenge .
a spot in international competition seemed like a sure thing at the season 's midpoint , but with the way into the top five now solidly blocked by the streaking stuttgart , hoffenheim could find themselves out in the cold .

if shareholders do not sell shares voluntarily , the government can force them to do so . following the approval of the german financial oversight authority , the fund -lrb- soffin -rrb- is offering 1.39 euros -lrb- $ 1.82 -rrb- in cash per share , 10 percent over the statutory minimum price , and it says it wants to buy 100 percent of the shares , which could cost the government around 290 million euros . the offer starts with friday 's announcement and continues until may 4 .
the takeover was made possible by a special law which came into effect on april 9 and which also allows the expropriation at the minimum price of any shareholdings which are not sold voluntarily . one shareholder , the us investor j.c. flowers , heads a consortium which owns almost 22 percent and has said he does not want to sell .
" in view of the serious situation in which hypo real estate holding currently finds itself , we consider 1.39 euros to be an attractive price " , said hannes rehm , chairman of the soffin management committee .

the verdict could help media companies recoup revenue lost through illegal downloads . the four defendants , who ran the pirate bay , were found guilty by the stockholm district court of being accessories to the breach of copyright laws and sentenced to one year in prison . the court ordered them to pay just over 30 million swedish crowns -lrb- 2.74 million euros or $ 3.58 million -rrb- to a number of content providers , including warner bros , sony music entertainment , emi und columbia pictures . the providers had sought 117 million crowns .
the four - peter sunde , gottfrid svartholm warg , fredrik neij and carl lundstrom - were charged early last year by a swedish prosecutor .
they claim they can not be held responsible for the material exchanged via their site , which was launched in 2003 , since no copyrighted material is stored on its servers and no exchange of files actually takes place there .
but the prosecution said that by financing , programming and administering the site , the four men promoted the infringement of property rights by its users .
the defendants ' lawyer said after the trial they would appeal .
the court 's finding could affectiinternet users throughout the world , since it tries to define at what stage in the download process copyright can be infringed , and how far internet site operators can claim that they are only providing technical infrastructure .
the pirate bay , which is estimated to have 22 million users , organized the exchange of so-called bittorrent data , small packets of data which allow the transfer of much larger files direct from one computer to another . the site left it up to the person doing the downloading to clarify copyright issues , including payment .
ifpi , which represents the recording industry worldwide , hailed the decision . " the trial of the operators of the pirate bay was about defending the rights of creators , confirming the illegality of the service and creating a fair environment for legal music services that respect the rights of the creative community , " ifpi chairman john kennedy said in a statement .
but some industry specialists are skeptical about the long-term effects of the verdict .
music analyst mark mulligan of research firm forrester told reuters , " every time you get rid of one , another bigger one pops up . ...

mitchell stressed the white house 's commitment to palestinian statehood . mitchell said president barack obama regarded establishing a sovereign , independent palestinian state as being in the " national interest " of the us .
he also warned that peace talks would not move forward unless israel 's new government cooperated in efforts to forge a two-state solution .
" a two-state solution is the only solution , " mitchell said after his talks with the palestinian president .
" this conflict has gone on for far too long .
the people of this region should no longer have to wait for the just peace , " he told reporters , as he wrapped up his first visit to the region since the new israeli government of hardline conservative prime minister benjamin netanyahu was sworn in .

erekat , a top aide to abbas , also said the peace process was impossible unless israel stopped all settlement construction in the occupied west bank and house demolitions in east jerusalem .
after the talks between abbas and mitchell , erekat told reporters that abbas emphasized the palestinian commitment to both the 2003 road map peace plan and the annapolis process .
the netanyahu government has said it is bound only by the road map , but not by the annapolis process of november 2007 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 17.04.2009 stuttgart , hoffenheim and the last international spot großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart have had plenty of reasons to celebrate in the second half of the season fifth place in the bundesliga means a spot in international competition .
hoffenheim , so strong in the season 's first half would settle for fifth now , but a charging stuttgart might well feel they can snatch it away . for vfb stuttgart , the low point of the season came in late november .
they 'd just lost 4-0 to wolfsburg and sat in 11th place in the table , a long fall from their last two seasons , in which they finished first and sixth , respectively .
hoping to shake things up , they fired their coach armin veh . the outlook was bleak , but in the meantime things have changed drastically .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach markus babbel has turned things around since taking over from armin veh under the leadership of new trainer markus babbel , stuttgart are sitting pretty in fifth thanks to a steady climb up the table that may not yet have reached its peak .
babbel 's squad have suffered just one loss since he took over the club in the season 's 15th week .
the swabians are currently coming off a clutch victory over hamburg that came on mario gomez 's second chance goal late in extra time . the win meant the bundesliga lead pack is now within reach of the surging stuttgart .
champions league possible stuttgart have every reason to be drooling over their prospects in the last seven weeks of the season .
they trail hertha berlin by one , and are three behind hamburg and bayern munich , who are tied on points at 51 .
the top of the table is a little more distant for stuttgart - six points to be exact - and league leaders wolfsburg are clutching dearly to the summit . even if the title remains a lofty ambition , suttgart 's situation could still improve . while fifth place would guarantee stuttgart a spot in next year 's europa league -lrb- the newly re-named successor to the uefa cup -rrb- , third place would put them in the qualifying rounds of the champions league .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gomez is stuttgart 's top scorer with 15 goals stuttgart square off this weekend with cologne , a team that 's been out-of-sorts as of late , and the critical set of games for stuttgart wo n't come until next month . they host wolfsburg four weeks before the end of the season , and then travel to bayern munich for what could be a very decisive final game of the bundesliga campaign .
hoffenheim falls from the top meanwhile , tsg hoffenheim 's season is headed precisely in the opposite direction . in the first half of the season , hoffenheim were the team to beat .
they started the season in first place , and after a couple of stumbles early on , found their form . by week nine , they regained control of the table and hardly looked back going into the winter break .
now hoffenheim ca n't seem to win a match , and have seen their dreams of a german title shrink to a struggle to salvage a uefa cup spot . hoffenheim are in sixth place , four points behind stuttgart , and with three ambitious clubs - schalke , dortmund , and leverkusen - nipping at their heels .
to fend them off , hoffenheim will have to snap its streak of nine winless matches - and soon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ibisevic , left , is still the league 's no. 2 scorer injuries and red cards perhaps hoffenheim 's biggest problem has been injuries .
especially painful was the loss of vedad ibisevic , who tore his right anterior cruciate ligament in a practice match in january . ibisevic 's role in the team 's first half success is best appreciated by looking at the current bundesliga top scorers list .
nearly four months after scoring his last league goal , ibisevic is still second on the list with 18 goals .
it 's a hole hoffenheim have been unable to fill .
discipline , too , has been a problem for hoffenheim . the worst offender is midfielder carlos eduardo , who is second on the team behind ibisevic in goals with 11 . in last weekend 's match against bochum , eduardo was given a red card for throwing an elbow at bochum 's philipp boenig .
that made two red cards this season for eduardo , who was handed a five-match suspension from the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- . he wo n't be available until hoffenheim 's penultimate game , against bayern munich .
hoffenheim 's goalie , daniel haas , was sent off shortly after eduardo against bochum for unsportsmanlike conduct and faces a three game suspension from the dfb .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after last weekend 's red card , carlos eduardo , right , is out for five matches hoffenheim needs a win to stop their free-fall in the table , and they wo n't get a better chance than this weekend against last-place karlsruhe .
after that , they 'll host hertha berlin and then face a steep uphill battle on the road against wolfsburg .
both matches provide good opportunities gain ground in the table , but the hoffenheim of the second half of the season does n't seem up to the challenge .
a spot in international competition seemed like a sure thing at the season 's midpoint , but with the way into the top five now solidly blocked by the streaking stuttgart , hoffenheim could find themselves out in the cold .

hoffenheim , so strong in the season 's first half would settle for fifth now , but a charging stuttgart might well feel they can snatch it away . for vfb stuttgart , the low point of the season came in late november .
they 'd just lost 4-0 to wolfsburg and sat in 11th place in the table , a long fall from their last two seasons , in which they finished first and sixth , respectively .
hoping to shake things up , they fired their coach armin veh . the outlook was bleak , but in the meantime things have changed drastically .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach markus babbel has turned things around since taking over from armin veh under the leadership of new trainer markus babbel , stuttgart are sitting pretty in fifth thanks to a steady climb up the table that may not yet have reached its peak .
babbel 's squad have suffered just one loss since he took over the club in the season 's 15th week .
the swabians are currently coming off a clutch victory over hamburg that came on mario gomez 's second chance goal late in extra time . the win meant the bundesliga lead pack is now within reach of the surging stuttgart .
champions league possible stuttgart have every reason to be drooling over their prospects in the last seven weeks of the season .
they trail hertha berlin by one , and are three behind hamburg and bayern munich , who are tied on points at 51 .
the top of the table is a little more distant for stuttgart - six points to be exact - and league leaders wolfsburg are clutching dearly to the summit . even if the title remains a lofty ambition , suttgart 's situation could still improve . while fifth place would guarantee stuttgart a spot in next year 's europa league -lrb- the newly re-named successor to the uefa cup -rrb- , third place would put them in the qualifying rounds of the champions league .

they started the season in first place , and after a couple of stumbles early on , found their form . by week nine , they regained control of the table and hardly looked back going into the winter break .
now hoffenheim ca n't seem to win a match , and have seen their dreams of a german title shrink to a struggle to salvage a uefa cup spot . hoffenheim are in sixth place , four points behind stuttgart , and with three ambitious clubs - schalke , dortmund , and leverkusen - nipping at their heels .

police said the footage included " images of the most serious sexual abuse , even of toddlers . "
on thursday they seized more than 500 computers throughout germany , as well as more than 43,000 data storage devices and nearly 800 hard drives .
police investigations were based on internet connection records which service providers are required by law to keep . the law has been attacked by critics as an invasion of privacy . however , the police said that 377 suspects could not be identified since their connection records were deleted before the law came into effect .
most suspects have been released while the evidence is examined , but police in the northern german state of lower saxony said that one man in his 40s has been arrested on suspicion of sexually abusing two children , aged seven and 11 , in his family .
police said they had forwarded their findings to the authorities in 91 countries , and their investigations had already led to arrests abroad .
the move comes as german police prepare to sign agreements with internet service providers on friday to make it harder to access websites posting child pornography . mll / ncy , afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

police said the footage included " images of the most serious sexual abuse , even of toddlers . "
on thursday they seized more than 500 computers throughout germany , as well as more than 43,000 data storage devices and nearly 800 hard drives .
police investigations were based on internet connection records which service providers are required by law to keep . the law has been attacked by critics as an invasion of privacy . however , the police said that 377 suspects could not be identified since their connection records were deleted before the law came into effect .
most suspects have been released while the evidence is examined , but police in the northern german state of lower saxony said that one man in his 40s has been arrested on suspicion of sexually abusing two children , aged seven and 11 , in his family .
police said they had forwarded their findings to the authorities in 91 countries , and their investigations had already led to arrests abroad .
the move comes as german police prepare to sign agreements with internet service providers on friday to make it harder to access websites posting child pornography . mll / ncy , afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we have been through a dark and painful chapter in our history , " obama said in a statement .
" but at a time of great challenges and disturbing disunity , nothing will be gained by spending our time and energy laying blame for the past . "
the white house also released several memos drafted under the bush administration that provided legal justification for the harsh interrogation methods .
techniques outlined in the memos include sleep deprivation , slamming detainees into walls , stripping them naked , and submitting them to waterboarding , a technique used to simulate drowning that human rights groups say amounts to torture .
the cia had previously acknowledged the waterboarding of three terrorism suspects , including khalid sheikh mohammed , the alleged mastermind of the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks .
obama emphasized that , in one of his first acts as president , he had already prohibited the use of such techniques , saying they " undermine our moral authority , and do not make us safer . "
but as he released these memos , obama said he wished to " assure those who carried out their duties relying in good faith upon legal advice from the department of justice that they will not be subject to prosecution . "
civil rights group aclu welcomed the release but said it still wanted an independent prosecutor to investigate allegations of torture during the bush administration .

mitchell stressed the white house 's commitment to palestinian statehood . mitchell said president barack obama regarded establishing a sovereign , independent palestinian state as being in the " national interest " of the us .
he also warned that peace talks would not move forward unless israel 's new government cooperated in efforts to forge a two-state solution .
" a two-state solution is the only solution , " mitchell said after his talks with the palestinian president .

police said the footage included " images of the most serious sexual abuse , even of toddlers . "
on thursday they seized more than 500 computers throughout germany , as well as more than 43,000 data storage devices and nearly 800 hard drives .
police investigations were based on internet connection records which service providers are required by law to keep . the law has been attacked by critics as an invasion of privacy . however , the police said that 377 suspects could not be identified since their connection records were deleted before the law came into effect .
most suspects have been released while the evidence is examined , but police in the northern german state of lower saxony said that one man in his 40s has been arrested on suspicion of sexually abusing two children , aged seven and 11 , in his family .
police said they had forwarded their findings to the authorities in 91 countries , and their investigations had already led to arrests abroad .

at a press conference with azerbaijan 's president , ilham aliyev , in moscow , medvedev warned that the exercises could cause " different kinds of complications " and could threaten a recent thaw in russia-nato relations .
russia 's brief war with georgia last august over georgia 's breakaway province of south ossetia had strained the relationship and caused nato to freeze high-level contacts with russia in protest .
medvedev said that nato 's impending military exercises in georgia could damage the reconciliation process .
" this decision appears to be short-sighted , " he said .
" such decisions are disappointing and do not facilitate the resumption of full-scale contacts between the russian federation and nato . "
earlier , russia 's nato mission in brussels had said it would ask the alliance to postpone the exercises .
nato announced earlier this week that the exercises in georgia would go ahead from may 6 , to improve cooperation between the western alliance and partner countries .
the exercises have been planned since the spring of 2008 , and are to involve about 1,300 personnel from 19 nato and partner countries .

now the smallest of germany 's national papers is turning 30 . a crucified soccer coach on the front page of the tageszeitung caught people 's attention on easter sunday .
the man on the cross was juergen klinsmann , the former head coach of germany 's national soccer team and now the coach of bayern munich . the responses were pre-programmed : klinsmann sues the taz and bayern munich bosses rant about the worst ethical derailment since the beginning of time . karl-heinz ruch , or kalle as he is known , sits back and smiles .
as the daily 's ceo , he 's pleased that the conflict is selling more papers . " the taz shaped its own genre of daily newspaper , " said ruch , drawing a fine line between his publication and bild , germany 's most popular mass-circulation daily . " it 's a subscription paper , which means that 80 percent of the print run goes to subscribers , " he added .
" but we also want to sell individual papers , which is why the headlines have to be powerful . " against all odds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruch says at the beginning no one thought the taz would succeed the first edition of the taz , which was published on april 17 , 1979 , featured a cover picture of a clown dancing on a pedestal .
from the start , it was clear that provocation rather than political correctness was its mandate . the quality of the paper back then was poor , with topics strewn randomly throughout .
one particular front page juxtaposed articles on an earthquake in yugoslavia , a wave of arrests in iran and the political critic robert havemann , who was sentenced to house arrest by the east german regime . the taz was founded as a kind of anti-press - a counterweight to the established middle-class newspapers .
for some , however , it did n't go far enough .
hermann gremlitza , of the monthly left-wing publication konkret , called the fledgling paper " baby-faz , " implying that it was n't very different from the bourgeoisie frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . " no one thought that much would become of the paper , " said ruch .
" there were n't even any experts there , it was just students , and only a handful of them had any journalism experience .
there was n't anybody from the publishing field . " riding political winds but those students had plenty to report on .
when the newspaper was founded in 1979 , it was a time of arms races , peace movements , squatters , and women 's liberation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now , a paper is n't necessarily radical for writing about the environment the taz thrust these issues into the spotlight , along with environmental protection .
while green topics may be common these days in media across the spectrum , it was the taz which played a key role back then in the rise of germany 's green party , which was also founded in 1979 . in the beginning , the left-leaning paper lived from its dedicated , if not exactly professional , style of writing .
now , however , the taz is referred to as the country 's school of journalism , since many who now write for large national publications like sueddeutsche zeitung or die zeit started at the taz . " here , everyone participates in the editorial conferences , whereas at other papers only the department heads are included , " said ruch , naming the advantages of working for the taz .
" everyone has the opportunity to play a part and even write commentaries .
the important thing is that you have talent . " the taz grows up randy kaufman , an american who has worked for the taz as an archivist since 1983 , said the once leftist paper has gradually slid toward the center of the spectrum . " we 've gotten older , had kids and the taz has moved more to the middle of society , " he said .
" many issues that the taz made public at the beginning have now become mainstream . " today , nearly all taz employees are between the ages of 30 and 40 .
it 's become something of a mix between a satirical and a serious newspaper - a high-gloss publication for those who do n't quite fit in . nevertheless , 30 years on , the taz can still get away with a sometimes disrespectful , radical or subversive approach to topics that other papers would n't touch with a 10-foot pole . author : christoph richter / kate bowen editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 17.04.2009 at 30 , germany 's liberal daily taz has grown up großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taz was meant to be a counterweight to the established press berlin 's tageszeitung , or taz , embodies the alternative green movement and is , for many , more of an escort to political change than just a daily newspaper .
now the smallest of germany 's national papers is turning 30 . a crucified soccer coach on the front page of the tageszeitung caught people 's attention on easter sunday .
the man on the cross was juergen klinsmann , the former head coach of germany 's national soccer team and now the coach of bayern munich . the responses were pre-programmed : klinsmann sues the taz and bayern munich bosses rant about the worst ethical derailment since the beginning of time . karl-heinz ruch , or kalle as he is known , sits back and smiles .
as the daily 's ceo , he 's pleased that the conflict is selling more papers . " the taz shaped its own genre of daily newspaper , " said ruch , drawing a fine line between his publication and bild , germany 's most popular mass-circulation daily . " it 's a subscription paper , which means that 80 percent of the print run goes to subscribers , " he added .
" but we also want to sell individual papers , which is why the headlines have to be powerful . " against all odds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruch says at the beginning no one thought the taz would succeed the first edition of the taz , which was published on april 17 , 1979 , featured a cover picture of a clown dancing on a pedestal .
from the start , it was clear that provocation rather than political correctness was its mandate . the quality of the paper back then was poor , with topics strewn randomly throughout .
one particular front page juxtaposed articles on an earthquake in yugoslavia , a wave of arrests in iran and the political critic robert havemann , who was sentenced to house arrest by the east german regime . the taz was founded as a kind of anti-press - a counterweight to the established middle-class newspapers .
for some , however , it did n't go far enough .
hermann gremlitza , of the monthly left-wing publication konkret , called the fledgling paper " baby-faz , " implying that it was n't very different from the bourgeoisie frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . " no one thought that much would become of the paper , " said ruch .
" there were n't even any experts there , it was just students , and only a handful of them had any journalism experience .
there was n't anybody from the publishing field . " riding political winds but those students had plenty to report on .
when the newspaper was founded in 1979 , it was a time of arms races , peace movements , squatters , and women 's liberation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now , a paper is n't necessarily radical for writing about the environment the taz thrust these issues into the spotlight , along with environmental protection .
while green topics may be common these days in media across the spectrum , it was the taz which played a key role back then in the rise of germany 's green party , which was also founded in 1979 . in the beginning , the left-leaning paper lived from its dedicated , if not exactly professional , style of writing .
now , however , the taz is referred to as the country 's school of journalism , since many who now write for large national publications like sueddeutsche zeitung or die zeit started at the taz . " here , everyone participates in the editorial conferences , whereas at other papers only the department heads are included , " said ruch , naming the advantages of working for the taz .
" everyone has the opportunity to play a part and even write commentaries .
the important thing is that you have talent . " the taz grows up randy kaufman , an american who has worked for the taz as an archivist since 1983 , said the once leftist paper has gradually slid toward the center of the spectrum . " we 've gotten older , had kids and the taz has moved more to the middle of society , " he said .
" many issues that the taz made public at the beginning have now become mainstream . " today , nearly all taz employees are between the ages of 30 and 40 .

at a press conference with azerbaijan 's president , ilham aliyev , in moscow , medvedev warned that the exercises could cause " different kinds of complications " and could threaten a recent thaw in russia-nato relations .
russia 's brief war with georgia last august over georgia 's breakaway province of south ossetia had strained the relationship and caused nato to freeze high-level contacts with russia in protest .
medvedev said that nato 's impending military exercises in georgia could damage the reconciliation process .
" this decision appears to be short-sighted , " he said .
" such decisions are disappointing and do not facilitate the resumption of full-scale contacts between the russian federation and nato . "
earlier , russia 's nato mission in brussels had said it would ask the alliance to postpone the exercises .
nato announced earlier this week that the exercises in georgia would go ahead from may 6 , to improve cooperation between the western alliance and partner countries .
the exercises have been planned since the spring of 2008 , and are to involve about 1,300 personnel from 19 nato and partner countries .

the verdict could help media companies recoup revenue lost through illegal downloads . the four defendants , who ran the pirate bay , were found guilty by the stockholm district court of being accessories to the breach of copyright laws and sentenced to one year in prison . the court ordered them to pay just over 30 million swedish crowns -lrb- 2.74 million euros or $ 3.58 million -rrb- to a number of content providers , including warner bros , sony music entertainment , emi und columbia pictures . the providers had sought 117 million crowns .
the four - peter sunde , gottfrid svartholm warg , fredrik neij and carl lundstrom - were charged early last year by a swedish prosecutor .
they claim they can not be held responsible for the material exchanged via their site , which was launched in 2003 , since no copyrighted material is stored on its servers and no exchange of files actually takes place there .
but the prosecution said that by financing , programming and administering the site , the four men promoted the infringement of property rights by its users .
the defendants ' lawyer said after the trial they would appeal .
the court 's finding could affectiinternet users throughout the world , since it tries to define at what stage in the download process copyright can be infringed , and how far internet site operators can claim that they are only providing technical infrastructure .
the pirate bay , which is estimated to have 22 million users , organized the exchange of so-called bittorrent data , small packets of data which allow the transfer of much larger files direct from one computer to another . the site left it up to the person doing the downloading to clarify copyright issues , including payment .
ifpi , which represents the recording industry worldwide , hailed the decision . " the trial of the operators of the pirate bay was about defending the rights of creators , confirming the illegality of the service and creating a fair environment for legal music services that respect the rights of the creative community , " ifpi chairman john kennedy said in a statement .
but some industry specialists are skeptical about the long-term effects of the verdict .
music analyst mark mulligan of research firm forrester told reuters , " every time you get rid of one , another bigger one pops up . ...
the problem of file-sharing just keeps growing year on year , and it 's increasingly difficult for the industry to do anything about it . " mll / ncy , reuters / dpa / ap / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 17.04.2009 major german online companies agree to block child porn websites großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's family minister warns all child porn sites will be blocked on the internet german internet providers have grudgingly agreed to block websites containing child pornography .
critics say their deal with the government wo n't make much of a difference . five of germany 's eight major internet service providers - deutsche telekom 's t-online , vodafone 's arcor , kabel deutschland , telefonica 's o2 and alice 's hansenet - signed the legally binding agreement with the government and the federal crime office on friday , agreeing to install software to block consumer access to child pornography sites .
the five companies together cover around 75 percent of the german market .
in future , due to the software blocks installed by the internet service providers , consumers attempting to click on blacklisted websites are to be automatically redirected to a red stop sign .
the federal crime office has compiled the blacklist of 1,000 sites , which it updates daily .
the online companies have six months to reprogram thousands of servers and install the page blockers .
the government expects that , once these are in place , up to 450,000 attempts to access child pornography sites will be blocked daily .
german family minister ursula von der leyen proposed the law obliging isps to block child porn sites .
it is modeled on similar action taken years ago in scandinavia , britain and italy .
" if these countries can overcome any legal and technical issues and successfully fight child porn online , we can do the same in germany , " von der leyen said when she first presented the new measures .
" we do n't want to tolerate the rape of children , even babies , being widely available in germany , " she added .
the law is also intended to make it harder for criminals to profit from distributing banned pedophile material .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is what child porn surfers will soon see pop up on their computer screen not all on board , yet notably absent in the agreement are 1 & 1 , freenet and other internet providers who service the remaining 25 percent of the german market .
they say they do not want to take the risk of breaching the telecommunications secrecy law by blocking child pornography sites .
they also argue that they only provide the technical capacity to distribute information and are not responsible for content that flows through their networks .
limiting access to information is a sensitive subject in germany because of its nazi past and east german communist rule , but von der leyen said protecting children was the priority .
" the vulnerability and dignity of children is more important than mass communication , " the family minister said .
the german cabinet is expected to announce changes to the telecommunications law by summer that would force the remaining internet providers to block child porn sites .
no reason to believe child porn consumption is going down the notion that pedophiles are shadowy figures who consume child pornography at midnight is long since defunct .
in an embarrassing admission a few weeks , a social democrat lawmaker , joerg tauss , admitted that he possessed child porn .
he denied that he was a pedophile or doing anything wrong , saying he had collected the material for research .
as a lawmaker , he ought to know that laws also govern the " research " of child pornography websites . there 's no reliable information on the extent of child pornography , but the german government says access to video and other images of child pornography on the internet more than doubled from 2006 to 2007 .
there has also been an increase in the amount of violence against small children they show .
the size of those child porn rings that are exposed is , however , some indication of the scope of the problem .
on thursday , german police announced they had smashed a global ring of around 9,000 suspected pedophiles in 92 countries .
pornographic images of children were transmitted from more than 1,000 connections in germany to 8,000 ip addresses in countries including the united states , canada , new zealand , austria and switzerland .
the footage included " images of the most serious sexual abuse , even of toddlers , ” police said in a statement .
child porn users bypass " obvious " areas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : child pornography is often distributed via dvds not the internet critics say the new law is practically useless , because companies abroad can easily bypass the software block .
according to german computer magazine ct , a 27-second online video is already circulating showing how the block can be circumvented . only the " naive internet user " might possibly be stopped from accessing prohibited material , the magazine wrote .
" most child pornography material is available through private forums , like exchange sites , newsgroups , chat rooms , free areas of usenet and e-mail distribution lists , " says udo vetter , a lawyer who often represents people charged with possession of child pornography .
in an interview with ct , vetter said " many simply receive the videos on dvd via the mail , " adding that he doubted a major child pornography industry even exists .
vetter estimated that 98 percent of such images have been around for years and that the quality of most new material that surfaces seems to have been made by private individuals in a domestic setting .
others criticize the government deal with the isps as being too short-sighted .
" blocking internet pages containing child pornography is only one step towards preventing the abuse of children and only reaches " the lower echelons " of pedophiles , says legal expert axel stahl , head of the association of federal judges and prosecutors in the state of north rhine-westphalia .
stahl warned against excessively high expectations , saying that foreign companies that produce child pornography will surely find ways to bypass the new technical limitations . scarcity can actually increase demand " the new rules mean gaining access to child pornography will become more difficult , but it wo n't stop material from being published , " says otto vollmers , who represents fsm , a german industry organization that advocates voluntary self-control of the internet .
" making access technically more difficult can actually arouse greater interest . "
however , similar measures in other countries suggest that blocks so work .
" between 15,000 and 50,000 access attempts are blocked in norway and sweden every day , " said friedemann schindler of the german youth protection initiative jugendschutz.de.

critics say their deal with the government wo n't make much of a difference . five of germany 's eight major internet service providers - deutsche telekom 's t-online , vodafone 's arcor , kabel deutschland , telefonica 's o2 and alice 's hansenet - signed the legally binding agreement with the government and the federal crime office on friday , agreeing to install software to block consumer access to child pornography sites .
the five companies together cover around 75 percent of the german market .
in future , due to the software blocks installed by the internet service providers , consumers attempting to click on blacklisted websites are to be automatically redirected to a red stop sign .
the federal crime office has compiled the blacklist of 1,000 sites , which it updates daily .
the online companies have six months to reprogram thousands of servers and install the page blockers .
the government expects that , once these are in place , up to 450,000 attempts to access child pornography sites will be blocked daily .
german family minister ursula von der leyen proposed the law obliging isps to block child porn sites .
it is modeled on similar action taken years ago in scandinavia , britain and italy .
" if these countries can overcome any legal and technical issues and successfully fight child porn online , we can do the same in germany , " von der leyen said when she first presented the new measures .
" we do n't want to tolerate the rape of children , even babies , being widely available in germany , " she added .

the german cabinet is expected to announce changes to the telecommunications law by summer that would force the remaining internet providers to block child porn sites .
no reason to believe child porn consumption is going down the notion that pedophiles are shadowy figures who consume child pornography at midnight is long since defunct .
in an embarrassing admission a few weeks , a social democrat lawmaker , joerg tauss , admitted that he possessed child porn .
he denied that he was a pedophile or doing anything wrong , saying he had collected the material for research .
as a lawmaker , he ought to know that laws also govern the " research " of child pornography websites . there 's no reliable information on the extent of child pornography , but the german government says access to video and other images of child pornography on the internet more than doubled from 2006 to 2007 .
there has also been an increase in the amount of violence against small children they show .
the size of those child porn rings that are exposed is , however , some indication of the scope of the problem .
on thursday , german police announced they had smashed a global ring of around 9,000 suspected pedophiles in 92 countries .
pornographic images of children were transmitted from more than 1,000 connections in germany to 8,000 ip addresses in countries including the united states , canada , new zealand , austria and switzerland .

child porn users bypass " obvious " areas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : child pornography is often distributed via dvds not the internet critics say the new law is practically useless , because companies abroad can easily bypass the software block .
according to german computer magazine ct , a 27-second online video is already circulating showing how the block can be circumvented . only the " naive internet user " might possibly be stopped from accessing prohibited material , the magazine wrote .
" most child pornography material is available through private forums , like exchange sites , newsgroups , chat rooms , free areas of usenet and e-mail distribution lists , " says udo vetter , a lawyer who often represents people charged with possession of child pornography .
in an interview with ct , vetter said " many simply receive the videos on dvd via the mail , " adding that he doubted a major child pornography industry even exists .
vetter estimated that 98 percent of such images have been around for years and that the quality of most new material that surfaces seems to have been made by private individuals in a domestic setting .
others criticize the government deal with the isps as being too short-sighted .
" blocking internet pages containing child pornography is only one step towards preventing the abuse of children and only reaches " the lower echelons " of pedophiles , says legal expert axel stahl , head of the association of federal judges and prosecutors in the state of north rhine-westphalia .
stahl warned against excessively high expectations , saying that foreign companies that produce child pornography will surely find ways to bypass the new technical limitations . scarcity can actually increase demand " the new rules mean gaining access to child pornography will become more difficult , but it wo n't stop material from being published , " says otto vollmers , who represents fsm , a german industry organization that advocates voluntary self-control of the internet .

in an embarrassing admission a few weeks , a social democrat lawmaker , joerg tauss , admitted that he possessed child porn .
he denied that he was a pedophile or doing anything wrong , saying he had collected the material for research .
as a lawmaker , he ought to know that laws also govern the " research " of child pornography websites . there 's no reliable information on the extent of child pornography , but the german government says access to video and other images of child pornography on the internet more than doubled from 2006 to 2007 .
there has also been an increase in the amount of violence against small children they show .
the size of those child porn rings that are exposed is , however , some indication of the scope of the problem .
on thursday , german police announced they had smashed a global ring of around 9,000 suspected pedophiles in 92 countries .
pornographic images of children were transmitted from more than 1,000 connections in germany to 8,000 ip addresses in countries including the united states , canada , new zealand , austria and switzerland .
the footage included " images of the most serious sexual abuse , even of toddlers , ” police said in a statement .
child porn users bypass " obvious " areas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : child pornography is often distributed via dvds not the internet critics say the new law is practically useless , because companies abroad can easily bypass the software block .
according to german computer magazine ct , a 27-second online video is already circulating showing how the block can be circumvented . only the " naive internet user " might possibly be stopped from accessing prohibited material , the magazine wrote .
" most child pornography material is available through private forums , like exchange sites , newsgroups , chat rooms , free areas of usenet and e-mail distribution lists , " says udo vetter , a lawyer who often represents people charged with possession of child pornography .
in an interview with ct , vetter said " many simply receive the videos on dvd via the mail , " adding that he doubted a major child pornography industry even exists .
vetter estimated that 98 percent of such images have been around for years and that the quality of most new material that surfaces seems to have been made by private individuals in a domestic setting .
others criticize the government deal with the isps as being too short-sighted .
" blocking internet pages containing child pornography is only one step towards preventing the abuse of children and only reaches " the lower echelons " of pedophiles , says legal expert axel stahl , head of the association of federal judges and prosecutors in the state of north rhine-westphalia .
stahl warned against excessively high expectations , saying that foreign companies that produce child pornography will surely find ways to bypass the new technical limitations . scarcity can actually increase demand " the new rules mean gaining access to child pornography will become more difficult , but it wo n't stop material from being published , " says otto vollmers , who represents fsm , a german industry organization that advocates voluntary self-control of the internet .

critics say their deal with the government wo n't make much of a difference . five of germany 's eight major internet service providers - deutsche telekom 's t-online , vodafone 's arcor , kabel deutschland , telefonica 's o2 and alice 's hansenet - signed the legally binding agreement with the government and the federal crime office on friday , agreeing to install software to block consumer access to child pornography sites .
the five companies together cover around 75 percent of the german market .
in future , due to the software blocks installed by the internet service providers , consumers attempting to click on blacklisted websites are to be automatically redirected to a red stop sign .
the federal crime office has compiled the blacklist of 1,000 sites , which it updates daily .
the online companies have six months to reprogram thousands of servers and install the page blockers .
the government expects that , once these are in place , up to 450,000 attempts to access child pornography sites will be blocked daily .
german family minister ursula von der leyen proposed the law obliging isps to block child porn sites .
it is modeled on similar action taken years ago in scandinavia , britain and italy .
" if these countries can overcome any legal and technical issues and successfully fight child porn online , we can do the same in germany , " von der leyen said when she first presented the new measures .
" we do n't want to tolerate the rape of children , even babies , being widely available in germany , " she added .
the law is also intended to make it harder for criminals to profit from distributing banned pedophile material .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is what child porn surfers will soon see pop up on their computer screen not all on board , yet notably absent in the agreement are 1 & 1 , freenet and other internet providers who service the remaining 25 percent of the german market .
they say they do not want to take the risk of breaching the telecommunications secrecy law by blocking child pornography sites .
they also argue that they only provide the technical capacity to distribute information and are not responsible for content that flows through their networks .
limiting access to information is a sensitive subject in germany because of its nazi past and east german communist rule , but von der leyen said protecting children was the priority .
" the vulnerability and dignity of children is more important than mass communication , " the family minister said .
the german cabinet is expected to announce changes to the telecommunications law by summer that would force the remaining internet providers to block child porn sites .
no reason to believe child porn consumption is going down the notion that pedophiles are shadowy figures who consume child pornography at midnight is long since defunct .

the plan could mean hundreds of thousands of moldovans having the right to settle in the eu . romanian president traian basescu told the romanian parliament on wednesday that he would fast-track moldovans for romanian citizenship following riots in the moldovan capital chisinau against election results which led to the victory of the communist party . he also proposed that moldovans with a romanian great-grandparent should in future have the right to citizenship . currently , an estimated 120,000 moldovans have romanian citizenship , which is available to moldovans with a romanian grandparent .
sixty percent of moldova 's 4.4 million people are thought to have romanian origins .
moldova was part of romania until 1940 when it was taken over by the soviet union .
after the break-up of the soviet union it became an independent state , but it remains one of the poorest countries in europe , with an average annual income of $ 1,830 in 2008 .

the communists won almost 50 percent of the vote , and the opposition has accused the authorities of cheating .
the parliament building in chisinau was set on fire during protests , and protesters were beaten and severely injured .

the plan could mean hundreds of thousands of moldovans having the right to settle in the eu . romanian president traian basescu told the romanian parliament on wednesday that he would fast-track moldovans for romanian citizenship following riots in the moldovan capital chisinau against election results which led to the victory of the communist party . he also proposed that moldovans with a romanian great-grandparent should in future have the right to citizenship . currently , an estimated 120,000 moldovans have romanian citizenship , which is available to moldovans with a romanian grandparent .

police said the footage included " images of the most serious sexual abuse , even of toddlers . "
on thursday they seized more than 500 computers throughout germany , as well as more than 43,000 data storage devices and nearly 800 hard drives .
police investigations were based on internet connection records which service providers are required by law to keep . the law has been attacked by critics as an invasion of privacy . however , the police said that 377 suspects could not be identified since their connection records were deleted before the law came into effect .
most suspects have been released while the evidence is examined , but police in the northern german state of lower saxony said that one man in his 40s has been arrested on suspicion of sexually abusing two children , aged seven and 11 , in his family .
police said they had forwarded their findings to the authorities in 91 countries , and their investigations had already led to arrests abroad .

" we have been through a dark and painful chapter in our history , " obama said in a statement .
" but at a time of great challenges and disturbing disunity , nothing will be gained by spending our time and energy laying blame for the past . "
the white house also released several memos drafted under the bush administration that provided legal justification for the harsh interrogation methods .
techniques outlined in the memos include sleep deprivation , slamming detainees into walls , stripping them naked , and submitting them to waterboarding , a technique used to simulate drowning that human rights groups say amounts to torture .
the cia had previously acknowledged the waterboarding of three terrorism suspects , including khalid sheikh mohammed , the alleged mastermind of the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks .
obama emphasized that , in one of his first acts as president , he had already prohibited the use of such techniques , saying they " undermine our moral authority , and do not make us safer . "
but as he released these memos , obama said he wished to " assure those who carried out their duties relying in good faith upon legal advice from the department of justice that they will not be subject to prosecution . "
civil rights group aclu welcomed the release but said it still wanted an independent prosecutor to investigate allegations of torture during the bush administration .
" we have to look back before we can move forward as a nation , " said anthony romero , executive director of the aclu .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 17.04.2009 stuttgart , hoffenheim and the last international spot großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart have had plenty of reasons to celebrate in the second half of the season fifth place in the bundesliga means a spot in international competition .
hoffenheim , so strong in the season 's first half would settle for fifth now , but a charging stuttgart might well feel they can snatch it away . for vfb stuttgart , the low point of the season came in late november .
they 'd just lost 4-0 to wolfsburg and sat in 11th place in the table , a long fall from their last two seasons , in which they finished first and sixth , respectively .
hoping to shake things up , they fired their coach armin veh . the outlook was bleak , but in the meantime things have changed drastically .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach markus babbel has turned things around since taking over from armin veh under the leadership of new trainer markus babbel , stuttgart are sitting pretty in fifth thanks to a steady climb up the table that may not yet have reached its peak .
babbel 's squad have suffered just one loss since he took over the club in the season 's 15th week .
the swabians are currently coming off a clutch victory over hamburg that came on mario gomez 's second chance goal late in extra time . the win meant the bundesliga lead pack is now within reach of the surging stuttgart .
champions league possible stuttgart have every reason to be drooling over their prospects in the last seven weeks of the season .
they trail hertha berlin by one , and are three behind hamburg and bayern munich , who are tied on points at 51 .
the top of the table is a little more distant for stuttgart - six points to be exact - and league leaders wolfsburg are clutching dearly to the summit . even if the title remains a lofty ambition , suttgart 's situation could still improve . while fifth place would guarantee stuttgart a spot in next year 's europa league -lrb- the newly re-named successor to the uefa cup -rrb- , third place would put them in the qualifying rounds of the champions league .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gomez is stuttgart 's top scorer with 15 goals stuttgart square off this weekend with cologne , a team that 's been out-of-sorts as of late , and the critical set of games for stuttgart wo n't come until next month . they host wolfsburg four weeks before the end of the season , and then travel to bayern munich for what could be a very decisive final game of the bundesliga campaign .

hoffenheim , so strong in the season 's first half would settle for fifth now , but a charging stuttgart might well feel they can snatch it away . for vfb stuttgart , the low point of the season came in late november .
they 'd just lost 4-0 to wolfsburg and sat in 11th place in the table , a long fall from their last two seasons , in which they finished first and sixth , respectively .
hoping to shake things up , they fired their coach armin veh . the outlook was bleak , but in the meantime things have changed drastically .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach markus babbel has turned things around since taking over from armin veh under the leadership of new trainer markus babbel , stuttgart are sitting pretty in fifth thanks to a steady climb up the table that may not yet have reached its peak .
babbel 's squad have suffered just one loss since he took over the club in the season 's 15th week .
the swabians are currently coming off a clutch victory over hamburg that came on mario gomez 's second chance goal late in extra time . the win meant the bundesliga lead pack is now within reach of the surging stuttgart .
champions league possible stuttgart have every reason to be drooling over their prospects in the last seven weeks of the season .
they trail hertha berlin by one , and are three behind hamburg and bayern munich , who are tied on points at 51 .
the top of the table is a little more distant for stuttgart - six points to be exact - and league leaders wolfsburg are clutching dearly to the summit . even if the title remains a lofty ambition , suttgart 's situation could still improve . while fifth place would guarantee stuttgart a spot in next year 's europa league -lrb- the newly re-named successor to the uefa cup -rrb- , third place would put them in the qualifying rounds of the champions league .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gomez is stuttgart 's top scorer with 15 goals stuttgart square off this weekend with cologne , a team that 's been out-of-sorts as of late , and the critical set of games for stuttgart wo n't come until next month . they host wolfsburg four weeks before the end of the season , and then travel to bayern munich for what could be a very decisive final game of the bundesliga campaign .
hoffenheim falls from the top meanwhile , tsg hoffenheim 's season is headed precisely in the opposite direction . in the first half of the season , hoffenheim were the team to beat .
they started the season in first place , and after a couple of stumbles early on , found their form . by week nine , they regained control of the table and hardly looked back going into the winter break .

critics say their deal with the government wo n't make much of a difference . five of germany 's eight major internet service providers - deutsche telekom 's t-online , vodafone 's arcor , kabel deutschland , telefonica 's o2 and alice 's hansenet - signed the legally binding agreement with the government and the federal crime office on friday , agreeing to install software to block consumer access to child pornography sites .
the five companies together cover around 75 percent of the german market .
in future , due to the software blocks installed by the internet service providers , consumers attempting to click on blacklisted websites are to be automatically redirected to a red stop sign .
the federal crime office has compiled the blacklist of 1,000 sites , which it updates daily .
the online companies have six months to reprogram thousands of servers and install the page blockers .
the government expects that , once these are in place , up to 450,000 attempts to access child pornography sites will be blocked daily .
german family minister ursula von der leyen proposed the law obliging isps to block child porn sites .
it is modeled on similar action taken years ago in scandinavia , britain and italy .
" if these countries can overcome any legal and technical issues and successfully fight child porn online , we can do the same in germany , " von der leyen said when she first presented the new measures .
" we do n't want to tolerate the rape of children , even babies , being widely available in germany , " she added .
the law is also intended to make it harder for criminals to profit from distributing banned pedophile material .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is what child porn surfers will soon see pop up on their computer screen not all on board , yet notably absent in the agreement are 1 & 1 , freenet and other internet providers who service the remaining 25 percent of the german market .
they say they do not want to take the risk of breaching the telecommunications secrecy law by blocking child pornography sites .
they also argue that they only provide the technical capacity to distribute information and are not responsible for content that flows through their networks .
limiting access to information is a sensitive subject in germany because of its nazi past and east german communist rule , but von der leyen said protecting children was the priority .
" the vulnerability and dignity of children is more important than mass communication , " the family minister said .
the german cabinet is expected to announce changes to the telecommunications law by summer that would force the remaining internet providers to block child porn sites .
no reason to believe child porn consumption is going down the notion that pedophiles are shadowy figures who consume child pornography at midnight is long since defunct .
in an embarrassing admission a few weeks , a social democrat lawmaker , joerg tauss , admitted that he possessed child porn .
he denied that he was a pedophile or doing anything wrong , saying he had collected the material for research .
as a lawmaker , he ought to know that laws also govern the " research " of child pornography websites . there 's no reliable information on the extent of child pornography , but the german government says access to video and other images of child pornography on the internet more than doubled from 2006 to 2007 .
there has also been an increase in the amount of violence against small children they show .
the size of those child porn rings that are exposed is , however , some indication of the scope of the problem .
on thursday , german police announced they had smashed a global ring of around 9,000 suspected pedophiles in 92 countries .
pornographic images of children were transmitted from more than 1,000 connections in germany to 8,000 ip addresses in countries including the united states , canada , new zealand , austria and switzerland .
the footage included " images of the most serious sexual abuse , even of toddlers , ” police said in a statement .
child porn users bypass " obvious " areas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : child pornography is often distributed via dvds not the internet critics say the new law is practically useless , because companies abroad can easily bypass the software block .
according to german computer magazine ct , a 27-second online video is already circulating showing how the block can be circumvented . only the " naive internet user " might possibly be stopped from accessing prohibited material , the magazine wrote .
" most child pornography material is available through private forums , like exchange sites , newsgroups , chat rooms , free areas of usenet and e-mail distribution lists , " says udo vetter , a lawyer who often represents people charged with possession of child pornography .
in an interview with ct , vetter said " many simply receive the videos on dvd via the mail , " adding that he doubted a major child pornography industry even exists .
vetter estimated that 98 percent of such images have been around for years and that the quality of most new material that surfaces seems to have been made by private individuals in a domestic setting .
others criticize the government deal with the isps as being too short-sighted .
" blocking internet pages containing child pornography is only one step towards preventing the abuse of children and only reaches " the lower echelons " of pedophiles , says legal expert axel stahl , head of the association of federal judges and prosecutors in the state of north rhine-westphalia .
stahl warned against excessively high expectations , saying that foreign companies that produce child pornography will surely find ways to bypass the new technical limitations . scarcity can actually increase demand " the new rules mean gaining access to child pornography will become more difficult , but it wo n't stop material from being published , " says otto vollmers , who represents fsm , a german industry organization that advocates voluntary self-control of the internet .

the verdict could help media companies recoup revenue lost through illegal downloads . the four defendants , who ran the pirate bay , were found guilty by the stockholm district court of being accessories to the breach of copyright laws and sentenced to one year in prison . the court ordered them to pay just over 30 million swedish crowns -lrb- 2.74 million euros or $ 3.58 million -rrb- to a number of content providers , including warner bros , sony music entertainment , emi und columbia pictures . the providers had sought 117 million crowns .
the four - peter sunde , gottfrid svartholm warg , fredrik neij and carl lundstrom - were charged early last year by a swedish prosecutor .
they claim they can not be held responsible for the material exchanged via their site , which was launched in 2003 , since no copyrighted material is stored on its servers and no exchange of files actually takes place there .
but the prosecution said that by financing , programming and administering the site , the four men promoted the infringement of property rights by its users .
the defendants ' lawyer said after the trial they would appeal .
the court 's finding could affectiinternet users throughout the world , since it tries to define at what stage in the download process copyright can be infringed , and how far internet site operators can claim that they are only providing technical infrastructure .
the pirate bay , which is estimated to have 22 million users , organized the exchange of so-called bittorrent data , small packets of data which allow the transfer of much larger files direct from one computer to another . the site left it up to the person doing the downloading to clarify copyright issues , including payment .
ifpi , which represents the recording industry worldwide , hailed the decision . " the trial of the operators of the pirate bay was about defending the rights of creators , confirming the illegality of the service and creating a fair environment for legal music services that respect the rights of the creative community , " ifpi chairman john kennedy said in a statement .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 17.04.2009 at 30 , germany 's liberal daily taz has grown up großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taz was meant to be a counterweight to the established press berlin 's tageszeitung , or taz , embodies the alternative green movement and is , for many , more of an escort to political change than just a daily newspaper .
now the smallest of germany 's national papers is turning 30 . a crucified soccer coach on the front page of the tageszeitung caught people 's attention on easter sunday .
the man on the cross was juergen klinsmann , the former head coach of germany 's national soccer team and now the coach of bayern munich . the responses were pre-programmed : klinsmann sues the taz and bayern munich bosses rant about the worst ethical derailment since the beginning of time . karl-heinz ruch , or kalle as he is known , sits back and smiles .
as the daily 's ceo , he 's pleased that the conflict is selling more papers . " the taz shaped its own genre of daily newspaper , " said ruch , drawing a fine line between his publication and bild , germany 's most popular mass-circulation daily . " it 's a subscription paper , which means that 80 percent of the print run goes to subscribers , " he added .
" but we also want to sell individual papers , which is why the headlines have to be powerful . " against all odds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruch says at the beginning no one thought the taz would succeed the first edition of the taz , which was published on april 17 , 1979 , featured a cover picture of a clown dancing on a pedestal .
from the start , it was clear that provocation rather than political correctness was its mandate . the quality of the paper back then was poor , with topics strewn randomly throughout .
one particular front page juxtaposed articles on an earthquake in yugoslavia , a wave of arrests in iran and the political critic robert havemann , who was sentenced to house arrest by the east german regime . the taz was founded as a kind of anti-press - a counterweight to the established middle-class newspapers .
for some , however , it did n't go far enough .
hermann gremlitza , of the monthly left-wing publication konkret , called the fledgling paper " baby-faz , " implying that it was n't very different from the bourgeoisie frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . " no one thought that much would become of the paper , " said ruch .
" there were n't even any experts there , it was just students , and only a handful of them had any journalism experience .
there was n't anybody from the publishing field . " riding political winds but those students had plenty to report on .
when the newspaper was founded in 1979 , it was a time of arms races , peace movements , squatters , and women 's liberation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now , a paper is n't necessarily radical for writing about the environment the taz thrust these issues into the spotlight , along with environmental protection .
while green topics may be common these days in media across the spectrum , it was the taz which played a key role back then in the rise of germany 's green party , which was also founded in 1979 . in the beginning , the left-leaning paper lived from its dedicated , if not exactly professional , style of writing .
now , however , the taz is referred to as the country 's school of journalism , since many who now write for large national publications like sueddeutsche zeitung or die zeit started at the taz . " here , everyone participates in the editorial conferences , whereas at other papers only the department heads are included , " said ruch , naming the advantages of working for the taz .
" everyone has the opportunity to play a part and even write commentaries .
the important thing is that you have talent . " the taz grows up randy kaufman , an american who has worked for the taz as an archivist since 1983 , said the once leftist paper has gradually slid toward the center of the spectrum . " we 've gotten older , had kids and the taz has moved more to the middle of society , " he said .
" many issues that the taz made public at the beginning have now become mainstream . " today , nearly all taz employees are between the ages of 30 and 40 .
it 's become something of a mix between a satirical and a serious newspaper - a high-gloss publication for those who do n't quite fit in . nevertheless , 30 years on , the taz can still get away with a sometimes disrespectful , radical or subversive approach to topics that other papers would n't touch with a 10-foot pole . author : christoph richter / kate bowen editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at a press conference with azerbaijan 's president , ilham aliyev , in moscow , medvedev warned that the exercises could cause " different kinds of complications " and could threaten a recent thaw in russia-nato relations .
russia 's brief war with georgia last august over georgia 's breakaway province of south ossetia had strained the relationship and caused nato to freeze high-level contacts with russia in protest .
medvedev said that nato 's impending military exercises in georgia could damage the reconciliation process .
" this decision appears to be short-sighted , " he said .
" such decisions are disappointing and do not facilitate the resumption of full-scale contacts between the russian federation and nato . "
earlier , russia 's nato mission in brussels had said it would ask the alliance to postpone the exercises .
nato announced earlier this week that the exercises in georgia would go ahead from may 6 , to improve cooperation between the western alliance and partner countries .
the exercises have been planned since the spring of 2008 , and are to involve about 1,300 personnel from 19 nato and partner countries .
moscow treats any cooperation between nato and georgia with suspicion .
the pro-western government of the former soviet republic has pushed hard to join the alliance , but this has been met with mixed responses from current members . ch / pfd , afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the belarusian president , however , did not say whether he intended to travel to prague .
" the president did not confirm his attendance , " schwarzenberg said .
" he accepted the invitation .
it is now for him to decide who will represent belarus at the summit . "
the invitation on behalf of the eu appears to be a policy reversal from the czech republic , which has long actively backed the anti-lukashenko political opposition .
in 2002 , prague denied lukashenko a visa for a nato summit in the czech capital .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the belarusian president has been described as europe 's last dictator the belarusian leader is set to visit italy and meet pope benedict xvi in late april , a further sign of a potential thaw in relations with the west .
it will be lukashenko 's first official trip to a western country since the mid-1990s .
the administration of former us president george w. bush described belarus , under president lukashenko , europe 's " last dictatorship " .
lukashenko has been trying to improve ties with the west since quarrelling with his traditional ally russia two years ago over energy prices .
in a joint statement several belarusian opposition leaders warned the eu that inviting lukashenko to prague was a show of support for a lawless regime , and would legitimize his dictatorship .
the aim of the eastern partnership is to bind six former soviet republics closer to the 27-member eu .
the eu hopes to bring armenia , azerbaijan , belarus , georgia , moldova and ukraine closer , through increased aid and partnership deals , in return for democratic and pro-market reforms .
the plan , however , does not offer full eu membership to any of the six countries . ch / pfd , reuters / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

police investigations were based on internet connection records which service providers are required by law to keep . the law has been attacked by critics as an invasion of privacy . however , the police said that 377 suspects could not be identified since their connection records were deleted before the law came into effect .
most suspects have been released while the evidence is examined , but police in the northern german state of lower saxony said that one man in his 40s has been arrested on suspicion of sexually abusing two children , aged seven and 11 , in his family .
police said they had forwarded their findings to the authorities in 91 countries , and their investigations had already led to arrests abroad .

she added that she was confident that all parties would approve the reworked statement and decide to attend the upcoming meeting in geneva .
" i feel very certain because this was so well deliberated by all groups that it will have an easy passage through the conference , " she told a news briefing at the un 's palais des nations complex , where the april 20-24 conference is to be held .
pillay said she therefore expected the conference to adopt the 17-page document .
references to the defamation of religions - another political hot potato - had also been deleted , pillay said .
she specifically thanked the palestinian delegation for allowing a compromise .
walk outs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are fears the conference could take on an anti-israel tone the conference , known as durban ii , has been plagued by discord , with canada and israel boycotting the event over fears that muslim nations will focus exclusively on the jewish state 's treatment of the palestinians .
germany and other eu countries are also mulling shunning the un talks amid concerns that the event may take on anti-semitic overtones , a senior official in berlin confirmed on thursday .
another government spokesman said that neither germany nor the eu could tolerate participating in the conference if it becomes a platform for " one-sided comments on the middle east conflict . "
the us and australia also objected to wording about israel in an earlier draft declaration and said they were not planning to send any envoys to the five-day meeting , though us state department deputy spokesman robert wood said on friday that washington was still weighing its options after viewing the recently reworked declaration .

it feels those moves are an effort to limit freedom of expression in the wake of the highly controversial danish cartoons of the muslim prophet mohammad in 2006 .
a final decision on whether the us and european countries will attend is expected to come in the next couple of days .
iran 's president , mahmoud ahmadinejad , has already stated that he will attend .
the iranian president has come under heavy criticism for previously hosting a conference questioning the historical accuracy of the holocaust .
this conference is to be a follow up to a 2001 anti-racism meeting in south africa .

she added that she was confident that all parties would approve the reworked statement and decide to attend the upcoming meeting in geneva .
" i feel very certain because this was so well deliberated by all groups that it will have an easy passage through the conference , " she told a news briefing at the un 's palais des nations complex , where the april 20-24 conference is to be held .
pillay said she therefore expected the conference to adopt the 17-page document .
references to the defamation of religions - another political hot potato - had also been deleted , pillay said .
she specifically thanked the palestinian delegation for allowing a compromise .
walk outs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are fears the conference could take on an anti-israel tone the conference , known as durban ii , has been plagued by discord , with canada and israel boycotting the event over fears that muslim nations will focus exclusively on the jewish state 's treatment of the palestinians .
germany and other eu countries are also mulling shunning the un talks amid concerns that the event may take on anti-semitic overtones , a senior official in berlin confirmed on thursday .
another government spokesman said that neither germany nor the eu could tolerate participating in the conference if it becomes a platform for " one-sided comments on the middle east conflict . "
the us and australia also objected to wording about israel in an earlier draft declaration and said they were not planning to send any envoys to the five-day meeting , though us state department deputy spokesman robert wood said on friday that washington was still weighing its options after viewing the recently reworked declaration .
decision pending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad will attend the upcoming un meeting the us has raised objections to a push by arab and muslim states to include a condemnation of " incitement to religious hatred " and to make " defamation of religion " illegal .
it feels those moves are an effort to limit freedom of expression in the wake of the highly controversial danish cartoons of the muslim prophet mohammad in 2006 .
a final decision on whether the us and european countries will attend is expected to come in the next couple of days .
iran 's president , mahmoud ahmadinejad , has already stated that he will attend .
the iranian president has come under heavy criticism for previously hosting a conference questioning the historical accuracy of the holocaust .
this conference is to be a follow up to a 2001 anti-racism meeting in south africa .
israel and the us walked out of that gathering after arab and muslim states attempted to add text defining zionism as racism . dfm / pfd , afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the belarusian president , however , did not say whether he intended to travel to prague .
" the president did not confirm his attendance , " schwarzenberg said .
" he accepted the invitation .
it is now for him to decide who will represent belarus at the summit . "
the invitation on behalf of the eu appears to be a policy reversal from the czech republic , which has long actively backed the anti-lukashenko political opposition .
in 2002 , prague denied lukashenko a visa for a nato summit in the czech capital .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the belarusian president has been described as europe 's last dictator the belarusian leader is set to visit italy and meet pope benedict xvi in late april , a further sign of a potential thaw in relations with the west .
it will be lukashenko 's first official trip to a western country since the mid-1990s .
the administration of former us president george w. bush described belarus , under president lukashenko , europe 's " last dictatorship " .
lukashenko has been trying to improve ties with the west since quarrelling with his traditional ally russia two years ago over energy prices .
in a joint statement several belarusian opposition leaders warned the eu that inviting lukashenko to prague was a show of support for a lawless regime , and would legitimize his dictatorship .
the aim of the eastern partnership is to bind six former soviet republics closer to the 27-member eu .
the eu hopes to bring armenia , azerbaijan , belarus , georgia , moldova and ukraine closer , through increased aid and partnership deals , in return for democratic and pro-market reforms .
the plan , however , does not offer full eu membership to any of the six countries . ch / pfd , reuters / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his comments came hours after us president barack obama said cuba needed to make the next move if there was to be further improvement in relations .
mr castro was speaking in venezuela ahead of a summit of the americas .
venezuelan president hugo chavez said he will veto any final declaration as cuba is excluded from the meeting .
the summit , due to start in trinidad , includes 34 latin american and caribbean countries .
the us has said the gathering is reserved for democratic nations .
' equal terms ' speaking to latin american leaders in venezuela , president castro said he had sent word to the us government " in private and in public " that he is open to negotiations as long as it is " on equal terms " . "
we do n't expect them to change overnight ... but we do expect that cuba will send signals that they 're interested in liberalising " us president barack obama there is still no formal contact between the cuban authorities and the us government , but this is the latest in a series of exchanges which suggest that both sides appear to be making efforts to find a way to end the 50-year stalemate , our correspondent in havana , michael voss reports .
earlier this week , the us president announced that he was lifting restrictions on cuban americans visiting relatives on the island and sending money home .
following the easing of us travel restrictions , mr obama said it was up to havana to make the next move .
president obama , who will attend the summit , said he wanted to " see whether cuba is also ready to change " as the us tried to improve relations .
" we do n't expect them to change overnight , that would be unrealistic .
but we do expect that cuba will send signals that they 're interested in liberalising , " said mr obama , during a visit to mexico .
mr castro , who took over the presidency from his older brother fidel last year , did not mention mr obama 's comments specifically and stopped short of promising any concrete actions .
' unacceptable ' on thursday , venezuelan president hugo chavez said he will veto any final declaration at the summit of the americas because cuba is excluded . "
i hope the president of the united states is going to listen " venezuelan president hugo chavez mr chavez spoke as he welcomed his closest latin american allies at a meeting of the alba group of nations in the venezuelan city of cumana .
he said a new organisation should be formed to replace the organization of american states -lrb- oas -rrb- , whose members are meeting in trinidad and tobago .
" why does cuba continue to be mistreated ? "
mr chavez asked after welcoming mr castro .
" we ca n't accept it . "
" i hope the president of the united states is going to listen " at the oas summit , he said .
a spokesperson for the us president said mr obama had no plans for a bilateral meeting with mr chavez during the summit of the americas .
mr castro recalled cuba 's victory against an invasion of us-backed exiles at the bay of pigs in april 1961 , the associated press news agency reported .
" we are going to continue fighting , " he said .
the alba leaders , who include mr castro , bolivian president evo morales and nicaraguan president daniel ortega , are expected to announce the launch of a shared currency called the sucre .
mr chavez said it would begin to circulate by january 2010 .

four in 10 did not know a glass of wine has the same calories -lrb- 120 -rrb- as a slice of cake , or that a pint of lager and a small sausage roll have 170 each .
the poll of 2,000 adults in england was carried out as part of the government 's drive to curb people 's drinking habits .
the campaign also stresses that a heavy drinking session is often followed by an unhealthy breakfast , which again helps to pile on the pounds .
the know your limits campaign has in the past focused on other consequences of drinking , such as disease risk .
but to coincide with the focus on weight , the department of health carried out research showing a regular beer drinker , who downed five pints a week or 250 over the course of a year , packed away the same number of calories as someone eating 221 doughnuts over the space of 12 months .
it also revealed the average wine drinker consumed 2,000 calories each month .
over the course of a year , that is the equivalent of eating an extra 38 roast beef dinners .
health minister phil hope said : " regularly drinking more than our recommended daily limits can have a knock-on effect on our health , including an expanding waistline .
" it 's not only the calories in the drinks themselves that can help to pile on the pounds , we 're also more likely to eat fatty foods when we 've had one too many . "
heather caswell , of the british nutrition foundation , added : " most people would baulk at consuming a full glass of single cream , but would n't think twice about a couple of pints .
" but the calorie content is similar and , over time , excess alcohol intake is likely to lead to weight gain . "
and a spokesman for the drinkaware trust added : it 's imperative we are in the know when it comes to what we are drinking . "

four in 10 did not know a glass of wine has the same calories -lrb- 120 -rrb- as a slice of cake , or that a pint of lager and a small sausage roll have 170 each .
the poll of 2,000 adults in england was carried out as part of the government 's drive to curb people 's drinking habits .

the know your limits campaign has in the past focused on other consequences of drinking , such as disease risk .
but to coincide with the focus on weight , the department of health carried out research showing a regular beer drinker , who downed five pints a week or 250 over the course of a year , packed away the same number of calories as someone eating 221 doughnuts over the space of 12 months .

health minister phil hope said : " regularly drinking more than our recommended daily limits can have a knock-on effect on our health , including an expanding waistline .
" it 's not only the calories in the drinks themselves that can help to pile on the pounds , we 're also more likely to eat fatty foods when we 've had one too many . "
heather caswell , of the british nutrition foundation , added : " most people would baulk at consuming a full glass of single cream , but would n't think twice about a couple of pints .
" but the calorie content is similar and , over time , excess alcohol intake is likely to lead to weight gain . "

negative equity is the situation where someone 's house has become worth less than their mortgage .
research by the council of mortgage lenders -lrb- cml -rrb- said the problem would restrict the number of home sales .
but it said two thirds of the 900,000 homes in negative equity had only a modest shortfall of less than 10 % .
that equated to an average of about £ 6,000 for first-time buyers in that situation , and £ 8,000 for the other home owners .
" although negative equity has resurfaced as house prices have fallen , one big difference from the early 1990s downturn is that it is less concentrated among young , first-time buyers , and more evenly spread across wider age groups and those at different points on the housing ladder , " said bob pannell , head of research at the cml .
" negative equity will contribute to subdued property turnover , but otherwise should have few adverse effects for the majority of households affected , " he added .
small deposits with lenders still restricting their lending because of a shortage of mortgage funds , few are currently prepared to accept a deposit of only 10 % from anyone buying a house .
negative equity ... only surfaces as a problem if households need to move , or are also experiencing repayment difficulties cml recent figures from the financial information service moneyfacts showed that there were currently only 106 mortgage deals requiring a deposit of 10 % or less , while more than two thirds of the 1,485 deals available asked customers to put up a deposit of at least 25 % .
the impact is that even people who still have some limited equity in their homes , but less than 10 % , are unlikely to be able to move .
the cml estimated that there are about 600,000 mortgage holders who have less than 5 % equity in their homes , plus another 500,000 whose equity would amount to a deposit of more than 5 % but still less than 10 % .
thus about two million homeowners in total could not raise a 10 % deposit for a new mortgage simply by selling their current homes .
1990s comparison the cml carried out its research by looking at data supplied by its members .
with house prices dropping by about 18 % since the middle of 2007 , the fall in prices has already outstripped the national price drop experienced during the early 1990s house price crash .
but the 900,000 estimated to be in negative equity now are fewer in number than the 1.5 million estimated to have been in this position more than a decade and a half ago .
of the households currently in negative equity , about 270,000 have a shortfall of between 10 % and 20 % , and about 30,000 have a shortfall of 20 % or more .
in those most extreme cases their negative equity amounts to an average £ 28,000 for first-time buyers and £ 37,000 for other home owners .
despite this , the cml argues that it is myth that there is a strong link between negative equity and mortgage repayment problems .
" payment problems are typically associated with unexpected spending commitments , reduced income and changes in household circumstances , " the cml said .
" negative equity , on the other hand , only surfaces as a problem if households need to move , or are also experiencing repayment difficulties , " it added .

negative equity is the situation where someone 's house has become worth less than their mortgage .
research by the council of mortgage lenders -lrb- cml -rrb- said the problem would restrict the number of home sales .
but it said two thirds of the 900,000 homes in negative equity had only a modest shortfall of less than 10 % .
that equated to an average of about £ 6,000 for first-time buyers in that situation , and £ 8,000 for the other home owners .
" although negative equity has resurfaced as house prices have fallen , one big difference from the early 1990s downturn is that it is less concentrated among young , first-time buyers , and more evenly spread across wider age groups and those at different points on the housing ladder , " said bob pannell , head of research at the cml .
" negative equity will contribute to subdued property turnover , but otherwise should have few adverse effects for the majority of households affected , " he added .
small deposits with lenders still restricting their lending because of a shortage of mortgage funds , few are currently prepared to accept a deposit of only 10 % from anyone buying a house . "
negative equity ... only surfaces as a problem if households need to move , or are also experiencing repayment difficulties " cml recent figures from the financial information service moneyfacts showed that there were currently only 106 mortgage deals requiring a deposit of 10 % or less , while more than two thirds of the 1,485 deals available asked customers to put up a deposit of at least 25 % .
the impact is that even people who still have some limited equity in their homes , but less than 10 % , are unlikely to be able to move .
the cml estimated that there are about 600,000 mortgage holders who have less than 5 % equity in their homes , plus another 500,000 whose equity would amount to a deposit of more than 5 % but still less than 10 % .
thus about two million homeowners in total could not raise a 10 % deposit for a new mortgage simply by selling their current homes .
1990s comparison the cml carried out its research by looking at data supplied by its members .
with house prices dropping by about 18 % since the middle of 2007 , the fall in prices has already outstripped the national price drop experienced during the early 1990s house price crash .
but the 900,000 estimated to be in negative equity now are fewer in number than the 1.5 million estimated to have been in this position more than a decade and a half ago .
of the households currently in negative equity , about 270,000 have a shortfall of between 10 % and 20 % , and about 30,000 have a shortfall of 20 % or more .
in those most extreme cases their negative equity amounts to an average £ 28,000 for first-time buyers and £ 37,000 for other home owners .
despite this , the cml argues that it is myth that there is a strong link between negative equity and mortgage repayment problems .
" payment problems are typically associated with unexpected spending commitments , reduced income and changes in household circumstances , " the cml said .
" negative equity , on the other hand , only surfaces as a problem if households need to move , or are also experiencing repayment difficulties , " it added .
