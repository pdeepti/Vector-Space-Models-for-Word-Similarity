equal pay day is observed to draw attention to the persistent discrepancy . it 's not by chance that equal pay day is held on march 20 in germany .
this is the date up to which german women on average had to work this year , in addition to last year , to earn as much as their male counterparts did in 2008 .
although the " same salary for the same work " policy has been part of german law for more than 30 years , the pay gap between genders continues to exist .
the organization for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- has been publishing figures on salary disparity between european men and women for a few years , and germany ranks third among the 27 eu members .
the salary gap between men and women who perform the same jobs is only higher in estonia and cyprus .
the discrepancy between non-skilled workers is the narrowest and the widest gap is between highly-qualified workers at up to 35 percent .
hard to grasp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen is also puzzled by the salary discrepancies germany 's minister for family affairs ursula von der leyen gave a specific example , noting that , despite the fact that they are equally capable of taking blood , changing beds and measuring fevers , " female nurses receive 100 euros -lrb- $ 135 -rrb- less a month than male nurses . "
" i simply ca n't explain it , " she added .
the phenomenon has prompted the business and professional women 's foundation to protest openly .
they have adopted the symbol of the red bag used by the us sister organization , so that " numbers in the black will arise from bags in the red , " said dagmar terbeznik of the german branch of the business and professional women 's foundation .
the reasons why equal work is still not rewarded with equal pay in germany are numerous .
studies have shown that german women place greater emphasis on the quality of their work and the working atmosphere rather than on salary .
" the tax system in germany encourages women to take a part-time job when their husband earns more than them , " astrid ziegler , a researcher at the wsi social economics institute in dusseldorf , told afp news agency .
in addition , a shortage of day-care options and the fact that schools are not open all day make it difficult for women to combine a job with family life , she added .
traditional roles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a shortage of daycare and pre-school options in germany but it is also known that factors such as performance-based salaries and free working arrangements also contribute to keeping women 's salaries below those of their male counterparts .
many german families still observe tradition roles , with men as the primary breadwinners .
silke anger from the german institute for economic research has been studying the problem of unpaid work for a long time .
she developed the following thesis : housework makes women poor .
" energy that is invested in house work is then missing at work , " said the economist .
" those who iron and do the laundry at home and do the shopping do n't have the energy for gainful employment . "
anger suspects that some employers offer married women smaller salaries from the outset .
human resources bosses often assume that these women have to divide their energy between their careers and their household .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german companies are not open about their salary policies the business and professional women 's foundation has said that , among other things , a lack of transparency in german companies is responsible for the wage differences .
in many companies , it is even recommended to employees that they refrain from speaking about what they earn .
the foundation , however wants german companies to be obligated - as is the case in forerunner sweden - to disclose how much their employees earn .
women 's salary negotiations can then be conducted in a more goal-oriented manner with this kind of information serving as the foundation for the discussions .

but if ukraine ca n't pay , europe may not get any gas . on monday , march 23 , ukraine 's president viktor yushchenko and prime minister yulia tymoshenko - currently feuding ahead of presidential elections - are set to meet the head of the eu 's executive , jose manuel barroso , and officials from the world bank , european investment bank and energy companies in brussels .
they are expected to sign a joint declaration committing ukraine to reforming the rules for operating its gas network .
that should pave the way for western and russian donors to invest in the renovation of the network , eu diplomats told dpa news agency .
huge investments needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tymoshenko , left , and yushchenko are political opponents one fifth of all the natural gas consumed in the eu flows through ukraine 's 13,500-kilometer -lrb- 8,400-mile -rrb- network of gas pipelines .
some experts have said that the network will need some 2.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.4 billion -rrb- in investment over the next six years just to keep the pipes and pumping stations in working order .
analysts say that ukrainian monopoly naftogaz , which runs the pipeline system , is having difficulties attracting the necessary investment due to a perceived lack of transparency both in its management and in ukraine 's top political leadership .
" i see a situation later this year where naftogaz will not be able to meet its payment obligations to gazprom because of its worsening financial situation , " robert shetler-jones from swiss-based gas trader rosukrenergo -lrb- rue -rrb- told reuters news agency .
rue is owned by russian gas giant gazprom and two ukrainian businessmen .
" if ukraine continued not to pay , then this could have a serious impact on the european gas supplies , " added shetler-jones . a highly-charged issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian energy giant gazprom has the full backing of the kremlin the question of ukraine 's gas transit system has been a highly-charged one ever since a row with russia in 2005-2006 provoked russian gas monopoly gazprom to shut supplies off to ukraine , causing severe shortfalls in europe .
the drama was repeated in january , when gas supplies to the eu were stalled for two weeks .
the eu has said it is interested in becoming less dependent on both russia and ukraine as energy suppliers .
on thursday , eu leaders agreed to give 200 million euros to the " nabucco " pipeline project , which is meant to bypass both countries and bring gas directly from the caspian sea to europe . tt / kjb / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , tehran 's ideologists are standing in the way . barack obama is getting serious .
he had already expressed his readiness to negotiate with iran , and now the american president has used the iranian new year 's festival " nourouz " as an opportunity to offer tehran a fresh start . obama may have praised iran 's cultural heritage , but his compliments were not the most important aspect of his address .
after all , similar things were also heard from george w. bush , who treated iran as part of his " axis of evil . " more important were the openness and clarity with which obama explained to the iranians that there are differences of opinion between the two countries , but that he 's prepared to deal with these issues diplomatically . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp obama 's strategy seems to be to approach iran as an equal .
the president has recognized that condescending advice or even orders and sanctions wo n't achieve anything .
on the contrary , they can backfire , with the other side feeling duped , disrespected and disdained .
which can only make them clam up . many iranians will be open to obama 's words .
they have been fixated on the us for a long time and have been eager to restart relations .
however , in tehran 's political circles , even the most reconciliatory statements from washington will be met with mistrust and at least initial rejection - as iran 's highest leader , ayatollah ali khamenei , demonstrated on saturday , march 21 . in a new year 's speech in mashhad , he criticized the us president , saying obama could n't wish the iranians a happy new year , while at the same time accusing them of supporting terrorism and violence . the iranian leader did n't want to understand that these were the differences of opinion that obama had referred to : iran 's support for hezbollah and hamas , and the suspicion that tehran is building nuclear weapons . just a day earlier , khamenei had celebrated the development of iran 's nuclear program as the greatest success of the past few years and it 's unlikely he 'll change his mind on this issue .
but the question remains whether he 'll give the green light for direct contact with the americans in various matters , no matter how controversial the standpoints between washington and tehran may be . the two can and should try to build on their commonalities .
both the us and iran , for example , have similar interests in iraq and - even more so - in afghanistan .
both countries should try to calm down and stop making trouble - neither for neighbor iran nor for the rest of the world . if these common interests can be worked out - perhaps at the upcoming afghanistan conference in the hague - why should n't the more controversial issues be tackled after that ? a lot depends on mutual trust and there seem to be a shortage in that area .
there 's a cogent reason for this , particularly in tehran : the ideologists of the " islamic republic " apparently fear that rapprochement with the us could undermine their state doctrine . for them , it 's easier with an enemy like the us . peter philipp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but if ukraine ca n't pay , europe may not get any gas . on monday , march 23 , ukraine 's president viktor yushchenko and prime minister yulia tymoshenko - currently feuding ahead of presidential elections - are set to meet the head of the eu 's executive , jose manuel barroso , and officials from the world bank , european investment bank and energy companies in brussels .
they are expected to sign a joint declaration committing ukraine to reforming the rules for operating its gas network .
that should pave the way for western and russian donors to invest in the renovation of the network , eu diplomats told dpa news agency .
huge investments needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tymoshenko , left , and yushchenko are political opponents one fifth of all the natural gas consumed in the eu flows through ukraine 's 13,500-kilometer -lrb- 8,400-mile -rrb- network of gas pipelines .
some experts have said that the network will need some 2.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.4 billion -rrb- in investment over the next six years just to keep the pipes and pumping stations in working order .
analysts say that ukrainian monopoly naftogaz , which runs the pipeline system , is having difficulties attracting the necessary investment due to a perceived lack of transparency both in its management and in ukraine 's top political leadership .
" i see a situation later this year where naftogaz will not be able to meet its payment obligations to gazprom because of its worsening financial situation , " robert shetler-jones from swiss-based gas trader rosukrenergo -lrb- rue -rrb- told reuters news agency .
rue is owned by russian gas giant gazprom and two ukrainian businessmen .
" if ukraine continued not to pay , then this could have a serious impact on the european gas supplies , " added shetler-jones . a highly-charged issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian energy giant gazprom has the full backing of the kremlin the question of ukraine 's gas transit system has been a highly-charged one ever since a row with russia in 2005-2006 provoked russian gas monopoly gazprom to shut supplies off to ukraine , causing severe shortfalls in europe .
the drama was repeated in january , when gas supplies to the eu were stalled for two weeks .
the eu has said it is interested in becoming less dependent on both russia and ukraine as energy suppliers .
on thursday , eu leaders agreed to give 200 million euros to the " nabucco " pipeline project , which is meant to bypass both countries and bring gas directly from the caspian sea to europe . tt / kjb / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , tehran 's ideologists are standing in the way . barack obama is getting serious .
he had already expressed his readiness to negotiate with iran , and now the american president has used the iranian new year 's festival " nourouz " as an opportunity to offer tehran a fresh start . obama may have praised iran 's cultural heritage , but his compliments were not the most important aspect of his address .
after all , similar things were also heard from george w. bush , who treated iran as part of his " axis of evil . " more important were the openness and clarity with which obama explained to the iranians that there are differences of opinion between the two countries , but that he 's prepared to deal with these issues diplomatically . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp obama 's strategy seems to be to approach iran as an equal .
the president has recognized that condescending advice or even orders and sanctions wo n't achieve anything .
on the contrary , they can backfire , with the other side feeling duped , disrespected and disdained .
which can only make them clam up . many iranians will be open to obama 's words .
they have been fixated on the us for a long time and have been eager to restart relations .
however , in tehran 's political circles , even the most reconciliatory statements from washington will be met with mistrust and at least initial rejection - as iran 's highest leader , ayatollah ali khamenei , demonstrated on saturday , march 21 . in a new year 's speech in mashhad , he criticized the us president , saying obama could n't wish the iranians a happy new year , while at the same time accusing them of supporting terrorism and violence . the iranian leader did n't want to understand that these were the differences of opinion that obama had referred to : iran 's support for hezbollah and hamas , and the suspicion that tehran is building nuclear weapons . just a day earlier , khamenei had celebrated the development of iran 's nuclear program as the greatest success of the past few years and it 's unlikely he 'll change his mind on this issue .
but the question remains whether he 'll give the green light for direct contact with the americans in various matters , no matter how controversial the standpoints between washington and tehran may be . the two can and should try to build on their commonalities .
both the us and iran , for example , have similar interests in iraq and - even more so - in afghanistan .
both countries should try to calm down and stop making trouble - neither for neighbor iran nor for the rest of the world . if these common interests can be worked out - perhaps at the upcoming afghanistan conference in the hague - why should n't the more controversial issues be tackled after that ? a lot depends on mutual trust and there seem to be a shortage in that area .

equal pay day is observed to draw attention to the persistent discrepancy . it 's not by chance that equal pay day is held on march 20 in germany .
this is the date up to which german women on average had to work this year , in addition to last year , to earn as much as their male counterparts did in 2008 .
although the " same salary for the same work " policy has been part of german law for more than 30 years , the pay gap between genders continues to exist .
the organization for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- has been publishing figures on salary disparity between european men and women for a few years , and germany ranks third among the 27 eu members .
the salary gap between men and women who perform the same jobs is only higher in estonia and cyprus .
the discrepancy between non-skilled workers is the narrowest and the widest gap is between highly-qualified workers at up to 35 percent .
hard to grasp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen is also puzzled by the salary discrepancies germany 's minister for family affairs ursula von der leyen gave a specific example , noting that , despite the fact that they are equally capable of taking blood , changing beds and measuring fevers , " female nurses receive 100 euros -lrb- $ 135 -rrb- less a month than male nurses . "
" i simply ca n't explain it , " she added .
the phenomenon has prompted the business and professional women 's foundation to protest openly .
they have adopted the symbol of the red bag used by the us sister organization , so that " numbers in the black will arise from bags in the red , " said dagmar terbeznik of the german branch of the business and professional women 's foundation .
the reasons why equal work is still not rewarded with equal pay in germany are numerous .
studies have shown that german women place greater emphasis on the quality of their work and the working atmosphere rather than on salary .
" the tax system in germany encourages women to take a part-time job when their husband earns more than them , " astrid ziegler , a researcher at the wsi social economics institute in dusseldorf , told afp news agency .
in addition , a shortage of day-care options and the fact that schools are not open all day make it difficult for women to combine a job with family life , she added .
traditional roles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a shortage of daycare and pre-school options in germany but it is also known that factors such as performance-based salaries and free working arrangements also contribute to keeping women 's salaries below those of their male counterparts .
many german families still observe tradition roles , with men as the primary breadwinners .
silke anger from the german institute for economic research has been studying the problem of unpaid work for a long time .
she developed the following thesis : housework makes women poor .
" energy that is invested in house work is then missing at work , " said the economist .
" those who iron and do the laundry at home and do the shopping do n't have the energy for gainful employment . "
anger suspects that some employers offer married women smaller salaries from the outset .
human resources bosses often assume that these women have to divide their energy between their careers and their household .
time for government intervention ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german companies are not open about their salary policies the business and professional women 's foundation has said that , among other things , a lack of transparency in german companies is responsible for the wage differences .
in many companies , it is even recommended to employees that they refrain from speaking about what they earn .
the foundation , however wants german companies to be obligated - as is the case in forerunner sweden - to disclose how much their employees earn .
women 's salary negotiations can then be conducted in a more goal-oriented manner with this kind of information serving as the foundation for the discussions .
many politicians also say it is time to put the pressure on companies .
the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has recently agreed on a program that advances a legal quota for members on a company 's board of directors and " discrimination checks " for contracts .

but if ukraine ca n't pay , europe may not get any gas . on monday , march 23 , ukraine 's president viktor yushchenko and prime minister yulia tymoshenko - currently feuding ahead of presidential elections - are set to meet the head of the eu 's executive , jose manuel barroso , and officials from the world bank , european investment bank and energy companies in brussels .
they are expected to sign a joint declaration committing ukraine to reforming the rules for operating its gas network .
that should pave the way for western and russian donors to invest in the renovation of the network , eu diplomats told dpa news agency .
huge investments needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tymoshenko , left , and yushchenko are political opponents one fifth of all the natural gas consumed in the eu flows through ukraine 's 13,500-kilometer -lrb- 8,400-mile -rrb- network of gas pipelines .
some experts have said that the network will need some 2.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.4 billion -rrb- in investment over the next six years just to keep the pipes and pumping stations in working order .
analysts say that ukrainian monopoly naftogaz , which runs the pipeline system , is having difficulties attracting the necessary investment due to a perceived lack of transparency both in its management and in ukraine 's top political leadership .
" i see a situation later this year where naftogaz will not be able to meet its payment obligations to gazprom because of its worsening financial situation , " robert shetler-jones from swiss-based gas trader rosukrenergo -lrb- rue -rrb- told reuters news agency .
rue is owned by russian gas giant gazprom and two ukrainian businessmen .
" if ukraine continued not to pay , then this could have a serious impact on the european gas supplies , " added shetler-jones . a highly-charged issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian energy giant gazprom has the full backing of the kremlin the question of ukraine 's gas transit system has been a highly-charged one ever since a row with russia in 2005-2006 provoked russian gas monopoly gazprom to shut supplies off to ukraine , causing severe shortfalls in europe .
the drama was repeated in january , when gas supplies to the eu were stalled for two weeks .
the eu has said it is interested in becoming less dependent on both russia and ukraine as energy suppliers .
on thursday , eu leaders agreed to give 200 million euros to the " nabucco " pipeline project , which is meant to bypass both countries and bring gas directly from the caspian sea to europe . tt / kjb / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

is it a sphere of influence , including belarus ? "
on friday , after a two-day summit in brussels , eu leaders approved the new partnership , which would allow the union to increase its aid to armenia , azerbaijan , georgia , moldova , ukraine and possibly belarus by 600 million euros -lrb- $ 814 million -rrb- .
" our dream has come true , we have been able to adopt the eastern partnership , " said czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
under the scheme , the eu is to negotiate new association agreements - accords setting terms for cooperation with non-member states - as reward for democratic and free-market reforms .
the plan envisages the gradual creation of a free-trade zone with the countries .
of the 600 million euros in aid , some 350 million euros will be new funds for strengthening state institutions , border control and assistance for small companies .
giving belarus a chance ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the belarusian opposition wants to see the country advance toward the eu the eu 's interest in its eastern neighborhood has surged since russia 's august invasion of georgia .
the bloc is now keen to strengthen its ties with its neighbors to counter-balance moscow 's growing assertiveness in the region .
as a gesture of goodwill towards russia 's staunch ally belarus , eu foreign ministers on monday extended until december the suspension of travel restrictions for the country 's top government officials , including president alexander lukashenko , the eu put the ban into effect in 2006 in response to human rights violations allegedly committed by lukashenko , whose regime former us secretary of state condoleezza rice once called " the last remaining true dictatorship in the heart of europe . "
but the bloc put the visa ban on ice in october in a bid to encourage the belarus president to take a more pro-western and pro-democracy course as part of a carrot-and-stick policy .
a sore spot for russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west did not recognize the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia lavrov , however , condemned the union 's effort to draw ex-soviet countries closer to the west as meddling into other countries ' internal affairs .
" when my good friend karel schwarzenberg publicly says that if belarus recognizes abkhazia and south ossetia it could forget about " eastern partnership " , is it blackmail or is it democracy at work ? "
" after those kinds of statements , we have questions , " lavrov added .
" is it about pulling countries -lrb- away -rrb- from the decisions that they are supposed to take freely ? "
russia recognized the independence of the breakaway georgian regions following its short war in georgia in august to widespread international condemnation .
moscow has been urging its neighbor to follow suit .
the official launch of the eu 's partnership with six eastern european countries , which is backed strongly by poland and sweden , is set for may 7 , although doubts remain about whether lukashenko will be invited .
" that will depend on the behavior of mr. lukashenko and the belarus government in the coming weeks , but belarus should be in the ' eastern partnership ' , " schwarzenberg said on friday . tt / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de women -pipe- 21.03.2009 working women in germany protest salary gap großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the salary gap still has n't closed for german women women in germany earn nearly a quarter less than men , compared to an average of 17 percent in the rest of europe .
equal pay day is observed to draw attention to the persistent discrepancy . it 's not by chance that equal pay day is held on march 20 in germany .
this is the date up to which german women on average had to work this year , in addition to last year , to earn as much as their male counterparts did in 2008 .
although the " same salary for the same work " policy has been part of german law for more than 30 years , the pay gap between genders continues to exist .
the organization for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- has been publishing figures on salary disparity between european men and women for a few years , and germany ranks third among the 27 eu members .
the salary gap between men and women who perform the same jobs is only higher in estonia and cyprus .
the discrepancy between non-skilled workers is the narrowest and the widest gap is between highly-qualified workers at up to 35 percent .
hard to grasp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen is also puzzled by the salary discrepancies germany 's minister for family affairs ursula von der leyen gave a specific example , noting that , despite the fact that they are equally capable of taking blood , changing beds and measuring fevers , " female nurses receive 100 euros -lrb- $ 135 -rrb- less a month than male nurses . "
" i simply ca n't explain it , " she added .
the phenomenon has prompted the business and professional women 's foundation to protest openly .
they have adopted the symbol of the red bag used by the us sister organization , so that " numbers in the black will arise from bags in the red , " said dagmar terbeznik of the german branch of the business and professional women 's foundation .
the reasons why equal work is still not rewarded with equal pay in germany are numerous .
studies have shown that german women place greater emphasis on the quality of their work and the working atmosphere rather than on salary .
" the tax system in germany encourages women to take a part-time job when their husband earns more than them , " astrid ziegler , a researcher at the wsi social economics institute in dusseldorf , told afp news agency .
in addition , a shortage of day-care options and the fact that schools are not open all day make it difficult for women to combine a job with family life , she added .
traditional roles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a shortage of daycare and pre-school options in germany but it is also known that factors such as performance-based salaries and free working arrangements also contribute to keeping women 's salaries below those of their male counterparts .
many german families still observe tradition roles , with men as the primary breadwinners .
silke anger from the german institute for economic research has been studying the problem of unpaid work for a long time .
she developed the following thesis : housework makes women poor .
" energy that is invested in house work is then missing at work , " said the economist .
" those who iron and do the laundry at home and do the shopping do n't have the energy for gainful employment . "
anger suspects that some employers offer married women smaller salaries from the outset .
human resources bosses often assume that these women have to divide their energy between their careers and their household .
time for government intervention ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german companies are not open about their salary policies the business and professional women 's foundation has said that , among other things , a lack of transparency in german companies is responsible for the wage differences .
in many companies , it is even recommended to employees that they refrain from speaking about what they earn .
the foundation , however wants german companies to be obligated - as is the case in forerunner sweden - to disclose how much their employees earn .
women 's salary negotiations can then be conducted in a more goal-oriented manner with this kind of information serving as the foundation for the discussions .
many politicians also say it is time to put the pressure on companies .
the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has recently agreed on a program that advances a legal quota for members on a company 's board of directors and " discrimination checks " for contracts .
" the time for voluntary measures by companies is over , " said party group leader christel humme . ls / kjb / tt / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on friday , after a two-day summit in brussels , eu leaders approved the new partnership , which would allow the union to increase its aid to armenia , azerbaijan , georgia , moldova , ukraine and possibly belarus by 600 million euros -lrb- $ 814 million -rrb- .
" our dream has come true , we have been able to adopt the eastern partnership , " said czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
under the scheme , the eu is to negotiate new association agreements - accords setting terms for cooperation with non-member states - as reward for democratic and free-market reforms .
the plan envisages the gradual creation of a free-trade zone with the countries .

but if ukraine ca n't pay , europe may not get any gas . on monday , march 23 , ukraine 's president viktor yushchenko and prime minister yulia tymoshenko - currently feuding ahead of presidential elections - are set to meet the head of the eu 's executive , jose manuel barroso , and officials from the world bank , european investment bank and energy companies in brussels .
they are expected to sign a joint declaration committing ukraine to reforming the rules for operating its gas network .
that should pave the way for western and russian donors to invest in the renovation of the network , eu diplomats told dpa news agency .
huge investments needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tymoshenko , left , and yushchenko are political opponents one fifth of all the natural gas consumed in the eu flows through ukraine 's 13,500-kilometer -lrb- 8,400-mile -rrb- network of gas pipelines .
some experts have said that the network will need some 2.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.4 billion -rrb- in investment over the next six years just to keep the pipes and pumping stations in working order .
analysts say that ukrainian monopoly naftogaz , which runs the pipeline system , is having difficulties attracting the necessary investment due to a perceived lack of transparency both in its management and in ukraine 's top political leadership .
" i see a situation later this year where naftogaz will not be able to meet its payment obligations to gazprom because of its worsening financial situation , " robert shetler-jones from swiss-based gas trader rosukrenergo -lrb- rue -rrb- told reuters news agency .
rue is owned by russian gas giant gazprom and two ukrainian businessmen .

the drama was repeated in january , when gas supplies to the eu were stalled for two weeks .
the eu has said it is interested in becoming less dependent on both russia and ukraine as energy suppliers .
on thursday , eu leaders agreed to give 200 million euros to the " nabucco " pipeline project , which is meant to bypass both countries and bring gas directly from the caspian sea to europe . tt / kjb / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but if ukraine ca n't pay , europe may not get any gas . on monday , march 23 , ukraine 's president viktor yushchenko and prime minister yulia tymoshenko - currently feuding ahead of presidential elections - are set to meet the head of the eu 's executive , jose manuel barroso , and officials from the world bank , european investment bank and energy companies in brussels .
they are expected to sign a joint declaration committing ukraine to reforming the rules for operating its gas network .
that should pave the way for western and russian donors to invest in the renovation of the network , eu diplomats told dpa news agency .
huge investments needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tymoshenko , left , and yushchenko are political opponents one fifth of all the natural gas consumed in the eu flows through ukraine 's 13,500-kilometer -lrb- 8,400-mile -rrb- network of gas pipelines .
some experts have said that the network will need some 2.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.4 billion -rrb- in investment over the next six years just to keep the pipes and pumping stations in working order .
analysts say that ukrainian monopoly naftogaz , which runs the pipeline system , is having difficulties attracting the necessary investment due to a perceived lack of transparency both in its management and in ukraine 's top political leadership .
" i see a situation later this year where naftogaz will not be able to meet its payment obligations to gazprom because of its worsening financial situation , " robert shetler-jones from swiss-based gas trader rosukrenergo -lrb- rue -rrb- told reuters news agency .
rue is owned by russian gas giant gazprom and two ukrainian businessmen .
" if ukraine continued not to pay , then this could have a serious impact on the european gas supplies , " added shetler-jones . a highly-charged issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian energy giant gazprom has the full backing of the kremlin the question of ukraine 's gas transit system has been a highly-charged one ever since a row with russia in 2005-2006 provoked russian gas monopoly gazprom to shut supplies off to ukraine , causing severe shortfalls in europe .
the drama was repeated in january , when gas supplies to the eu were stalled for two weeks .
the eu has said it is interested in becoming less dependent on both russia and ukraine as energy suppliers .
on thursday , eu leaders agreed to give 200 million euros to the " nabucco " pipeline project , which is meant to bypass both countries and bring gas directly from the caspian sea to europe . tt / kjb / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , tehran 's ideologists are standing in the way . barack obama is getting serious .
he had already expressed his readiness to negotiate with iran , and now the american president has used the iranian new year 's festival " nourouz " as an opportunity to offer tehran a fresh start . obama may have praised iran 's cultural heritage , but his compliments were not the most important aspect of his address .
after all , similar things were also heard from george w. bush , who treated iran as part of his " axis of evil . " more important were the openness and clarity with which obama explained to the iranians that there are differences of opinion between the two countries , but that he 's prepared to deal with these issues diplomatically . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp obama 's strategy seems to be to approach iran as an equal .
the president has recognized that condescending advice or even orders and sanctions wo n't achieve anything .
on the contrary , they can backfire , with the other side feeling duped , disrespected and disdained .
which can only make them clam up . many iranians will be open to obama 's words .
they have been fixated on the us for a long time and have been eager to restart relations .
however , in tehran 's political circles , even the most reconciliatory statements from washington will be met with mistrust and at least initial rejection - as iran 's highest leader , ayatollah ali khamenei , demonstrated on saturday , march 21 . in a new year 's speech in mashhad , he criticized the us president , saying obama could n't wish the iranians a happy new year , while at the same time accusing them of supporting terrorism and violence . the iranian leader did n't want to understand that these were the differences of opinion that obama had referred to : iran 's support for hezbollah and hamas , and the suspicion that tehran is building nuclear weapons . just a day earlier , khamenei had celebrated the development of iran 's nuclear program as the greatest success of the past few years and it 's unlikely he 'll change his mind on this issue .

however , tehran 's ideologists are standing in the way . barack obama is getting serious .
he had already expressed his readiness to negotiate with iran , and now the american president has used the iranian new year 's festival " nourouz " as an opportunity to offer tehran a fresh start . obama may have praised iran 's cultural heritage , but his compliments were not the most important aspect of his address .
after all , similar things were also heard from george w. bush , who treated iran as part of his " axis of evil . " more important were the openness and clarity with which obama explained to the iranians that there are differences of opinion between the two countries , but that he 's prepared to deal with these issues diplomatically . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp obama 's strategy seems to be to approach iran as an equal .
the president has recognized that condescending advice or even orders and sanctions wo n't achieve anything .
on the contrary , they can backfire , with the other side feeling duped , disrespected and disdained .
which can only make them clam up . many iranians will be open to obama 's words .
they have been fixated on the us for a long time and have been eager to restart relations .
however , in tehran 's political circles , even the most reconciliatory statements from washington will be met with mistrust and at least initial rejection - as iran 's highest leader , ayatollah ali khamenei , demonstrated on saturday , march 21 . in a new year 's speech in mashhad , he criticized the us president , saying obama could n't wish the iranians a happy new year , while at the same time accusing them of supporting terrorism and violence . the iranian leader did n't want to understand that these were the differences of opinion that obama had referred to : iran 's support for hezbollah and hamas , and the suspicion that tehran is building nuclear weapons . just a day earlier , khamenei had celebrated the development of iran 's nuclear program as the greatest success of the past few years and it 's unlikely he 'll change his mind on this issue .
but the question remains whether he 'll give the green light for direct contact with the americans in various matters , no matter how controversial the standpoints between washington and tehran may be . the two can and should try to build on their commonalities .

but if ukraine ca n't pay , europe may not get any gas . on monday , march 23 , ukraine 's president viktor yushchenko and prime minister yulia tymoshenko - currently feuding ahead of presidential elections - are set to meet the head of the eu 's executive , jose manuel barroso , and officials from the world bank , european investment bank and energy companies in brussels .
they are expected to sign a joint declaration committing ukraine to reforming the rules for operating its gas network .
that should pave the way for western and russian donors to invest in the renovation of the network , eu diplomats told dpa news agency .
huge investments needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tymoshenko , left , and yushchenko are political opponents one fifth of all the natural gas consumed in the eu flows through ukraine 's 13,500-kilometer -lrb- 8,400-mile -rrb- network of gas pipelines .
some experts have said that the network will need some 2.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.4 billion -rrb- in investment over the next six years just to keep the pipes and pumping stations in working order .
analysts say that ukrainian monopoly naftogaz , which runs the pipeline system , is having difficulties attracting the necessary investment due to a perceived lack of transparency both in its management and in ukraine 's top political leadership .
" i see a situation later this year where naftogaz will not be able to meet its payment obligations to gazprom because of its worsening financial situation , " robert shetler-jones from swiss-based gas trader rosukrenergo -lrb- rue -rrb- told reuters news agency .
rue is owned by russian gas giant gazprom and two ukrainian businessmen .

the drama was repeated in january , when gas supplies to the eu were stalled for two weeks .
the eu has said it is interested in becoming less dependent on both russia and ukraine as energy suppliers .

" what is the ' eastern partnership ' ?
is it a sphere of influence , including belarus ? "
on friday , after a two-day summit in brussels , eu leaders approved the new partnership , which would allow the union to increase its aid to armenia , azerbaijan , georgia , moldova , ukraine and possibly belarus by 600 million euros -lrb- $ 814 million -rrb- .
" our dream has come true , we have been able to adopt the eastern partnership , " said czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
under the scheme , the eu is to negotiate new association agreements - accords setting terms for cooperation with non-member states - as reward for democratic and free-market reforms .
the plan envisages the gradual creation of a free-trade zone with the countries .
of the 600 million euros in aid , some 350 million euros will be new funds for strengthening state institutions , border control and assistance for small companies .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the belarusian opposition wants to see the country advance toward the eu the eu 's interest in its eastern neighborhood has surged since russia 's august invasion of georgia .
the bloc is now keen to strengthen its ties with its neighbors to counter-balance moscow 's growing assertiveness in the region .
as a gesture of goodwill towards russia 's staunch ally belarus , eu foreign ministers on monday extended until december the suspension of travel restrictions for the country 's top government officials , including president alexander lukashenko , the eu put the ban into effect in 2006 in response to human rights violations allegedly committed by lukashenko , whose regime former us secretary of state condoleezza rice once called " the last remaining true dictatorship in the heart of europe . "
but the bloc put the visa ban on ice in october in a bid to encourage the belarus president to take a more pro-western and pro-democracy course as part of a carrot-and-stick policy .
a sore spot for russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west did not recognize the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia lavrov , however , condemned the union 's effort to draw ex-soviet countries closer to the west as meddling into other countries ' internal affairs .
" when my good friend karel schwarzenberg publicly says that if belarus recognizes abkhazia and south ossetia it could forget about " eastern partnership " , is it blackmail or is it democracy at work ? "
" after those kinds of statements , we have questions , " lavrov added .
" is it about pulling countries -lrb- away -rrb- from the decisions that they are supposed to take freely ? "
russia recognized the independence of the breakaway georgian regions following its short war in georgia in august to widespread international condemnation .
moscow has been urging its neighbor to follow suit .
the official launch of the eu 's partnership with six eastern european countries , which is backed strongly by poland and sweden , is set for may 7 , although doubts remain about whether lukashenko will be invited .
" that will depend on the behavior of mr. lukashenko and the belarus government in the coming weeks , but belarus should be in the ' eastern partnership ' , " schwarzenberg said on friday . tt / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , tehran 's ideologists are standing in the way . barack obama is getting serious .
he had already expressed his readiness to negotiate with iran , and now the american president has used the iranian new year 's festival " nourouz " as an opportunity to offer tehran a fresh start . obama may have praised iran 's cultural heritage , but his compliments were not the most important aspect of his address .
after all , similar things were also heard from george w. bush , who treated iran as part of his " axis of evil . " more important were the openness and clarity with which obama explained to the iranians that there are differences of opinion between the two countries , but that he 's prepared to deal with these issues diplomatically . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp obama 's strategy seems to be to approach iran as an equal .
the president has recognized that condescending advice or even orders and sanctions wo n't achieve anything .
on the contrary , they can backfire , with the other side feeling duped , disrespected and disdained .
which can only make them clam up . many iranians will be open to obama 's words .
they have been fixated on the us for a long time and have been eager to restart relations .
however , in tehran 's political circles , even the most reconciliatory statements from washington will be met with mistrust and at least initial rejection - as iran 's highest leader , ayatollah ali khamenei , demonstrated on saturday , march 21 . in a new year 's speech in mashhad , he criticized the us president , saying obama could n't wish the iranians a happy new year , while at the same time accusing them of supporting terrorism and violence . the iranian leader did n't want to understand that these were the differences of opinion that obama had referred to : iran 's support for hezbollah and hamas , and the suspicion that tehran is building nuclear weapons . just a day earlier , khamenei had celebrated the development of iran 's nuclear program as the greatest success of the past few years and it 's unlikely he 'll change his mind on this issue .
but the question remains whether he 'll give the green light for direct contact with the americans in various matters , no matter how controversial the standpoints between washington and tehran may be . the two can and should try to build on their commonalities .
both the us and iran , for example , have similar interests in iraq and - even more so - in afghanistan .
both countries should try to calm down and stop making trouble - neither for neighbor iran nor for the rest of the world . if these common interests can be worked out - perhaps at the upcoming afghanistan conference in the hague - why should n't the more controversial issues be tackled after that ? a lot depends on mutual trust and there seem to be a shortage in that area .
there 's a cogent reason for this , particularly in tehran : the ideologists of the " islamic republic " apparently fear that rapprochement with the us could undermine their state doctrine . for them , it 's easier with an enemy like the us . peter philipp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de women -pipe- 21.03.2009 working women in germany protest salary gap großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the salary gap still has n't closed for german women women in germany earn nearly a quarter less than men , compared to an average of 17 percent in the rest of europe .
equal pay day is observed to draw attention to the persistent discrepancy . it 's not by chance that equal pay day is held on march 20 in germany .
this is the date up to which german women on average had to work this year , in addition to last year , to earn as much as their male counterparts did in 2008 .
although the " same salary for the same work " policy has been part of german law for more than 30 years , the pay gap between genders continues to exist .
the organization for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- has been publishing figures on salary disparity between european men and women for a few years , and germany ranks third among the 27 eu members .
the salary gap between men and women who perform the same jobs is only higher in estonia and cyprus .
the discrepancy between non-skilled workers is the narrowest and the widest gap is between highly-qualified workers at up to 35 percent .
hard to grasp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen is also puzzled by the salary discrepancies germany 's minister for family affairs ursula von der leyen gave a specific example , noting that , despite the fact that they are equally capable of taking blood , changing beds and measuring fevers , " female nurses receive 100 euros -lrb- $ 135 -rrb- less a month than male nurses . "
" i simply ca n't explain it , " she added .
the phenomenon has prompted the business and professional women 's foundation to protest openly .
they have adopted the symbol of the red bag used by the us sister organization , so that " numbers in the black will arise from bags in the red , " said dagmar terbeznik of the german branch of the business and professional women 's foundation .
the reasons why equal work is still not rewarded with equal pay in germany are numerous .
studies have shown that german women place greater emphasis on the quality of their work and the working atmosphere rather than on salary .
" the tax system in germany encourages women to take a part-time job when their husband earns more than them , " astrid ziegler , a researcher at the wsi social economics institute in dusseldorf , told afp news agency .
in addition , a shortage of day-care options and the fact that schools are not open all day make it difficult for women to combine a job with family life , she added .
traditional roles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a shortage of daycare and pre-school options in germany but it is also known that factors such as performance-based salaries and free working arrangements also contribute to keeping women 's salaries below those of their male counterparts .
many german families still observe tradition roles , with men as the primary breadwinners .
silke anger from the german institute for economic research has been studying the problem of unpaid work for a long time .
she developed the following thesis : housework makes women poor .
" energy that is invested in house work is then missing at work , " said the economist .
" those who iron and do the laundry at home and do the shopping do n't have the energy for gainful employment . "
anger suspects that some employers offer married women smaller salaries from the outset .
human resources bosses often assume that these women have to divide their energy between their careers and their household .
time for government intervention ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german companies are not open about their salary policies the business and professional women 's foundation has said that , among other things , a lack of transparency in german companies is responsible for the wage differences .
in many companies , it is even recommended to employees that they refrain from speaking about what they earn .
the foundation , however wants german companies to be obligated - as is the case in forerunner sweden - to disclose how much their employees earn .
women 's salary negotiations can then be conducted in a more goal-oriented manner with this kind of information serving as the foundation for the discussions .
many politicians also say it is time to put the pressure on companies .
the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has recently agreed on a program that advances a legal quota for members on a company 's board of directors and " discrimination checks " for contracts .
" the time for voluntary measures by companies is over , " said party group leader christel humme . ls / kjb / tt / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , tehran 's ideologists are standing in the way . barack obama is getting serious .
he had already expressed his readiness to negotiate with iran , and now the american president has used the iranian new year 's festival " nourouz " as an opportunity to offer tehran a fresh start . obama may have praised iran 's cultural heritage , but his compliments were not the most important aspect of his address .
after all , similar things were also heard from george w. bush , who treated iran as part of his " axis of evil . " more important were the openness and clarity with which obama explained to the iranians that there are differences of opinion between the two countries , but that he 's prepared to deal with these issues diplomatically . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp obama 's strategy seems to be to approach iran as an equal .
the president has recognized that condescending advice or even orders and sanctions wo n't achieve anything .
on the contrary , they can backfire , with the other side feeling duped , disrespected and disdained .
which can only make them clam up . many iranians will be open to obama 's words .
they have been fixated on the us for a long time and have been eager to restart relations .
however , in tehran 's political circles , even the most reconciliatory statements from washington will be met with mistrust and at least initial rejection - as iran 's highest leader , ayatollah ali khamenei , demonstrated on saturday , march 21 . in a new year 's speech in mashhad , he criticized the us president , saying obama could n't wish the iranians a happy new year , while at the same time accusing them of supporting terrorism and violence . the iranian leader did n't want to understand that these were the differences of opinion that obama had referred to : iran 's support for hezbollah and hamas , and the suspicion that tehran is building nuclear weapons . just a day earlier , khamenei had celebrated the development of iran 's nuclear program as the greatest success of the past few years and it 's unlikely he 'll change his mind on this issue .
but the question remains whether he 'll give the green light for direct contact with the americans in various matters , no matter how controversial the standpoints between washington and tehran may be . the two can and should try to build on their commonalities .
both the us and iran , for example , have similar interests in iraq and - even more so - in afghanistan .
both countries should try to calm down and stop making trouble - neither for neighbor iran nor for the rest of the world . if these common interests can be worked out - perhaps at the upcoming afghanistan conference in the hague - why should n't the more controversial issues be tackled after that ? a lot depends on mutual trust and there seem to be a shortage in that area .
there 's a cogent reason for this , particularly in tehran : the ideologists of the " islamic republic " apparently fear that rapprochement with the us could undermine their state doctrine . for them , it 's easier with an enemy like the us . peter philipp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de women -pipe- 21.03.2009 working women in germany protest salary gap großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the salary gap still has n't closed for german women women in germany earn nearly a quarter less than men , compared to an average of 17 percent in the rest of europe .
equal pay day is observed to draw attention to the persistent discrepancy . it 's not by chance that equal pay day is held on march 20 in germany .
this is the date up to which german women on average had to work this year , in addition to last year , to earn as much as their male counterparts did in 2008 .
although the " same salary for the same work " policy has been part of german law for more than 30 years , the pay gap between genders continues to exist .
the organization for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- has been publishing figures on salary disparity between european men and women for a few years , and germany ranks third among the 27 eu members .
the salary gap between men and women who perform the same jobs is only higher in estonia and cyprus .
the discrepancy between non-skilled workers is the narrowest and the widest gap is between highly-qualified workers at up to 35 percent .
hard to grasp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen is also puzzled by the salary discrepancies germany 's minister for family affairs ursula von der leyen gave a specific example , noting that , despite the fact that they are equally capable of taking blood , changing beds and measuring fevers , " female nurses receive 100 euros -lrb- $ 135 -rrb- less a month than male nurses . "
" i simply ca n't explain it , " she added .
the phenomenon has prompted the business and professional women 's foundation to protest openly .
they have adopted the symbol of the red bag used by the us sister organization , so that " numbers in the black will arise from bags in the red , " said dagmar terbeznik of the german branch of the business and professional women 's foundation .
the reasons why equal work is still not rewarded with equal pay in germany are numerous .
studies have shown that german women place greater emphasis on the quality of their work and the working atmosphere rather than on salary .
" the tax system in germany encourages women to take a part-time job when their husband earns more than them , " astrid ziegler , a researcher at the wsi social economics institute in dusseldorf , told afp news agency .
in addition , a shortage of day-care options and the fact that schools are not open all day make it difficult for women to combine a job with family life , she added .
traditional roles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a shortage of daycare and pre-school options in germany but it is also known that factors such as performance-based salaries and free working arrangements also contribute to keeping women 's salaries below those of their male counterparts .
many german families still observe tradition roles , with men as the primary breadwinners .
silke anger from the german institute for economic research has been studying the problem of unpaid work for a long time .
she developed the following thesis : housework makes women poor .
" energy that is invested in house work is then missing at work , " said the economist .
" those who iron and do the laundry at home and do the shopping do n't have the energy for gainful employment . "
anger suspects that some employers offer married women smaller salaries from the outset .
human resources bosses often assume that these women have to divide their energy between their careers and their household .
time for government intervention ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german companies are not open about their salary policies the business and professional women 's foundation has said that , among other things , a lack of transparency in german companies is responsible for the wage differences .
in many companies , it is even recommended to employees that they refrain from speaking about what they earn .
the foundation , however wants german companies to be obligated - as is the case in forerunner sweden - to disclose how much their employees earn .
women 's salary negotiations can then be conducted in a more goal-oriented manner with this kind of information serving as the foundation for the discussions .
many politicians also say it is time to put the pressure on companies .
the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has recently agreed on a program that advances a legal quota for members on a company 's board of directors and " discrimination checks " for contracts .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de women -pipe- 21.03.2009 working women in germany protest salary gap großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the salary gap still has n't closed for german women women in germany earn nearly a quarter less than men , compared to an average of 17 percent in the rest of europe .
equal pay day is observed to draw attention to the persistent discrepancy . it 's not by chance that equal pay day is held on march 20 in germany .
this is the date up to which german women on average had to work this year , in addition to last year , to earn as much as their male counterparts did in 2008 .
although the " same salary for the same work " policy has been part of german law for more than 30 years , the pay gap between genders continues to exist .
the organization for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- has been publishing figures on salary disparity between european men and women for a few years , and germany ranks third among the 27 eu members .
the salary gap between men and women who perform the same jobs is only higher in estonia and cyprus .
the discrepancy between non-skilled workers is the narrowest and the widest gap is between highly-qualified workers at up to 35 percent .
hard to grasp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen is also puzzled by the salary discrepancies germany 's minister for family affairs ursula von der leyen gave a specific example , noting that , despite the fact that they are equally capable of taking blood , changing beds and measuring fevers , " female nurses receive 100 euros -lrb- $ 135 -rrb- less a month than male nurses . "
" i simply ca n't explain it , " she added .
the phenomenon has prompted the business and professional women 's foundation to protest openly .
they have adopted the symbol of the red bag used by the us sister organization , so that " numbers in the black will arise from bags in the red , " said dagmar terbeznik of the german branch of the business and professional women 's foundation .
the reasons why equal work is still not rewarded with equal pay in germany are numerous .
studies have shown that german women place greater emphasis on the quality of their work and the working atmosphere rather than on salary .
" the tax system in germany encourages women to take a part-time job when their husband earns more than them , " astrid ziegler , a researcher at the wsi social economics institute in dusseldorf , told afp news agency .
in addition , a shortage of day-care options and the fact that schools are not open all day make it difficult for women to combine a job with family life , she added .
traditional roles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a shortage of daycare and pre-school options in germany but it is also known that factors such as performance-based salaries and free working arrangements also contribute to keeping women 's salaries below those of their male counterparts .
many german families still observe tradition roles , with men as the primary breadwinners .
silke anger from the german institute for economic research has been studying the problem of unpaid work for a long time .
she developed the following thesis : housework makes women poor .
" energy that is invested in house work is then missing at work , " said the economist .
" those who iron and do the laundry at home and do the shopping do n't have the energy for gainful employment . "
anger suspects that some employers offer married women smaller salaries from the outset .
human resources bosses often assume that these women have to divide their energy between their careers and their household .
time for government intervention ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german companies are not open about their salary policies the business and professional women 's foundation has said that , among other things , a lack of transparency in german companies is responsible for the wage differences .
in many companies , it is even recommended to employees that they refrain from speaking about what they earn .
the foundation , however wants german companies to be obligated - as is the case in forerunner sweden - to disclose how much their employees earn .
women 's salary negotiations can then be conducted in a more goal-oriented manner with this kind of information serving as the foundation for the discussions .
many politicians also say it is time to put the pressure on companies .
the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has recently agreed on a program that advances a legal quota for members on a company 's board of directors and " discrimination checks " for contracts .
" the time for voluntary measures by companies is over , " said party group leader christel humme . ls / kjb / tt / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but if ukraine ca n't pay , europe may not get any gas . on monday , march 23 , ukraine 's president viktor yushchenko and prime minister yulia tymoshenko - currently feuding ahead of presidential elections - are set to meet the head of the eu 's executive , jose manuel barroso , and officials from the world bank , european investment bank and energy companies in brussels .
they are expected to sign a joint declaration committing ukraine to reforming the rules for operating its gas network .
that should pave the way for western and russian donors to invest in the renovation of the network , eu diplomats told dpa news agency .
huge investments needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tymoshenko , left , and yushchenko are political opponents one fifth of all the natural gas consumed in the eu flows through ukraine 's 13,500-kilometer -lrb- 8,400-mile -rrb- network of gas pipelines .
some experts have said that the network will need some 2.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.4 billion -rrb- in investment over the next six years just to keep the pipes and pumping stations in working order .
analysts say that ukrainian monopoly naftogaz , which runs the pipeline system , is having difficulties attracting the necessary investment due to a perceived lack of transparency both in its management and in ukraine 's top political leadership .
" i see a situation later this year where naftogaz will not be able to meet its payment obligations to gazprom because of its worsening financial situation , " robert shetler-jones from swiss-based gas trader rosukrenergo -lrb- rue -rrb- told reuters news agency .
rue is owned by russian gas giant gazprom and two ukrainian businessmen .
" if ukraine continued not to pay , then this could have a serious impact on the european gas supplies , " added shetler-jones . a highly-charged issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian energy giant gazprom has the full backing of the kremlin the question of ukraine 's gas transit system has been a highly-charged one ever since a row with russia in 2005-2006 provoked russian gas monopoly gazprom to shut supplies off to ukraine , causing severe shortfalls in europe .
the drama was repeated in january , when gas supplies to the eu were stalled for two weeks .
the eu has said it is interested in becoming less dependent on both russia and ukraine as energy suppliers .
on thursday , eu leaders agreed to give 200 million euros to the " nabucco " pipeline project , which is meant to bypass both countries and bring gas directly from the caspian sea to europe . tt / kjb / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de women -pipe- 21.03.2009 working women in germany protest salary gap großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the salary gap still has n't closed for german women women in germany earn nearly a quarter less than men , compared to an average of 17 percent in the rest of europe .
equal pay day is observed to draw attention to the persistent discrepancy . it 's not by chance that equal pay day is held on march 20 in germany .
this is the date up to which german women on average had to work this year , in addition to last year , to earn as much as their male counterparts did in 2008 .
although the " same salary for the same work " policy has been part of german law for more than 30 years , the pay gap between genders continues to exist .
the organization for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- has been publishing figures on salary disparity between european men and women for a few years , and germany ranks third among the 27 eu members .
the salary gap between men and women who perform the same jobs is only higher in estonia and cyprus .
the discrepancy between non-skilled workers is the narrowest and the widest gap is between highly-qualified workers at up to 35 percent .
hard to grasp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen is also puzzled by the salary discrepancies germany 's minister for family affairs ursula von der leyen gave a specific example , noting that , despite the fact that they are equally capable of taking blood , changing beds and measuring fevers , " female nurses receive 100 euros -lrb- $ 135 -rrb- less a month than male nurses . "
" i simply ca n't explain it , " she added .
the phenomenon has prompted the business and professional women 's foundation to protest openly .
they have adopted the symbol of the red bag used by the us sister organization , so that " numbers in the black will arise from bags in the red , " said dagmar terbeznik of the german branch of the business and professional women 's foundation .
the reasons why equal work is still not rewarded with equal pay in germany are numerous .
studies have shown that german women place greater emphasis on the quality of their work and the working atmosphere rather than on salary .
" the tax system in germany encourages women to take a part-time job when their husband earns more than them , " astrid ziegler , a researcher at the wsi social economics institute in dusseldorf , told afp news agency .
in addition , a shortage of day-care options and the fact that schools are not open all day make it difficult for women to combine a job with family life , she added .
traditional roles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a shortage of daycare and pre-school options in germany but it is also known that factors such as performance-based salaries and free working arrangements also contribute to keeping women 's salaries below those of their male counterparts .
many german families still observe tradition roles , with men as the primary breadwinners .
silke anger from the german institute for economic research has been studying the problem of unpaid work for a long time .
she developed the following thesis : housework makes women poor .
" energy that is invested in house work is then missing at work , " said the economist .
" those who iron and do the laundry at home and do the shopping do n't have the energy for gainful employment . "
anger suspects that some employers offer married women smaller salaries from the outset .
human resources bosses often assume that these women have to divide their energy between their careers and their household .
time for government intervention ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german companies are not open about their salary policies the business and professional women 's foundation has said that , among other things , a lack of transparency in german companies is responsible for the wage differences .
in many companies , it is even recommended to employees that they refrain from speaking about what they earn .
the foundation , however wants german companies to be obligated - as is the case in forerunner sweden - to disclose how much their employees earn .
women 's salary negotiations can then be conducted in a more goal-oriented manner with this kind of information serving as the foundation for the discussions .
many politicians also say it is time to put the pressure on companies .
the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has recently agreed on a program that advances a legal quota for members on a company 's board of directors and " discrimination checks " for contracts .
" the time for voluntary measures by companies is over , " said party group leader christel humme . ls / kjb / tt / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but if ukraine ca n't pay , europe may not get any gas . on monday , march 23 , ukraine 's president viktor yushchenko and prime minister yulia tymoshenko - currently feuding ahead of presidential elections - are set to meet the head of the eu 's executive , jose manuel barroso , and officials from the world bank , european investment bank and energy companies in brussels .
they are expected to sign a joint declaration committing ukraine to reforming the rules for operating its gas network .
that should pave the way for western and russian donors to invest in the renovation of the network , eu diplomats told dpa news agency .
huge investments needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tymoshenko , left , and yushchenko are political opponents one fifth of all the natural gas consumed in the eu flows through ukraine 's 13,500-kilometer -lrb- 8,400-mile -rrb- network of gas pipelines .
some experts have said that the network will need some 2.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.4 billion -rrb- in investment over the next six years just to keep the pipes and pumping stations in working order .
analysts say that ukrainian monopoly naftogaz , which runs the pipeline system , is having difficulties attracting the necessary investment due to a perceived lack of transparency both in its management and in ukraine 's top political leadership .
" i see a situation later this year where naftogaz will not be able to meet its payment obligations to gazprom because of its worsening financial situation , " robert shetler-jones from swiss-based gas trader rosukrenergo -lrb- rue -rrb- told reuters news agency .
rue is owned by russian gas giant gazprom and two ukrainian businessmen .
" if ukraine continued not to pay , then this could have a serious impact on the european gas supplies , " added shetler-jones . a highly-charged issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian energy giant gazprom has the full backing of the kremlin the question of ukraine 's gas transit system has been a highly-charged one ever since a row with russia in 2005-2006 provoked russian gas monopoly gazprom to shut supplies off to ukraine , causing severe shortfalls in europe .
the drama was repeated in january , when gas supplies to the eu were stalled for two weeks .
the eu has said it is interested in becoming less dependent on both russia and ukraine as energy suppliers .
on thursday , eu leaders agreed to give 200 million euros to the " nabucco " pipeline project , which is meant to bypass both countries and bring gas directly from the caspian sea to europe . tt / kjb / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de women -pipe- 21.03.2009 working women in germany protest salary gap großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the salary gap still has n't closed for german women women in germany earn nearly a quarter less than men , compared to an average of 17 percent in the rest of europe .
equal pay day is observed to draw attention to the persistent discrepancy . it 's not by chance that equal pay day is held on march 20 in germany .
this is the date up to which german women on average had to work this year , in addition to last year , to earn as much as their male counterparts did in 2008 .
although the " same salary for the same work " policy has been part of german law for more than 30 years , the pay gap between genders continues to exist .
the organization for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- has been publishing figures on salary disparity between european men and women for a few years , and germany ranks third among the 27 eu members .
the salary gap between men and women who perform the same jobs is only higher in estonia and cyprus .
the discrepancy between non-skilled workers is the narrowest and the widest gap is between highly-qualified workers at up to 35 percent .
hard to grasp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen is also puzzled by the salary discrepancies germany 's minister for family affairs ursula von der leyen gave a specific example , noting that , despite the fact that they are equally capable of taking blood , changing beds and measuring fevers , " female nurses receive 100 euros -lrb- $ 135 -rrb- less a month than male nurses . "
" i simply ca n't explain it , " she added .
the phenomenon has prompted the business and professional women 's foundation to protest openly .
they have adopted the symbol of the red bag used by the us sister organization , so that " numbers in the black will arise from bags in the red , " said dagmar terbeznik of the german branch of the business and professional women 's foundation .
the reasons why equal work is still not rewarded with equal pay in germany are numerous .
studies have shown that german women place greater emphasis on the quality of their work and the working atmosphere rather than on salary .
" the tax system in germany encourages women to take a part-time job when their husband earns more than them , " astrid ziegler , a researcher at the wsi social economics institute in dusseldorf , told afp news agency .
in addition , a shortage of day-care options and the fact that schools are not open all day make it difficult for women to combine a job with family life , she added .
traditional roles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a shortage of daycare and pre-school options in germany but it is also known that factors such as performance-based salaries and free working arrangements also contribute to keeping women 's salaries below those of their male counterparts .
many german families still observe tradition roles , with men as the primary breadwinners .
silke anger from the german institute for economic research has been studying the problem of unpaid work for a long time .
she developed the following thesis : housework makes women poor .
" energy that is invested in house work is then missing at work , " said the economist .
" those who iron and do the laundry at home and do the shopping do n't have the energy for gainful employment . "
anger suspects that some employers offer married women smaller salaries from the outset .
human resources bosses often assume that these women have to divide their energy between their careers and their household .
time for government intervention ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german companies are not open about their salary policies the business and professional women 's foundation has said that , among other things , a lack of transparency in german companies is responsible for the wage differences .
in many companies , it is even recommended to employees that they refrain from speaking about what they earn .
the foundation , however wants german companies to be obligated - as is the case in forerunner sweden - to disclose how much their employees earn .
women 's salary negotiations can then be conducted in a more goal-oriented manner with this kind of information serving as the foundation for the discussions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de women -pipe- 21.03.2009 working women in germany protest salary gap großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the salary gap still has n't closed for german women women in germany earn nearly a quarter less than men , compared to an average of 17 percent in the rest of europe .
equal pay day is observed to draw attention to the persistent discrepancy . it 's not by chance that equal pay day is held on march 20 in germany .
this is the date up to which german women on average had to work this year , in addition to last year , to earn as much as their male counterparts did in 2008 .
although the " same salary for the same work " policy has been part of german law for more than 30 years , the pay gap between genders continues to exist .
the organization for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- has been publishing figures on salary disparity between european men and women for a few years , and germany ranks third among the 27 eu members .
the salary gap between men and women who perform the same jobs is only higher in estonia and cyprus .
the discrepancy between non-skilled workers is the narrowest and the widest gap is between highly-qualified workers at up to 35 percent .
hard to grasp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen is also puzzled by the salary discrepancies germany 's minister for family affairs ursula von der leyen gave a specific example , noting that , despite the fact that they are equally capable of taking blood , changing beds and measuring fevers , " female nurses receive 100 euros -lrb- $ 135 -rrb- less a month than male nurses . "
" i simply ca n't explain it , " she added .
the phenomenon has prompted the business and professional women 's foundation to protest openly .
they have adopted the symbol of the red bag used by the us sister organization , so that " numbers in the black will arise from bags in the red , " said dagmar terbeznik of the german branch of the business and professional women 's foundation .
the reasons why equal work is still not rewarded with equal pay in germany are numerous .
studies have shown that german women place greater emphasis on the quality of their work and the working atmosphere rather than on salary .
" the tax system in germany encourages women to take a part-time job when their husband earns more than them , " astrid ziegler , a researcher at the wsi social economics institute in dusseldorf , told afp news agency .
in addition , a shortage of day-care options and the fact that schools are not open all day make it difficult for women to combine a job with family life , she added .
traditional roles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a shortage of daycare and pre-school options in germany but it is also known that factors such as performance-based salaries and free working arrangements also contribute to keeping women 's salaries below those of their male counterparts .
many german families still observe tradition roles , with men as the primary breadwinners .
silke anger from the german institute for economic research has been studying the problem of unpaid work for a long time .
she developed the following thesis : housework makes women poor .
" energy that is invested in house work is then missing at work , " said the economist .
" those who iron and do the laundry at home and do the shopping do n't have the energy for gainful employment . "
anger suspects that some employers offer married women smaller salaries from the outset .
human resources bosses often assume that these women have to divide their energy between their careers and their household .
time for government intervention ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german companies are not open about their salary policies the business and professional women 's foundation has said that , among other things , a lack of transparency in german companies is responsible for the wage differences .
in many companies , it is even recommended to employees that they refrain from speaking about what they earn .
the foundation , however wants german companies to be obligated - as is the case in forerunner sweden - to disclose how much their employees earn .
women 's salary negotiations can then be conducted in a more goal-oriented manner with this kind of information serving as the foundation for the discussions .
many politicians also say it is time to put the pressure on companies .
the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has recently agreed on a program that advances a legal quota for members on a company 's board of directors and " discrimination checks " for contracts .

on friday , after a two-day summit in brussels , eu leaders approved the new partnership , which would allow the union to increase its aid to armenia , azerbaijan , georgia , moldova , ukraine and possibly belarus by 600 million euros -lrb- $ 814 million -rrb- .
" our dream has come true , we have been able to adopt the eastern partnership , " said czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
under the scheme , the eu is to negotiate new association agreements - accords setting terms for cooperation with non-member states - as reward for democratic and free-market reforms .
the plan envisages the gradual creation of a free-trade zone with the countries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 21.03.2009 opinion : us and iran should focus on common interests großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if the us and iran start by focusing on common interests like the middle east , they should be able to tackle the more controversial issues , says dw 's peter philipp .
however , tehran 's ideologists are standing in the way . barack obama is getting serious .
he had already expressed his readiness to negotiate with iran , and now the american president has used the iranian new year 's festival " nourouz " as an opportunity to offer tehran a fresh start . obama may have praised iran 's cultural heritage , but his compliments were not the most important aspect of his address .
after all , similar things were also heard from george w. bush , who treated iran as part of his " axis of evil . " more important were the openness and clarity with which obama explained to the iranians that there are differences of opinion between the two countries , but that he 's prepared to deal with these issues diplomatically . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp obama 's strategy seems to be to approach iran as an equal .
the president has recognized that condescending advice or even orders and sanctions wo n't achieve anything .
on the contrary , they can backfire , with the other side feeling duped , disrespected and disdained .
which can only make them clam up . many iranians will be open to obama 's words .
they have been fixated on the us for a long time and have been eager to restart relations .
however , in tehran 's political circles , even the most reconciliatory statements from washington will be met with mistrust and at least initial rejection - as iran 's highest leader , ayatollah ali khamenei , demonstrated on saturday , march 21 . in a new year 's speech in mashhad , he criticized the us president , saying obama could n't wish the iranians a happy new year , while at the same time accusing them of supporting terrorism and violence . the iranian leader did n't want to understand that these were the differences of opinion that obama had referred to : iran 's support for hezbollah and hamas , and the suspicion that tehran is building nuclear weapons . just a day earlier , khamenei had celebrated the development of iran 's nuclear program as the greatest success of the past few years and it 's unlikely he 'll change his mind on this issue .
but the question remains whether he 'll give the green light for direct contact with the americans in various matters , no matter how controversial the standpoints between washington and tehran may be . the two can and should try to build on their commonalities .
both the us and iran , for example , have similar interests in iraq and - even more so - in afghanistan .
both countries should try to calm down and stop making trouble - neither for neighbor iran nor for the rest of the world . if these common interests can be worked out - perhaps at the upcoming afghanistan conference in the hague - why should n't the more controversial issues be tackled after that ? a lot depends on mutual trust and there seem to be a shortage in that area .
there 's a cogent reason for this , particularly in tehran : the ideologists of the " islamic republic " apparently fear that rapprochement with the us could undermine their state doctrine . for them , it 's easier with an enemy like the us . peter philipp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but if ukraine ca n't pay , europe may not get any gas . on monday , march 23 , ukraine 's president viktor yushchenko and prime minister yulia tymoshenko - currently feuding ahead of presidential elections - are set to meet the head of the eu 's executive , jose manuel barroso , and officials from the world bank , european investment bank and energy companies in brussels .
they are expected to sign a joint declaration committing ukraine to reforming the rules for operating its gas network .
that should pave the way for western and russian donors to invest in the renovation of the network , eu diplomats told dpa news agency .
huge investments needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tymoshenko , left , and yushchenko are political opponents one fifth of all the natural gas consumed in the eu flows through ukraine 's 13,500-kilometer -lrb- 8,400-mile -rrb- network of gas pipelines .
some experts have said that the network will need some 2.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.4 billion -rrb- in investment over the next six years just to keep the pipes and pumping stations in working order .
analysts say that ukrainian monopoly naftogaz , which runs the pipeline system , is having difficulties attracting the necessary investment due to a perceived lack of transparency both in its management and in ukraine 's top political leadership .
" i see a situation later this year where naftogaz will not be able to meet its payment obligations to gazprom because of its worsening financial situation , " robert shetler-jones from swiss-based gas trader rosukrenergo -lrb- rue -rrb- told reuters news agency .
rue is owned by russian gas giant gazprom and two ukrainian businessmen .
" if ukraine continued not to pay , then this could have a serious impact on the european gas supplies , " added shetler-jones . a highly-charged issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian energy giant gazprom has the full backing of the kremlin the question of ukraine 's gas transit system has been a highly-charged one ever since a row with russia in 2005-2006 provoked russian gas monopoly gazprom to shut supplies off to ukraine , causing severe shortfalls in europe .
the drama was repeated in january , when gas supplies to the eu were stalled for two weeks .
the eu has said it is interested in becoming less dependent on both russia and ukraine as energy suppliers .
on thursday , eu leaders agreed to give 200 million euros to the " nabucco " pipeline project , which is meant to bypass both countries and bring gas directly from the caspian sea to europe . tt / kjb / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de women -pipe- 21.03.2009 working women in germany protest salary gap großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the salary gap still has n't closed for german women women in germany earn nearly a quarter less than men , compared to an average of 17 percent in the rest of europe .
equal pay day is observed to draw attention to the persistent discrepancy . it 's not by chance that equal pay day is held on march 20 in germany .
this is the date up to which german women on average had to work this year , in addition to last year , to earn as much as their male counterparts did in 2008 .
although the " same salary for the same work " policy has been part of german law for more than 30 years , the pay gap between genders continues to exist .
the organization for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- has been publishing figures on salary disparity between european men and women for a few years , and germany ranks third among the 27 eu members .
the salary gap between men and women who perform the same jobs is only higher in estonia and cyprus .
the discrepancy between non-skilled workers is the narrowest and the widest gap is between highly-qualified workers at up to 35 percent .
hard to grasp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen is also puzzled by the salary discrepancies germany 's minister for family affairs ursula von der leyen gave a specific example , noting that , despite the fact that they are equally capable of taking blood , changing beds and measuring fevers , " female nurses receive 100 euros -lrb- $ 135 -rrb- less a month than male nurses . "
" i simply ca n't explain it , " she added .
the phenomenon has prompted the business and professional women 's foundation to protest openly .
they have adopted the symbol of the red bag used by the us sister organization , so that " numbers in the black will arise from bags in the red , " said dagmar terbeznik of the german branch of the business and professional women 's foundation .
the reasons why equal work is still not rewarded with equal pay in germany are numerous .
studies have shown that german women place greater emphasis on the quality of their work and the working atmosphere rather than on salary .
" the tax system in germany encourages women to take a part-time job when their husband earns more than them , " astrid ziegler , a researcher at the wsi social economics institute in dusseldorf , told afp news agency .
in addition , a shortage of day-care options and the fact that schools are not open all day make it difficult for women to combine a job with family life , she added .
traditional roles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a shortage of daycare and pre-school options in germany but it is also known that factors such as performance-based salaries and free working arrangements also contribute to keeping women 's salaries below those of their male counterparts .
many german families still observe tradition roles , with men as the primary breadwinners .
silke anger from the german institute for economic research has been studying the problem of unpaid work for a long time .
she developed the following thesis : housework makes women poor .
" energy that is invested in house work is then missing at work , " said the economist .
" those who iron and do the laundry at home and do the shopping do n't have the energy for gainful employment . "
anger suspects that some employers offer married women smaller salaries from the outset .
human resources bosses often assume that these women have to divide their energy between their careers and their household .
time for government intervention ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german companies are not open about their salary policies the business and professional women 's foundation has said that , among other things , a lack of transparency in german companies is responsible for the wage differences .
in many companies , it is even recommended to employees that they refrain from speaking about what they earn .
the foundation , however wants german companies to be obligated - as is the case in forerunner sweden - to disclose how much their employees earn .
women 's salary negotiations can then be conducted in a more goal-oriented manner with this kind of information serving as the foundation for the discussions .
many politicians also say it is time to put the pressure on companies .
the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has recently agreed on a program that advances a legal quota for members on a company 's board of directors and " discrimination checks " for contracts .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de women -pipe- 21.03.2009 working women in germany protest salary gap großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the salary gap still has n't closed for german women women in germany earn nearly a quarter less than men , compared to an average of 17 percent in the rest of europe .
equal pay day is observed to draw attention to the persistent discrepancy . it 's not by chance that equal pay day is held on march 20 in germany .
this is the date up to which german women on average had to work this year , in addition to last year , to earn as much as their male counterparts did in 2008 .
although the " same salary for the same work " policy has been part of german law for more than 30 years , the pay gap between genders continues to exist .
the organization for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- has been publishing figures on salary disparity between european men and women for a few years , and germany ranks third among the 27 eu members .
the salary gap between men and women who perform the same jobs is only higher in estonia and cyprus .
the discrepancy between non-skilled workers is the narrowest and the widest gap is between highly-qualified workers at up to 35 percent .
hard to grasp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen is also puzzled by the salary discrepancies germany 's minister for family affairs ursula von der leyen gave a specific example , noting that , despite the fact that they are equally capable of taking blood , changing beds and measuring fevers , " female nurses receive 100 euros -lrb- $ 135 -rrb- less a month than male nurses . "
" i simply ca n't explain it , " she added .
the phenomenon has prompted the business and professional women 's foundation to protest openly .
they have adopted the symbol of the red bag used by the us sister organization , so that " numbers in the black will arise from bags in the red , " said dagmar terbeznik of the german branch of the business and professional women 's foundation .
the reasons why equal work is still not rewarded with equal pay in germany are numerous .
studies have shown that german women place greater emphasis on the quality of their work and the working atmosphere rather than on salary .
" the tax system in germany encourages women to take a part-time job when their husband earns more than them , " astrid ziegler , a researcher at the wsi social economics institute in dusseldorf , told afp news agency .
in addition , a shortage of day-care options and the fact that schools are not open all day make it difficult for women to combine a job with family life , she added .
traditional roles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a shortage of daycare and pre-school options in germany but it is also known that factors such as performance-based salaries and free working arrangements also contribute to keeping women 's salaries below those of their male counterparts .
many german families still observe tradition roles , with men as the primary breadwinners .
silke anger from the german institute for economic research has been studying the problem of unpaid work for a long time .
she developed the following thesis : housework makes women poor .
" energy that is invested in house work is then missing at work , " said the economist .
" those who iron and do the laundry at home and do the shopping do n't have the energy for gainful employment . "
anger suspects that some employers offer married women smaller salaries from the outset .
human resources bosses often assume that these women have to divide their energy between their careers and their household .
time for government intervention ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german companies are not open about their salary policies the business and professional women 's foundation has said that , among other things , a lack of transparency in german companies is responsible for the wage differences .
in many companies , it is even recommended to employees that they refrain from speaking about what they earn .
the foundation , however wants german companies to be obligated - as is the case in forerunner sweden - to disclose how much their employees earn .
women 's salary negotiations can then be conducted in a more goal-oriented manner with this kind of information serving as the foundation for the discussions .
many politicians also say it is time to put the pressure on companies .
the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has recently agreed on a program that advances a legal quota for members on a company 's board of directors and " discrimination checks " for contracts .
" the time for voluntary measures by companies is over , " said party group leader christel humme . ls / kjb / tt / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" what is the ' eastern partnership ' ?
is it a sphere of influence , including belarus ? "
on friday , after a two-day summit in brussels , eu leaders approved the new partnership , which would allow the union to increase its aid to armenia , azerbaijan , georgia , moldova , ukraine and possibly belarus by 600 million euros -lrb- $ 814 million -rrb- .
" our dream has come true , we have been able to adopt the eastern partnership , " said czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
under the scheme , the eu is to negotiate new association agreements - accords setting terms for cooperation with non-member states - as reward for democratic and free-market reforms .
the plan envisages the gradual creation of a free-trade zone with the countries .
of the 600 million euros in aid , some 350 million euros will be new funds for strengthening state institutions , border control and assistance for small companies .
giving belarus a chance ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the belarusian opposition wants to see the country advance toward the eu the eu 's interest in its eastern neighborhood has surged since russia 's august invasion of georgia .
the bloc is now keen to strengthen its ties with its neighbors to counter-balance moscow 's growing assertiveness in the region .
as a gesture of goodwill towards russia 's staunch ally belarus , eu foreign ministers on monday extended until december the suspension of travel restrictions for the country 's top government officials , including president alexander lukashenko , the eu put the ban into effect in 2006 in response to human rights violations allegedly committed by lukashenko , whose regime former us secretary of state condoleezza rice once called " the last remaining true dictatorship in the heart of europe . "
but the bloc put the visa ban on ice in october in a bid to encourage the belarus president to take a more pro-western and pro-democracy course as part of a carrot-and-stick policy .
a sore spot for russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west did not recognize the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia lavrov , however , condemned the union 's effort to draw ex-soviet countries closer to the west as meddling into other countries ' internal affairs .
" when my good friend karel schwarzenberg publicly says that if belarus recognizes abkhazia and south ossetia it could forget about " eastern partnership " , is it blackmail or is it democracy at work ? "
" after those kinds of statements , we have questions , " lavrov added .
" is it about pulling countries -lrb- away -rrb- from the decisions that they are supposed to take freely ? "
russia recognized the independence of the breakaway georgian regions following its short war in georgia in august to widespread international condemnation .
moscow has been urging its neighbor to follow suit .
the official launch of the eu 's partnership with six eastern european countries , which is backed strongly by poland and sweden , is set for may 7 , although doubts remain about whether lukashenko will be invited .
" that will depend on the behavior of mr. lukashenko and the belarus government in the coming weeks , but belarus should be in the ' eastern partnership ' , " schwarzenberg said on friday . tt / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 21.03.2009 opinion : us and iran should focus on common interests großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if the us and iran start by focusing on common interests like the middle east , they should be able to tackle the more controversial issues , says dw 's peter philipp .
however , tehran 's ideologists are standing in the way . barack obama is getting serious .
he had already expressed his readiness to negotiate with iran , and now the american president has used the iranian new year 's festival " nourouz " as an opportunity to offer tehran a fresh start . obama may have praised iran 's cultural heritage , but his compliments were not the most important aspect of his address .
after all , similar things were also heard from george w. bush , who treated iran as part of his " axis of evil . " more important were the openness and clarity with which obama explained to the iranians that there are differences of opinion between the two countries , but that he 's prepared to deal with these issues diplomatically . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp obama 's strategy seems to be to approach iran as an equal .
the president has recognized that condescending advice or even orders and sanctions wo n't achieve anything .
on the contrary , they can backfire , with the other side feeling duped , disrespected and disdained .
which can only make them clam up . many iranians will be open to obama 's words .
they have been fixated on the us for a long time and have been eager to restart relations .
however , in tehran 's political circles , even the most reconciliatory statements from washington will be met with mistrust and at least initial rejection - as iran 's highest leader , ayatollah ali khamenei , demonstrated on saturday , march 21 . in a new year 's speech in mashhad , he criticized the us president , saying obama could n't wish the iranians a happy new year , while at the same time accusing them of supporting terrorism and violence . the iranian leader did n't want to understand that these were the differences of opinion that obama had referred to : iran 's support for hezbollah and hamas , and the suspicion that tehran is building nuclear weapons . just a day earlier , khamenei had celebrated the development of iran 's nuclear program as the greatest success of the past few years and it 's unlikely he 'll change his mind on this issue .
but the question remains whether he 'll give the green light for direct contact with the americans in various matters , no matter how controversial the standpoints between washington and tehran may be . the two can and should try to build on their commonalities .
both the us and iran , for example , have similar interests in iraq and - even more so - in afghanistan .
both countries should try to calm down and stop making trouble - neither for neighbor iran nor for the rest of the world . if these common interests can be worked out - perhaps at the upcoming afghanistan conference in the hague - why should n't the more controversial issues be tackled after that ? a lot depends on mutual trust and there seem to be a shortage in that area .
there 's a cogent reason for this , particularly in tehran : the ideologists of the " islamic republic " apparently fear that rapprochement with the us could undermine their state doctrine . for them , it 's easier with an enemy like the us . peter philipp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" what is the ' eastern partnership ' ?
is it a sphere of influence , including belarus ? "
on friday , after a two-day summit in brussels , eu leaders approved the new partnership , which would allow the union to increase its aid to armenia , azerbaijan , georgia , moldova , ukraine and possibly belarus by 600 million euros -lrb- $ 814 million -rrb- .
" our dream has come true , we have been able to adopt the eastern partnership , " said czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
under the scheme , the eu is to negotiate new association agreements - accords setting terms for cooperation with non-member states - as reward for democratic and free-market reforms .
the plan envisages the gradual creation of a free-trade zone with the countries .
of the 600 million euros in aid , some 350 million euros will be new funds for strengthening state institutions , border control and assistance for small companies .
giving belarus a chance ?

however , tehran 's ideologists are standing in the way . barack obama is getting serious .
he had already expressed his readiness to negotiate with iran , and now the american president has used the iranian new year 's festival " nourouz " as an opportunity to offer tehran a fresh start . obama may have praised iran 's cultural heritage , but his compliments were not the most important aspect of his address .
after all , similar things were also heard from george w. bush , who treated iran as part of his " axis of evil . " more important were the openness and clarity with which obama explained to the iranians that there are differences of opinion between the two countries , but that he 's prepared to deal with these issues diplomatically . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp obama 's strategy seems to be to approach iran as an equal .
the president has recognized that condescending advice or even orders and sanctions wo n't achieve anything .
on the contrary , they can backfire , with the other side feeling duped , disrespected and disdained .
which can only make them clam up . many iranians will be open to obama 's words .
they have been fixated on the us for a long time and have been eager to restart relations .
however , in tehran 's political circles , even the most reconciliatory statements from washington will be met with mistrust and at least initial rejection - as iran 's highest leader , ayatollah ali khamenei , demonstrated on saturday , march 21 . in a new year 's speech in mashhad , he criticized the us president , saying obama could n't wish the iranians a happy new year , while at the same time accusing them of supporting terrorism and violence . the iranian leader did n't want to understand that these were the differences of opinion that obama had referred to : iran 's support for hezbollah and hamas , and the suspicion that tehran is building nuclear weapons . just a day earlier , khamenei had celebrated the development of iran 's nuclear program as the greatest success of the past few years and it 's unlikely he 'll change his mind on this issue .
but the question remains whether he 'll give the green light for direct contact with the americans in various matters , no matter how controversial the standpoints between washington and tehran may be . the two can and should try to build on their commonalities .
both the us and iran , for example , have similar interests in iraq and - even more so - in afghanistan .
both countries should try to calm down and stop making trouble - neither for neighbor iran nor for the rest of the world . if these common interests can be worked out - perhaps at the upcoming afghanistan conference in the hague - why should n't the more controversial issues be tackled after that ? a lot depends on mutual trust and there seem to be a shortage in that area .
there 's a cogent reason for this , particularly in tehran : the ideologists of the " islamic republic " apparently fear that rapprochement with the us could undermine their state doctrine . for them , it 's easier with an enemy like the us . peter philipp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de women -pipe- 21.03.2009 working women in germany protest salary gap großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the salary gap still has n't closed for german women women in germany earn nearly a quarter less than men , compared to an average of 17 percent in the rest of europe .
equal pay day is observed to draw attention to the persistent discrepancy . it 's not by chance that equal pay day is held on march 20 in germany .
this is the date up to which german women on average had to work this year , in addition to last year , to earn as much as their male counterparts did in 2008 .
although the " same salary for the same work " policy has been part of german law for more than 30 years , the pay gap between genders continues to exist .
the organization for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- has been publishing figures on salary disparity between european men and women for a few years , and germany ranks third among the 27 eu members .
the salary gap between men and women who perform the same jobs is only higher in estonia and cyprus .
the discrepancy between non-skilled workers is the narrowest and the widest gap is between highly-qualified workers at up to 35 percent .
hard to grasp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen is also puzzled by the salary discrepancies germany 's minister for family affairs ursula von der leyen gave a specific example , noting that , despite the fact that they are equally capable of taking blood , changing beds and measuring fevers , " female nurses receive 100 euros -lrb- $ 135 -rrb- less a month than male nurses . "
" i simply ca n't explain it , " she added .
the phenomenon has prompted the business and professional women 's foundation to protest openly .
they have adopted the symbol of the red bag used by the us sister organization , so that " numbers in the black will arise from bags in the red , " said dagmar terbeznik of the german branch of the business and professional women 's foundation .
the reasons why equal work is still not rewarded with equal pay in germany are numerous .
studies have shown that german women place greater emphasis on the quality of their work and the working atmosphere rather than on salary .
" the tax system in germany encourages women to take a part-time job when their husband earns more than them , " astrid ziegler , a researcher at the wsi social economics institute in dusseldorf , told afp news agency .
in addition , a shortage of day-care options and the fact that schools are not open all day make it difficult for women to combine a job with family life , she added .
traditional roles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a shortage of daycare and pre-school options in germany but it is also known that factors such as performance-based salaries and free working arrangements also contribute to keeping women 's salaries below those of their male counterparts .
many german families still observe tradition roles , with men as the primary breadwinners .
silke anger from the german institute for economic research has been studying the problem of unpaid work for a long time .
she developed the following thesis : housework makes women poor .
" energy that is invested in house work is then missing at work , " said the economist .
" those who iron and do the laundry at home and do the shopping do n't have the energy for gainful employment . "
anger suspects that some employers offer married women smaller salaries from the outset .
human resources bosses often assume that these women have to divide their energy between their careers and their household .
time for government intervention ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german companies are not open about their salary policies the business and professional women 's foundation has said that , among other things , a lack of transparency in german companies is responsible for the wage differences .
in many companies , it is even recommended to employees that they refrain from speaking about what they earn .
the foundation , however wants german companies to be obligated - as is the case in forerunner sweden - to disclose how much their employees earn .
women 's salary negotiations can then be conducted in a more goal-oriented manner with this kind of information serving as the foundation for the discussions .
many politicians also say it is time to put the pressure on companies .
the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has recently agreed on a program that advances a legal quota for members on a company 's board of directors and " discrimination checks " for contracts .
" the time for voluntary measures by companies is over , " said party group leader christel humme . ls / kjb / tt / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , tehran 's ideologists are standing in the way . barack obama is getting serious .
he had already expressed his readiness to negotiate with iran , and now the american president has used the iranian new year 's festival " nourouz " as an opportunity to offer tehran a fresh start . obama may have praised iran 's cultural heritage , but his compliments were not the most important aspect of his address .
after all , similar things were also heard from george w. bush , who treated iran as part of his " axis of evil . " more important were the openness and clarity with which obama explained to the iranians that there are differences of opinion between the two countries , but that he 's prepared to deal with these issues diplomatically . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp obama 's strategy seems to be to approach iran as an equal .
the president has recognized that condescending advice or even orders and sanctions wo n't achieve anything .
on the contrary , they can backfire , with the other side feeling duped , disrespected and disdained .
which can only make them clam up . many iranians will be open to obama 's words .
they have been fixated on the us for a long time and have been eager to restart relations .
however , in tehran 's political circles , even the most reconciliatory statements from washington will be met with mistrust and at least initial rejection - as iran 's highest leader , ayatollah ali khamenei , demonstrated on saturday , march 21 . in a new year 's speech in mashhad , he criticized the us president , saying obama could n't wish the iranians a happy new year , while at the same time accusing them of supporting terrorism and violence . the iranian leader did n't want to understand that these were the differences of opinion that obama had referred to : iran 's support for hezbollah and hamas , and the suspicion that tehran is building nuclear weapons . just a day earlier , khamenei had celebrated the development of iran 's nuclear program as the greatest success of the past few years and it 's unlikely he 'll change his mind on this issue .
but the question remains whether he 'll give the green light for direct contact with the americans in various matters , no matter how controversial the standpoints between washington and tehran may be . the two can and should try to build on their commonalities .
both the us and iran , for example , have similar interests in iraq and - even more so - in afghanistan .
both countries should try to calm down and stop making trouble - neither for neighbor iran nor for the rest of the world . if these common interests can be worked out - perhaps at the upcoming afghanistan conference in the hague - why should n't the more controversial issues be tackled after that ? a lot depends on mutual trust and there seem to be a shortage in that area .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de women -pipe- 21.03.2009 working women in germany protest salary gap großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the salary gap still has n't closed for german women women in germany earn nearly a quarter less than men , compared to an average of 17 percent in the rest of europe .
equal pay day is observed to draw attention to the persistent discrepancy . it 's not by chance that equal pay day is held on march 20 in germany .
this is the date up to which german women on average had to work this year , in addition to last year , to earn as much as their male counterparts did in 2008 .
although the " same salary for the same work " policy has been part of german law for more than 30 years , the pay gap between genders continues to exist .
the organization for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- has been publishing figures on salary disparity between european men and women for a few years , and germany ranks third among the 27 eu members .
the salary gap between men and women who perform the same jobs is only higher in estonia and cyprus .
the discrepancy between non-skilled workers is the narrowest and the widest gap is between highly-qualified workers at up to 35 percent .
hard to grasp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen is also puzzled by the salary discrepancies germany 's minister for family affairs ursula von der leyen gave a specific example , noting that , despite the fact that they are equally capable of taking blood , changing beds and measuring fevers , " female nurses receive 100 euros -lrb- $ 135 -rrb- less a month than male nurses . "
" i simply ca n't explain it , " she added .
the phenomenon has prompted the business and professional women 's foundation to protest openly .
they have adopted the symbol of the red bag used by the us sister organization , so that " numbers in the black will arise from bags in the red , " said dagmar terbeznik of the german branch of the business and professional women 's foundation .
the reasons why equal work is still not rewarded with equal pay in germany are numerous .
studies have shown that german women place greater emphasis on the quality of their work and the working atmosphere rather than on salary .
" the tax system in germany encourages women to take a part-time job when their husband earns more than them , " astrid ziegler , a researcher at the wsi social economics institute in dusseldorf , told afp news agency .
in addition , a shortage of day-care options and the fact that schools are not open all day make it difficult for women to combine a job with family life , she added .
traditional roles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a shortage of daycare and pre-school options in germany but it is also known that factors such as performance-based salaries and free working arrangements also contribute to keeping women 's salaries below those of their male counterparts .
many german families still observe tradition roles , with men as the primary breadwinners .
silke anger from the german institute for economic research has been studying the problem of unpaid work for a long time .
she developed the following thesis : housework makes women poor .
" energy that is invested in house work is then missing at work , " said the economist .
" those who iron and do the laundry at home and do the shopping do n't have the energy for gainful employment . "
anger suspects that some employers offer married women smaller salaries from the outset .
human resources bosses often assume that these women have to divide their energy between their careers and their household .
time for government intervention ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german companies are not open about their salary policies the business and professional women 's foundation has said that , among other things , a lack of transparency in german companies is responsible for the wage differences .
in many companies , it is even recommended to employees that they refrain from speaking about what they earn .
the foundation , however wants german companies to be obligated - as is the case in forerunner sweden - to disclose how much their employees earn .
women 's salary negotiations can then be conducted in a more goal-oriented manner with this kind of information serving as the foundation for the discussions .
many politicians also say it is time to put the pressure on companies .
the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has recently agreed on a program that advances a legal quota for members on a company 's board of directors and " discrimination checks " for contracts .
" the time for voluntary measures by companies is over , " said party group leader christel humme . ls / kjb / tt / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but if ukraine ca n't pay , europe may not get any gas . on monday , march 23 , ukraine 's president viktor yushchenko and prime minister yulia tymoshenko - currently feuding ahead of presidential elections - are set to meet the head of the eu 's executive , jose manuel barroso , and officials from the world bank , european investment bank and energy companies in brussels .
they are expected to sign a joint declaration committing ukraine to reforming the rules for operating its gas network .
that should pave the way for western and russian donors to invest in the renovation of the network , eu diplomats told dpa news agency .
huge investments needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tymoshenko , left , and yushchenko are political opponents one fifth of all the natural gas consumed in the eu flows through ukraine 's 13,500-kilometer -lrb- 8,400-mile -rrb- network of gas pipelines .
some experts have said that the network will need some 2.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.4 billion -rrb- in investment over the next six years just to keep the pipes and pumping stations in working order .
analysts say that ukrainian monopoly naftogaz , which runs the pipeline system , is having difficulties attracting the necessary investment due to a perceived lack of transparency both in its management and in ukraine 's top political leadership .
" i see a situation later this year where naftogaz will not be able to meet its payment obligations to gazprom because of its worsening financial situation , " robert shetler-jones from swiss-based gas trader rosukrenergo -lrb- rue -rrb- told reuters news agency .
rue is owned by russian gas giant gazprom and two ukrainian businessmen .
" if ukraine continued not to pay , then this could have a serious impact on the european gas supplies , " added shetler-jones . a highly-charged issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian energy giant gazprom has the full backing of the kremlin the question of ukraine 's gas transit system has been a highly-charged one ever since a row with russia in 2005-2006 provoked russian gas monopoly gazprom to shut supplies off to ukraine , causing severe shortfalls in europe .
the drama was repeated in january , when gas supplies to the eu were stalled for two weeks .
the eu has said it is interested in becoming less dependent on both russia and ukraine as energy suppliers .
on thursday , eu leaders agreed to give 200 million euros to the " nabucco " pipeline project , which is meant to bypass both countries and bring gas directly from the caspian sea to europe . tt / kjb / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

equal pay day is observed to draw attention to the persistent discrepancy . it 's not by chance that equal pay day is held on march 20 in germany .
this is the date up to which german women on average had to work this year , in addition to last year , to earn as much as their male counterparts did in 2008 .
although the " same salary for the same work " policy has been part of german law for more than 30 years , the pay gap between genders continues to exist .
the organization for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- has been publishing figures on salary disparity between european men and women for a few years , and germany ranks third among the 27 eu members .
the salary gap between men and women who perform the same jobs is only higher in estonia and cyprus .
the discrepancy between non-skilled workers is the narrowest and the widest gap is between highly-qualified workers at up to 35 percent .
hard to grasp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen is also puzzled by the salary discrepancies germany 's minister for family affairs ursula von der leyen gave a specific example , noting that , despite the fact that they are equally capable of taking blood , changing beds and measuring fevers , " female nurses receive 100 euros -lrb- $ 135 -rrb- less a month than male nurses .

the reasons why equal work is still not rewarded with equal pay in germany are numerous .
studies have shown that german women place greater emphasis on the quality of their work and the working atmosphere rather than on salary .
" the tax system in germany encourages women to take a part-time job when their husband earns more than them , " astrid ziegler , a researcher at the wsi social economics institute in dusseldorf , told afp news agency .
in addition , a shortage of day-care options and the fact that schools are not open all day make it difficult for women to combine a job with family life , she added .

many german families still observe tradition roles , with men as the primary breadwinners .
silke anger from the german institute for economic research has been studying the problem of unpaid work for a long time .
she developed the following thesis : housework makes women poor .
" energy that is invested in house work is then missing at work , " said the economist .
" those who iron and do the laundry at home and do the shopping do n't have the energy for gainful employment . "
anger suspects that some employers offer married women smaller salaries from the outset .
human resources bosses often assume that these women have to divide their energy between their careers and their household .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german companies are not open about their salary policies the business and professional women 's foundation has said that , among other things , a lack of transparency in german companies is responsible for the wage differences .
in many companies , it is even recommended to employees that they refrain from speaking about what they earn .
the foundation , however wants german companies to be obligated - as is the case in forerunner sweden - to disclose how much their employees earn .
women 's salary negotiations can then be conducted in a more goal-oriented manner with this kind of information serving as the foundation for the discussions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de women -pipe- 21.03.2009 working women in germany protest salary gap großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the salary gap still has n't closed for german women women in germany earn nearly a quarter less than men , compared to an average of 17 percent in the rest of europe .
equal pay day is observed to draw attention to the persistent discrepancy . it 's not by chance that equal pay day is held on march 20 in germany .
this is the date up to which german women on average had to work this year , in addition to last year , to earn as much as their male counterparts did in 2008 .
although the " same salary for the same work " policy has been part of german law for more than 30 years , the pay gap between genders continues to exist .
the organization for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- has been publishing figures on salary disparity between european men and women for a few years , and germany ranks third among the 27 eu members .
the salary gap between men and women who perform the same jobs is only higher in estonia and cyprus .
the discrepancy between non-skilled workers is the narrowest and the widest gap is between highly-qualified workers at up to 35 percent .
hard to grasp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen is also puzzled by the salary discrepancies germany 's minister for family affairs ursula von der leyen gave a specific example , noting that , despite the fact that they are equally capable of taking blood , changing beds and measuring fevers , " female nurses receive 100 euros -lrb- $ 135 -rrb- less a month than male nurses . "
" i simply ca n't explain it , " she added .
the phenomenon has prompted the business and professional women 's foundation to protest openly .
they have adopted the symbol of the red bag used by the us sister organization , so that " numbers in the black will arise from bags in the red , " said dagmar terbeznik of the german branch of the business and professional women 's foundation .
the reasons why equal work is still not rewarded with equal pay in germany are numerous .
studies have shown that german women place greater emphasis on the quality of their work and the working atmosphere rather than on salary .
" the tax system in germany encourages women to take a part-time job when their husband earns more than them , " astrid ziegler , a researcher at the wsi social economics institute in dusseldorf , told afp news agency .
in addition , a shortage of day-care options and the fact that schools are not open all day make it difficult for women to combine a job with family life , she added .
traditional roles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a shortage of daycare and pre-school options in germany but it is also known that factors such as performance-based salaries and free working arrangements also contribute to keeping women 's salaries below those of their male counterparts .
many german families still observe tradition roles , with men as the primary breadwinners .
silke anger from the german institute for economic research has been studying the problem of unpaid work for a long time .
she developed the following thesis : housework makes women poor .
" energy that is invested in house work is then missing at work , " said the economist .
" those who iron and do the laundry at home and do the shopping do n't have the energy for gainful employment . "
anger suspects that some employers offer married women smaller salaries from the outset .
human resources bosses often assume that these women have to divide their energy between their careers and their household .
time for government intervention ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german companies are not open about their salary policies the business and professional women 's foundation has said that , among other things , a lack of transparency in german companies is responsible for the wage differences .
in many companies , it is even recommended to employees that they refrain from speaking about what they earn .
the foundation , however wants german companies to be obligated - as is the case in forerunner sweden - to disclose how much their employees earn .
women 's salary negotiations can then be conducted in a more goal-oriented manner with this kind of information serving as the foundation for the discussions .

" what is the ' eastern partnership ' ?
is it a sphere of influence , including belarus ? "
on friday , after a two-day summit in brussels , eu leaders approved the new partnership , which would allow the union to increase its aid to armenia , azerbaijan , georgia , moldova , ukraine and possibly belarus by 600 million euros -lrb- $ 814 million -rrb- .
" our dream has come true , we have been able to adopt the eastern partnership , " said czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
under the scheme , the eu is to negotiate new association agreements - accords setting terms for cooperation with non-member states - as reward for democratic and free-market reforms .
the plan envisages the gradual creation of a free-trade zone with the countries .
of the 600 million euros in aid , some 350 million euros will be new funds for strengthening state institutions , border control and assistance for small companies .

russia recognized the independence of the breakaway georgian regions following its short war in georgia in august to widespread international condemnation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de women -pipe- 21.03.2009 working women in germany protest salary gap großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the salary gap still has n't closed for german women women in germany earn nearly a quarter less than men , compared to an average of 17 percent in the rest of europe .
equal pay day is observed to draw attention to the persistent discrepancy . it 's not by chance that equal pay day is held on march 20 in germany .
this is the date up to which german women on average had to work this year , in addition to last year , to earn as much as their male counterparts did in 2008 .
although the " same salary for the same work " policy has been part of german law for more than 30 years , the pay gap between genders continues to exist .
the organization for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- has been publishing figures on salary disparity between european men and women for a few years , and germany ranks third among the 27 eu members .
the salary gap between men and women who perform the same jobs is only higher in estonia and cyprus .
the discrepancy between non-skilled workers is the narrowest and the widest gap is between highly-qualified workers at up to 35 percent .
hard to grasp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen is also puzzled by the salary discrepancies germany 's minister for family affairs ursula von der leyen gave a specific example , noting that , despite the fact that they are equally capable of taking blood , changing beds and measuring fevers , " female nurses receive 100 euros -lrb- $ 135 -rrb- less a month than male nurses . "
" i simply ca n't explain it , " she added .
the phenomenon has prompted the business and professional women 's foundation to protest openly .
they have adopted the symbol of the red bag used by the us sister organization , so that " numbers in the black will arise from bags in the red , " said dagmar terbeznik of the german branch of the business and professional women 's foundation .
the reasons why equal work is still not rewarded with equal pay in germany are numerous .
studies have shown that german women place greater emphasis on the quality of their work and the working atmosphere rather than on salary .
" the tax system in germany encourages women to take a part-time job when their husband earns more than them , " astrid ziegler , a researcher at the wsi social economics institute in dusseldorf , told afp news agency .
in addition , a shortage of day-care options and the fact that schools are not open all day make it difficult for women to combine a job with family life , she added .
traditional roles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a shortage of daycare and pre-school options in germany but it is also known that factors such as performance-based salaries and free working arrangements also contribute to keeping women 's salaries below those of their male counterparts .
many german families still observe tradition roles , with men as the primary breadwinners .
silke anger from the german institute for economic research has been studying the problem of unpaid work for a long time .
she developed the following thesis : housework makes women poor .
" energy that is invested in house work is then missing at work , " said the economist .
" those who iron and do the laundry at home and do the shopping do n't have the energy for gainful employment . "
anger suspects that some employers offer married women smaller salaries from the outset .
human resources bosses often assume that these women have to divide their energy between their careers and their household .
time for government intervention ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german companies are not open about their salary policies the business and professional women 's foundation has said that , among other things , a lack of transparency in german companies is responsible for the wage differences .
in many companies , it is even recommended to employees that they refrain from speaking about what they earn .
the foundation , however wants german companies to be obligated - as is the case in forerunner sweden - to disclose how much their employees earn .
women 's salary negotiations can then be conducted in a more goal-oriented manner with this kind of information serving as the foundation for the discussions .
many politicians also say it is time to put the pressure on companies .
the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has recently agreed on a program that advances a legal quota for members on a company 's board of directors and " discrimination checks " for contracts .
" the time for voluntary measures by companies is over , " said party group leader christel humme . ls / kjb / tt / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" what is the ' eastern partnership ' ?
is it a sphere of influence , including belarus ? "
on friday , after a two-day summit in brussels , eu leaders approved the new partnership , which would allow the union to increase its aid to armenia , azerbaijan , georgia , moldova , ukraine and possibly belarus by 600 million euros -lrb- $ 814 million -rrb- .
" our dream has come true , we have been able to adopt the eastern partnership , " said czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
under the scheme , the eu is to negotiate new association agreements - accords setting terms for cooperation with non-member states - as reward for democratic and free-market reforms .
the plan envisages the gradual creation of a free-trade zone with the countries .
of the 600 million euros in aid , some 350 million euros will be new funds for strengthening state institutions , border control and assistance for small companies .

the bloc is now keen to strengthen its ties with its neighbors to counter-balance moscow 's growing assertiveness in the region .
as a gesture of goodwill towards russia 's staunch ally belarus , eu foreign ministers on monday extended until december the suspension of travel restrictions for the country 's top government officials , including president alexander lukashenko , the eu put the ban into effect in 2006 in response to human rights violations allegedly committed by lukashenko , whose regime former us secretary of state condoleezza rice once called " the last remaining true dictatorship in the heart of europe . "

" when my good friend karel schwarzenberg publicly says that if belarus recognizes abkhazia and south ossetia it could forget about " eastern partnership " , is it blackmail or is it democracy at work ? "
" after those kinds of statements , we have questions , " lavrov added .
" is it about pulling countries -lrb- away -rrb- from the decisions that they are supposed to take freely ? "
russia recognized the independence of the breakaway georgian regions following its short war in georgia in august to widespread international condemnation .
moscow has been urging its neighbor to follow suit .
the official launch of the eu 's partnership with six eastern european countries , which is backed strongly by poland and sweden , is set for may 7 , although doubts remain about whether lukashenko will be invited .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de women -pipe- 21.03.2009 working women in germany protest salary gap großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the salary gap still has n't closed for german women women in germany earn nearly a quarter less than men , compared to an average of 17 percent in the rest of europe .
equal pay day is observed to draw attention to the persistent discrepancy . it 's not by chance that equal pay day is held on march 20 in germany .
this is the date up to which german women on average had to work this year , in addition to last year , to earn as much as their male counterparts did in 2008 .
although the " same salary for the same work " policy has been part of german law for more than 30 years , the pay gap between genders continues to exist .
the organization for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- has been publishing figures on salary disparity between european men and women for a few years , and germany ranks third among the 27 eu members .
the salary gap between men and women who perform the same jobs is only higher in estonia and cyprus .
the discrepancy between non-skilled workers is the narrowest and the widest gap is between highly-qualified workers at up to 35 percent .
hard to grasp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen is also puzzled by the salary discrepancies germany 's minister for family affairs ursula von der leyen gave a specific example , noting that , despite the fact that they are equally capable of taking blood , changing beds and measuring fevers , " female nurses receive 100 euros -lrb- $ 135 -rrb- less a month than male nurses . "
" i simply ca n't explain it , " she added .
the phenomenon has prompted the business and professional women 's foundation to protest openly .
they have adopted the symbol of the red bag used by the us sister organization , so that " numbers in the black will arise from bags in the red , " said dagmar terbeznik of the german branch of the business and professional women 's foundation .
the reasons why equal work is still not rewarded with equal pay in germany are numerous .
studies have shown that german women place greater emphasis on the quality of their work and the working atmosphere rather than on salary .
" the tax system in germany encourages women to take a part-time job when their husband earns more than them , " astrid ziegler , a researcher at the wsi social economics institute in dusseldorf , told afp news agency .
in addition , a shortage of day-care options and the fact that schools are not open all day make it difficult for women to combine a job with family life , she added .
traditional roles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a shortage of daycare and pre-school options in germany but it is also known that factors such as performance-based salaries and free working arrangements also contribute to keeping women 's salaries below those of their male counterparts .
many german families still observe tradition roles , with men as the primary breadwinners .
silke anger from the german institute for economic research has been studying the problem of unpaid work for a long time .
she developed the following thesis : housework makes women poor .
" energy that is invested in house work is then missing at work , " said the economist .
" those who iron and do the laundry at home and do the shopping do n't have the energy for gainful employment . "
anger suspects that some employers offer married women smaller salaries from the outset .
human resources bosses often assume that these women have to divide their energy between their careers and their household .
time for government intervention ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german companies are not open about their salary policies the business and professional women 's foundation has said that , among other things , a lack of transparency in german companies is responsible for the wage differences .
in many companies , it is even recommended to employees that they refrain from speaking about what they earn .
the foundation , however wants german companies to be obligated - as is the case in forerunner sweden - to disclose how much their employees earn .
women 's salary negotiations can then be conducted in a more goal-oriented manner with this kind of information serving as the foundation for the discussions .
many politicians also say it is time to put the pressure on companies .
the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has recently agreed on a program that advances a legal quota for members on a company 's board of directors and " discrimination checks " for contracts .
" the time for voluntary measures by companies is over , " said party group leader christel humme . ls / kjb / tt / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de women -pipe- 21.03.2009 working women in germany protest salary gap großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the salary gap still has n't closed for german women women in germany earn nearly a quarter less than men , compared to an average of 17 percent in the rest of europe .
equal pay day is observed to draw attention to the persistent discrepancy . it 's not by chance that equal pay day is held on march 20 in germany .
this is the date up to which german women on average had to work this year , in addition to last year , to earn as much as their male counterparts did in 2008 .
although the " same salary for the same work " policy has been part of german law for more than 30 years , the pay gap between genders continues to exist .
the organization for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- has been publishing figures on salary disparity between european men and women for a few years , and germany ranks third among the 27 eu members .
the salary gap between men and women who perform the same jobs is only higher in estonia and cyprus .
the discrepancy between non-skilled workers is the narrowest and the widest gap is between highly-qualified workers at up to 35 percent .
hard to grasp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen is also puzzled by the salary discrepancies germany 's minister for family affairs ursula von der leyen gave a specific example , noting that , despite the fact that they are equally capable of taking blood , changing beds and measuring fevers , " female nurses receive 100 euros -lrb- $ 135 -rrb- less a month than male nurses . "
" i simply ca n't explain it , " she added .
the phenomenon has prompted the business and professional women 's foundation to protest openly .
they have adopted the symbol of the red bag used by the us sister organization , so that " numbers in the black will arise from bags in the red , " said dagmar terbeznik of the german branch of the business and professional women 's foundation .
the reasons why equal work is still not rewarded with equal pay in germany are numerous .
studies have shown that german women place greater emphasis on the quality of their work and the working atmosphere rather than on salary .
" the tax system in germany encourages women to take a part-time job when their husband earns more than them , " astrid ziegler , a researcher at the wsi social economics institute in dusseldorf , told afp news agency .
in addition , a shortage of day-care options and the fact that schools are not open all day make it difficult for women to combine a job with family life , she added .
traditional roles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a shortage of daycare and pre-school options in germany but it is also known that factors such as performance-based salaries and free working arrangements also contribute to keeping women 's salaries below those of their male counterparts .
many german families still observe tradition roles , with men as the primary breadwinners .
silke anger from the german institute for economic research has been studying the problem of unpaid work for a long time .
she developed the following thesis : housework makes women poor .
" energy that is invested in house work is then missing at work , " said the economist .
" those who iron and do the laundry at home and do the shopping do n't have the energy for gainful employment . "
anger suspects that some employers offer married women smaller salaries from the outset .
human resources bosses often assume that these women have to divide their energy between their careers and their household .
time for government intervention ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german companies are not open about their salary policies the business and professional women 's foundation has said that , among other things , a lack of transparency in german companies is responsible for the wage differences .
in many companies , it is even recommended to employees that they refrain from speaking about what they earn .
the foundation , however wants german companies to be obligated - as is the case in forerunner sweden - to disclose how much their employees earn .
women 's salary negotiations can then be conducted in a more goal-oriented manner with this kind of information serving as the foundation for the discussions .
many politicians also say it is time to put the pressure on companies .
the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has recently agreed on a program that advances a legal quota for members on a company 's board of directors and " discrimination checks " for contracts .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 21.03.2009 eu , ukraine set to overhaul gas network as new gas row looms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is highly dependent on russian gas imports the european union and ukraine are set to agree on a program of political reforms and physical repairs to the former soviet state 's gas network , officials said .
but if ukraine ca n't pay , europe may not get any gas . on monday , march 23 , ukraine 's president viktor yushchenko and prime minister yulia tymoshenko - currently feuding ahead of presidential elections - are set to meet the head of the eu 's executive , jose manuel barroso , and officials from the world bank , european investment bank and energy companies in brussels .
they are expected to sign a joint declaration committing ukraine to reforming the rules for operating its gas network .
that should pave the way for western and russian donors to invest in the renovation of the network , eu diplomats told dpa news agency .
huge investments needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tymoshenko , left , and yushchenko are political opponents one fifth of all the natural gas consumed in the eu flows through ukraine 's 13,500-kilometer -lrb- 8,400-mile -rrb- network of gas pipelines .
some experts have said that the network will need some 2.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.4 billion -rrb- in investment over the next six years just to keep the pipes and pumping stations in working order .
analysts say that ukrainian monopoly naftogaz , which runs the pipeline system , is having difficulties attracting the necessary investment due to a perceived lack of transparency both in its management and in ukraine 's top political leadership .

however , tehran 's ideologists are standing in the way . barack obama is getting serious .
he had already expressed his readiness to negotiate with iran , and now the american president has used the iranian new year 's festival " nourouz " as an opportunity to offer tehran a fresh start . obama may have praised iran 's cultural heritage , but his compliments were not the most important aspect of his address .
after all , similar things were also heard from george w. bush , who treated iran as part of his " axis of evil . " more important were the openness and clarity with which obama explained to the iranians that there are differences of opinion between the two countries , but that he 's prepared to deal with these issues diplomatically . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp obama 's strategy seems to be to approach iran as an equal .
the president has recognized that condescending advice or even orders and sanctions wo n't achieve anything .
on the contrary , they can backfire , with the other side feeling duped , disrespected and disdained .
which can only make them clam up . many iranians will be open to obama 's words .
they have been fixated on the us for a long time and have been eager to restart relations .
however , in tehran 's political circles , even the most reconciliatory statements from washington will be met with mistrust and at least initial rejection - as iran 's highest leader , ayatollah ali khamenei , demonstrated on saturday , march 21 . in a new year 's speech in mashhad , he criticized the us president , saying obama could n't wish the iranians a happy new year , while at the same time accusing them of supporting terrorism and violence . the iranian leader did n't want to understand that these were the differences of opinion that obama had referred to : iran 's support for hezbollah and hamas , and the suspicion that tehran is building nuclear weapons . just a day earlier , khamenei had celebrated the development of iran 's nuclear program as the greatest success of the past few years and it 's unlikely he 'll change his mind on this issue .
but the question remains whether he 'll give the green light for direct contact with the americans in various matters , no matter how controversial the standpoints between washington and tehran may be . the two can and should try to build on their commonalities .
both the us and iran , for example , have similar interests in iraq and - even more so - in afghanistan .
both countries should try to calm down and stop making trouble - neither for neighbor iran nor for the rest of the world . if these common interests can be worked out - perhaps at the upcoming afghanistan conference in the hague - why should n't the more controversial issues be tackled after that ? a lot depends on mutual trust and there seem to be a shortage in that area .
there 's a cogent reason for this , particularly in tehran : the ideologists of the " islamic republic " apparently fear that rapprochement with the us could undermine their state doctrine . for them , it 's easier with an enemy like the us . peter philipp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , tehran 's ideologists are standing in the way . barack obama is getting serious .
he had already expressed his readiness to negotiate with iran , and now the american president has used the iranian new year 's festival " nourouz " as an opportunity to offer tehran a fresh start . obama may have praised iran 's cultural heritage , but his compliments were not the most important aspect of his address .
after all , similar things were also heard from george w. bush , who treated iran as part of his " axis of evil . " more important were the openness and clarity with which obama explained to the iranians that there are differences of opinion between the two countries , but that he 's prepared to deal with these issues diplomatically . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp obama 's strategy seems to be to approach iran as an equal .
the president has recognized that condescending advice or even orders and sanctions wo n't achieve anything .
on the contrary , they can backfire , with the other side feeling duped , disrespected and disdained .
which can only make them clam up . many iranians will be open to obama 's words .
they have been fixated on the us for a long time and have been eager to restart relations .
however , in tehran 's political circles , even the most reconciliatory statements from washington will be met with mistrust and at least initial rejection - as iran 's highest leader , ayatollah ali khamenei , demonstrated on saturday , march 21 . in a new year 's speech in mashhad , he criticized the us president , saying obama could n't wish the iranians a happy new year , while at the same time accusing them of supporting terrorism and violence . the iranian leader did n't want to understand that these were the differences of opinion that obama had referred to : iran 's support for hezbollah and hamas , and the suspicion that tehran is building nuclear weapons . just a day earlier , khamenei had celebrated the development of iran 's nuclear program as the greatest success of the past few years and it 's unlikely he 'll change his mind on this issue .
but the question remains whether he 'll give the green light for direct contact with the americans in various matters , no matter how controversial the standpoints between washington and tehran may be . the two can and should try to build on their commonalities .
both the us and iran , for example , have similar interests in iraq and - even more so - in afghanistan .
both countries should try to calm down and stop making trouble - neither for neighbor iran nor for the rest of the world . if these common interests can be worked out - perhaps at the upcoming afghanistan conference in the hague - why should n't the more controversial issues be tackled after that ? a lot depends on mutual trust and there seem to be a shortage in that area .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de women -pipe- 21.03.2009 working women in germany protest salary gap großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the salary gap still has n't closed for german women women in germany earn nearly a quarter less than men , compared to an average of 17 percent in the rest of europe .
equal pay day is observed to draw attention to the persistent discrepancy . it 's not by chance that equal pay day is held on march 20 in germany .
this is the date up to which german women on average had to work this year , in addition to last year , to earn as much as their male counterparts did in 2008 .
although the " same salary for the same work " policy has been part of german law for more than 30 years , the pay gap between genders continues to exist .
the organization for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- has been publishing figures on salary disparity between european men and women for a few years , and germany ranks third among the 27 eu members .
the salary gap between men and women who perform the same jobs is only higher in estonia and cyprus .
the discrepancy between non-skilled workers is the narrowest and the widest gap is between highly-qualified workers at up to 35 percent .
hard to grasp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen is also puzzled by the salary discrepancies germany 's minister for family affairs ursula von der leyen gave a specific example , noting that , despite the fact that they are equally capable of taking blood , changing beds and measuring fevers , " female nurses receive 100 euros -lrb- $ 135 -rrb- less a month than male nurses . "
" i simply ca n't explain it , " she added .
the phenomenon has prompted the business and professional women 's foundation to protest openly .
they have adopted the symbol of the red bag used by the us sister organization , so that " numbers in the black will arise from bags in the red , " said dagmar terbeznik of the german branch of the business and professional women 's foundation .
the reasons why equal work is still not rewarded with equal pay in germany are numerous .
studies have shown that german women place greater emphasis on the quality of their work and the working atmosphere rather than on salary .
" the tax system in germany encourages women to take a part-time job when their husband earns more than them , " astrid ziegler , a researcher at the wsi social economics institute in dusseldorf , told afp news agency .
in addition , a shortage of day-care options and the fact that schools are not open all day make it difficult for women to combine a job with family life , she added .
traditional roles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a shortage of daycare and pre-school options in germany but it is also known that factors such as performance-based salaries and free working arrangements also contribute to keeping women 's salaries below those of their male counterparts .
many german families still observe tradition roles , with men as the primary breadwinners .
silke anger from the german institute for economic research has been studying the problem of unpaid work for a long time .
she developed the following thesis : housework makes women poor .
" energy that is invested in house work is then missing at work , " said the economist .
" those who iron and do the laundry at home and do the shopping do n't have the energy for gainful employment . "
anger suspects that some employers offer married women smaller salaries from the outset .
human resources bosses often assume that these women have to divide their energy between their careers and their household .
time for government intervention ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german companies are not open about their salary policies the business and professional women 's foundation has said that , among other things , a lack of transparency in german companies is responsible for the wage differences .
in many companies , it is even recommended to employees that they refrain from speaking about what they earn .
the foundation , however wants german companies to be obligated - as is the case in forerunner sweden - to disclose how much their employees earn .
women 's salary negotiations can then be conducted in a more goal-oriented manner with this kind of information serving as the foundation for the discussions .
many politicians also say it is time to put the pressure on companies .
the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has recently agreed on a program that advances a legal quota for members on a company 's board of directors and " discrimination checks " for contracts .
" the time for voluntary measures by companies is over , " said party group leader christel humme . ls / kjb / tt / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but if ukraine ca n't pay , europe may not get any gas . on monday , march 23 , ukraine 's president viktor yushchenko and prime minister yulia tymoshenko - currently feuding ahead of presidential elections - are set to meet the head of the eu 's executive , jose manuel barroso , and officials from the world bank , european investment bank and energy companies in brussels .
they are expected to sign a joint declaration committing ukraine to reforming the rules for operating its gas network .
that should pave the way for western and russian donors to invest in the renovation of the network , eu diplomats told dpa news agency .
huge investments needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tymoshenko , left , and yushchenko are political opponents one fifth of all the natural gas consumed in the eu flows through ukraine 's 13,500-kilometer -lrb- 8,400-mile -rrb- network of gas pipelines .
some experts have said that the network will need some 2.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.4 billion -rrb- in investment over the next six years just to keep the pipes and pumping stations in working order .
analysts say that ukrainian monopoly naftogaz , which runs the pipeline system , is having difficulties attracting the necessary investment due to a perceived lack of transparency both in its management and in ukraine 's top political leadership .
" i see a situation later this year where naftogaz will not be able to meet its payment obligations to gazprom because of its worsening financial situation , " robert shetler-jones from swiss-based gas trader rosukrenergo -lrb- rue -rrb- told reuters news agency .
rue is owned by russian gas giant gazprom and two ukrainian businessmen .
" if ukraine continued not to pay , then this could have a serious impact on the european gas supplies , " added shetler-jones . a highly-charged issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian energy giant gazprom has the full backing of the kremlin the question of ukraine 's gas transit system has been a highly-charged one ever since a row with russia in 2005-2006 provoked russian gas monopoly gazprom to shut supplies off to ukraine , causing severe shortfalls in europe .
the drama was repeated in january , when gas supplies to the eu were stalled for two weeks .
the eu has said it is interested in becoming less dependent on both russia and ukraine as energy suppliers .
on thursday , eu leaders agreed to give 200 million euros to the " nabucco " pipeline project , which is meant to bypass both countries and bring gas directly from the caspian sea to europe . tt / kjb / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" what is the ' eastern partnership ' ?
is it a sphere of influence , including belarus ? "
on friday , after a two-day summit in brussels , eu leaders approved the new partnership , which would allow the union to increase its aid to armenia , azerbaijan , georgia , moldova , ukraine and possibly belarus by 600 million euros -lrb- $ 814 million -rrb- .
" our dream has come true , we have been able to adopt the eastern partnership , " said czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
under the scheme , the eu is to negotiate new association agreements - accords setting terms for cooperation with non-member states - as reward for democratic and free-market reforms .
the plan envisages the gradual creation of a free-trade zone with the countries .
of the 600 million euros in aid , some 350 million euros will be new funds for strengthening state institutions , border control and assistance for small companies .
giving belarus a chance ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the belarusian opposition wants to see the country advance toward the eu the eu 's interest in its eastern neighborhood has surged since russia 's august invasion of georgia .
the bloc is now keen to strengthen its ties with its neighbors to counter-balance moscow 's growing assertiveness in the region .
as a gesture of goodwill towards russia 's staunch ally belarus , eu foreign ministers on monday extended until december the suspension of travel restrictions for the country 's top government officials , including president alexander lukashenko , the eu put the ban into effect in 2006 in response to human rights violations allegedly committed by lukashenko , whose regime former us secretary of state condoleezza rice once called " the last remaining true dictatorship in the heart of europe . "
but the bloc put the visa ban on ice in october in a bid to encourage the belarus president to take a more pro-western and pro-democracy course as part of a carrot-and-stick policy .
a sore spot for russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west did not recognize the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia lavrov , however , condemned the union 's effort to draw ex-soviet countries closer to the west as meddling into other countries ' internal affairs .
" when my good friend karel schwarzenberg publicly says that if belarus recognizes abkhazia and south ossetia it could forget about " eastern partnership " , is it blackmail or is it democracy at work ? "
" after those kinds of statements , we have questions , " lavrov added .
" is it about pulling countries -lrb- away -rrb- from the decisions that they are supposed to take freely ? "
russia recognized the independence of the breakaway georgian regions following its short war in georgia in august to widespread international condemnation .
moscow has been urging its neighbor to follow suit .
the official launch of the eu 's partnership with six eastern european countries , which is backed strongly by poland and sweden , is set for may 7 , although doubts remain about whether lukashenko will be invited .
" that will depend on the behavior of mr. lukashenko and the belarus government in the coming weeks , but belarus should be in the ' eastern partnership ' , " schwarzenberg said on friday . tt / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de women -pipe- 21.03.2009 working women in germany protest salary gap großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the salary gap still has n't closed for german women women in germany earn nearly a quarter less than men , compared to an average of 17 percent in the rest of europe .
equal pay day is observed to draw attention to the persistent discrepancy . it 's not by chance that equal pay day is held on march 20 in germany .
this is the date up to which german women on average had to work this year , in addition to last year , to earn as much as their male counterparts did in 2008 .
although the " same salary for the same work " policy has been part of german law for more than 30 years , the pay gap between genders continues to exist .
the organization for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- has been publishing figures on salary disparity between european men and women for a few years , and germany ranks third among the 27 eu members .
the salary gap between men and women who perform the same jobs is only higher in estonia and cyprus .
the discrepancy between non-skilled workers is the narrowest and the widest gap is between highly-qualified workers at up to 35 percent .
hard to grasp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen is also puzzled by the salary discrepancies germany 's minister for family affairs ursula von der leyen gave a specific example , noting that , despite the fact that they are equally capable of taking blood , changing beds and measuring fevers , " female nurses receive 100 euros -lrb- $ 135 -rrb- less a month than male nurses . "
" i simply ca n't explain it , " she added .
the phenomenon has prompted the business and professional women 's foundation to protest openly .
they have adopted the symbol of the red bag used by the us sister organization , so that " numbers in the black will arise from bags in the red , " said dagmar terbeznik of the german branch of the business and professional women 's foundation .
the reasons why equal work is still not rewarded with equal pay in germany are numerous .
studies have shown that german women place greater emphasis on the quality of their work and the working atmosphere rather than on salary .
" the tax system in germany encourages women to take a part-time job when their husband earns more than them , " astrid ziegler , a researcher at the wsi social economics institute in dusseldorf , told afp news agency .
in addition , a shortage of day-care options and the fact that schools are not open all day make it difficult for women to combine a job with family life , she added .
traditional roles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a shortage of daycare and pre-school options in germany but it is also known that factors such as performance-based salaries and free working arrangements also contribute to keeping women 's salaries below those of their male counterparts .
many german families still observe tradition roles , with men as the primary breadwinners .
silke anger from the german institute for economic research has been studying the problem of unpaid work for a long time .
she developed the following thesis : housework makes women poor .
" energy that is invested in house work is then missing at work , " said the economist .
" those who iron and do the laundry at home and do the shopping do n't have the energy for gainful employment . "
anger suspects that some employers offer married women smaller salaries from the outset .
human resources bosses often assume that these women have to divide their energy between their careers and their household .
time for government intervention ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german companies are not open about their salary policies the business and professional women 's foundation has said that , among other things , a lack of transparency in german companies is responsible for the wage differences .
in many companies , it is even recommended to employees that they refrain from speaking about what they earn .
the foundation , however wants german companies to be obligated - as is the case in forerunner sweden - to disclose how much their employees earn .
women 's salary negotiations can then be conducted in a more goal-oriented manner with this kind of information serving as the foundation for the discussions .
many politicians also say it is time to put the pressure on companies .
the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has recently agreed on a program that advances a legal quota for members on a company 's board of directors and " discrimination checks " for contracts .
" the time for voluntary measures by companies is over , " said party group leader christel humme . ls / kjb / tt / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 21.03.2009 eu 's new eastern partnership draws ire from russia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is unhappy about the eu 's increasing cooperation with ex-soviet states russian foreign minister sergei lavrov criticized on saturday the european union 's new partnership with six former soviet states , suggesting the 27-member bloc was seeking to extend its own sphere of influence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lavrov is questioning eu 's policies towards eastern europe " we are accused of trying to have spheres of influence , " lavrov said during the annual brussels forum in the belgian capital . " what is the ' eastern partnership ' ?
is it a sphere of influence , including belarus ? "
on friday , after a two-day summit in brussels , eu leaders approved the new partnership , which would allow the union to increase its aid to armenia , azerbaijan , georgia , moldova , ukraine and possibly belarus by 600 million euros -lrb- $ 814 million -rrb- .
" our dream has come true , we have been able to adopt the eastern partnership , " said czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
under the scheme , the eu is to negotiate new association agreements - accords setting terms for cooperation with non-member states - as reward for democratic and free-market reforms .
the plan envisages the gradual creation of a free-trade zone with the countries .
of the 600 million euros in aid , some 350 million euros will be new funds for strengthening state institutions , border control and assistance for small companies .
giving belarus a chance ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the belarusian opposition wants to see the country advance toward the eu the eu 's interest in its eastern neighborhood has surged since russia 's august invasion of georgia .
the bloc is now keen to strengthen its ties with its neighbors to counter-balance moscow 's growing assertiveness in the region .
as a gesture of goodwill towards russia 's staunch ally belarus , eu foreign ministers on monday extended until december the suspension of travel restrictions for the country 's top government officials , including president alexander lukashenko , the eu put the ban into effect in 2006 in response to human rights violations allegedly committed by lukashenko , whose regime former us secretary of state condoleezza rice once called " the last remaining true dictatorship in the heart of europe . "
but the bloc put the visa ban on ice in october in a bid to encourage the belarus president to take a more pro-western and pro-democracy course as part of a carrot-and-stick policy .
a sore spot for russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west did not recognize the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia lavrov , however , condemned the union 's effort to draw ex-soviet countries closer to the west as meddling into other countries ' internal affairs .
" when my good friend karel schwarzenberg publicly says that if belarus recognizes abkhazia and south ossetia it could forget about " eastern partnership " , is it blackmail or is it democracy at work ? "
" after those kinds of statements , we have questions , " lavrov added .
" is it about pulling countries -lrb- away -rrb- from the decisions that they are supposed to take freely ? "
russia recognized the independence of the breakaway georgian regions following its short war in georgia in august to widespread international condemnation .
moscow has been urging its neighbor to follow suit .
the official launch of the eu 's partnership with six eastern european countries , which is backed strongly by poland and sweden , is set for may 7 , although doubts remain about whether lukashenko will be invited .
" that will depend on the behavior of mr. lukashenko and the belarus government in the coming weeks , but belarus should be in the ' eastern partnership ' , " schwarzenberg said on friday . tt / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" what is the ' eastern partnership ' ?
is it a sphere of influence , including belarus ? "
on friday , after a two-day summit in brussels , eu leaders approved the new partnership , which would allow the union to increase its aid to armenia , azerbaijan , georgia , moldova , ukraine and possibly belarus by 600 million euros -lrb- $ 814 million -rrb- .
" our dream has come true , we have been able to adopt the eastern partnership , " said czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
under the scheme , the eu is to negotiate new association agreements - accords setting terms for cooperation with non-member states - as reward for democratic and free-market reforms .
the plan envisages the gradual creation of a free-trade zone with the countries .
of the 600 million euros in aid , some 350 million euros will be new funds for strengthening state institutions , border control and assistance for small companies .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 21.03.2009 eu , ukraine set to overhaul gas network as new gas row looms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is highly dependent on russian gas imports the european union and ukraine are set to agree on a program of political reforms and physical repairs to the former soviet state 's gas network , officials said .
but if ukraine ca n't pay , europe may not get any gas . on monday , march 23 , ukraine 's president viktor yushchenko and prime minister yulia tymoshenko - currently feuding ahead of presidential elections - are set to meet the head of the eu 's executive , jose manuel barroso , and officials from the world bank , european investment bank and energy companies in brussels .
they are expected to sign a joint declaration committing ukraine to reforming the rules for operating its gas network .
that should pave the way for western and russian donors to invest in the renovation of the network , eu diplomats told dpa news agency .
huge investments needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tymoshenko , left , and yushchenko are political opponents one fifth of all the natural gas consumed in the eu flows through ukraine 's 13,500-kilometer -lrb- 8,400-mile -rrb- network of gas pipelines .
some experts have said that the network will need some 2.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.4 billion -rrb- in investment over the next six years just to keep the pipes and pumping stations in working order .
analysts say that ukrainian monopoly naftogaz , which runs the pipeline system , is having difficulties attracting the necessary investment due to a perceived lack of transparency both in its management and in ukraine 's top political leadership .
" i see a situation later this year where naftogaz will not be able to meet its payment obligations to gazprom because of its worsening financial situation , " robert shetler-jones from swiss-based gas trader rosukrenergo -lrb- rue -rrb- told reuters news agency .
rue is owned by russian gas giant gazprom and two ukrainian businessmen .
" if ukraine continued not to pay , then this could have a serious impact on the european gas supplies , " added shetler-jones . a highly-charged issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian energy giant gazprom has the full backing of the kremlin the question of ukraine 's gas transit system has been a highly-charged one ever since a row with russia in 2005-2006 provoked russian gas monopoly gazprom to shut supplies off to ukraine , causing severe shortfalls in europe .

but if ukraine ca n't pay , europe may not get any gas . on monday , march 23 , ukraine 's president viktor yushchenko and prime minister yulia tymoshenko - currently feuding ahead of presidential elections - are set to meet the head of the eu 's executive , jose manuel barroso , and officials from the world bank , european investment bank and energy companies in brussels .
they are expected to sign a joint declaration committing ukraine to reforming the rules for operating its gas network .
that should pave the way for western and russian donors to invest in the renovation of the network , eu diplomats told dpa news agency .
huge investments needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tymoshenko , left , and yushchenko are political opponents one fifth of all the natural gas consumed in the eu flows through ukraine 's 13,500-kilometer -lrb- 8,400-mile -rrb- network of gas pipelines .
some experts have said that the network will need some 2.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.4 billion -rrb- in investment over the next six years just to keep the pipes and pumping stations in working order .
analysts say that ukrainian monopoly naftogaz , which runs the pipeline system , is having difficulties attracting the necessary investment due to a perceived lack of transparency both in its management and in ukraine 's top political leadership .
" i see a situation later this year where naftogaz will not be able to meet its payment obligations to gazprom because of its worsening financial situation , " robert shetler-jones from swiss-based gas trader rosukrenergo -lrb- rue -rrb- told reuters news agency .
rue is owned by russian gas giant gazprom and two ukrainian businessmen .
" if ukraine continued not to pay , then this could have a serious impact on the european gas supplies , " added shetler-jones . a highly-charged issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian energy giant gazprom has the full backing of the kremlin the question of ukraine 's gas transit system has been a highly-charged one ever since a row with russia in 2005-2006 provoked russian gas monopoly gazprom to shut supplies off to ukraine , causing severe shortfalls in europe .
the drama was repeated in january , when gas supplies to the eu were stalled for two weeks .
the eu has said it is interested in becoming less dependent on both russia and ukraine as energy suppliers .

is it a sphere of influence , including belarus ? "
on friday , after a two-day summit in brussels , eu leaders approved the new partnership , which would allow the union to increase its aid to armenia , azerbaijan , georgia , moldova , ukraine and possibly belarus by 600 million euros -lrb- $ 814 million -rrb- .
" our dream has come true , we have been able to adopt the eastern partnership , " said czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
under the scheme , the eu is to negotiate new association agreements - accords setting terms for cooperation with non-member states - as reward for democratic and free-market reforms .
the plan envisages the gradual creation of a free-trade zone with the countries .

however , tehran 's ideologists are standing in the way . barack obama is getting serious .
he had already expressed his readiness to negotiate with iran , and now the american president has used the iranian new year 's festival " nourouz " as an opportunity to offer tehran a fresh start . obama may have praised iran 's cultural heritage , but his compliments were not the most important aspect of his address .
after all , similar things were also heard from george w. bush , who treated iran as part of his " axis of evil . " more important were the openness and clarity with which obama explained to the iranians that there are differences of opinion between the two countries , but that he 's prepared to deal with these issues diplomatically . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp obama 's strategy seems to be to approach iran as an equal .
the president has recognized that condescending advice or even orders and sanctions wo n't achieve anything .
on the contrary , they can backfire , with the other side feeling duped , disrespected and disdained .
which can only make them clam up . many iranians will be open to obama 's words .
they have been fixated on the us for a long time and have been eager to restart relations .
however , in tehran 's political circles , even the most reconciliatory statements from washington will be met with mistrust and at least initial rejection - as iran 's highest leader , ayatollah ali khamenei , demonstrated on saturday , march 21 . in a new year 's speech in mashhad , he criticized the us president , saying obama could n't wish the iranians a happy new year , while at the same time accusing them of supporting terrorism and violence . the iranian leader did n't want to understand that these were the differences of opinion that obama had referred to : iran 's support for hezbollah and hamas , and the suspicion that tehran is building nuclear weapons . just a day earlier , khamenei had celebrated the development of iran 's nuclear program as the greatest success of the past few years and it 's unlikely he 'll change his mind on this issue .
but the question remains whether he 'll give the green light for direct contact with the americans in various matters , no matter how controversial the standpoints between washington and tehran may be . the two can and should try to build on their commonalities .
both the us and iran , for example , have similar interests in iraq and - even more so - in afghanistan .
both countries should try to calm down and stop making trouble - neither for neighbor iran nor for the rest of the world . if these common interests can be worked out - perhaps at the upcoming afghanistan conference in the hague - why should n't the more controversial issues be tackled after that ? a lot depends on mutual trust and there seem to be a shortage in that area .
there 's a cogent reason for this , particularly in tehran : the ideologists of the " islamic republic " apparently fear that rapprochement with the us could undermine their state doctrine . for them , it 's easier with an enemy like the us . peter philipp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , tehran 's ideologists are standing in the way . barack obama is getting serious .
he had already expressed his readiness to negotiate with iran , and now the american president has used the iranian new year 's festival " nourouz " as an opportunity to offer tehran a fresh start . obama may have praised iran 's cultural heritage , but his compliments were not the most important aspect of his address .
after all , similar things were also heard from george w. bush , who treated iran as part of his " axis of evil . " more important were the openness and clarity with which obama explained to the iranians that there are differences of opinion between the two countries , but that he 's prepared to deal with these issues diplomatically . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp obama 's strategy seems to be to approach iran as an equal .
the president has recognized that condescending advice or even orders and sanctions wo n't achieve anything .
on the contrary , they can backfire , with the other side feeling duped , disrespected and disdained .
which can only make them clam up . many iranians will be open to obama 's words .
they have been fixated on the us for a long time and have been eager to restart relations .
however , in tehran 's political circles , even the most reconciliatory statements from washington will be met with mistrust and at least initial rejection - as iran 's highest leader , ayatollah ali khamenei , demonstrated on saturday , march 21 . in a new year 's speech in mashhad , he criticized the us president , saying obama could n't wish the iranians a happy new year , while at the same time accusing them of supporting terrorism and violence . the iranian leader did n't want to understand that these were the differences of opinion that obama had referred to : iran 's support for hezbollah and hamas , and the suspicion that tehran is building nuclear weapons . just a day earlier , khamenei had celebrated the development of iran 's nuclear program as the greatest success of the past few years and it 's unlikely he 'll change his mind on this issue .
but the question remains whether he 'll give the green light for direct contact with the americans in various matters , no matter how controversial the standpoints between washington and tehran may be . the two can and should try to build on their commonalities .
both the us and iran , for example , have similar interests in iraq and - even more so - in afghanistan .
both countries should try to calm down and stop making trouble - neither for neighbor iran nor for the rest of the world . if these common interests can be worked out - perhaps at the upcoming afghanistan conference in the hague - why should n't the more controversial issues be tackled after that ? a lot depends on mutual trust and there seem to be a shortage in that area .
there 's a cogent reason for this , particularly in tehran : the ideologists of the " islamic republic " apparently fear that rapprochement with the us could undermine their state doctrine . for them , it 's easier with an enemy like the us . peter philipp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de women -pipe- 21.03.2009 working women in germany protest salary gap großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the salary gap still has n't closed for german women women in germany earn nearly a quarter less than men , compared to an average of 17 percent in the rest of europe .
equal pay day is observed to draw attention to the persistent discrepancy . it 's not by chance that equal pay day is held on march 20 in germany .
this is the date up to which german women on average had to work this year , in addition to last year , to earn as much as their male counterparts did in 2008 .
although the " same salary for the same work " policy has been part of german law for more than 30 years , the pay gap between genders continues to exist .
the organization for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- has been publishing figures on salary disparity between european men and women for a few years , and germany ranks third among the 27 eu members .
the salary gap between men and women who perform the same jobs is only higher in estonia and cyprus .
the discrepancy between non-skilled workers is the narrowest and the widest gap is between highly-qualified workers at up to 35 percent .
hard to grasp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen is also puzzled by the salary discrepancies germany 's minister for family affairs ursula von der leyen gave a specific example , noting that , despite the fact that they are equally capable of taking blood , changing beds and measuring fevers , " female nurses receive 100 euros -lrb- $ 135 -rrb- less a month than male nurses . "
" i simply ca n't explain it , " she added .
the phenomenon has prompted the business and professional women 's foundation to protest openly .
they have adopted the symbol of the red bag used by the us sister organization , so that " numbers in the black will arise from bags in the red , " said dagmar terbeznik of the german branch of the business and professional women 's foundation .
the reasons why equal work is still not rewarded with equal pay in germany are numerous .
studies have shown that german women place greater emphasis on the quality of their work and the working atmosphere rather than on salary .
" the tax system in germany encourages women to take a part-time job when their husband earns more than them , " astrid ziegler , a researcher at the wsi social economics institute in dusseldorf , told afp news agency .
in addition , a shortage of day-care options and the fact that schools are not open all day make it difficult for women to combine a job with family life , she added .
traditional roles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a shortage of daycare and pre-school options in germany but it is also known that factors such as performance-based salaries and free working arrangements also contribute to keeping women 's salaries below those of their male counterparts .
many german families still observe tradition roles , with men as the primary breadwinners .
silke anger from the german institute for economic research has been studying the problem of unpaid work for a long time .
she developed the following thesis : housework makes women poor .
" energy that is invested in house work is then missing at work , " said the economist .
" those who iron and do the laundry at home and do the shopping do n't have the energy for gainful employment . "
anger suspects that some employers offer married women smaller salaries from the outset .
human resources bosses often assume that these women have to divide their energy between their careers and their household .
time for government intervention ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german companies are not open about their salary policies the business and professional women 's foundation has said that , among other things , a lack of transparency in german companies is responsible for the wage differences .
in many companies , it is even recommended to employees that they refrain from speaking about what they earn .
the foundation , however wants german companies to be obligated - as is the case in forerunner sweden - to disclose how much their employees earn .
women 's salary negotiations can then be conducted in a more goal-oriented manner with this kind of information serving as the foundation for the discussions .
many politicians also say it is time to put the pressure on companies .
the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has recently agreed on a program that advances a legal quota for members on a company 's board of directors and " discrimination checks " for contracts .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de women -pipe- 21.03.2009 working women in germany protest salary gap großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the salary gap still has n't closed for german women women in germany earn nearly a quarter less than men , compared to an average of 17 percent in the rest of europe .
equal pay day is observed to draw attention to the persistent discrepancy . it 's not by chance that equal pay day is held on march 20 in germany .
this is the date up to which german women on average had to work this year , in addition to last year , to earn as much as their male counterparts did in 2008 .
although the " same salary for the same work " policy has been part of german law for more than 30 years , the pay gap between genders continues to exist .
the organization for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- has been publishing figures on salary disparity between european men and women for a few years , and germany ranks third among the 27 eu members .
the salary gap between men and women who perform the same jobs is only higher in estonia and cyprus .
the discrepancy between non-skilled workers is the narrowest and the widest gap is between highly-qualified workers at up to 35 percent .
hard to grasp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen is also puzzled by the salary discrepancies germany 's minister for family affairs ursula von der leyen gave a specific example , noting that , despite the fact that they are equally capable of taking blood , changing beds and measuring fevers , " female nurses receive 100 euros -lrb- $ 135 -rrb- less a month than male nurses . "
" i simply ca n't explain it , " she added .
the phenomenon has prompted the business and professional women 's foundation to protest openly .
they have adopted the symbol of the red bag used by the us sister organization , so that " numbers in the black will arise from bags in the red , " said dagmar terbeznik of the german branch of the business and professional women 's foundation .
the reasons why equal work is still not rewarded with equal pay in germany are numerous .
studies have shown that german women place greater emphasis on the quality of their work and the working atmosphere rather than on salary .
" the tax system in germany encourages women to take a part-time job when their husband earns more than them , " astrid ziegler , a researcher at the wsi social economics institute in dusseldorf , told afp news agency .
in addition , a shortage of day-care options and the fact that schools are not open all day make it difficult for women to combine a job with family life , she added .
traditional roles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a shortage of daycare and pre-school options in germany but it is also known that factors such as performance-based salaries and free working arrangements also contribute to keeping women 's salaries below those of their male counterparts .
many german families still observe tradition roles , with men as the primary breadwinners .
silke anger from the german institute for economic research has been studying the problem of unpaid work for a long time .
she developed the following thesis : housework makes women poor .
" energy that is invested in house work is then missing at work , " said the economist .
" those who iron and do the laundry at home and do the shopping do n't have the energy for gainful employment . "
anger suspects that some employers offer married women smaller salaries from the outset .
human resources bosses often assume that these women have to divide their energy between their careers and their household .
time for government intervention ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german companies are not open about their salary policies the business and professional women 's foundation has said that , among other things , a lack of transparency in german companies is responsible for the wage differences .
in many companies , it is even recommended to employees that they refrain from speaking about what they earn .
the foundation , however wants german companies to be obligated - as is the case in forerunner sweden - to disclose how much their employees earn .
women 's salary negotiations can then be conducted in a more goal-oriented manner with this kind of information serving as the foundation for the discussions .
many politicians also say it is time to put the pressure on companies .
the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has recently agreed on a program that advances a legal quota for members on a company 's board of directors and " discrimination checks " for contracts .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 21.03.2009 eu , ukraine set to overhaul gas network as new gas row looms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is highly dependent on russian gas imports the european union and ukraine are set to agree on a program of political reforms and physical repairs to the former soviet state 's gas network , officials said .
but if ukraine ca n't pay , europe may not get any gas . on monday , march 23 , ukraine 's president viktor yushchenko and prime minister yulia tymoshenko - currently feuding ahead of presidential elections - are set to meet the head of the eu 's executive , jose manuel barroso , and officials from the world bank , european investment bank and energy companies in brussels .
they are expected to sign a joint declaration committing ukraine to reforming the rules for operating its gas network .
that should pave the way for western and russian donors to invest in the renovation of the network , eu diplomats told dpa news agency .
huge investments needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tymoshenko , left , and yushchenko are political opponents one fifth of all the natural gas consumed in the eu flows through ukraine 's 13,500-kilometer -lrb- 8,400-mile -rrb- network of gas pipelines .
some experts have said that the network will need some 2.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.4 billion -rrb- in investment over the next six years just to keep the pipes and pumping stations in working order .
analysts say that ukrainian monopoly naftogaz , which runs the pipeline system , is having difficulties attracting the necessary investment due to a perceived lack of transparency both in its management and in ukraine 's top political leadership .

" what is the ' eastern partnership ' ?
is it a sphere of influence , including belarus ? "
on friday , after a two-day summit in brussels , eu leaders approved the new partnership , which would allow the union to increase its aid to armenia , azerbaijan , georgia , moldova , ukraine and possibly belarus by 600 million euros -lrb- $ 814 million -rrb- .
" our dream has come true , we have been able to adopt the eastern partnership , " said czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
under the scheme , the eu is to negotiate new association agreements - accords setting terms for cooperation with non-member states - as reward for democratic and free-market reforms .
the plan envisages the gradual creation of a free-trade zone with the countries .
of the 600 million euros in aid , some 350 million euros will be new funds for strengthening state institutions , border control and assistance for small companies .
giving belarus a chance ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the belarusian opposition wants to see the country advance toward the eu the eu 's interest in its eastern neighborhood has surged since russia 's august invasion of georgia .
the bloc is now keen to strengthen its ties with its neighbors to counter-balance moscow 's growing assertiveness in the region .
as a gesture of goodwill towards russia 's staunch ally belarus , eu foreign ministers on monday extended until december the suspension of travel restrictions for the country 's top government officials , including president alexander lukashenko , the eu put the ban into effect in 2006 in response to human rights violations allegedly committed by lukashenko , whose regime former us secretary of state condoleezza rice once called " the last remaining true dictatorship in the heart of europe . "
but the bloc put the visa ban on ice in october in a bid to encourage the belarus president to take a more pro-western and pro-democracy course as part of a carrot-and-stick policy .
a sore spot for russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west did not recognize the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia lavrov , however , condemned the union 's effort to draw ex-soviet countries closer to the west as meddling into other countries ' internal affairs .
" when my good friend karel schwarzenberg publicly says that if belarus recognizes abkhazia and south ossetia it could forget about " eastern partnership " , is it blackmail or is it democracy at work ? "
" after those kinds of statements , we have questions , " lavrov added .
" is it about pulling countries -lrb- away -rrb- from the decisions that they are supposed to take freely ? "
russia recognized the independence of the breakaway georgian regions following its short war in georgia in august to widespread international condemnation .
moscow has been urging its neighbor to follow suit .
the official launch of the eu 's partnership with six eastern european countries , which is backed strongly by poland and sweden , is set for may 7 , although doubts remain about whether lukashenko will be invited .
" that will depend on the behavior of mr. lukashenko and the belarus government in the coming weeks , but belarus should be in the ' eastern partnership ' , " schwarzenberg said on friday . tt / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but if ukraine ca n't pay , europe may not get any gas . on monday , march 23 , ukraine 's president viktor yushchenko and prime minister yulia tymoshenko - currently feuding ahead of presidential elections - are set to meet the head of the eu 's executive , jose manuel barroso , and officials from the world bank , european investment bank and energy companies in brussels .
they are expected to sign a joint declaration committing ukraine to reforming the rules for operating its gas network .
that should pave the way for western and russian donors to invest in the renovation of the network , eu diplomats told dpa news agency .
huge investments needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tymoshenko , left , and yushchenko are political opponents one fifth of all the natural gas consumed in the eu flows through ukraine 's 13,500-kilometer -lrb- 8,400-mile -rrb- network of gas pipelines .
some experts have said that the network will need some 2.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.4 billion -rrb- in investment over the next six years just to keep the pipes and pumping stations in working order .
analysts say that ukrainian monopoly naftogaz , which runs the pipeline system , is having difficulties attracting the necessary investment due to a perceived lack of transparency both in its management and in ukraine 's top political leadership .
" i see a situation later this year where naftogaz will not be able to meet its payment obligations to gazprom because of its worsening financial situation , " robert shetler-jones from swiss-based gas trader rosukrenergo -lrb- rue -rrb- told reuters news agency .
rue is owned by russian gas giant gazprom and two ukrainian businessmen .
" if ukraine continued not to pay , then this could have a serious impact on the european gas supplies , " added shetler-jones . a highly-charged issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian energy giant gazprom has the full backing of the kremlin the question of ukraine 's gas transit system has been a highly-charged one ever since a row with russia in 2005-2006 provoked russian gas monopoly gazprom to shut supplies off to ukraine , causing severe shortfalls in europe .
the drama was repeated in january , when gas supplies to the eu were stalled for two weeks .
the eu has said it is interested in becoming less dependent on both russia and ukraine as energy suppliers .
on thursday , eu leaders agreed to give 200 million euros to the " nabucco " pipeline project , which is meant to bypass both countries and bring gas directly from the caspian sea to europe . tt / kjb / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the father of an 11-year old girl , mr kaya is angry that she was forced to watch what he calls a " very bloody propaganda film " at school .
sari gelin , or " blonde bride " , was commissioned by the turkish general staff and distributed in recent months by the education ministry .
it is an attempt to counter what turkey calls " baseless " claims that ottoman turks committed genocide against the armenians in 1915 .
the dvd was sent to all elementary schools with a note instructing teachers to show it to pupils and report back .
at the school of mr kaya 's daughter , children as young as six had to watch .
" this film is not fit for adults , let alone children , " he says .
" they 're promoting discrimination , branding certain people as ' others ' and teaching children to do the same .
my daughter will not be part of this enmity . "
mr kaya has applied to the courts to sue education minister huseyin celik , arguing the film incites ethnic hatred against armenians .
there are around 50,000 turkish-armenians left in turkey , mostly in istanbul .
in a statement last month , the ministry said it had stopped distributing the film and claimed it was never intended for children .
but teachers are still receiving official reminders to screen it .
' very dangerous ' sari gelin presents the turkish state 's case that the armenians betrayed the benevolent ottoman empire during world war i , siding with invading foreign forces and massacring thousands of turks .
the film says the armenians were " relocated " as a result of their actions . "
we worry it will create more hatred " ayse gul altinay hrant dink foundation q & a : armenian genocide dispute turkey 's armenian dilemma obituary : hrant dink there is no mention of the hundreds of thousands who perished or were killed on the long march through the desert .
instead , elderly men relate how armenians cooked turkish babies alive and used civilians as firewood .
" the word armenian is used very many times and always negatively , " says ayse gul altinay , a board member of the hrant dink foundation .
she has good reason for concern .
two years ago , hrant dink - a prominent turkish-armenian writer - was shot and killed by a teenager , who saw him as an enemy of the state .
so , the foundation created in his memory has also applied to the courts to get sari gelin withdrawn from schools .
" showing young people a film with graphic scenes of violence , that repeats over and again that the armenians stabbed the turks in the back , and killed innocent women and babies and civilians is very dangerous , " ms altinay says .
" we worry it will create more hatred . "
clear message outside the school attended by mr kaya 's daughter , parents ' opinions were divided .
" i do n't think it 's right to show children such a film , not at their age , " another father said .
" but in turkey , when there 's an order from above , the officials have to comply . "
however , one of the teachers disagreed : " we teach children who our enemies are and which countries tried to divide up our territory , but we do n't teach them about the armenians .
" so i thought this film was good , and objective . "
turkey is coming under increasing international pressure to acknowledge the 1915 deportation and mass killing of ottoman armenians as genocide .
the us house of representatives has just introduced a resolution on the issue and when barack obama was campaigning for the presidency , he pledged to recognise the armenian genocide as a " widely documented fact supported by an overwhelming body of historical evidence " .
ankara is lobbying hard against such a move , arguing it would jeopardise its recent efforts at reconciliation with armenia .
official ties with yerevan were cut in the 1990s , and the countries ' common border was closed .
but while turkey is open to renewing trade and diplomatic ties with its neighbour , the distribution of this film suggests it is more closed than ever to any discussion of its history .
the education ministry 's statement calls sari gelin a balanced , historical account , but the clear message it gives turkish school-children is that armenians are traitors and their enemies .

the father of an 11-year old girl , mr kaya is angry that she was forced to watch what he calls a " very bloody propaganda film " at school .
sari gelin , or " blonde bride " , was commissioned by the turkish general staff and distributed in recent months by the education ministry .
it is an attempt to counter what turkey calls " baseless " claims that ottoman turks committed genocide against the armenians in 1915 .
the dvd was sent to all elementary schools with a note instructing teachers to show it to pupils and report back .
at the school of mr kaya 's daughter , children as young as six had to watch .
" this film is not fit for adults , let alone children , " he says .
serdar kaya has applied to the courts to sue the turkish education minister " they 're promoting discrimination , branding certain people as ' others ' and teaching children to do the same .
my daughter will not be part of this enmity . "
mr kaya has applied to the courts to sue education minister huseyin celik , arguing the film incites ethnic hatred against armenians .
there are around 50,000 turkish-armenians left in turkey , mostly in istanbul .
in a statement last month , the ministry said it had stopped distributing the film and claimed it was never intended for children .
but teachers are still receiving official reminders to screen it .
' very dangerous ' sari gelin presents the turkish state 's case that the armenians betrayed the benevolent ottoman empire during world war i , siding with invading foreign forces and massacring thousands of turks .
the film says the armenians were " relocated " as a result of their actions .
we worry it will create more hatred ayse gul altinay hrant dink foundation q & a : armenian genocide dispute turkey 's armenian dilemma obituary : hrant dink there is no mention of the hundreds of thousands who perished or were killed on the long march through the desert .
instead , elderly men relate how armenians cooked turkish babies alive and used civilians as firewood .
" the word armenian is used very many times and always negatively , " says ayse gul altinay , a board member of the hrant dink foundation .
she has good reason for concern .
two years ago , hrant dink - a prominent turkish-armenian writer - was shot and killed by a teenager , who saw him as an enemy of the state .
so , the foundation created in his memory has also applied to the courts to get sari gelin withdrawn from schools .
" showing young people a film with graphic scenes of violence , that repeats over and again that the armenians stabbed the turks in the back , and killed innocent women and babies and civilians is very dangerous , " ms altinay says .
" we worry it will create more hatred . "
clear message outside the school attended by mr kaya 's daughter , parents ' opinions were divided .
" i do n't think it 's right to show children such a film , not at their age , " another father said .
hundreds of thousands of armenians died while being forced out of anatolia " but in turkey , when there 's an order from above , the officials have to comply . "
however , one of the teachers disagreed : " we teach children who our enemies are and which countries tried to divide up our territory , but we do n't teach them about the armenians .
" so i thought this film was good , and objective . "
turkey is coming under increasing international pressure to acknowledge the 1915 deportation and mass killing of ottoman armenians as genocide .
the us house of representatives has just introduced a resolution on the issue and when barack obama was campaigning for the presidency , he pledged to recognise the armenian genocide as a " widely documented fact supported by an overwhelming body of historical evidence " .
ankara is lobbying hard against such a move , arguing it would jeopardise its recent efforts at reconciliation with armenia .
official ties with yerevan were cut in the 1990s , and the countries ' common border was closed .
but while turkey is open to renewing trade and diplomatic ties with its neighbour , the distribution of this film suggests it is more closed than ever to any discussion of its history .
the education ministry 's statement calls sari gelin a balanced , historical account , but the clear message it gives turkish school-children is that armenians are traitors and their enemies .

at the school of mr kaya 's daughter , children as young as six had to watch .
" this film is not fit for adults , let alone children , " he says .
serdar kaya has applied to the courts to sue the turkish education minister " they 're promoting discrimination , branding certain people as ' others ' and teaching children to do the same .
my daughter will not be part of this enmity . "
mr kaya has applied to the courts to sue education minister huseyin celik , arguing the film incites ethnic hatred against armenians .
there are around 50,000 turkish-armenians left in turkey , mostly in istanbul .
in a statement last month , the ministry said it had stopped distributing the film and claimed it was never intended for children .
but teachers are still receiving official reminders to screen it .
' very dangerous ' sari gelin presents the turkish state 's case that the armenians betrayed the benevolent ottoman empire during world war i , siding with invading foreign forces and massacring thousands of turks .
the film says the armenians were " relocated " as a result of their actions .
we worry it will create more hatred ayse gul altinay hrant dink foundation q & a : armenian genocide dispute turkey 's armenian dilemma obituary : hrant dink there is no mention of the hundreds of thousands who perished or were killed on the long march through the desert .
instead , elderly men relate how armenians cooked turkish babies alive and used civilians as firewood .
" the word armenian is used very many times and always negatively , " says ayse gul altinay , a board member of the hrant dink foundation .
she has good reason for concern .
two years ago , hrant dink - a prominent turkish-armenian writer - was shot and killed by a teenager , who saw him as an enemy of the state .
so , the foundation created in his memory has also applied to the courts to get sari gelin withdrawn from schools .
" showing young people a film with graphic scenes of violence , that repeats over and again that the armenians stabbed the turks in the back , and killed innocent women and babies and civilians is very dangerous , " ms altinay says .
" we worry it will create more hatred . "
clear message outside the school attended by mr kaya 's daughter , parents ' opinions were divided .
" i do n't think it 's right to show children such a film , not at their age , " another father said .
hundreds of thousands of armenians died while being forced out of anatolia " but in turkey , when there 's an order from above , the officials have to comply . "
however , one of the teachers disagreed : " we teach children who our enemies are and which countries tried to divide up our territory , but we do n't teach them about the armenians .
" so i thought this film was good , and objective . "
turkey is coming under increasing international pressure to acknowledge the 1915 deportation and mass killing of ottoman armenians as genocide .
the us house of representatives has just introduced a resolution on the issue and when barack obama was campaigning for the presidency , he pledged to recognise the armenian genocide as a " widely documented fact supported by an overwhelming body of historical evidence " .
ankara is lobbying hard against such a move , arguing it would jeopardise its recent efforts at reconciliation with armenia .
official ties with yerevan were cut in the 1990s , and the countries ' common border was closed .
but while turkey is open to renewing trade and diplomatic ties with its neighbour , the distribution of this film suggests it is more closed than ever to any discussion of its history .
the education ministry 's statement calls sari gelin a balanced , historical account , but the clear message it gives turkish school-children is that armenians are traitors and their enemies .
