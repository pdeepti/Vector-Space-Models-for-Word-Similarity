it could offer guarantees up to 100 billion euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one focus will be on infrastructure projects taxes and health insurance contributions would be lowered and a change in the car taxation system from july would provide drivers incentives to switch to fuel-efficient vehicles . it would raise the threshold for income tax and reform the system to make sure taxpayers are not automatically bumped into higher tax brackets even if their real incomes have not grown . there would also be a program to extend broadband internet access . second time 's a charm ? merkel 's conservatives and her governing coalition partners , the social democrats , launched a first stimulus package in november .
but it was widely criticized as being too meager .
while berlin said the package was worth 31 billion euros -lrb- $ 42 billion -rrb- , many countered that the numbers were massaged and it really amounted to much less . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany could see a severe economic contraction in 2009 the final amount of this second package will only become clear after merkel 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , and the spd agree on the plan in the coming days . speaking in erfurt , merkel said it was unclear how europe 's biggest economy , currently in recession , would perform over the coming year . " i ca n't give you any binding answers , " she said after the cdu agreed on the plan . many analysts has said they predict the german economy will contract by a record margin this year , with some saying gdp could shrink by four percent or even more .
that would be an unwelcome record , since the german economy has never contracted by as much as one percent over a full year since world war two . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now atheists in in britain 's capital are having their own say .
one christian group has complained . for many londoners , queuing for a tardy red double-decker bus may on occasions have prompted the utterance of a swear word or raised doubts about the existence of a deity altogether .
from this week , those with lingering doubts will have their views confirmed in an atheist advertising campaign rolled out on 200 of london 's iconic buses , the underground -lrb- tube -rrb- network and transport systems in other major cities .
" there 's probably no god .
now stop worrying and enjoy your life , " is the main slogan of the campaign .
it is the brainchild of a television comedy writer and is backed by the british humanist association -lrb- bha -rrb- , as well as the highly regarded evolutionary biologist and prominent atheist richard dawkins , the author of " the god delusion . "
posters featuring quotations from prominent figures known to have endorsed atheism - such as albert einstein , douglas adams and katharine hepburn - are to be placed on london underground stations .

sherine said she believed that a lot of people had been outraged by the evangelical advertisements , without knowing what to do about it .
" our rational slogan will hopefully reassure anyone who has been scared by this kind of evangelism , " she said on launching the atheist campaign .
" i hope they 'll brighten people 's days and make them smile on their way to work . "
sherine said support for a fund-raising drive to finance the adverts had exceeded all expectations , with donations totalling 156,000 euros -lrb- $ 210,000 -rrb- , as opposed to the original target of 6,000 euros -lrb- $ 8,200 -rrb- .

in spain , the union of atheists and freethinkers has launched buses with a translation of the slogan in the northern city of barcelona , and italy 's union of atheists , agnostics and rationalists was also planning to roll out atheist buses .
in the us , the american humanist association had been inspired to run a similar campaign on buses in washington , but in australia , a bus advertising scheme by the atheist foundation had been rejected by the country 's biggest outdoor advertising company .

the methodist church welcomed the atheist bus campaign as " an opportunity to talk about the deepest questions in life . "

now atheists in in britain 's capital are having their own say .
one christian group has complained . for many londoners , queuing for a tardy red double-decker bus may on occasions have prompted the utterance of a swear word or raised doubts about the existence of a deity altogether .
from this week , those with lingering doubts will have their views confirmed in an atheist advertising campaign rolled out on 200 of london 's iconic buses , the underground -lrb- tube -rrb- network and transport systems in other major cities .
" there 's probably no god .
now stop worrying and enjoy your life , " is the main slogan of the campaign .
it is the brainchild of a television comedy writer and is backed by the british humanist association -lrb- bha -rrb- , as well as the highly regarded evolutionary biologist and prominent atheist richard dawkins , the author of " the god delusion . "
posters featuring quotations from prominent figures known to have endorsed atheism - such as albert einstein , douglas adams and katharine hepburn - are to be placed on london underground stations .

the idea bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tv comedy writer ariane sherine helped come up with the idea tv comedy writer ariane sherine said her idea for an atheist publicity campaign was born out of anger at a christian advertising campaign on london buses this summer .
those who followed the " jesus said " campaign to its website were told that non-christians " will be condemned to everlasting separation from god and then you spend all eternity in torment in hell . "
sherine said she believed that a lot of people had been outraged by the evangelical advertisements , without knowing what to do about it .
" our rational slogan will hopefully reassure anyone who has been scared by this kind of evangelism , " she said on launching the atheist campaign .
" i hope they 'll brighten people 's days and make them smile on their way to work . "
sherine said support for a fund-raising drive to finance the adverts had exceeded all expectations , with donations totalling 156,000 euros -lrb- $ 210,000 -rrb- , as opposed to the original target of 6,000 euros -lrb- $ 8,200 -rrb- .

some died in suicide bombings in iraq , while others were unable to get there and returned to spain , where they encourage others to follow their example , according to the daily . almost 50 percent of suspects released in 2007 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turnover of arrests and releases in spain is high despite such evidence of the presence of potential terrorists in spain , spanish courts acquitted 31 of the 63 people who were tried on charges linked to islamist terrorism in 2007 . the supreme court has overturned several such high-profile verdicts handed out by the national court in the recent years . it reduced the sentence of abu dahdah from 27 to 12 years , acquitted three others among a total of 18 whom the national court had convicted in the case , and acquitted four of the 21 people who had been sentenced for the madrid train bombings . the supreme court also acquitted 15 of the 20 people who had been sentenced for belonging to an extremist cell and planning attacks including a plot to blow up the national court . that acquittal , in october 2008 , caused concern among police who regarded the suspects as very dangerous . questions over exaggerated threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are concerns that the terror threat is exaggerated with media attention focusing on islamist terrorists rather than the overwhelming majority of peaceful muslims living in spain , the acquittals raise the question whether the threat is being exaggerated , but the public prosecutor 's office does not believe that to be the case . the acquittals were demonstrative of the " enormous legal difficulties " of proving that a suspect was dangerous , the prosecutors said in a 2008 report . potential terrorists usually belong to small cells which act independently , making obtaining proof even harder , according to police experts . there have been no significant islamist attacks in spain since the madrid train bombings , the prosecutors conceded , but warned that the difficulty of jailing suspects hampered preventative action by police . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" despite all the efforts that have been made , the crisis is worsening , " putin said as he began talks withtopolanek , whose country represents the european union . " it is the ukrainian leadership that is making it worse , " putin added . putin , flanked by top russian officials including deputy prime minister igor sechin , alexei miller , head of gas giant gazprom , and energy minister sergei shmatko , said kiev had brought about a " gas blockade " of europe . " nonetheless we will try " to resolve the crisis , he said . russia cut off gas to ukraine on january 1 over a contractual dispute .
it later accused ukraine of " stealing " transit gas intended for clients in europe , a charge ukraine denied . russia cut off all gas through the network a week later , saying it was forced to do so after ukraine closed all routes in its territory for transport of russian gas to europe . " we hope you can convince the ukrainian party to sign the document " that sets terms for sending international , independent monitors to key gas pipeline sites to verify flows of russian gas through ukrainian territory . topolanek indicated that the uneasy relationship between ukraine 's president , viktor yushchenko , and its prime minister , julia timoshenko , was playing a role in the gas crisis , but claimed to have solved the problem . " we have managed to overcome the rift between the ukrainian president and the prime minister , " topolanek said as he was greeted by putin at the russian prime minister 's country home . putin replied : " you have done the impossible . " the czech prime minister also said he would not leave the region until russian gas again began to flow through ukraine to customers in europe . " i have sent a signal to ukrainian leaders that i will stay in the region until we get the gas flowing , " topolanek said at the meeting with putin . topolanek already had talks late friday with ukrainian president viktor yushchenko and prime minister julia timoshenko . the two ukrainian leaders , in a rare show of public solidarity , jointly met toplanek to discuss an eu observer mission sent to ukraine to assist in resolving the stand-off . the eu has urged russia immediately to restore gas supplies to europe after satisfying one of moscow 's key demands in the gas dispute by sending a team of observers to ukraine . but the taps remained shut as representatives of the two countries ' state-owned monopolies , gazprom and naftogaz , worked to hammer out details on the observers ' mission , while publicly exchanging accusations that the other was causing more delays . a deal brokered by the eu on thursday and friday still hung in the balance as gazprom and naftogaz failed to reach a written agreement on the deployment of additional russian and ukrainian observers to each other 's territory . eu observers in place bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's demands have been met now the eu wants its gas the eu mission , initially consisting of 18 senior eu officials and experts from the european gas industry , is tasked with verifying that no russian gas is siphoned off by ukraine while on its way to european customers . an advance team of eight eu technicians , led by filip cornelius , a senior european commission official , was on the ground in kyiv . cornelius made clear restoration of gas supplies to europe would take time , and - equally importantly - political will on the part of russia and ukraine . the eu observers could technically begin trips to pipelines as early as saturday , but a large number of " organizational issues " remained to be resolved before gas could flow , he said . the eu observers are to act as independent monitors at the six main natural-gas pipeline crossing points from russia to ukraine , and at the naftogaz headquarters . czech pm wants the gas to flow as soon as possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : topolanek hoped to get the taps turned on as europe shivers eu member states in central and southern europe continued to be hard hit by russia 's shut-off of all gas supplies through ukraine , with slovakia relying on gas supplies from poland and eu neighbor serbia seeking emergency help from germany , austria and hungary . by far the most critical situation , though , is faced by non-eu members serbia , bosnia-herzegovina , macedonia and moldova , which have no reserves left . other seriously affected eu countries such as greece , austria , the czech republic , slovenia , hungary , poland and romania , either have reserves that can last several weeks or have been able to resort to alternative sources of energy , eu officials said in a statement . about a quarter of the eu 's gas needs are met by russian gas , 80 per cent of which reaches european clients via ukraine . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his grim assessment comes as obama prepares to shift the focus of us military operations to afghanistan from iraq to stem an insurgency that has rebounded over the past two years .
craddock said that , although european allies were expecting obama to ask them to do more , " i think it 's going to be harder for them to do it because of decreasing defense budgets . "
he said nato has plans for replacing dutch forces in southern afghanistan in 2010 and the canadians in 2011 .
" the unknown is who else is going to pull out quickly .
we do n't know that .
it 's like in iraq , when nations pulled out without telling anyone ahead time ; it 's a terrible situation , " he told reporters .
the united states has committed to sending an additional 30,000 us troops to afghanistan , nearly doubling us force levels there from 32,000 troops currently .
but the pace of the us build-up has been slowed by continuing military requirements in iraq , where there are still more than 140,000 troops and where commanders insist that conditions remain fragile .
foreign forces needed for at least another three years in afghanistan , the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- has about 50,000 troops , which includes 14,000 us troops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the afghan army wo n't be able to take over for some time craddock said it will be another three years before the shortfall in security requirements there can be filled by the afghan army , and so more foreign forces will be needed to provide security .
" we have to be able to implement our strategy : one , clear out the insurgency ; two , hold ; three , build , " he said .
however , he said that after clearing , " we do n't have enough to hold to allow the build . "
asked whether afghanistan will require a 10-year us military commitment , he said , " at least . "
" maybe not at current force levels but i think we 'll see a presence there for decades , " he added .
drug trade fueling insurgency , says nato general the greatest security challenge is in southern afghanistan , where isaf faces a " very coherent pashtun insurgency " fueled by the trade in drugs from afghan poppies , craddock said .
he said the united nations estimates that insurgents are now getting $ 200 - $ 500 million a year from the drug trade , a big jump from the previous un estimate of $ 60 - $ 100 million a year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : remote controled bombs have become more prevalent " the uptick in ieds , the uptick in suicide bombs , the new numbers we 're seeing would tell me it has to be paid for , " he said , adding that he believes insurgent financing from drugs has at least doubled over the past year to 18 months .
craddock has pushed for , and obtained , authority for isaf to attack drug labs as a way of combating the insurgency .
" the question i 'm asked all the time is , ' are you losing ? ' , " he said .
" no .
we 're not winning fast enough . "
he said european allies have not questioned the requirement for more forces in afghanistan , but are constrained by declining defense budgets , and that is likely to get worse in current financial climate .
currently , only six of 36 nato members meet the alliance 's minimum goal of dedicating two percent of gdp to security , he said .
of those , half have declining defense budgets , he said .
" absent this financial crisis , still we 're challenged .
with this financial crisis , we 're challenged ever more greatly , " he said .

french television viewers can now watch their favorite prime time shows uninterrupted by ad breaks , but critics say sarkozy ’ s advertising ban on france ’ s public television is an attempt to gain media control . this week a catchy jingle aired right before the news broadcast on the public tv channel france 2 , reminding viewers that from now on , prime time evening programming would start 15 minutes earlier because advertising was being banned .
as of jan .
5 , after 8:00 p.m. there are now no commercials on public television in france and commercials will be phased out entirely by the year 2011 . french president nicolas sarkozy ’ s plan to pull ads as part of a move to restore the quality of the nation ’ s public television was approved by the national assembly towards the end of last year and also allows sarkozy to choose the chief of the french public broadcasting company , france télévisions .
the boss previously was appointed by an independent body . " if we keep commercials we are subjecting ourselves to the tyranny of audience ratings .
and this always means the worst programming dumbed down to lowest levels , " sarkozy said last february while announcing his reform plans .
" that ’ s ok for private stations , but public television must be different .

5 , after 8:00 p.m. there are now no commercials on public television in france and commercials will be phased out entirely by the year 2011 . french president nicolas sarkozy ’ s plan to pull ads as part of a move to restore the quality of the nation ’ s public television was approved by the national assembly towards the end of last year and also allows sarkozy to choose the chief of the french public broadcasting company , france télévisions .
the boss previously was appointed by an independent body . " if we keep commercials we are subjecting ourselves to the tyranny of audience ratings .
and this always means the worst programming dumbed down to lowest levels , " sarkozy said last february while announcing his reform plans .
" that ’ s ok for private stations , but public television must be different .
it must lift people up and excite their curiosity , conscience and intelligence . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does making tv fit for the french start with banning ads ? nex taxes make up for ad losses the new ban will be offset by two new taxes : a 0.9 percent tax on revenue of internet service suppliers and telephone operators , and a tax on advertising revenue of private tv channels ranging from 1.5 to 3 percent . but detractors claim that sarkozy ’ s move to ban ads is really just a camouflaged boost for tf1 , the most widely watched station in france , and which is also owned by martin bouygues , a long-time friend of sarkozy .
such critics expect that tf1 will win much of the advertising lost by france ’ s public networks . jean-francoise tealdi , a union leader at france télévisions , told deutsche welle that sarkozy ’ s reforms will impoverish public broadcasting and compromise its independence . " this is a return to 40 years ago when the political leaders chose the television directors .
back then the public broadcaster didn ’ t serve the people like it does today , " he said .
" it was basically state-run television like in eastern europe .
and that ’ s what mr. sarkozy is taking us back to . " tuning in to " france sarkozvision " ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy seems set on the tried and true bbc as a model for french tv public television staff walked off the job last week to protest the changes and several midday newscasts were scrapped . defending his reform , sarkozy has said that the ban on advertising is a major step toward his goal of modeling french public television on britain ’ s bbc .
but left-leaning newspaper libération has called the president ’ s reform a pretext to turn france télévisions into " france sarkozvision . " dw staff -lrb- ls / eb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

meanwhile the israeli campaign entered its third week with more air strikes . steinmeier ’ s arrival late friday in cairo adds yet another player to european union mediation efforts .
steinmeier said that his stepped up intervention was coordinated with the czech republic , currently the eu president . steinmeier was scheduled to meet saturday in cairo with egyptian president hosni mubarak . no location was announced for a planned meeting with palestinian president mahmoud abbas , whose term of office expired thursday . on sunday , steinmeier is to meet in tel aviv with israeli foreign minister tzipi livni and president shimon peres .
it was not clear if the german would also meet with israeli prime minister ehud olmert before returning late sunday to berlin . steinmeier has already made a series of telephone calls to key players in the region in a bid to achieve a " humanitarian ceasefire " in the gaza strip . the united nations security council late thursday demanded an immediate end to the fighting .
steinmeier called the resolution , passed 14-0 with the united states abstaining , " an important sign of unity . " israel launched a bombing campaign on december 27 in the coastal territory followed by a ground invasion on january 3 , all with the stated goal of halting rocket attacks by the gaza-based islamic militant movement hamas . the militant missile fire toward israel has been unabated despite the presence of israeli troops and continued airstrikes , with israeli authorities reporting another 30 rockets fired on friday . germany intent on stopping arms smuggling germany has been broadly supportive toward israel in the conflict , saying it is vital to cut off hamas ' supply of missiles , which are mainly smuggled into gaza via tunnels from egypt . bildunterschrift : german marines were deployed to stop arms smuggling after the 2006 lebanon war " if one does not manage to stop the arms smuggling , the outlook for a ceasefire and a subsequent armistice looks poor , " said thomas steg , deputy government spokesman . he refused to say if germany would offer peace monitors in gaza . other eu figures who have intervened include french president nicolas sarkozy , eu foreign policy chief javier solana , former british prime minister tony blair representing the mideast " quartet " of the united states , eu , un and russia , and the czech as eu president . steinmeier 's involvement had been only by telephone , with germany 's middle east envoy , andreas michaelis , on the ground in the region . some eu governments have been critical of sarkozy for acting independently of czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg . steinmeier wants a lasting ceasefire steinmeier said that the aim of his trip was " that the appeal for a ceasefire leads to an actual ceasefire . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier hopes to find a way to silence the guns he said berlin was " deeply concerned " about the humanitarian crisis inside gaza .
" the situation in the gaza strip can only be improved if we achieve a comprehensive ceasefire , " steinmeier said . andreas peschke , deputy foreign ministry spokesman , said : " in political and diplomatic terms , we will concentrate first of all on obtaining a ceasefire .
we see the principal point of departure in egypt 's initiative .
that 's why it is important to step up and maintain contacts with egypt and of course directly with israel . " egypt 's plan , as backed by sarkozy , calls for a cessation of violence , allowing aid to reach civilians , and includes an invitation to discuss ending israel 's blockade of gaza . third week of campaign sees intensity increase meanwhile , israel continued its offensive in the gaza strip saturday , pounding over 40 targets overnight , a military spokesman said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 40 targets were hit ny israeli jets on saturday the airstrikes , which came on top of 70 such attacks on friday , largely targeted smuggling tunnels and weapon manufacturing shops . israeli soldiers on the ground said they killed 15 armed men , the spokesman added . palestinian medical sources in the gaza strip have said the death toll has surpassed 800 , with over 3,300 people injured .
this was the 15th day of fighting . five israeli soldiers were lightly injured in overnight fighting .
troops remains in the gaza strip , but for the most part have not entered the most crowded urban areas . palestinian militants fired one mortar and three homemade rockets at southern israel since midnight . nine israeli soldiers and three civilians were killed since israel launched operation cast lead on december 27 , in what was said to be a campaign to curtail palestinian rocket fire . un truce plan goes unheeded the israeli offensive continued after the security cabinet decided on friday to carry on , despite a united nations ' security council resolution which called for an immediate ceasefire . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel and hamas have both ignored the un resolution " israel has a right to protect its citizens , " a statement from the cabinet said , adding that the military would " continue to change the security situation in the south , " parlance for attacking militant targets and sources of rocket fire and conducting activities to curtail arms smuggling . caretaker prime minister ehud olmert said israel " has never agreed that any outside body would determine its right to defend the security of its citizens . " israel also maintains an option , analysts said , to go to " phase three , " which would mean sending more ground troops deeper into populated areas . the military could not say whether there would be a three-hour " humanitarian lull " on saturday , to allow palestinians to stock up on food and let medics and patients move freely . three such lulls have taken place so far since wednesday , though friday 's was marred with violence that would not let up , even during the allotted time . the largest un aid agencies are also expected to resume activities " as soon as possible " after they reached an understanding with the israeli security forces .
four staff of unrwa , the agency for palestinian refugees , have been killed in the fighting . the un said it received security assurances from the israelis and they would closely monitor their commitment to the safety of the aid workers . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she faces re-election in september . the plan is expected to cost up to 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 68 billion -rrb- over the next two years , and will include investments in schools and infrastructure projects to protect jobs . the plan will also set up a " germany fund " which will help struggling firms get credit .

" i ca n't give you any binding answers , " she said after the cdu agreed on the plan . many analysts has said they predict the german economy will contract by a record margin this year , with some saying gdp could shrink by four percent or even more .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 10.01.2009 atheist campaign launched on london buses großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the campaign was partly created as an answer to a christian campaign last year last june london buses were plastered with the phrase " jesus said , " which pointed people to a website warning of hell .
now atheists in in britain 's capital are having their own say .
one christian group has complained . for many londoners , queuing for a tardy red double-decker bus may on occasions have prompted the utterance of a swear word or raised doubts about the existence of a deity altogether .
from this week , those with lingering doubts will have their views confirmed in an atheist advertising campaign rolled out on 200 of london 's iconic buses , the underground -lrb- tube -rrb- network and transport systems in other major cities .
" there 's probably no god .

those who followed the " jesus said " campaign to its website were told that non-christians " will be condemned to everlasting separation from god and then you spend all eternity in torment in hell . "
sherine said she believed that a lot of people had been outraged by the evangelical advertisements , without knowing what to do about it .
" our rational slogan will hopefully reassure anyone who has been scared by this kind of evangelism , " she said on launching the atheist campaign .
" i hope they 'll brighten people 's days and make them smile on their way to work . "
sherine said support for a fund-raising drive to finance the adverts had exceeded all expectations , with donations totalling 156,000 euros -lrb- $ 210,000 -rrb- , as opposed to the original target of 6,000 euros -lrb- $ 8,200 -rrb- .

" despite all the efforts that have been made , the crisis is worsening , " putin said as he began talks withtopolanek , whose country represents the european union . " it is the ukrainian leadership that is making it worse , " putin added . putin , flanked by top russian officials including deputy prime minister igor sechin , alexei miller , head of gas giant gazprom , and energy minister sergei shmatko , said kiev had brought about a " gas blockade " of europe . " nonetheless we will try " to resolve the crisis , he said . russia cut off gas to ukraine on january 1 over a contractual dispute .
it later accused ukraine of " stealing " transit gas intended for clients in europe , a charge ukraine denied . russia cut off all gas through the network a week later , saying it was forced to do so after ukraine closed all routes in its territory for transport of russian gas to europe . " we hope you can convince the ukrainian party to sign the document " that sets terms for sending international , independent monitors to key gas pipeline sites to verify flows of russian gas through ukrainian territory . topolanek indicated that the uneasy relationship between ukraine 's president , viktor yushchenko , and its prime minister , julia timoshenko , was playing a role in the gas crisis , but claimed to have solved the problem . " we have managed to overcome the rift between the ukrainian president and the prime minister , " topolanek said as he was greeted by putin at the russian prime minister 's country home . putin replied : " you have done the impossible . " the czech prime minister also said he would not leave the region until russian gas again began to flow through ukraine to customers in europe . " i have sent a signal to ukrainian leaders that i will stay in the region until we get the gas flowing , " topolanek said at the meeting with putin . topolanek already had talks late friday with ukrainian president viktor yushchenko and prime minister julia timoshenko . the two ukrainian leaders , in a rare show of public solidarity , jointly met toplanek to discuss an eu observer mission sent to ukraine to assist in resolving the stand-off . the eu has urged russia immediately to restore gas supplies to europe after satisfying one of moscow 's key demands in the gas dispute by sending a team of observers to ukraine . but the taps remained shut as representatives of the two countries ' state-owned monopolies , gazprom and naftogaz , worked to hammer out details on the observers ' mission , while publicly exchanging accusations that the other was causing more delays . a deal brokered by the eu on thursday and friday still hung in the balance as gazprom and naftogaz failed to reach a written agreement on the deployment of additional russian and ukrainian observers to each other 's territory . eu observers in place bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's demands have been met now the eu wants its gas the eu mission , initially consisting of 18 senior eu officials and experts from the european gas industry , is tasked with verifying that no russian gas is siphoned off by ukraine while on its way to european customers . an advance team of eight eu technicians , led by filip cornelius , a senior european commission official , was on the ground in kyiv . cornelius made clear restoration of gas supplies to europe would take time , and - equally importantly - political will on the part of russia and ukraine . the eu observers could technically begin trips to pipelines as early as saturday , but a large number of " organizational issues " remained to be resolved before gas could flow , he said . the eu observers are to act as independent monitors at the six main natural-gas pipeline crossing points from russia to ukraine , and at the naftogaz headquarters . czech pm wants the gas to flow as soon as possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : topolanek hoped to get the taps turned on as europe shivers eu member states in central and southern europe continued to be hard hit by russia 's shut-off of all gas supplies through ukraine , with slovakia relying on gas supplies from poland and eu neighbor serbia seeking emergency help from germany , austria and hungary . by far the most critical situation , though , is faced by non-eu members serbia , bosnia-herzegovina , macedonia and moldova , which have no reserves left . other seriously affected eu countries such as greece , austria , the czech republic , slovenia , hungary , poland and romania , either have reserves that can last several weeks or have been able to resort to alternative sources of energy , eu officials said in a statement . about a quarter of the eu 's gas needs are met by russian gas , 80 per cent of which reaches european clients via ukraine . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

french television viewers can now watch their favorite prime time shows uninterrupted by ad breaks , but critics say sarkozy ’ s advertising ban on france ’ s public television is an attempt to gain media control . this week a catchy jingle aired right before the news broadcast on the public tv channel france 2 , reminding viewers that from now on , prime time evening programming would start 15 minutes earlier because advertising was being banned .
as of jan .
5 , after 8:00 p.m. there are now no commercials on public television in france and commercials will be phased out entirely by the year 2011 . french president nicolas sarkozy ’ s plan to pull ads as part of a move to restore the quality of the nation ’ s public television was approved by the national assembly towards the end of last year and also allows sarkozy to choose the chief of the french public broadcasting company , france télévisions .
the boss previously was appointed by an independent body . " if we keep commercials we are subjecting ourselves to the tyranny of audience ratings .

such critics expect that tf1 will win much of the advertising lost by france ’ s public networks . jean-francoise tealdi , a union leader at france télévisions , told deutsche welle that sarkozy ’ s reforms will impoverish public broadcasting and compromise its independence . " this is a return to 40 years ago when the political leaders chose the television directors .

his grim assessment comes as obama prepares to shift the focus of us military operations to afghanistan from iraq to stem an insurgency that has rebounded over the past two years .
craddock said that , although european allies were expecting obama to ask them to do more , " i think it 's going to be harder for them to do it because of decreasing defense budgets . "
he said nato has plans for replacing dutch forces in southern afghanistan in 2010 and the canadians in 2011 .
" the unknown is who else is going to pull out quickly .
we do n't know that .
it 's like in iraq , when nations pulled out without telling anyone ahead time ; it 's a terrible situation , " he told reporters .
the united states has committed to sending an additional 30,000 us troops to afghanistan , nearly doubling us force levels there from 32,000 troops currently .
but the pace of the us build-up has been slowed by continuing military requirements in iraq , where there are still more than 140,000 troops and where commanders insist that conditions remain fragile .
foreign forces needed for at least another three years in afghanistan , the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- has about 50,000 troops , which includes 14,000 us troops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the afghan army wo n't be able to take over for some time craddock said it will be another three years before the shortfall in security requirements there can be filled by the afghan army , and so more foreign forces will be needed to provide security .
" we have to be able to implement our strategy : one , clear out the insurgency ; two , hold ; three , build , " he said .
however , he said that after clearing , " we do n't have enough to hold to allow the build . "
asked whether afghanistan will require a 10-year us military commitment , he said , " at least . "
" maybe not at current force levels but i think we 'll see a presence there for decades , " he added .
drug trade fueling insurgency , says nato general the greatest security challenge is in southern afghanistan , where isaf faces a " very coherent pashtun insurgency " fueled by the trade in drugs from afghan poppies , craddock said .
he said the united nations estimates that insurgents are now getting $ 200 - $ 500 million a year from the drug trade , a big jump from the previous un estimate of $ 60 - $ 100 million a year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : remote controled bombs have become more prevalent " the uptick in ieds , the uptick in suicide bombs , the new numbers we 're seeing would tell me it has to be paid for , " he said , adding that he believes insurgent financing from drugs has at least doubled over the past year to 18 months .
craddock has pushed for , and obtained , authority for isaf to attack drug labs as a way of combating the insurgency .
" the question i 'm asked all the time is , ' are you losing ? ' , " he said .
" no .
we 're not winning fast enough . "
he said european allies have not questioned the requirement for more forces in afghanistan , but are constrained by declining defense budgets , and that is likely to get worse in current financial climate .
currently , only six of 36 nato members meet the alliance 's minimum goal of dedicating two percent of gdp to security , he said .
of those , half have declining defense budgets , he said .
" absent this financial crisis , still we 're challenged .
with this financial crisis , we 're challenged ever more greatly , " he said .
nato 's own advancement hit by crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money is also a factor in modernizing nato forces besides troop contributions to nato operations , tight budgets also are undercutting efforts to modernize nato forces and acquire helicopters , drones and other systems needed in afghanistan , he said .

his grim assessment comes as obama prepares to shift the focus of us military operations to afghanistan from iraq to stem an insurgency that has rebounded over the past two years .
craddock said that , although european allies were expecting obama to ask them to do more , " i think it 's going to be harder for them to do it because of decreasing defense budgets . "
he said nato has plans for replacing dutch forces in southern afghanistan in 2010 and the canadians in 2011 .
" the unknown is who else is going to pull out quickly .
we do n't know that .
it 's like in iraq , when nations pulled out without telling anyone ahead time ; it 's a terrible situation , " he told reporters .
the united states has committed to sending an additional 30,000 us troops to afghanistan , nearly doubling us force levels there from 32,000 troops currently .
but the pace of the us build-up has been slowed by continuing military requirements in iraq , where there are still more than 140,000 troops and where commanders insist that conditions remain fragile .
foreign forces needed for at least another three years in afghanistan , the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- has about 50,000 troops , which includes 14,000 us troops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the afghan army wo n't be able to take over for some time craddock said it will be another three years before the shortfall in security requirements there can be filled by the afghan army , and so more foreign forces will be needed to provide security .
" we have to be able to implement our strategy : one , clear out the insurgency ; two , hold ; three , build , " he said .
however , he said that after clearing , " we do n't have enough to hold to allow the build . "
asked whether afghanistan will require a 10-year us military commitment , he said , " at least . "
" maybe not at current force levels but i think we 'll see a presence there for decades , " he added .
drug trade fueling insurgency , says nato general the greatest security challenge is in southern afghanistan , where isaf faces a " very coherent pashtun insurgency " fueled by the trade in drugs from afghan poppies , craddock said .
he said the united nations estimates that insurgents are now getting $ 200 - $ 500 million a year from the drug trade , a big jump from the previous un estimate of $ 60 - $ 100 million a year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : remote controled bombs have become more prevalent " the uptick in ieds , the uptick in suicide bombs , the new numbers we 're seeing would tell me it has to be paid for , " he said , adding that he believes insurgent financing from drugs has at least doubled over the past year to 18 months .
craddock has pushed for , and obtained , authority for isaf to attack drug labs as a way of combating the insurgency .
" the question i 'm asked all the time is , ' are you losing ? ' , " he said .
" no .
we 're not winning fast enough . "
he said european allies have not questioned the requirement for more forces in afghanistan , but are constrained by declining defense budgets , and that is likely to get worse in current financial climate .
currently , only six of 36 nato members meet the alliance 's minimum goal of dedicating two percent of gdp to security , he said .
of those , half have declining defense budgets , he said .
" absent this financial crisis , still we 're challenged .
with this financial crisis , we 're challenged ever more greatly , " he said .
nato 's own advancement hit by crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money is also a factor in modernizing nato forces besides troop contributions to nato operations , tight budgets also are undercutting efforts to modernize nato forces and acquire helicopters , drones and other systems needed in afghanistan , he said .

" israel launched a bombing campaign on december 27 in the coastal territory followed by a ground invasion on january 3 , all with the stated goal of halting rocket attacks by the gaza-based islamic militant movement hamas . the militant missile fire toward israel has been unabated despite the presence of israeli troops and continued airstrikes , with israeli authorities reporting another 30 rockets fired on friday . germany intent on stopping arms smuggling germany has been broadly supportive toward israel in the conflict , saying it is vital to cut off hamas ' supply of missiles , which are mainly smuggled into gaza via tunnels from egypt . bildunterschrift : german marines were deployed to stop arms smuggling after the 2006 lebanon war " if one does not manage to stop the arms smuggling , the outlook for a ceasefire and a subsequent armistice looks poor , " said thomas steg , deputy government spokesman . he refused to say if germany would offer peace monitors in gaza . other eu figures who have intervened include french president nicolas sarkozy , eu foreign policy chief javier solana , former british prime minister tony blair representing the mideast " quartet " of the united states , eu , un and russia , and the czech as eu president . steinmeier 's involvement had been only by telephone , with germany 's middle east envoy , andreas michaelis , on the ground in the region . some eu governments have been critical of sarkozy for acting independently of czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg . steinmeier wants a lasting ceasefire steinmeier said that the aim of his trip was " that the appeal for a ceasefire leads to an actual ceasefire . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier hopes to find a way to silence the guns he said berlin was " deeply concerned " about the humanitarian crisis inside gaza .
" the situation in the gaza strip can only be improved if we achieve a comprehensive ceasefire , " steinmeier said . andreas peschke , deputy foreign ministry spokesman , said : " in political and diplomatic terms , we will concentrate first of all on obtaining a ceasefire .
we see the principal point of departure in egypt 's initiative .
that 's why it is important to step up and maintain contacts with egypt and of course directly with israel . " egypt 's plan , as backed by sarkozy , calls for a cessation of violence , allowing aid to reach civilians , and includes an invitation to discuss ending israel 's blockade of gaza . third week of campaign sees intensity increase meanwhile , israel continued its offensive in the gaza strip saturday , pounding over 40 targets overnight , a military spokesman said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 40 targets were hit ny israeli jets on saturday the airstrikes , which came on top of 70 such attacks on friday , largely targeted smuggling tunnels and weapon manufacturing shops . israeli soldiers on the ground said they killed 15 armed men , the spokesman added . palestinian medical sources in the gaza strip have said the death toll has surpassed 800 , with over 3,300 people injured .
this was the 15th day of fighting . five israeli soldiers were lightly injured in overnight fighting .
troops remains in the gaza strip , but for the most part have not entered the most crowded urban areas . palestinian militants fired one mortar and three homemade rockets at southern israel since midnight . nine israeli soldiers and three civilians were killed since israel launched operation cast lead on december 27 , in what was said to be a campaign to curtail palestinian rocket fire . un truce plan goes unheeded the israeli offensive continued after the security cabinet decided on friday to carry on , despite a united nations ' security council resolution which called for an immediate ceasefire . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel and hamas have both ignored the un resolution " israel has a right to protect its citizens , " a statement from the cabinet said , adding that the military would " continue to change the security situation in the south , " parlance for attacking militant targets and sources of rocket fire and conducting activities to curtail arms smuggling . caretaker prime minister ehud olmert said israel " has never agreed that any outside body would determine its right to defend the security of its citizens . " israel also maintains an option , analysts said , to go to " phase three , " which would mean sending more ground troops deeper into populated areas . the military could not say whether there would be a three-hour " humanitarian lull " on saturday , to allow palestinians to stock up on food and let medics and patients move freely . three such lulls have taken place so far since wednesday , though friday 's was marred with violence that would not let up , even during the allotted time . the largest un aid agencies are also expected to resume activities " as soon as possible " after they reached an understanding with the israeli security forces .
four staff of unrwa , the agency for palestinian refugees , have been killed in the fighting . the un said it received security assurances from the israelis and they would closely monitor their commitment to the safety of the aid workers . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some died in suicide bombings in iraq , while others were unable to get there and returned to spain , where they encourage others to follow their example , according to the daily . almost 50 percent of suspects released in 2007 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turnover of arrests and releases in spain is high despite such evidence of the presence of potential terrorists in spain , spanish courts acquitted 31 of the 63 people who were tried on charges linked to islamist terrorism in 2007 . the supreme court has overturned several such high-profile verdicts handed out by the national court in the recent years . it reduced the sentence of abu dahdah from 27 to 12 years , acquitted three others among a total of 18 whom the national court had convicted in the case , and acquitted four of the 21 people who had been sentenced for the madrid train bombings . the supreme court also acquitted 15 of the 20 people who had been sentenced for belonging to an extremist cell and planning attacks including a plot to blow up the national court . that acquittal , in october 2008 , caused concern among police who regarded the suspects as very dangerous . questions over exaggerated threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are concerns that the terror threat is exaggerated with media attention focusing on islamist terrorists rather than the overwhelming majority of peaceful muslims living in spain , the acquittals raise the question whether the threat is being exaggerated , but the public prosecutor 's office does not believe that to be the case . the acquittals were demonstrative of the " enormous legal difficulties " of proving that a suspect was dangerous , the prosecutors said in a 2008 report . potential terrorists usually belong to small cells which act independently , making obtaining proof even harder , according to police experts . there have been no significant islamist attacks in spain since the madrid train bombings , the prosecutors conceded , but warned that the difficulty of jailing suspects hampered preventative action by police . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

other parties in the governing coalition are expected to follow . the 10-point-plan , agreed upon on saturday , jan 10 , by the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- in the central city of erfurt , is aimed at shoring up the economy and helping merkel 's campaign for chancellor later this year .
she faces re-election in september . the plan is expected to cost up to 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 68 billion -rrb- over the next two years , and will include investments in schools and infrastructure projects to protect jobs . the plan will also set up a " germany fund " which will help struggling firms get credit .
it could offer guarantees up to 100 billion euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one focus will be on infrastructure projects taxes and health insurance contributions would be lowered and a change in the car taxation system from july would provide drivers incentives to switch to fuel-efficient vehicles . it would raise the threshold for income tax and reform the system to make sure taxpayers are not automatically bumped into higher tax brackets even if their real incomes have not grown . there would also be a program to extend broadband internet access . second time 's a charm ? merkel 's conservatives and her governing coalition partners , the social democrats , launched a first stimulus package in november .
but it was widely criticized as being too meager .
while berlin said the package was worth 31 billion euros -lrb- $ 42 billion -rrb- , many countered that the numbers were massaged and it really amounted to much less . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany could see a severe economic contraction in 2009 the final amount of this second package will only become clear after merkel 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , and the spd agree on the plan in the coming days . speaking in erfurt , merkel said it was unclear how europe 's biggest economy , currently in recession , would perform over the coming year . " i ca n't give you any binding answers , " she said after the cdu agreed on the plan . many analysts has said they predict the german economy will contract by a record margin this year , with some saying gdp could shrink by four percent or even more .
that would be an unwelcome record , since the german economy has never contracted by as much as one percent over a full year since world war two . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 10.01.2009 atheist campaign launched on london buses großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the campaign was partly created as an answer to a christian campaign last year last june london buses were plastered with the phrase " jesus said , " which pointed people to a website warning of hell .
now atheists in in britain 's capital are having their own say .
one christian group has complained . for many londoners , queuing for a tardy red double-decker bus may on occasions have prompted the utterance of a swear word or raised doubts about the existence of a deity altogether .
from this week , those with lingering doubts will have their views confirmed in an atheist advertising campaign rolled out on 200 of london 's iconic buses , the underground -lrb- tube -rrb- network and transport systems in other major cities .
" there 's probably no god .
now stop worrying and enjoy your life , " is the main slogan of the campaign .
it is the brainchild of a television comedy writer and is backed by the british humanist association -lrb- bha -rrb- , as well as the highly regarded evolutionary biologist and prominent atheist richard dawkins , the author of " the god delusion . "
posters featuring quotations from prominent figures known to have endorsed atheism - such as albert einstein , douglas adams and katharine hepburn - are to be placed on london underground stations .
the words " that it will never come again is what makes life so sweet " are quoted from the poet emily dickinson .
the idea bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tv comedy writer ariane sherine helped come up with the idea tv comedy writer ariane sherine said her idea for an atheist publicity campaign was born out of anger at a christian advertising campaign on london buses this summer .
those who followed the " jesus said " campaign to its website were told that non-christians " will be condemned to everlasting separation from god and then you spend all eternity in torment in hell . "
sherine said she believed that a lot of people had been outraged by the evangelical advertisements , without knowing what to do about it .
" our rational slogan will hopefully reassure anyone who has been scared by this kind of evangelism , " she said on launching the atheist campaign .
" i hope they 'll brighten people 's days and make them smile on their way to work . "
sherine said support for a fund-raising drive to finance the adverts had exceeded all expectations , with donations totalling 156,000 euros -lrb- $ 210,000 -rrb- , as opposed to the original target of 6,000 euros -lrb- $ 8,200 -rrb- .
branching out as the campaign starts rolling , there is every indication that it could go global , sherine wrote in the british daily the guardian .
in spain , the union of atheists and freethinkers has launched buses with a translation of the slogan in the northern city of barcelona , and italy 's union of atheists , agnostics and rationalists was also planning to roll out atheist buses .
in the us , the american humanist association had been inspired to run a similar campaign on buses in washington , but in australia , a bus advertising scheme by the atheist foundation had been rejected by the country 's biggest outdoor advertising company .
church leaders react bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the italian version of the slogan could will soon be seen on buses in rome in britain , where the bha says up to 40 per cent of the population have " non-religious beliefs , " the atheist poster campaign has met with a measured response from church leaders .
" we would defend the right of any group representing a religious or philosophical position to be able to promote that view through appropriate channels , " said a spokesman for the mainstream church of england .
" however , christian belief is not about worrying or not enjoying life , " he added .
the methodist church welcomed the atheist bus campaign as " an opportunity to talk about the deepest questions in life . "
it could open up a dialogue between christians and atheists which would " allow misconceptions to be challenged , " said the methodist church .
professor dawkins , however , said he would have preferred the main slogan to read : " there 's certainly no god " instead of : " there 's probably no god . "
complaint but at least one christian group is not taking such a low-key approach .
the christian voice lobby group has filed a complaint with the advertising standards authority -lrb- asa -rrb- , saying the ads breach its codes on substantiation and truthfulness . " -lrb- the message -rrb- is given as a statement of fact and that means it must be capable of substantiation if it is not to break the rules , " said stephen green , the group 's national director . " there is plenty of evidence for god , from people 's personal experience , to the complexity , interdependence , beauty and design of the natural world . " but british humanist association head hanne stinson said it , for one , was not taking the complaint very seriously . " i 've sought advice from some of our key people here , but i 'm afraid all i 've got out of them so far is peals of laughter , " she said . the asa said it has acknowledged the complaint and will be assessing it over the next few days . dw staff -lrb- mrm / jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

meanwhile the israeli campaign entered its third week with more air strikes . steinmeier ’ s arrival late friday in cairo adds yet another player to european union mediation efforts .
steinmeier said that his stepped up intervention was coordinated with the czech republic , currently the eu president . steinmeier was scheduled to meet saturday in cairo with egyptian president hosni mubarak . no location was announced for a planned meeting with palestinian president mahmoud abbas , whose term of office expired thursday . on sunday , steinmeier is to meet in tel aviv with israeli foreign minister tzipi livni and president shimon peres .

steinmeier called the resolution , passed 14-0 with the united states abstaining , " an important sign of unity .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nato -pipe- 10.01.2009 nato fears european pull-out from afghanistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european forces may be forced to pull-out of afghanistan due to the economic crisis the economic crisis raises the risk that european allies will pull back from afghanistan at a time when president-elect barack obama is expected to reach out to them for help , nato 's supreme commander warned friday . at the same time , general bantz craddock predicted that us forces will be in afghanistan for " at least " a decade , and likely have a presence there for decades to come .
his grim assessment comes as obama prepares to shift the focus of us military operations to afghanistan from iraq to stem an insurgency that has rebounded over the past two years .
craddock said that , although european allies were expecting obama to ask them to do more , " i think it 's going to be harder for them to do it because of decreasing defense budgets . "
he said nato has plans for replacing dutch forces in southern afghanistan in 2010 and the canadians in 2011 .
" the unknown is who else is going to pull out quickly .
we do n't know that .
it 's like in iraq , when nations pulled out without telling anyone ahead time ; it 's a terrible situation , " he told reporters .
the united states has committed to sending an additional 30,000 us troops to afghanistan , nearly doubling us force levels there from 32,000 troops currently .
but the pace of the us build-up has been slowed by continuing military requirements in iraq , where there are still more than 140,000 troops and where commanders insist that conditions remain fragile .
foreign forces needed for at least another three years in afghanistan , the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- has about 50,000 troops , which includes 14,000 us troops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the afghan army wo n't be able to take over for some time craddock said it will be another three years before the shortfall in security requirements there can be filled by the afghan army , and so more foreign forces will be needed to provide security .
" we have to be able to implement our strategy : one , clear out the insurgency ; two , hold ; three , build , " he said .
however , he said that after clearing , " we do n't have enough to hold to allow the build . "
asked whether afghanistan will require a 10-year us military commitment , he said , " at least . "
" maybe not at current force levels but i think we 'll see a presence there for decades , " he added .
drug trade fueling insurgency , says nato general the greatest security challenge is in southern afghanistan , where isaf faces a " very coherent pashtun insurgency " fueled by the trade in drugs from afghan poppies , craddock said .
he said the united nations estimates that insurgents are now getting $ 200 - $ 500 million a year from the drug trade , a big jump from the previous un estimate of $ 60 - $ 100 million a year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : remote controled bombs have become more prevalent " the uptick in ieds , the uptick in suicide bombs , the new numbers we 're seeing would tell me it has to be paid for , " he said , adding that he believes insurgent financing from drugs has at least doubled over the past year to 18 months .
craddock has pushed for , and obtained , authority for isaf to attack drug labs as a way of combating the insurgency .
" the question i 'm asked all the time is , ' are you losing ? ' , " he said .
" no .
we 're not winning fast enough . "
he said european allies have not questioned the requirement for more forces in afghanistan , but are constrained by declining defense budgets , and that is likely to get worse in current financial climate .
currently , only six of 36 nato members meet the alliance 's minimum goal of dedicating two percent of gdp to security , he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nato -pipe- 10.01.2009 nato fears european pull-out from afghanistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european forces may be forced to pull-out of afghanistan due to the economic crisis the economic crisis raises the risk that european allies will pull back from afghanistan at a time when president-elect barack obama is expected to reach out to them for help , nato 's supreme commander warned friday . at the same time , general bantz craddock predicted that us forces will be in afghanistan for " at least " a decade , and likely have a presence there for decades to come .
his grim assessment comes as obama prepares to shift the focus of us military operations to afghanistan from iraq to stem an insurgency that has rebounded over the past two years .
craddock said that , although european allies were expecting obama to ask them to do more , " i think it 's going to be harder for them to do it because of decreasing defense budgets . "
he said nato has plans for replacing dutch forces in southern afghanistan in 2010 and the canadians in 2011 .
" the unknown is who else is going to pull out quickly .
we do n't know that .
it 's like in iraq , when nations pulled out without telling anyone ahead time ; it 's a terrible situation , " he told reporters .
the united states has committed to sending an additional 30,000 us troops to afghanistan , nearly doubling us force levels there from 32,000 troops currently .
but the pace of the us build-up has been slowed by continuing military requirements in iraq , where there are still more than 140,000 troops and where commanders insist that conditions remain fragile .
foreign forces needed for at least another three years in afghanistan , the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- has about 50,000 troops , which includes 14,000 us troops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the afghan army wo n't be able to take over for some time craddock said it will be another three years before the shortfall in security requirements there can be filled by the afghan army , and so more foreign forces will be needed to provide security .
" we have to be able to implement our strategy : one , clear out the insurgency ; two , hold ; three , build , " he said .
however , he said that after clearing , " we do n't have enough to hold to allow the build . "
asked whether afghanistan will require a 10-year us military commitment , he said , " at least . "
" maybe not at current force levels but i think we 'll see a presence there for decades , " he added .
drug trade fueling insurgency , says nato general the greatest security challenge is in southern afghanistan , where isaf faces a " very coherent pashtun insurgency " fueled by the trade in drugs from afghan poppies , craddock said .
he said the united nations estimates that insurgents are now getting $ 200 - $ 500 million a year from the drug trade , a big jump from the previous un estimate of $ 60 - $ 100 million a year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : remote controled bombs have become more prevalent " the uptick in ieds , the uptick in suicide bombs , the new numbers we 're seeing would tell me it has to be paid for , " he said , adding that he believes insurgent financing from drugs has at least doubled over the past year to 18 months .
craddock has pushed for , and obtained , authority for isaf to attack drug labs as a way of combating the insurgency .
" the question i 'm asked all the time is , ' are you losing ? ' , " he said .
" no .
we 're not winning fast enough . "
he said european allies have not questioned the requirement for more forces in afghanistan , but are constrained by declining defense budgets , and that is likely to get worse in current financial climate .
currently , only six of 36 nato members meet the alliance 's minimum goal of dedicating two percent of gdp to security , he said .
of those , half have declining defense budgets , he said .
" absent this financial crisis , still we 're challenged .
with this financial crisis , we 're challenged ever more greatly , " he said .
nato 's own advancement hit by crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money is also a factor in modernizing nato forces besides troop contributions to nato operations , tight budgets also are undercutting efforts to modernize nato forces and acquire helicopters , drones and other systems needed in afghanistan , he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nato -pipe- 10.01.2009 nato fears european pull-out from afghanistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european forces may be forced to pull-out of afghanistan due to the economic crisis the economic crisis raises the risk that european allies will pull back from afghanistan at a time when president-elect barack obama is expected to reach out to them for help , nato 's supreme commander warned friday . at the same time , general bantz craddock predicted that us forces will be in afghanistan for " at least " a decade , and likely have a presence there for decades to come .
his grim assessment comes as obama prepares to shift the focus of us military operations to afghanistan from iraq to stem an insurgency that has rebounded over the past two years .
craddock said that , although european allies were expecting obama to ask them to do more , " i think it 's going to be harder for them to do it because of decreasing defense budgets . "
he said nato has plans for replacing dutch forces in southern afghanistan in 2010 and the canadians in 2011 .
" the unknown is who else is going to pull out quickly .
we do n't know that .
it 's like in iraq , when nations pulled out without telling anyone ahead time ; it 's a terrible situation , " he told reporters .
the united states has committed to sending an additional 30,000 us troops to afghanistan , nearly doubling us force levels there from 32,000 troops currently .
but the pace of the us build-up has been slowed by continuing military requirements in iraq , where there are still more than 140,000 troops and where commanders insist that conditions remain fragile .
foreign forces needed for at least another three years in afghanistan , the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- has about 50,000 troops , which includes 14,000 us troops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the afghan army wo n't be able to take over for some time craddock said it will be another three years before the shortfall in security requirements there can be filled by the afghan army , and so more foreign forces will be needed to provide security .
" we have to be able to implement our strategy : one , clear out the insurgency ; two , hold ; three , build , " he said .
however , he said that after clearing , " we do n't have enough to hold to allow the build . "
asked whether afghanistan will require a 10-year us military commitment , he said , " at least . "
" maybe not at current force levels but i think we 'll see a presence there for decades , " he added .
drug trade fueling insurgency , says nato general the greatest security challenge is in southern afghanistan , where isaf faces a " very coherent pashtun insurgency " fueled by the trade in drugs from afghan poppies , craddock said .
he said the united nations estimates that insurgents are now getting $ 200 - $ 500 million a year from the drug trade , a big jump from the previous un estimate of $ 60 - $ 100 million a year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : remote controled bombs have become more prevalent " the uptick in ieds , the uptick in suicide bombs , the new numbers we 're seeing would tell me it has to be paid for , " he said , adding that he believes insurgent financing from drugs has at least doubled over the past year to 18 months .
craddock has pushed for , and obtained , authority for isaf to attack drug labs as a way of combating the insurgency .
" the question i 'm asked all the time is , ' are you losing ? ' , " he said .
" no .
we 're not winning fast enough . "
he said european allies have not questioned the requirement for more forces in afghanistan , but are constrained by declining defense budgets , and that is likely to get worse in current financial climate .
currently , only six of 36 nato members meet the alliance 's minimum goal of dedicating two percent of gdp to security , he said .
of those , half have declining defense budgets , he said .
" absent this financial crisis , still we 're challenged .
with this financial crisis , we 're challenged ever more greatly , " he said .
nato 's own advancement hit by crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money is also a factor in modernizing nato forces besides troop contributions to nato operations , tight budgets also are undercutting efforts to modernize nato forces and acquire helicopters , drones and other systems needed in afghanistan , he said .
" so i think we are going to have some hard times ahead .
it 's going to impact , one , the ability of nations to stay in operations , which is probably the most expensive .
two , it may slow down their transformation , " he said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the czech prime minister heads to kyiv for talks on saturday , jan .
10 . the deal for international observers to monitor the russian shipments via the ukraine was signed after five hours of talks between russian first deputy prime minister igor sechin and eu officials . russia will resume gas supply to europe through ukraine as soon as monitors are in place but will cut it again if it sees any " theft " by ukraine , prime minister vladimir putin warned saturday . the dispute began when russia and ukraine could not agree on gas prices for the coming year and russia cut off gas supplies on jan .
1 . russia has accused ukraine of corruption and of stealing gas meant for europe .
ukraine has countered that russia is trying to blackmail it by its actions so it can substantially raise its prices . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gas supplies in eastern europe have been affected the row has led to the worst-ever disruption of russian gas supplies to europe .
it has resulted in factories having to close down in eastern europe and renewed fears in the eu over the reliability of russian gas supplies .
europe gets about a quarter of its gas supplies from russia , 80 percent of which passes through ukraine . czech prime minister mirek topolanek , holder of the eu 's presidency , was expected in kyiv later saturday for talks with the ukrainian prime minister after russian and eu officials signed the monitoring agreement . russia had said it wanted a written deal in place before resuming shipments , but it also needs to be signed by ukraine to come into force . ukraine said it could sign an agreement to verify the flow of russian gas to europe on saturday . the agreement could be signed " already today , " deputy prime minister grygory nemyrya told reporters .
" i am hoping " that it will be signed on saturday , he said . monitoring team bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cutting wood near sarajevo to sell after deliveries of russian natural gas to bosnia were stopped an eu monitoring team is already in kyiv at the headquarters of the ukrainian natural gas transportation company ukrtransnafta for inspections of volume counting equipment and company records , said volodymyr trikolich , an ukrtransgaz spokesman , at a kyiv press conference . an advance team of eight eu technicians arrived in ukraine on friday as part of a brussels plan to end bickering between kyiv and the kremlin over natural gas shipments , by placing independent monitors in ukraine to supervise russian exports to europe moving through ukrainian pipelines . a total 18 observers will work in ukraine until the standoff between russia and ukraine over gas shipments is resolved , eu officials said friday .

his grim assessment comes as obama prepares to shift the focus of us military operations to afghanistan from iraq to stem an insurgency that has rebounded over the past two years .
craddock said that , although european allies were expecting obama to ask them to do more , " i think it 's going to be harder for them to do it because of decreasing defense budgets . "
he said nato has plans for replacing dutch forces in southern afghanistan in 2010 and the canadians in 2011 .
" the unknown is who else is going to pull out quickly .
we do n't know that .
it 's like in iraq , when nations pulled out without telling anyone ahead time ; it 's a terrible situation , " he told reporters .
the united states has committed to sending an additional 30,000 us troops to afghanistan , nearly doubling us force levels there from 32,000 troops currently .
but the pace of the us build-up has been slowed by continuing military requirements in iraq , where there are still more than 140,000 troops and where commanders insist that conditions remain fragile .
foreign forces needed for at least another three years in afghanistan , the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- has about 50,000 troops , which includes 14,000 us troops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the afghan army wo n't be able to take over for some time craddock said it will be another three years before the shortfall in security requirements there can be filled by the afghan army , and so more foreign forces will be needed to provide security .
" we have to be able to implement our strategy : one , clear out the insurgency ; two , hold ; three , build , " he said .
however , he said that after clearing , " we do n't have enough to hold to allow the build . "
asked whether afghanistan will require a 10-year us military commitment , he said , " at least . "
" maybe not at current force levels but i think we 'll see a presence there for decades , " he added .
drug trade fueling insurgency , says nato general the greatest security challenge is in southern afghanistan , where isaf faces a " very coherent pashtun insurgency " fueled by the trade in drugs from afghan poppies , craddock said .
he said the united nations estimates that insurgents are now getting $ 200 - $ 500 million a year from the drug trade , a big jump from the previous un estimate of $ 60 - $ 100 million a year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : remote controled bombs have become more prevalent " the uptick in ieds , the uptick in suicide bombs , the new numbers we 're seeing would tell me it has to be paid for , " he said , adding that he believes insurgent financing from drugs has at least doubled over the past year to 18 months .
craddock has pushed for , and obtained , authority for isaf to attack drug labs as a way of combating the insurgency .
" the question i 'm asked all the time is , ' are you losing ? ' , " he said .
" no .
we 're not winning fast enough . "
he said european allies have not questioned the requirement for more forces in afghanistan , but are constrained by declining defense budgets , and that is likely to get worse in current financial climate .
currently , only six of 36 nato members meet the alliance 's minimum goal of dedicating two percent of gdp to security , he said .
of those , half have declining defense budgets , he said .
" absent this financial crisis , still we 're challenged .
with this financial crisis , we 're challenged ever more greatly , " he said .
nato 's own advancement hit by crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money is also a factor in modernizing nato forces besides troop contributions to nato operations , tight budgets also are undercutting efforts to modernize nato forces and acquire helicopters , drones and other systems needed in afghanistan , he said .
" so i think we are going to have some hard times ahead .
it 's going to impact , one , the ability of nations to stay in operations , which is probably the most expensive .
two , it may slow down their transformation , " he said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some died in suicide bombings in iraq , while others were unable to get there and returned to spain , where they encourage others to follow their example , according to the daily . almost 50 percent of suspects released in 2007 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turnover of arrests and releases in spain is high despite such evidence of the presence of potential terrorists in spain , spanish courts acquitted 31 of the 63 people who were tried on charges linked to islamist terrorism in 2007 . the supreme court has overturned several such high-profile verdicts handed out by the national court in the recent years . it reduced the sentence of abu dahdah from 27 to 12 years , acquitted three others among a total of 18 whom the national court had convicted in the case , and acquitted four of the 21 people who had been sentenced for the madrid train bombings . the supreme court also acquitted 15 of the 20 people who had been sentenced for belonging to an extremist cell and planning attacks including a plot to blow up the national court . that acquittal , in october 2008 , caused concern among police who regarded the suspects as very dangerous . questions over exaggerated threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are concerns that the terror threat is exaggerated with media attention focusing on islamist terrorists rather than the overwhelming majority of peaceful muslims living in spain , the acquittals raise the question whether the threat is being exaggerated , but the public prosecutor 's office does not believe that to be the case . the acquittals were demonstrative of the " enormous legal difficulties " of proving that a suspect was dangerous , the prosecutors said in a 2008 report . potential terrorists usually belong to small cells which act independently , making obtaining proof even harder , according to police experts . there have been no significant islamist attacks in spain since the madrid train bombings , the prosecutors conceded , but warned that the difficulty of jailing suspects hampered preventative action by police . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

meanwhile the israeli campaign entered its third week with more air strikes . steinmeier ’ s arrival late friday in cairo adds yet another player to european union mediation efforts .
steinmeier said that his stepped up intervention was coordinated with the czech republic , currently the eu president . steinmeier was scheduled to meet saturday in cairo with egyptian president hosni mubarak . no location was announced for a planned meeting with palestinian president mahmoud abbas , whose term of office expired thursday . on sunday , steinmeier is to meet in tel aviv with israeli foreign minister tzipi livni and president shimon peres .
it was not clear if the german would also meet with israeli prime minister ehud olmert before returning late sunday to berlin . steinmeier has already made a series of telephone calls to key players in the region in a bid to achieve a " humanitarian ceasefire " in the gaza strip . the united nations security council late thursday demanded an immediate end to the fighting .
steinmeier called the resolution , passed 14-0 with the united states abstaining , " an important sign of unity . " israel launched a bombing campaign on december 27 in the coastal territory followed by a ground invasion on january 3 , all with the stated goal of halting rocket attacks by the gaza-based islamic militant movement hamas . the militant missile fire toward israel has been unabated despite the presence of israeli troops and continued airstrikes , with israeli authorities reporting another 30 rockets fired on friday . germany intent on stopping arms smuggling germany has been broadly supportive toward israel in the conflict , saying it is vital to cut off hamas ' supply of missiles , which are mainly smuggled into gaza via tunnels from egypt . bildunterschrift : german marines were deployed to stop arms smuggling after the 2006 lebanon war " if one does not manage to stop the arms smuggling , the outlook for a ceasefire and a subsequent armistice looks poor , " said thomas steg , deputy government spokesman . he refused to say if germany would offer peace monitors in gaza . other eu figures who have intervened include french president nicolas sarkozy , eu foreign policy chief javier solana , former british prime minister tony blair representing the mideast " quartet " of the united states , eu , un and russia , and the czech as eu president . steinmeier 's involvement had been only by telephone , with germany 's middle east envoy , andreas michaelis , on the ground in the region . some eu governments have been critical of sarkozy for acting independently of czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg . steinmeier wants a lasting ceasefire steinmeier said that the aim of his trip was " that the appeal for a ceasefire leads to an actual ceasefire . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier hopes to find a way to silence the guns he said berlin was " deeply concerned " about the humanitarian crisis inside gaza .
" the situation in the gaza strip can only be improved if we achieve a comprehensive ceasefire , " steinmeier said . andreas peschke , deputy foreign ministry spokesman , said : " in political and diplomatic terms , we will concentrate first of all on obtaining a ceasefire .
we see the principal point of departure in egypt 's initiative .
that 's why it is important to step up and maintain contacts with egypt and of course directly with israel . " egypt 's plan , as backed by sarkozy , calls for a cessation of violence , allowing aid to reach civilians , and includes an invitation to discuss ending israel 's blockade of gaza . third week of campaign sees intensity increase meanwhile , israel continued its offensive in the gaza strip saturday , pounding over 40 targets overnight , a military spokesman said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 40 targets were hit ny israeli jets on saturday the airstrikes , which came on top of 70 such attacks on friday , largely targeted smuggling tunnels and weapon manufacturing shops . israeli soldiers on the ground said they killed 15 armed men , the spokesman added . palestinian medical sources in the gaza strip have said the death toll has surpassed 800 , with over 3,300 people injured .
this was the 15th day of fighting . five israeli soldiers were lightly injured in overnight fighting .
troops remains in the gaza strip , but for the most part have not entered the most crowded urban areas . palestinian militants fired one mortar and three homemade rockets at southern israel since midnight . nine israeli soldiers and three civilians were killed since israel launched operation cast lead on december 27 , in what was said to be a campaign to curtail palestinian rocket fire . un truce plan goes unheeded the israeli offensive continued after the security cabinet decided on friday to carry on , despite a united nations ' security council resolution which called for an immediate ceasefire . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel and hamas have both ignored the un resolution " israel has a right to protect its citizens , " a statement from the cabinet said , adding that the military would " continue to change the security situation in the south , " parlance for attacking militant targets and sources of rocket fire and conducting activities to curtail arms smuggling . caretaker prime minister ehud olmert said israel " has never agreed that any outside body would determine its right to defend the security of its citizens . " israel also maintains an option , analysts said , to go to " phase three , " which would mean sending more ground troops deeper into populated areas . the military could not say whether there would be a three-hour " humanitarian lull " on saturday , to allow palestinians to stock up on food and let medics and patients move freely . three such lulls have taken place so far since wednesday , though friday 's was marred with violence that would not let up , even during the allotted time . the largest un aid agencies are also expected to resume activities " as soon as possible " after they reached an understanding with the israeli security forces .
four staff of unrwa , the agency for palestinian refugees , have been killed in the fighting . the un said it received security assurances from the israelis and they would closely monitor their commitment to the safety of the aid workers . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

french television viewers can now watch their favorite prime time shows uninterrupted by ad breaks , but critics say sarkozy ’ s advertising ban on france ’ s public television is an attempt to gain media control . this week a catchy jingle aired right before the news broadcast on the public tv channel france 2 , reminding viewers that from now on , prime time evening programming would start 15 minutes earlier because advertising was being banned .
as of jan .
5 , after 8:00 p.m. there are now no commercials on public television in france and commercials will be phased out entirely by the year 2011 . french president nicolas sarkozy ’ s plan to pull ads as part of a move to restore the quality of the nation ’ s public television was approved by the national assembly towards the end of last year and also allows sarkozy to choose the chief of the french public broadcasting company , france télévisions .
the boss previously was appointed by an independent body . " if we keep commercials we are subjecting ourselves to the tyranny of audience ratings .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 10.01.2009 atheist campaign launched on london buses großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the campaign was partly created as an answer to a christian campaign last year last june london buses were plastered with the phrase " jesus said , " which pointed people to a website warning of hell .
now atheists in in britain 's capital are having their own say .
one christian group has complained . for many londoners , queuing for a tardy red double-decker bus may on occasions have prompted the utterance of a swear word or raised doubts about the existence of a deity altogether .
from this week , those with lingering doubts will have their views confirmed in an atheist advertising campaign rolled out on 200 of london 's iconic buses , the underground -lrb- tube -rrb- network and transport systems in other major cities .
" there 's probably no god .
now stop worrying and enjoy your life , " is the main slogan of the campaign .
it is the brainchild of a television comedy writer and is backed by the british humanist association -lrb- bha -rrb- , as well as the highly regarded evolutionary biologist and prominent atheist richard dawkins , the author of " the god delusion . "
posters featuring quotations from prominent figures known to have endorsed atheism - such as albert einstein , douglas adams and katharine hepburn - are to be placed on london underground stations .
the words " that it will never come again is what makes life so sweet " are quoted from the poet emily dickinson .
the idea bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tv comedy writer ariane sherine helped come up with the idea tv comedy writer ariane sherine said her idea for an atheist publicity campaign was born out of anger at a christian advertising campaign on london buses this summer .
those who followed the " jesus said " campaign to its website were told that non-christians " will be condemned to everlasting separation from god and then you spend all eternity in torment in hell . "
sherine said she believed that a lot of people had been outraged by the evangelical advertisements , without knowing what to do about it .

french television viewers can now watch their favorite prime time shows uninterrupted by ad breaks , but critics say sarkozy ’ s advertising ban on france ’ s public television is an attempt to gain media control . this week a catchy jingle aired right before the news broadcast on the public tv channel france 2 , reminding viewers that from now on , prime time evening programming would start 15 minutes earlier because advertising was being banned .
as of jan .
5 , after 8:00 p.m. there are now no commercials on public television in france and commercials will be phased out entirely by the year 2011 . french president nicolas sarkozy ’ s plan to pull ads as part of a move to restore the quality of the nation ’ s public television was approved by the national assembly towards the end of last year and also allows sarkozy to choose the chief of the french public broadcasting company , france télévisions .
the boss previously was appointed by an independent body . " if we keep commercials we are subjecting ourselves to the tyranny of audience ratings .

french television viewers can now watch their favorite prime time shows uninterrupted by ad breaks , but critics say sarkozy ’ s advertising ban on france ’ s public television is an attempt to gain media control . this week a catchy jingle aired right before the news broadcast on the public tv channel france 2 , reminding viewers that from now on , prime time evening programming would start 15 minutes earlier because advertising was being banned .
as of jan .
5 , after 8:00 p.m. there are now no commercials on public television in france and commercials will be phased out entirely by the year 2011 . french president nicolas sarkozy ’ s plan to pull ads as part of a move to restore the quality of the nation ’ s public television was approved by the national assembly towards the end of last year and also allows sarkozy to choose the chief of the french public broadcasting company , france télévisions .
the boss previously was appointed by an independent body . " if we keep commercials we are subjecting ourselves to the tyranny of audience ratings .
and this always means the worst programming dumbed down to lowest levels , " sarkozy said last february while announcing his reform plans .
" that ’ s ok for private stations , but public television must be different .
it must lift people up and excite their curiosity , conscience and intelligence . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does making tv fit for the french start with banning ads ? nex taxes make up for ad losses the new ban will be offset by two new taxes : a 0.9 percent tax on revenue of internet service suppliers and telephone operators , and a tax on advertising revenue of private tv channels ranging from 1.5 to 3 percent . but detractors claim that sarkozy ’ s move to ban ads is really just a camouflaged boost for tf1 , the most widely watched station in france , and which is also owned by martin bouygues , a long-time friend of sarkozy .
such critics expect that tf1 will win much of the advertising lost by france ’ s public networks . jean-francoise tealdi , a union leader at france télévisions , told deutsche welle that sarkozy ’ s reforms will impoverish public broadcasting and compromise its independence . " this is a return to 40 years ago when the political leaders chose the television directors .
back then the public broadcaster didn ’ t serve the people like it does today , " he said .
" it was basically state-run television like in eastern europe .
and that ’ s what mr. sarkozy is taking us back to . " tuning in to " france sarkozvision " ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy seems set on the tried and true bbc as a model for french tv public television staff walked off the job last week to protest the changes and several midday newscasts were scrapped . defending his reform , sarkozy has said that the ban on advertising is a major step toward his goal of modeling french public television on britain ’ s bbc .
but left-leaning newspaper libération has called the president ’ s reform a pretext to turn france télévisions into " france sarkozvision . " dw staff -lrb- ls / eb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 10.01.2009 atheist campaign launched on london buses großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the campaign was partly created as an answer to a christian campaign last year last june london buses were plastered with the phrase " jesus said , " which pointed people to a website warning of hell .
now atheists in in britain 's capital are having their own say .
one christian group has complained . for many londoners , queuing for a tardy red double-decker bus may on occasions have prompted the utterance of a swear word or raised doubts about the existence of a deity altogether .
from this week , those with lingering doubts will have their views confirmed in an atheist advertising campaign rolled out on 200 of london 's iconic buses , the underground -lrb- tube -rrb- network and transport systems in other major cities .
" there 's probably no god .
now stop worrying and enjoy your life , " is the main slogan of the campaign .
it is the brainchild of a television comedy writer and is backed by the british humanist association -lrb- bha -rrb- , as well as the highly regarded evolutionary biologist and prominent atheist richard dawkins , the author of " the god delusion . "
posters featuring quotations from prominent figures known to have endorsed atheism - such as albert einstein , douglas adams and katharine hepburn - are to be placed on london underground stations .
the words " that it will never come again is what makes life so sweet " are quoted from the poet emily dickinson .
the idea bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tv comedy writer ariane sherine helped come up with the idea tv comedy writer ariane sherine said her idea for an atheist publicity campaign was born out of anger at a christian advertising campaign on london buses this summer .
those who followed the " jesus said " campaign to its website were told that non-christians " will be condemned to everlasting separation from god and then you spend all eternity in torment in hell . "
sherine said she believed that a lot of people had been outraged by the evangelical advertisements , without knowing what to do about it .
" our rational slogan will hopefully reassure anyone who has been scared by this kind of evangelism , " she said on launching the atheist campaign .
" i hope they 'll brighten people 's days and make them smile on their way to work . "
sherine said support for a fund-raising drive to finance the adverts had exceeded all expectations , with donations totalling 156,000 euros -lrb- $ 210,000 -rrb- , as opposed to the original target of 6,000 euros -lrb- $ 8,200 -rrb- .
branching out as the campaign starts rolling , there is every indication that it could go global , sherine wrote in the british daily the guardian .
in spain , the union of atheists and freethinkers has launched buses with a translation of the slogan in the northern city of barcelona , and italy 's union of atheists , agnostics and rationalists was also planning to roll out atheist buses .
in the us , the american humanist association had been inspired to run a similar campaign on buses in washington , but in australia , a bus advertising scheme by the atheist foundation had been rejected by the country 's biggest outdoor advertising company .
church leaders react bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the italian version of the slogan could will soon be seen on buses in rome in britain , where the bha says up to 40 per cent of the population have " non-religious beliefs , " the atheist poster campaign has met with a measured response from church leaders .
" we would defend the right of any group representing a religious or philosophical position to be able to promote that view through appropriate channels , " said a spokesman for the mainstream church of england .
" however , christian belief is not about worrying or not enjoying life , " he added .
the methodist church welcomed the atheist bus campaign as " an opportunity to talk about the deepest questions in life . "
it could open up a dialogue between christians and atheists which would " allow misconceptions to be challenged , " said the methodist church .
professor dawkins , however , said he would have preferred the main slogan to read : " there 's certainly no god " instead of : " there 's probably no god . "
complaint but at least one christian group is not taking such a low-key approach .
the christian voice lobby group has filed a complaint with the advertising standards authority -lrb- asa -rrb- , saying the ads breach its codes on substantiation and truthfulness . " -lrb- the message -rrb- is given as a statement of fact and that means it must be capable of substantiation if it is not to break the rules , " said stephen green , the group 's national director . " there is plenty of evidence for god , from people 's personal experience , to the complexity , interdependence , beauty and design of the natural world . " but british humanist association head hanne stinson said it , for one , was not taking the complaint very seriously . " i 've sought advice from some of our key people here , but i 'm afraid all i 've got out of them so far is peals of laughter , " she said . the asa said it has acknowledged the complaint and will be assessing it over the next few days . dw staff -lrb- mrm / jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

posters featuring quotations from prominent figures known to have endorsed atheism - such as albert einstein , douglas adams and katharine hepburn - are to be placed on london underground stations .
the words " that it will never come again is what makes life so sweet " are quoted from the poet emily dickinson .
the idea bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tv comedy writer ariane sherine helped come up with the idea tv comedy writer ariane sherine said her idea for an atheist publicity campaign was born out of anger at a christian advertising campaign on london buses this summer .
those who followed the " jesus said " campaign to its website were told that non-christians " will be condemned to everlasting separation from god and then you spend all eternity in torment in hell . "
sherine said she believed that a lot of people had been outraged by the evangelical advertisements , without knowing what to do about it .
" our rational slogan will hopefully reassure anyone who has been scared by this kind of evangelism , " she said on launching the atheist campaign .
" i hope they 'll brighten people 's days and make them smile on their way to work . "
sherine said support for a fund-raising drive to finance the adverts had exceeded all expectations , with donations totalling 156,000 euros -lrb- $ 210,000 -rrb- , as opposed to the original target of 6,000 euros -lrb- $ 8,200 -rrb- .
branching out as the campaign starts rolling , there is every indication that it could go global , sherine wrote in the british daily the guardian .
in spain , the union of atheists and freethinkers has launched buses with a translation of the slogan in the northern city of barcelona , and italy 's union of atheists , agnostics and rationalists was also planning to roll out atheist buses .
in the us , the american humanist association had been inspired to run a similar campaign on buses in washington , but in australia , a bus advertising scheme by the atheist foundation had been rejected by the country 's biggest outdoor advertising company .
church leaders react bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the italian version of the slogan could will soon be seen on buses in rome in britain , where the bha says up to 40 per cent of the population have " non-religious beliefs , " the atheist poster campaign has met with a measured response from church leaders .
" we would defend the right of any group representing a religious or philosophical position to be able to promote that view through appropriate channels , " said a spokesman for the mainstream church of england .
" however , christian belief is not about worrying or not enjoying life , " he added .
the methodist church welcomed the atheist bus campaign as " an opportunity to talk about the deepest questions in life . "
it could open up a dialogue between christians and atheists which would " allow misconceptions to be challenged , " said the methodist church .
professor dawkins , however , said he would have preferred the main slogan to read : " there 's certainly no god " instead of : " there 's probably no god . "
complaint but at least one christian group is not taking such a low-key approach .
the christian voice lobby group has filed a complaint with the advertising standards authority -lrb- asa -rrb- , saying the ads breach its codes on substantiation and truthfulness . " -lrb- the message -rrb- is given as a statement of fact and that means it must be capable of substantiation if it is not to break the rules , " said stephen green , the group 's national director . " there is plenty of evidence for god , from people 's personal experience , to the complexity , interdependence , beauty and design of the natural world . " but british humanist association head hanne stinson said it , for one , was not taking the complaint very seriously . " i 've sought advice from some of our key people here , but i 'm afraid all i 've got out of them so far is peals of laughter , " she said . the asa said it has acknowledged the complaint and will be assessing it over the next few days . dw staff -lrb- mrm / jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

other parties in the governing coalition are expected to follow . the 10-point-plan , agreed upon on saturday , jan 10 , by the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- in the central city of erfurt , is aimed at shoring up the economy and helping merkel 's campaign for chancellor later this year .
she faces re-election in september . the plan is expected to cost up to 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 68 billion -rrb- over the next two years , and will include investments in schools and infrastructure projects to protect jobs . the plan will also set up a " germany fund " which will help struggling firms get credit .
it could offer guarantees up to 100 billion euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one focus will be on infrastructure projects taxes and health insurance contributions would be lowered and a change in the car taxation system from july would provide drivers incentives to switch to fuel-efficient vehicles . it would raise the threshold for income tax and reform the system to make sure taxpayers are not automatically bumped into higher tax brackets even if their real incomes have not grown . there would also be a program to extend broadband internet access . second time 's a charm ? merkel 's conservatives and her governing coalition partners , the social democrats , launched a first stimulus package in november .
but it was widely criticized as being too meager .
while berlin said the package was worth 31 billion euros -lrb- $ 42 billion -rrb- , many countered that the numbers were massaged and it really amounted to much less . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany could see a severe economic contraction in 2009 the final amount of this second package will only become clear after merkel 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , and the spd agree on the plan in the coming days . speaking in erfurt , merkel said it was unclear how europe 's biggest economy , currently in recession , would perform over the coming year . " i ca n't give you any binding answers , " she said after the cdu agreed on the plan . many analysts has said they predict the german economy will contract by a record margin this year , with some saying gdp could shrink by four percent or even more .
that would be an unwelcome record , since the german economy has never contracted by as much as one percent over a full year since world war two . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now atheists in in britain 's capital are having their own say .
one christian group has complained . for many londoners , queuing for a tardy red double-decker bus may on occasions have prompted the utterance of a swear word or raised doubts about the existence of a deity altogether .
from this week , those with lingering doubts will have their views confirmed in an atheist advertising campaign rolled out on 200 of london 's iconic buses , the underground -lrb- tube -rrb- network and transport systems in other major cities .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nato -pipe- 10.01.2009 nato fears european pull-out from afghanistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european forces may be forced to pull-out of afghanistan due to the economic crisis the economic crisis raises the risk that european allies will pull back from afghanistan at a time when president-elect barack obama is expected to reach out to them for help , nato 's supreme commander warned friday . at the same time , general bantz craddock predicted that us forces will be in afghanistan for " at least " a decade , and likely have a presence there for decades to come .
his grim assessment comes as obama prepares to shift the focus of us military operations to afghanistan from iraq to stem an insurgency that has rebounded over the past two years .
craddock said that , although european allies were expecting obama to ask them to do more , " i think it 's going to be harder for them to do it because of decreasing defense budgets . "
he said nato has plans for replacing dutch forces in southern afghanistan in 2010 and the canadians in 2011 .
" the unknown is who else is going to pull out quickly .
we do n't know that .
it 's like in iraq , when nations pulled out without telling anyone ahead time ; it 's a terrible situation , " he told reporters .
the united states has committed to sending an additional 30,000 us troops to afghanistan , nearly doubling us force levels there from 32,000 troops currently .
but the pace of the us build-up has been slowed by continuing military requirements in iraq , where there are still more than 140,000 troops and where commanders insist that conditions remain fragile .
foreign forces needed for at least another three years in afghanistan , the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- has about 50,000 troops , which includes 14,000 us troops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the afghan army wo n't be able to take over for some time craddock said it will be another three years before the shortfall in security requirements there can be filled by the afghan army , and so more foreign forces will be needed to provide security .
" we have to be able to implement our strategy : one , clear out the insurgency ; two , hold ; three , build , " he said .
however , he said that after clearing , " we do n't have enough to hold to allow the build . "
asked whether afghanistan will require a 10-year us military commitment , he said , " at least . "
" maybe not at current force levels but i think we 'll see a presence there for decades , " he added .
drug trade fueling insurgency , says nato general the greatest security challenge is in southern afghanistan , where isaf faces a " very coherent pashtun insurgency " fueled by the trade in drugs from afghan poppies , craddock said .
he said the united nations estimates that insurgents are now getting $ 200 - $ 500 million a year from the drug trade , a big jump from the previous un estimate of $ 60 - $ 100 million a year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : remote controled bombs have become more prevalent " the uptick in ieds , the uptick in suicide bombs , the new numbers we 're seeing would tell me it has to be paid for , " he said , adding that he believes insurgent financing from drugs has at least doubled over the past year to 18 months .
craddock has pushed for , and obtained , authority for isaf to attack drug labs as a way of combating the insurgency .
" the question i 'm asked all the time is , ' are you losing ? ' , " he said .
" no .
we 're not winning fast enough . "
he said european allies have not questioned the requirement for more forces in afghanistan , but are constrained by declining defense budgets , and that is likely to get worse in current financial climate .
currently , only six of 36 nato members meet the alliance 's minimum goal of dedicating two percent of gdp to security , he said .
of those , half have declining defense budgets , he said .
" absent this financial crisis , still we 're challenged .
with this financial crisis , we 're challenged ever more greatly , " he said .
nato 's own advancement hit by crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money is also a factor in modernizing nato forces besides troop contributions to nato operations , tight budgets also are undercutting efforts to modernize nato forces and acquire helicopters , drones and other systems needed in afghanistan , he said .
" so i think we are going to have some hard times ahead .
it 's going to impact , one , the ability of nations to stay in operations , which is probably the most expensive .
two , it may slow down their transformation , " he said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

french television viewers can now watch their favorite prime time shows uninterrupted by ad breaks , but critics say sarkozy ’ s advertising ban on france ’ s public television is an attempt to gain media control . this week a catchy jingle aired right before the news broadcast on the public tv channel france 2 , reminding viewers that from now on , prime time evening programming would start 15 minutes earlier because advertising was being banned .
as of jan .
5 , after 8:00 p.m. there are now no commercials on public television in france and commercials will be phased out entirely by the year 2011 . french president nicolas sarkozy ’ s plan to pull ads as part of a move to restore the quality of the nation ’ s public television was approved by the national assembly towards the end of last year and also allows sarkozy to choose the chief of the french public broadcasting company , france télévisions .
the boss previously was appointed by an independent body . " if we keep commercials we are subjecting ourselves to the tyranny of audience ratings .
and this always means the worst programming dumbed down to lowest levels , " sarkozy said last february while announcing his reform plans .
" that ’ s ok for private stations , but public television must be different .
it must lift people up and excite their curiosity , conscience and intelligence . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does making tv fit for the french start with banning ads ? nex taxes make up for ad losses the new ban will be offset by two new taxes : a 0.9 percent tax on revenue of internet service suppliers and telephone operators , and a tax on advertising revenue of private tv channels ranging from 1.5 to 3 percent . but detractors claim that sarkozy ’ s move to ban ads is really just a camouflaged boost for tf1 , the most widely watched station in france , and which is also owned by martin bouygues , a long-time friend of sarkozy .
such critics expect that tf1 will win much of the advertising lost by france ’ s public networks . jean-francoise tealdi , a union leader at france télévisions , told deutsche welle that sarkozy ’ s reforms will impoverish public broadcasting and compromise its independence . " this is a return to 40 years ago when the political leaders chose the television directors .
back then the public broadcaster didn ’ t serve the people like it does today , " he said .
" it was basically state-run television like in eastern europe .
and that ’ s what mr. sarkozy is taking us back to . " tuning in to " france sarkozvision " ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy seems set on the tried and true bbc as a model for french tv public television staff walked off the job last week to protest the changes and several midday newscasts were scrapped . defending his reform , sarkozy has said that the ban on advertising is a major step toward his goal of modeling french public television on britain ’ s bbc .
but left-leaning newspaper libération has called the president ’ s reform a pretext to turn france télévisions into " france sarkozvision . " dw staff -lrb- ls / eb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 10.01.2009 atheist campaign launched on london buses großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the campaign was partly created as an answer to a christian campaign last year last june london buses were plastered with the phrase " jesus said , " which pointed people to a website warning of hell .
now atheists in in britain 's capital are having their own say .
one christian group has complained . for many londoners , queuing for a tardy red double-decker bus may on occasions have prompted the utterance of a swear word or raised doubts about the existence of a deity altogether .
from this week , those with lingering doubts will have their views confirmed in an atheist advertising campaign rolled out on 200 of london 's iconic buses , the underground -lrb- tube -rrb- network and transport systems in other major cities .
" there 's probably no god .
now stop worrying and enjoy your life , " is the main slogan of the campaign .
it is the brainchild of a television comedy writer and is backed by the british humanist association -lrb- bha -rrb- , as well as the highly regarded evolutionary biologist and prominent atheist richard dawkins , the author of " the god delusion . "
posters featuring quotations from prominent figures known to have endorsed atheism - such as albert einstein , douglas adams and katharine hepburn - are to be placed on london underground stations .
the words " that it will never come again is what makes life so sweet " are quoted from the poet emily dickinson .
the idea bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tv comedy writer ariane sherine helped come up with the idea tv comedy writer ariane sherine said her idea for an atheist publicity campaign was born out of anger at a christian advertising campaign on london buses this summer .
those who followed the " jesus said " campaign to its website were told that non-christians " will be condemned to everlasting separation from god and then you spend all eternity in torment in hell . "
sherine said she believed that a lot of people had been outraged by the evangelical advertisements , without knowing what to do about it .
" our rational slogan will hopefully reassure anyone who has been scared by this kind of evangelism , " she said on launching the atheist campaign .
" i hope they 'll brighten people 's days and make them smile on their way to work . "
sherine said support for a fund-raising drive to finance the adverts had exceeded all expectations , with donations totalling 156,000 euros -lrb- $ 210,000 -rrb- , as opposed to the original target of 6,000 euros -lrb- $ 8,200 -rrb- .
branching out as the campaign starts rolling , there is every indication that it could go global , sherine wrote in the british daily the guardian .
in spain , the union of atheists and freethinkers has launched buses with a translation of the slogan in the northern city of barcelona , and italy 's union of atheists , agnostics and rationalists was also planning to roll out atheist buses .
in the us , the american humanist association had been inspired to run a similar campaign on buses in washington , but in australia , a bus advertising scheme by the atheist foundation had been rejected by the country 's biggest outdoor advertising company .
church leaders react bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the italian version of the slogan could will soon be seen on buses in rome in britain , where the bha says up to 40 per cent of the population have " non-religious beliefs , " the atheist poster campaign has met with a measured response from church leaders .
" we would defend the right of any group representing a religious or philosophical position to be able to promote that view through appropriate channels , " said a spokesman for the mainstream church of england .
" however , christian belief is not about worrying or not enjoying life , " he added .
the methodist church welcomed the atheist bus campaign as " an opportunity to talk about the deepest questions in life . "
it could open up a dialogue between christians and atheists which would " allow misconceptions to be challenged , " said the methodist church .
professor dawkins , however , said he would have preferred the main slogan to read : " there 's certainly no god " instead of : " there 's probably no god . "
complaint but at least one christian group is not taking such a low-key approach .
the christian voice lobby group has filed a complaint with the advertising standards authority -lrb- asa -rrb- , saying the ads breach its codes on substantiation and truthfulness . " -lrb- the message -rrb- is given as a statement of fact and that means it must be capable of substantiation if it is not to break the rules , " said stephen green , the group 's national director . " there is plenty of evidence for god , from people 's personal experience , to the complexity , interdependence , beauty and design of the natural world . " but british humanist association head hanne stinson said it , for one , was not taking the complaint very seriously . " i 've sought advice from some of our key people here , but i 'm afraid all i 've got out of them so far is peals of laughter , " she said . the asa said it has acknowledged the complaint and will be assessing it over the next few days . dw staff -lrb- mrm / jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" despite all the efforts that have been made , the crisis is worsening , " putin said as he began talks withtopolanek , whose country represents the european union . " it is the ukrainian leadership that is making it worse , " putin added . putin , flanked by top russian officials including deputy prime minister igor sechin , alexei miller , head of gas giant gazprom , and energy minister sergei shmatko , said kiev had brought about a " gas blockade " of europe . " nonetheless we will try " to resolve the crisis , he said . russia cut off gas to ukraine on january 1 over a contractual dispute .
it later accused ukraine of " stealing " transit gas intended for clients in europe , a charge ukraine denied . russia cut off all gas through the network a week later , saying it was forced to do so after ukraine closed all routes in its territory for transport of russian gas to europe . " we hope you can convince the ukrainian party to sign the document " that sets terms for sending international , independent monitors to key gas pipeline sites to verify flows of russian gas through ukrainian territory . topolanek indicated that the uneasy relationship between ukraine 's president , viktor yushchenko , and its prime minister , julia timoshenko , was playing a role in the gas crisis , but claimed to have solved the problem . " we have managed to overcome the rift between the ukrainian president and the prime minister , " topolanek said as he was greeted by putin at the russian prime minister 's country home . putin replied : " you have done the impossible . " the czech prime minister also said he would not leave the region until russian gas again began to flow through ukraine to customers in europe . " i have sent a signal to ukrainian leaders that i will stay in the region until we get the gas flowing , " topolanek said at the meeting with putin . topolanek already had talks late friday with ukrainian president viktor yushchenko and prime minister julia timoshenko . the two ukrainian leaders , in a rare show of public solidarity , jointly met toplanek to discuss an eu observer mission sent to ukraine to assist in resolving the stand-off . the eu has urged russia immediately to restore gas supplies to europe after satisfying one of moscow 's key demands in the gas dispute by sending a team of observers to ukraine . but the taps remained shut as representatives of the two countries ' state-owned monopolies , gazprom and naftogaz , worked to hammer out details on the observers ' mission , while publicly exchanging accusations that the other was causing more delays . a deal brokered by the eu on thursday and friday still hung in the balance as gazprom and naftogaz failed to reach a written agreement on the deployment of additional russian and ukrainian observers to each other 's territory . eu observers in place bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's demands have been met now the eu wants its gas the eu mission , initially consisting of 18 senior eu officials and experts from the european gas industry , is tasked with verifying that no russian gas is siphoned off by ukraine while on its way to european customers . an advance team of eight eu technicians , led by filip cornelius , a senior european commission official , was on the ground in kyiv . cornelius made clear restoration of gas supplies to europe would take time , and - equally importantly - political will on the part of russia and ukraine . the eu observers could technically begin trips to pipelines as early as saturday , but a large number of " organizational issues " remained to be resolved before gas could flow , he said . the eu observers are to act as independent monitors at the six main natural-gas pipeline crossing points from russia to ukraine , and at the naftogaz headquarters . czech pm wants the gas to flow as soon as possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : topolanek hoped to get the taps turned on as europe shivers eu member states in central and southern europe continued to be hard hit by russia 's shut-off of all gas supplies through ukraine , with slovakia relying on gas supplies from poland and eu neighbor serbia seeking emergency help from germany , austria and hungary . by far the most critical situation , though , is faced by non-eu members serbia , bosnia-herzegovina , macedonia and moldova , which have no reserves left . other seriously affected eu countries such as greece , austria , the czech republic , slovenia , hungary , poland and romania , either have reserves that can last several weeks or have been able to resort to alternative sources of energy , eu officials said in a statement . about a quarter of the eu 's gas needs are met by russian gas , 80 per cent of which reaches european clients via ukraine . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his grim assessment comes as obama prepares to shift the focus of us military operations to afghanistan from iraq to stem an insurgency that has rebounded over the past two years .
craddock said that , although european allies were expecting obama to ask them to do more , " i think it 's going to be harder for them to do it because of decreasing defense budgets . "
he said nato has plans for replacing dutch forces in southern afghanistan in 2010 and the canadians in 2011 .
" the unknown is who else is going to pull out quickly .
we do n't know that .
it 's like in iraq , when nations pulled out without telling anyone ahead time ; it 's a terrible situation , " he told reporters .
the united states has committed to sending an additional 30,000 us troops to afghanistan , nearly doubling us force levels there from 32,000 troops currently .
but the pace of the us build-up has been slowed by continuing military requirements in iraq , where there are still more than 140,000 troops and where commanders insist that conditions remain fragile .
foreign forces needed for at least another three years in afghanistan , the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- has about 50,000 troops , which includes 14,000 us troops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the afghan army wo n't be able to take over for some time craddock said it will be another three years before the shortfall in security requirements there can be filled by the afghan army , and so more foreign forces will be needed to provide security .
" we have to be able to implement our strategy : one , clear out the insurgency ; two , hold ; three , build , " he said .
however , he said that after clearing , " we do n't have enough to hold to allow the build . "
asked whether afghanistan will require a 10-year us military commitment , he said , " at least . "
" maybe not at current force levels but i think we 'll see a presence there for decades , " he added .
drug trade fueling insurgency , says nato general the greatest security challenge is in southern afghanistan , where isaf faces a " very coherent pashtun insurgency " fueled by the trade in drugs from afghan poppies , craddock said .

his grim assessment comes as obama prepares to shift the focus of us military operations to afghanistan from iraq to stem an insurgency that has rebounded over the past two years .
craddock said that , although european allies were expecting obama to ask them to do more , " i think it 's going to be harder for them to do it because of decreasing defense budgets . "
he said nato has plans for replacing dutch forces in southern afghanistan in 2010 and the canadians in 2011 .
" the unknown is who else is going to pull out quickly .
we do n't know that .
it 's like in iraq , when nations pulled out without telling anyone ahead time ; it 's a terrible situation , " he told reporters .
the united states has committed to sending an additional 30,000 us troops to afghanistan , nearly doubling us force levels there from 32,000 troops currently .
but the pace of the us build-up has been slowed by continuing military requirements in iraq , where there are still more than 140,000 troops and where commanders insist that conditions remain fragile .
foreign forces needed for at least another three years in afghanistan , the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- has about 50,000 troops , which includes 14,000 us troops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the afghan army wo n't be able to take over for some time craddock said it will be another three years before the shortfall in security requirements there can be filled by the afghan army , and so more foreign forces will be needed to provide security .
" we have to be able to implement our strategy : one , clear out the insurgency ; two , hold ; three , build , " he said .
however , he said that after clearing , " we do n't have enough to hold to allow the build . "
asked whether afghanistan will require a 10-year us military commitment , he said , " at least . "
" maybe not at current force levels but i think we 'll see a presence there for decades , " he added .
drug trade fueling insurgency , says nato general the greatest security challenge is in southern afghanistan , where isaf faces a " very coherent pashtun insurgency " fueled by the trade in drugs from afghan poppies , craddock said .

his grim assessment comes as obama prepares to shift the focus of us military operations to afghanistan from iraq to stem an insurgency that has rebounded over the past two years .
craddock said that , although european allies were expecting obama to ask them to do more , " i think it 's going to be harder for them to do it because of decreasing defense budgets . "
he said nato has plans for replacing dutch forces in southern afghanistan in 2010 and the canadians in 2011 .
" the unknown is who else is going to pull out quickly .
we do n't know that .
it 's like in iraq , when nations pulled out without telling anyone ahead time ; it 's a terrible situation , " he told reporters .
the united states has committed to sending an additional 30,000 us troops to afghanistan , nearly doubling us force levels there from 32,000 troops currently .
but the pace of the us build-up has been slowed by continuing military requirements in iraq , where there are still more than 140,000 troops and where commanders insist that conditions remain fragile .
foreign forces needed for at least another three years in afghanistan , the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- has about 50,000 troops , which includes 14,000 us troops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the afghan army wo n't be able to take over for some time craddock said it will be another three years before the shortfall in security requirements there can be filled by the afghan army , and so more foreign forces will be needed to provide security .
" we have to be able to implement our strategy : one , clear out the insurgency ; two , hold ; three , build , " he said .
however , he said that after clearing , " we do n't have enough to hold to allow the build . "
asked whether afghanistan will require a 10-year us military commitment , he said , " at least . "
" maybe not at current force levels but i think we 'll see a presence there for decades , " he added .
drug trade fueling insurgency , says nato general the greatest security challenge is in southern afghanistan , where isaf faces a " very coherent pashtun insurgency " fueled by the trade in drugs from afghan poppies , craddock said .
he said the united nations estimates that insurgents are now getting $ 200 - $ 500 million a year from the drug trade , a big jump from the previous un estimate of $ 60 - $ 100 million a year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : remote controled bombs have become more prevalent " the uptick in ieds , the uptick in suicide bombs , the new numbers we 're seeing would tell me it has to be paid for , " he said , adding that he believes insurgent financing from drugs has at least doubled over the past year to 18 months .
craddock has pushed for , and obtained , authority for isaf to attack drug labs as a way of combating the insurgency .
" the question i 'm asked all the time is , ' are you losing ? ' , " he said .
" no .
we 're not winning fast enough . "
he said european allies have not questioned the requirement for more forces in afghanistan , but are constrained by declining defense budgets , and that is likely to get worse in current financial climate .
currently , only six of 36 nato members meet the alliance 's minimum goal of dedicating two percent of gdp to security , he said .
of those , half have declining defense budgets , he said .
" absent this financial crisis , still we 're challenged .
with this financial crisis , we 're challenged ever more greatly , " he said .
nato 's own advancement hit by crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money is also a factor in modernizing nato forces besides troop contributions to nato operations , tight budgets also are undercutting efforts to modernize nato forces and acquire helicopters , drones and other systems needed in afghanistan , he said .
" so i think we are going to have some hard times ahead .
it 's going to impact , one , the ability of nations to stay in operations , which is probably the most expensive .
two , it may slow down their transformation , " he said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

french television viewers can now watch their favorite prime time shows uninterrupted by ad breaks , but critics say sarkozy ’ s advertising ban on france ’ s public television is an attempt to gain media control . this week a catchy jingle aired right before the news broadcast on the public tv channel france 2 , reminding viewers that from now on , prime time evening programming would start 15 minutes earlier because advertising was being banned .
as of jan .
5 , after 8:00 p.m. there are now no commercials on public television in france and commercials will be phased out entirely by the year 2011 . french president nicolas sarkozy ’ s plan to pull ads as part of a move to restore the quality of the nation ’ s public television was approved by the national assembly towards the end of last year and also allows sarkozy to choose the chief of the french public broadcasting company , france télévisions .
the boss previously was appointed by an independent body . " if we keep commercials we are subjecting ourselves to the tyranny of audience ratings .
and this always means the worst programming dumbed down to lowest levels , " sarkozy said last february while announcing his reform plans .

french television viewers can now watch their favorite prime time shows uninterrupted by ad breaks , but critics say sarkozy ’ s advertising ban on france ’ s public television is an attempt to gain media control . this week a catchy jingle aired right before the news broadcast on the public tv channel france 2 , reminding viewers that from now on , prime time evening programming would start 15 minutes earlier because advertising was being banned .
as of jan .
5 , after 8:00 p.m. there are now no commercials on public television in france and commercials will be phased out entirely by the year 2011 . french president nicolas sarkozy ’ s plan to pull ads as part of a move to restore the quality of the nation ’ s public television was approved by the national assembly towards the end of last year and also allows sarkozy to choose the chief of the french public broadcasting company , france télévisions .
the boss previously was appointed by an independent body . " if we keep commercials we are subjecting ourselves to the tyranny of audience ratings .
and this always means the worst programming dumbed down to lowest levels , " sarkozy said last february while announcing his reform plans .
" that ’ s ok for private stations , but public television must be different .
it must lift people up and excite their curiosity , conscience and intelligence . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does making tv fit for the french start with banning ads ? nex taxes make up for ad losses the new ban will be offset by two new taxes : a 0.9 percent tax on revenue of internet service suppliers and telephone operators , and a tax on advertising revenue of private tv channels ranging from 1.5 to 3 percent . but detractors claim that sarkozy ’ s move to ban ads is really just a camouflaged boost for tf1 , the most widely watched station in france , and which is also owned by martin bouygues , a long-time friend of sarkozy .
such critics expect that tf1 will win much of the advertising lost by france ’ s public networks . jean-francoise tealdi , a union leader at france télévisions , told deutsche welle that sarkozy ’ s reforms will impoverish public broadcasting and compromise its independence . " this is a return to 40 years ago when the political leaders chose the television directors .
back then the public broadcaster didn ’ t serve the people like it does today , " he said .

" abbas said the initiative is the main mechanism by which thursday 's un security council resolution for a ceasefire in the gaza strip could be put into action . he noted that so far the security council resolution unfortunately had not yet had any immediate impact .

his grim assessment comes as obama prepares to shift the focus of us military operations to afghanistan from iraq to stem an insurgency that has rebounded over the past two years .
craddock said that , although european allies were expecting obama to ask them to do more , " i think it 's going to be harder for them to do it because of decreasing defense budgets . "
he said nato has plans for replacing dutch forces in southern afghanistan in 2010 and the canadians in 2011 .
" the unknown is who else is going to pull out quickly .
we do n't know that .
it 's like in iraq , when nations pulled out without telling anyone ahead time ; it 's a terrible situation , " he told reporters .
the united states has committed to sending an additional 30,000 us troops to afghanistan , nearly doubling us force levels there from 32,000 troops currently .
but the pace of the us build-up has been slowed by continuing military requirements in iraq , where there are still more than 140,000 troops and where commanders insist that conditions remain fragile .

his grim assessment comes as obama prepares to shift the focus of us military operations to afghanistan from iraq to stem an insurgency that has rebounded over the past two years .
craddock said that , although european allies were expecting obama to ask them to do more , " i think it 's going to be harder for them to do it because of decreasing defense budgets . "
he said nato has plans for replacing dutch forces in southern afghanistan in 2010 and the canadians in 2011 .
" the unknown is who else is going to pull out quickly .
we do n't know that .
it 's like in iraq , when nations pulled out without telling anyone ahead time ; it 's a terrible situation , " he told reporters .
the united states has committed to sending an additional 30,000 us troops to afghanistan , nearly doubling us force levels there from 32,000 troops currently .
but the pace of the us build-up has been slowed by continuing military requirements in iraq , where there are still more than 140,000 troops and where commanders insist that conditions remain fragile .

now atheists in in britain 's capital are having their own say .
one christian group has complained . for many londoners , queuing for a tardy red double-decker bus may on occasions have prompted the utterance of a swear word or raised doubts about the existence of a deity altogether .
from this week , those with lingering doubts will have their views confirmed in an atheist advertising campaign rolled out on 200 of london 's iconic buses , the underground -lrb- tube -rrb- network and transport systems in other major cities .
" there 's probably no god .
now stop worrying and enjoy your life , " is the main slogan of the campaign .
it is the brainchild of a television comedy writer and is backed by the british humanist association -lrb- bha -rrb- , as well as the highly regarded evolutionary biologist and prominent atheist richard dawkins , the author of " the god delusion . "
posters featuring quotations from prominent figures known to have endorsed atheism - such as albert einstein , douglas adams and katharine hepburn - are to be placed on london underground stations .
the words " that it will never come again is what makes life so sweet " are quoted from the poet emily dickinson .
the idea bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tv comedy writer ariane sherine helped come up with the idea tv comedy writer ariane sherine said her idea for an atheist publicity campaign was born out of anger at a christian advertising campaign on london buses this summer .
those who followed the " jesus said " campaign to its website were told that non-christians " will be condemned to everlasting separation from god and then you spend all eternity in torment in hell . "
sherine said she believed that a lot of people had been outraged by the evangelical advertisements , without knowing what to do about it .
" our rational slogan will hopefully reassure anyone who has been scared by this kind of evangelism , " she said on launching the atheist campaign .
" i hope they 'll brighten people 's days and make them smile on their way to work . "
sherine said support for a fund-raising drive to finance the adverts had exceeded all expectations , with donations totalling 156,000 euros -lrb- $ 210,000 -rrb- , as opposed to the original target of 6,000 euros -lrb- $ 8,200 -rrb- .

" we would defend the right of any group representing a religious or philosophical position to be able to promote that view through appropriate channels , " said a spokesman for the mainstream church of england .
" however , christian belief is not about worrying or not enjoying life , " he added .
the methodist church welcomed the atheist bus campaign as " an opportunity to talk about the deepest questions in life . "
it could open up a dialogue between christians and atheists which would " allow misconceptions to be challenged , " said the methodist church .

some died in suicide bombings in iraq , while others were unable to get there and returned to spain , where they encourage others to follow their example , according to the daily . almost 50 percent of suspects released in 2007 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turnover of arrests and releases in spain is high despite such evidence of the presence of potential terrorists in spain , spanish courts acquitted 31 of the 63 people who were tried on charges linked to islamist terrorism in 2007 . the supreme court has overturned several such high-profile verdicts handed out by the national court in the recent years . it reduced the sentence of abu dahdah from 27 to 12 years , acquitted three others among a total of 18 whom the national court had convicted in the case , and acquitted four of the 21 people who had been sentenced for the madrid train bombings . the supreme court also acquitted 15 of the 20 people who had been sentenced for belonging to an extremist cell and planning attacks including a plot to blow up the national court . that acquittal , in october 2008 , caused concern among police who regarded the suspects as very dangerous . questions over exaggerated threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are concerns that the terror threat is exaggerated with media attention focusing on islamist terrorists rather than the overwhelming majority of peaceful muslims living in spain , the acquittals raise the question whether the threat is being exaggerated , but the public prosecutor 's office does not believe that to be the case . the acquittals were demonstrative of the " enormous legal difficulties " of proving that a suspect was dangerous , the prosecutors said in a 2008 report . potential terrorists usually belong to small cells which act independently , making obtaining proof even harder , according to police experts . there have been no significant islamist attacks in spain since the madrid train bombings , the prosecutors conceded , but warned that the difficulty of jailing suspects hampered preventative action by police . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now atheists in in britain 's capital are having their own say .
one christian group has complained . for many londoners , queuing for a tardy red double-decker bus may on occasions have prompted the utterance of a swear word or raised doubts about the existence of a deity altogether .
from this week , those with lingering doubts will have their views confirmed in an atheist advertising campaign rolled out on 200 of london 's iconic buses , the underground -lrb- tube -rrb- network and transport systems in other major cities .
" there 's probably no god .
now stop worrying and enjoy your life , " is the main slogan of the campaign .
it is the brainchild of a television comedy writer and is backed by the british humanist association -lrb- bha -rrb- , as well as the highly regarded evolutionary biologist and prominent atheist richard dawkins , the author of " the god delusion . "
posters featuring quotations from prominent figures known to have endorsed atheism - such as albert einstein , douglas adams and katharine hepburn - are to be placed on london underground stations .
the words " that it will never come again is what makes life so sweet " are quoted from the poet emily dickinson .
the idea bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tv comedy writer ariane sherine helped come up with the idea tv comedy writer ariane sherine said her idea for an atheist publicity campaign was born out of anger at a christian advertising campaign on london buses this summer .
those who followed the " jesus said " campaign to its website were told that non-christians " will be condemned to everlasting separation from god and then you spend all eternity in torment in hell . "
sherine said she believed that a lot of people had been outraged by the evangelical advertisements , without knowing what to do about it .
" our rational slogan will hopefully reassure anyone who has been scared by this kind of evangelism , " she said on launching the atheist campaign .
" i hope they 'll brighten people 's days and make them smile on their way to work . "
sherine said support for a fund-raising drive to finance the adverts had exceeded all expectations , with donations totalling 156,000 euros -lrb- $ 210,000 -rrb- , as opposed to the original target of 6,000 euros -lrb- $ 8,200 -rrb- .
branching out as the campaign starts rolling , there is every indication that it could go global , sherine wrote in the british daily the guardian .
in spain , the union of atheists and freethinkers has launched buses with a translation of the slogan in the northern city of barcelona , and italy 's union of atheists , agnostics and rationalists was also planning to roll out atheist buses .
in the us , the american humanist association had been inspired to run a similar campaign on buses in washington , but in australia , a bus advertising scheme by the atheist foundation had been rejected by the country 's biggest outdoor advertising company .
church leaders react bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the italian version of the slogan could will soon be seen on buses in rome in britain , where the bha says up to 40 per cent of the population have " non-religious beliefs , " the atheist poster campaign has met with a measured response from church leaders .
" we would defend the right of any group representing a religious or philosophical position to be able to promote that view through appropriate channels , " said a spokesman for the mainstream church of england .
" however , christian belief is not about worrying or not enjoying life , " he added .
the methodist church welcomed the atheist bus campaign as " an opportunity to talk about the deepest questions in life . "
it could open up a dialogue between christians and atheists which would " allow misconceptions to be challenged , " said the methodist church .
professor dawkins , however , said he would have preferred the main slogan to read : " there 's certainly no god " instead of : " there 's probably no god . "
complaint but at least one christian group is not taking such a low-key approach .
the christian voice lobby group has filed a complaint with the advertising standards authority -lrb- asa -rrb- , saying the ads breach its codes on substantiation and truthfulness . " -lrb- the message -rrb- is given as a statement of fact and that means it must be capable of substantiation if it is not to break the rules , " said stephen green , the group 's national director . " there is plenty of evidence for god , from people 's personal experience , to the complexity , interdependence , beauty and design of the natural world . " but british humanist association head hanne stinson said it , for one , was not taking the complaint very seriously .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 10.01.2009 atheist campaign launched on london buses großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the campaign was partly created as an answer to a christian campaign last year last june london buses were plastered with the phrase " jesus said , " which pointed people to a website warning of hell .
now atheists in in britain 's capital are having their own say .
one christian group has complained . for many londoners , queuing for a tardy red double-decker bus may on occasions have prompted the utterance of a swear word or raised doubts about the existence of a deity altogether .
from this week , those with lingering doubts will have their views confirmed in an atheist advertising campaign rolled out on 200 of london 's iconic buses , the underground -lrb- tube -rrb- network and transport systems in other major cities .
" there 's probably no god .
now stop worrying and enjoy your life , " is the main slogan of the campaign .
it is the brainchild of a television comedy writer and is backed by the british humanist association -lrb- bha -rrb- , as well as the highly regarded evolutionary biologist and prominent atheist richard dawkins , the author of " the god delusion . "
posters featuring quotations from prominent figures known to have endorsed atheism - such as albert einstein , douglas adams and katharine hepburn - are to be placed on london underground stations .
the words " that it will never come again is what makes life so sweet " are quoted from the poet emily dickinson .
the idea bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tv comedy writer ariane sherine helped come up with the idea tv comedy writer ariane sherine said her idea for an atheist publicity campaign was born out of anger at a christian advertising campaign on london buses this summer .
those who followed the " jesus said " campaign to its website were told that non-christians " will be condemned to everlasting separation from god and then you spend all eternity in torment in hell . "
sherine said she believed that a lot of people had been outraged by the evangelical advertisements , without knowing what to do about it .
" our rational slogan will hopefully reassure anyone who has been scared by this kind of evangelism , " she said on launching the atheist campaign .
" i hope they 'll brighten people 's days and make them smile on their way to work . "
sherine said support for a fund-raising drive to finance the adverts had exceeded all expectations , with donations totalling 156,000 euros -lrb- $ 210,000 -rrb- , as opposed to the original target of 6,000 euros -lrb- $ 8,200 -rrb- .
branching out as the campaign starts rolling , there is every indication that it could go global , sherine wrote in the british daily the guardian .
in spain , the union of atheists and freethinkers has launched buses with a translation of the slogan in the northern city of barcelona , and italy 's union of atheists , agnostics and rationalists was also planning to roll out atheist buses .
in the us , the american humanist association had been inspired to run a similar campaign on buses in washington , but in australia , a bus advertising scheme by the atheist foundation had been rejected by the country 's biggest outdoor advertising company .
church leaders react bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the italian version of the slogan could will soon be seen on buses in rome in britain , where the bha says up to 40 per cent of the population have " non-religious beliefs , " the atheist poster campaign has met with a measured response from church leaders .
" we would defend the right of any group representing a religious or philosophical position to be able to promote that view through appropriate channels , " said a spokesman for the mainstream church of england .
" however , christian belief is not about worrying or not enjoying life , " he added .
the methodist church welcomed the atheist bus campaign as " an opportunity to talk about the deepest questions in life . "
it could open up a dialogue between christians and atheists which would " allow misconceptions to be challenged , " said the methodist church .
professor dawkins , however , said he would have preferred the main slogan to read : " there 's certainly no god " instead of : " there 's probably no god . "

other parties in the governing coalition are expected to follow . the 10-point-plan , agreed upon on saturday , jan 10 , by the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- in the central city of erfurt , is aimed at shoring up the economy and helping merkel 's campaign for chancellor later this year .
she faces re-election in september . the plan is expected to cost up to 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 68 billion -rrb- over the next two years , and will include investments in schools and infrastructure projects to protect jobs . the plan will also set up a " germany fund " which will help struggling firms get credit .
it could offer guarantees up to 100 billion euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one focus will be on infrastructure projects taxes and health insurance contributions would be lowered and a change in the car taxation system from july would provide drivers incentives to switch to fuel-efficient vehicles . it would raise the threshold for income tax and reform the system to make sure taxpayers are not automatically bumped into higher tax brackets even if their real incomes have not grown . there would also be a program to extend broadband internet access . second time 's a charm ? merkel 's conservatives and her governing coalition partners , the social democrats , launched a first stimulus package in november .

" i ca n't give you any binding answers , " she said after the cdu agreed on the plan . many analysts has said they predict the german economy will contract by a record margin this year , with some saying gdp could shrink by four percent or even more .

some died in suicide bombings in iraq , while others were unable to get there and returned to spain , where they encourage others to follow their example , according to the daily . almost 50 percent of suspects released in 2007 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turnover of arrests and releases in spain is high despite such evidence of the presence of potential terrorists in spain , spanish courts acquitted 31 of the 63 people who were tried on charges linked to islamist terrorism in 2007 . the supreme court has overturned several such high-profile verdicts handed out by the national court in the recent years . it reduced the sentence of abu dahdah from 27 to 12 years , acquitted three others among a total of 18 whom the national court had convicted in the case , and acquitted four of the 21 people who had been sentenced for the madrid train bombings . the supreme court also acquitted 15 of the 20 people who had been sentenced for belonging to an extremist cell and planning attacks including a plot to blow up the national court . that acquittal , in october 2008 , caused concern among police who regarded the suspects as very dangerous . questions over exaggerated threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are concerns that the terror threat is exaggerated with media attention focusing on islamist terrorists rather than the overwhelming majority of peaceful muslims living in spain , the acquittals raise the question whether the threat is being exaggerated , but the public prosecutor 's office does not believe that to be the case . the acquittals were demonstrative of the " enormous legal difficulties " of proving that a suspect was dangerous , the prosecutors said in a 2008 report . potential terrorists usually belong to small cells which act independently , making obtaining proof even harder , according to police experts . there have been no significant islamist attacks in spain since the madrid train bombings , the prosecutors conceded , but warned that the difficulty of jailing suspects hampered preventative action by police . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ukraine has suggested the monitors take up observation at the six main pipelines carrying russian gas into ukraine , and at uktransnafta headquarters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian gas giant gazprom has taken a tough position in the gas dispute with ukraine the actual field locations of the eu observers for the monitoring mission had not been made public by late afternoon saturday . the eu observers visiting ukrtransnafta obtained full access to monitoring equipment and company archives , trikolich claimed . russian observers were " welcome " to perform their own independent inspections , he added . the presence of independent observers to watch russian gas exports to europe via ukrainian pipelines was a key pre-condition set by moscow for an end to a total embargo on such shipments , imposed last week . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" despite all the efforts that have been made , the crisis is worsening , " putin said as he began talks withtopolanek , whose country represents the european union . " it is the ukrainian leadership that is making it worse , " putin added . putin , flanked by top russian officials including deputy prime minister igor sechin , alexei miller , head of gas giant gazprom , and energy minister sergei shmatko , said kiev had brought about a " gas blockade " of europe . " nonetheless we will try " to resolve the crisis , he said . russia cut off gas to ukraine on january 1 over a contractual dispute .
it later accused ukraine of " stealing " transit gas intended for clients in europe , a charge ukraine denied . russia cut off all gas through the network a week later , saying it was forced to do so after ukraine closed all routes in its territory for transport of russian gas to europe . " we hope you can convince the ukrainian party to sign the document " that sets terms for sending international , independent monitors to key gas pipeline sites to verify flows of russian gas through ukrainian territory . topolanek indicated that the uneasy relationship between ukraine 's president , viktor yushchenko , and its prime minister , julia timoshenko , was playing a role in the gas crisis , but claimed to have solved the problem . " we have managed to overcome the rift between the ukrainian president and the prime minister , " topolanek said as he was greeted by putin at the russian prime minister 's country home . putin replied : " you have done the impossible . " the czech prime minister also said he would not leave the region until russian gas again began to flow through ukraine to customers in europe . " i have sent a signal to ukrainian leaders that i will stay in the region until we get the gas flowing , " topolanek said at the meeting with putin . topolanek already had talks late friday with ukrainian president viktor yushchenko and prime minister julia timoshenko . the two ukrainian leaders , in a rare show of public solidarity , jointly met toplanek to discuss an eu observer mission sent to ukraine to assist in resolving the stand-off . the eu has urged russia immediately to restore gas supplies to europe after satisfying one of moscow 's key demands in the gas dispute by sending a team of observers to ukraine . but the taps remained shut as representatives of the two countries ' state-owned monopolies , gazprom and naftogaz , worked to hammer out details on the observers ' mission , while publicly exchanging accusations that the other was causing more delays . a deal brokered by the eu on thursday and friday still hung in the balance as gazprom and naftogaz failed to reach a written agreement on the deployment of additional russian and ukrainian observers to each other 's territory . eu observers in place bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's demands have been met now the eu wants its gas the eu mission , initially consisting of 18 senior eu officials and experts from the european gas industry , is tasked with verifying that no russian gas is siphoned off by ukraine while on its way to european customers . an advance team of eight eu technicians , led by filip cornelius , a senior european commission official , was on the ground in kyiv . cornelius made clear restoration of gas supplies to europe would take time , and - equally importantly - political will on the part of russia and ukraine . the eu observers could technically begin trips to pipelines as early as saturday , but a large number of " organizational issues " remained to be resolved before gas could flow , he said . the eu observers are to act as independent monitors at the six main natural-gas pipeline crossing points from russia to ukraine , and at the naftogaz headquarters . czech pm wants the gas to flow as soon as possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : topolanek hoped to get the taps turned on as europe shivers eu member states in central and southern europe continued to be hard hit by russia 's shut-off of all gas supplies through ukraine , with slovakia relying on gas supplies from poland and eu neighbor serbia seeking emergency help from germany , austria and hungary . by far the most critical situation , though , is faced by non-eu members serbia , bosnia-herzegovina , macedonia and moldova , which have no reserves left . other seriously affected eu countries such as greece , austria , the czech republic , slovenia , hungary , poland and romania , either have reserves that can last several weeks or have been able to resort to alternative sources of energy , eu officials said in a statement . about a quarter of the eu 's gas needs are met by russian gas , 80 per cent of which reaches european clients via ukraine . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

french television viewers can now watch their favorite prime time shows uninterrupted by ad breaks , but critics say sarkozy ’ s advertising ban on france ’ s public television is an attempt to gain media control . this week a catchy jingle aired right before the news broadcast on the public tv channel france 2 , reminding viewers that from now on , prime time evening programming would start 15 minutes earlier because advertising was being banned .
as of jan .
5 , after 8:00 p.m. there are now no commercials on public television in france and commercials will be phased out entirely by the year 2011 . french president nicolas sarkozy ’ s plan to pull ads as part of a move to restore the quality of the nation ’ s public television was approved by the national assembly towards the end of last year and also allows sarkozy to choose the chief of the french public broadcasting company , france télévisions .
the boss previously was appointed by an independent body . " if we keep commercials we are subjecting ourselves to the tyranny of audience ratings .
and this always means the worst programming dumbed down to lowest levels , " sarkozy said last february while announcing his reform plans .
" that ’ s ok for private stations , but public television must be different .
it must lift people up and excite their curiosity , conscience and intelligence . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does making tv fit for the french start with banning ads ? nex taxes make up for ad losses the new ban will be offset by two new taxes : a 0.9 percent tax on revenue of internet service suppliers and telephone operators , and a tax on advertising revenue of private tv channels ranging from 1.5 to 3 percent . but detractors claim that sarkozy ’ s move to ban ads is really just a camouflaged boost for tf1 , the most widely watched station in france , and which is also owned by martin bouygues , a long-time friend of sarkozy .
such critics expect that tf1 will win much of the advertising lost by france ’ s public networks . jean-francoise tealdi , a union leader at france télévisions , told deutsche welle that sarkozy ’ s reforms will impoverish public broadcasting and compromise its independence . " this is a return to 40 years ago when the political leaders chose the television directors .
back then the public broadcaster didn ’ t serve the people like it does today , " he said .
" it was basically state-run television like in eastern europe .
and that ’ s what mr. sarkozy is taking us back to . " tuning in to " france sarkozvision " ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy seems set on the tried and true bbc as a model for french tv public television staff walked off the job last week to protest the changes and several midday newscasts were scrapped . defending his reform , sarkozy has said that the ban on advertising is a major step toward his goal of modeling french public television on britain ’ s bbc .
but left-leaning newspaper libération has called the president ’ s reform a pretext to turn france télévisions into " france sarkozvision . " dw staff -lrb- ls / eb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

french television viewers can now watch their favorite prime time shows uninterrupted by ad breaks , but critics say sarkozy ’ s advertising ban on france ’ s public television is an attempt to gain media control . this week a catchy jingle aired right before the news broadcast on the public tv channel france 2 , reminding viewers that from now on , prime time evening programming would start 15 minutes earlier because advertising was being banned .
as of jan .
5 , after 8:00 p.m. there are now no commercials on public television in france and commercials will be phased out entirely by the year 2011 . french president nicolas sarkozy ’ s plan to pull ads as part of a move to restore the quality of the nation ’ s public television was approved by the national assembly towards the end of last year and also allows sarkozy to choose the chief of the french public broadcasting company , france télévisions .
the boss previously was appointed by an independent body . " if we keep commercials we are subjecting ourselves to the tyranny of audience ratings .

such critics expect that tf1 will win much of the advertising lost by france ’ s public networks . jean-francoise tealdi , a union leader at france télévisions , told deutsche welle that sarkozy ’ s reforms will impoverish public broadcasting and compromise its independence . " this is a return to 40 years ago when the political leaders chose the television directors .

some died in suicide bombings in iraq , while others were unable to get there and returned to spain , where they encourage others to follow their example , according to the daily . almost 50 percent of suspects released in 2007 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turnover of arrests and releases in spain is high despite such evidence of the presence of potential terrorists in spain , spanish courts acquitted 31 of the 63 people who were tried on charges linked to islamist terrorism in 2007 . the supreme court has overturned several such high-profile verdicts handed out by the national court in the recent years . it reduced the sentence of abu dahdah from 27 to 12 years , acquitted three others among a total of 18 whom the national court had convicted in the case , and acquitted four of the 21 people who had been sentenced for the madrid train bombings . the supreme court also acquitted 15 of the 20 people who had been sentenced for belonging to an extremist cell and planning attacks including a plot to blow up the national court . that acquittal , in october 2008 , caused concern among police who regarded the suspects as very dangerous . questions over exaggerated threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are concerns that the terror threat is exaggerated with media attention focusing on islamist terrorists rather than the overwhelming majority of peaceful muslims living in spain , the acquittals raise the question whether the threat is being exaggerated , but the public prosecutor 's office does not believe that to be the case . the acquittals were demonstrative of the " enormous legal difficulties " of proving that a suspect was dangerous , the prosecutors said in a 2008 report . potential terrorists usually belong to small cells which act independently , making obtaining proof even harder , according to police experts . there have been no significant islamist attacks in spain since the madrid train bombings , the prosecutors conceded , but warned that the difficulty of jailing suspects hampered preventative action by police . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in ant society , workers normally give up reproducing to care for the queen 's offspring , who are also their brothers and sisters .
the researchers found worker ants that try to reproduce - against convention - produce chemicals that give away their fertility status .
the findings by a us-german team are published in current biology journal .
to test the idea , scientists applied a synthetic compound typical of fertile individuals to non-reproductive worker ants belonging to the species aphaenogaster cockerelli .
in colonies where a queen was present , the workers with the hydrocarbon chemical applied to them were attacked by other ants .
the researchers reported that deceitful ants were bitten , pulled and held by their peers .
but this was not the case in colonies without a queen ant , where workers were free to reproduce .
co-author jurgen liebig of arizona state university in tempe , us , said the hydrocarbon chemicals produced by the cheating ants were an " inherently reliable signal " .
this " reproductive policing " plays an important role in maintaining harmony in the ant world , dr liebig explained .
" the idea that social harmony is dependent on strict systems to prevent and punish cheating individuals seems to apply to most successful societies , " he said .
for cheating to be a successful strategy for some ants , the researchers say , two conditions would need to be satisfied .
firstly , worker ants would need to suppress the hydrocarbon signals on their bodies .
secondly , they would need to continue to express the signal on their eggs , so that their offspring could not be distinguished from those of the queen .
some ant species are known not only to attack cheating workers , but also to destroy their eggs .

in colonies where a queen was present , the workers with the hydrocarbon chemical applied to them were attacked by other ants .
the researchers reported that deceitful ants were bitten , pulled and held by their peers .
but this was not the case in colonies without a queen ant , where workers were free to reproduce .
co-author jurgen liebig of arizona state university in tempe , us , said the hydrocarbon chemicals produced by the cheating ants were an " inherently reliable signal " .
this " reproductive policing " plays an important role in maintaining harmony in the ant world , dr liebig explained .
" the idea that social harmony is dependent on strict systems to prevent and punish cheating individuals seems to apply to most successful societies , " he said .
for cheating to be a successful strategy for some ants , the researchers say , two conditions would need to be satisfied .
firstly , worker ants would need to suppress the hydrocarbon signals on their bodies .
secondly , they would need to continue to express the signal on their eggs , so that their offspring could not be distinguished from those of the queen .
some ant species are known not only to attack cheating workers , but also to destroy their eggs .
