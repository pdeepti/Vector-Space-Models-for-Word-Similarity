the us internet giant has also been barred from digitizating further french works without approval . google 's drive to digitize all the world 's books came to a skidding halt on friday after a paris court ruled that " google had committed acts of copyright violations " by digitizing 4,000 of works from one of france 's biggest publishing houses , la martiniere .
the court ordered google to pay 300,000 euros in damages to the three publishers owned by the la martiniere group and a symbolic sum of one euro to the sne publishers ' association and the sgdl society of authors .
google must also pay an additional 10,000 euro per day for each day the books , or parts that have been digitized , remained in its data-base .
the court ruled that scanning the books and then making this available on the internet online amounted to copyright violations too .
google may now no longer scan any book without the consent of the publisher .
le seuil brought the case three years ago , and demanded compensation of 15 million euros plus 100,000 for every day the court order is not carried out .
google 's decision to digitize the books was " illegal , dangerous and caused prejudice to the publishers , " said yann colin , the plaintiff 's lawyer told the court .
google has said it will immediately appeal the decision .
the online giant has been wanting to create a huge virtual library of all of the world 's books. wl / reu / ape / afpe / dpa editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the deal has been strongly criticized for not setting tough limits on emissions . the outcome of the copenhagen summit has been branded an " abject failure " by environmentalists and " a betrayal " by developing countries . the copenhagen accord , which recognizes the need to limit global temperature increases to two degrees centigrade , was effectively passed after angry discussions at the danish capital 's bella centre . but it prompted criticism for not setting tough , legally binding limits on future climate emissions for the 193 nations present . friends of the earth said the conference had been an " abject failure " , adding that the effects of global warming would be felt most by the poor . " rich countries have condemned millions of the world 's poorest people to hunger , suffering and loss of life as climate change accelerates , " said international group chairman nnimmo bassey adding that the blame rested " squarely on the shoulders of developed nations .

in fact it 's a lot less than one might have expected in one 's worst nightmares . " another expert challenged the setting of temperature targets without limits on emissions . " without any agreed targets for reducing greenhouse gases , one can not limit global warming to two degrees celsius , " said peter lemke , chief climatologist at the alfred wegener institute in bremerhaven . last-minute talks talks had been close to collapse until a last-minute agreement by the us , china , brazil , india and south africa to recognize common goals . the resulting draft was hailed as a " meaningful agreement " by us president barack obama and an " essential beginning " by un secretary general ban ki-moon . among the components of the agreement are pledges on financial aid for tackling the effects of climate change .
the deal was savagely criticized at the proceedings for not doing enough to limit global warming itself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudanese delegate lumumba stanislaus was critical of the deal deal " a betrayal " representative ian fry , from the threatened island state of tuvalu , said " it looks like we are being offered 30 pieces of silver to betray our people and our future .

danish prime minister lars lokke rasmussen , as chairman , ruled that the meeting would " take note " of the agreement – one step short of formal acceptance . china and us blamed china and the us , as the world 's greatest emitters of greenhouse gases , have received the greatest criticism for not accepting tough emissions limits . " this progress did not come easily and we know this progress alone is not enough , " said president obama before leaving the summit .

this is a strong blow to preventing climate change , writes henrik boehme . it 's been almost two years since the climate conference in bali , where plans were made for signing a new climate treaty by december 2009 in copenhagen .
but it was clear months before this year 's meeting that no such agreement would be reached .
copenhagen was an odd conference .
truly everyone attending was in agreement that something must be done to stop climate change .
but conflicting interests got in the way of compromise : the chinese did n't want supervisors in their country ; the europeans did n't want to increase co-2 reduction goals ; the americans did n't want to go too far on any deal .
africans wanted more money , but had a problem with being transparent on how it would be spent .
in the end the conference reached a complete stand-still .
in order to not leave complete empty-handed , a few countries united on a meager agreement .
obama was content to call this deal " unprecedented , " but it was in fact only a trick to prevent the conference from being seen as a complete failure .
it 's not only about climate the results of this conference have widened the gap between the developed and developing world .
meetings such as these offer poorer nations the unique opportunity to discuss their problems on a world stage , and they have done so here with impressive assertiveness .
the conference was not just about climate : it also dealt with the global balance of power and safety and stability around the world .
the problems of this planet were clearly visible through the walls of the 70,000 square-meter conference center as if they were glass .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : henrik boehme , dw economics department for us president barack obama , copenhagen offers no good news .
his last trip in copenhagen was his failed attempt to bring the 2016 olympics to chicago .
now with the stakes much higher , he has failed again .
his speech was good – but others like brazil 's lula da silva were better .
his effort was good , but simply not good enough .
in terms of his leadership , there was little to be seen .
quo vadis , kyoto ?
so how will the world proceed with climate politics ?
whatever trust that had been built between industrial and developing nations is gone .
there now remains one last chance : rich countries , which produce the majority of greenhouse gases , must place themselves on the forefront of the movement without being bogged down by preconditions .
they can no longer just talk about change – they must also make it happen .
climate politics have moved forward but a millimeter in the past two years .
the model the kyoto protocol gave us may not yet be dead .
but the hope that the success of the 1997 conference could somehow be replicated in copenhagen has undeniably disappeared .

this is a strong blow to preventing climate change , writes henrik boehme . it 's been almost two years since the climate conference in bali , where plans were made for signing a new climate treaty by december 2009 in copenhagen .
but it was clear months before this year 's meeting that no such agreement would be reached .
copenhagen was an odd conference .
truly everyone attending was in agreement that something must be done to stop climate change .
but conflicting interests got in the way of compromise : the chinese did n't want supervisors in their country ; the europeans did n't want to increase co-2 reduction goals ; the americans did n't want to go too far on any deal .
africans wanted more money , but had a problem with being transparent on how it would be spent .
in the end the conference reached a complete stand-still .
in order to not leave complete empty-handed , a few countries united on a meager agreement .
obama was content to call this deal " unprecedented , " but it was in fact only a trick to prevent the conference from being seen as a complete failure .
it 's not only about climate the results of this conference have widened the gap between the developed and developing world .
meetings such as these offer poorer nations the unique opportunity to discuss their problems on a world stage , and they have done so here with impressive assertiveness .
the conference was not just about climate : it also dealt with the global balance of power and safety and stability around the world .
the problems of this planet were clearly visible through the walls of the 70,000 square-meter conference center as if they were glass .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : henrik boehme , dw economics department for us president barack obama , copenhagen offers no good news .
his last trip in copenhagen was his failed attempt to bring the 2016 olympics to chicago .
now with the stakes much higher , he has failed again .
his speech was good – but others like brazil 's lula da silva were better .
his effort was good , but simply not good enough .
in terms of his leadership , there was little to be seen .
quo vadis , kyoto ?
so how will the world proceed with climate politics ?
whatever trust that had been built between industrial and developing nations is gone .
there now remains one last chance : rich countries , which produce the majority of greenhouse gases , must place themselves on the forefront of the movement without being bogged down by preconditions .
they can no longer just talk about change – they must also make it happen .
climate politics have moved forward but a millimeter in the past two years .
the model the kyoto protocol gave us may not yet be dead .
but the hope that the success of the 1997 conference could somehow be replicated in copenhagen has undeniably disappeared .

jewish groups say pope pius xii did not do enough to save jewish lives during the second world war . the vatican is at the center of criticism over a move that places former pope pius xii closer to becoming a saint .
pope benedict has approved a decree that recognizes the pontiff , who is accused of doing too little to help europe 's jews during world war ii , as having " heroic virtues . "
the posthumous honor gives the former pope the title " venerable " and places him two steps from full canonization .
pius xi has been accused of turning a blind eye to the nazi genocide of the jews , in a controversy that has strained relations between the vatican and israel .
when a department within the vatican submitted the decree to the pope in 2007 , it was decided that any decision should be postponed for a " period of reflection . "
pope benedict 's latest decision means that pius now needs only to be beatified as the next step before he can be canonized as a saint .
honors " not acceptable " attempts to beatify the former pope had been described as " unacceptable " by israel 's social affairs minister isaac herzog , who says that the vatican 's own laws required action at the time .
" throughout the period of the holocaust , the vatican knew very well what was happening in europe , " herzog told the haaretz newspaper in 2008 .
jews have called on the vatican to open archives on pius and to freeze the process that could make him a saint . they want the documents to be examined by scholars .
defense of pope the current pope , who as a child was a member of the hitler youth , has defended pius .
the vatican maintains that he saved many jews , hiding them in religious institutions , and that he kept silent to avoid aggravating their situation .

jewish groups say pope pius xii did not do enough to save jewish lives during the second world war . the vatican is at the center of criticism over a move that places former pope pius xii closer to becoming a saint .
pope benedict has approved a decree that recognizes the pontiff , who is accused of doing too little to help europe 's jews during world war ii , as having " heroic virtues . "
the posthumous honor gives the former pope the title " venerable " and places him two steps from full canonization .
pius xi has been accused of turning a blind eye to the nazi genocide of the jews , in a controversy that has strained relations between the vatican and israel .
when a department within the vatican submitted the decree to the pope in 2007 , it was decided that any decision should be postponed for a " period of reflection . "
pope benedict 's latest decision means that pius now needs only to be beatified as the next step before he can be canonized as a saint .
honors " not acceptable " attempts to beatify the former pope had been described as " unacceptable " by israel 's social affairs minister isaac herzog , who says that the vatican 's own laws required action at the time .
" throughout the period of the holocaust , the vatican knew very well what was happening in europe , " herzog told the haaretz newspaper in 2008 .
jews have called on the vatican to open archives on pius and to freeze the process that could make him a saint . they want the documents to be examined by scholars .
defense of pope the current pope , who as a child was a member of the hitler youth , has defended pius .
the vatican maintains that he saved many jews , hiding them in religious institutions , and that he kept silent to avoid aggravating their situation .

the us internet giant has also been barred from digitizating further french works without approval . google 's drive to digitize all the world 's books came to a skidding halt on friday after a paris court ruled that " google had committed acts of copyright violations " by digitizing 4,000 of works from one of france 's biggest publishing houses , la martiniere .
the court ordered google to pay 300,000 euros in damages to the three publishers owned by the la martiniere group and a symbolic sum of one euro to the sne publishers ' association and the sgdl society of authors .
google must also pay an additional 10,000 euro per day for each day the books , or parts that have been digitized , remained in its data-base .
the court ruled that scanning the books and then making this available on the internet online amounted to copyright violations too .
google may now no longer scan any book without the consent of the publisher .
le seuil brought the case three years ago , and demanded compensation of 15 million euros plus 100,000 for every day the court order is not carried out .
google 's decision to digitize the books was " illegal , dangerous and caused prejudice to the publishers , " said yann colin , the plaintiff 's lawyer told the court .
google has said it will immediately appeal the decision .
the online giant has been wanting to create a huge virtual library of all of the world 's books. wl / reu / ape / afpe / dpa editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it is not what everyone has hoped for , " ban ki-moon told reporters in copenhagen .
" we will try hard to have this legally binding treaty in 2010 . " " many will say that it lacks ambition , " he admitted .

according to the decision , countries in favor and against the deal would be listed .
under conference rules , decisions by the 193 participating countries are made by consensus .
the summit stopped far from a full endorsement of the plan , which sets a target of limiting global warming to a maximum two degree celsius rise over pre-industrial times and holds out the prospect of $ 100 billion in annual aid from 2020 for developing nations .
however , the plan does not specify greenhouse gas cuts needed to achieve the two celsius goal that is seen as a threshold for dangerous changes such as more floods , droughts , mudslides , sandstorms and rising seas .
ban praises deal united nations secretary-general ban ki-moon praised the deal struck at the summit , while admitting that it did not meet expectations .
" it may not be everything we hoped for , but this decision of the conference of parties is an essential beginning , " ban told reporters .

" the conference decides to take note of the copenhagen accord of december 18 , 2009 , " the chairman of the plenary session of the un climate summit declared on saturday morning . the decision was announced after a marathon plenary session resumed on saturday after talks were adjourned following threats by some developing nations to reject the accord put forward on friday . un secretary general ban ki-moon welcomed the deal as an " essential beginning " , but admitted that it fell short of what many had expected . " it is not what everyone has hoped for , " ban ki-moon told reporters in copenhagen .
" we will try hard to have this legally binding treaty in 2010 . " " many will say that it lacks ambition , " he admitted .
" nonetheless , you have achieved much . "
ban pointed to pledges on financing by wealthy nations to developing states and said that the copenhagen accord would be " immediately operational " as of january 1 . open opposition countries including venezuela , sudan and tuvalu had criticized the deal spearheaded by the united states , china , india , south africa and brazil . opponents said the document , which sets a target of limiting global warming to a maximum 2 degree celsius rise over pre-industrial times and holds out the prospect of $ 100 billion in annual aid from 2020 for developing nations , was too weak . praise and criticism after talks with the leaders of china , india , and south africa , us president barack obama told reporters on friday that " for the first time in history all major economies are taking action against climate change . "
however , he admitted that the deal was " not enough . " climate activists have criticized the us-led deal saying it falls far short of expectations .

the us internet giant has also been barred from digitizating further french works without approval . google 's drive to digitize all the world 's books came to a skidding halt on friday after a paris court ruled that " google had committed acts of copyright violations " by digitizing 4,000 of works from one of france 's biggest publishing houses , la martiniere .
the court ordered google to pay 300,000 euros in damages to the three publishers owned by the la martiniere group and a symbolic sum of one euro to the sne publishers ' association and the sgdl society of authors .
google must also pay an additional 10,000 euro per day for each day the books , or parts that have been digitized , remained in its data-base .
the court ruled that scanning the books and then making this available on the internet online amounted to copyright violations too .
google may now no longer scan any book without the consent of the publisher .
le seuil brought the case three years ago , and demanded compensation of 15 million euros plus 100,000 for every day the court order is not carried out .
google 's decision to digitize the books was " illegal , dangerous and caused prejudice to the publishers , " said yann colin , the plaintiff 's lawyer told the court .
google has said it will immediately appeal the decision .
the online giant has been wanting to create a huge virtual library of all of the world 's books. wl / reu / ape / afpe / dpa editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the court ordered google to pay 300,000 euros in damages to the three publishers owned by the la martiniere group and a symbolic sum of one euro to the sne publishers ' association and the sgdl society of authors .
google must also pay an additional 10,000 euro per day for each day the books , or parts that have been digitized , remained in its data-base .
the court ruled that scanning the books and then making this available on the internet online amounted to copyright violations too .
google may now no longer scan any book without the consent of the publisher .
le seuil brought the case three years ago , and demanded compensation of 15 million euros plus 100,000 for every day the court order is not carried out .

the visit , organized by the serbian authorities and supported by the european commission 's directorate general for enlargement as well as by the embassies of france , italy and germany , symbolically marks the abolition of visas for serbian citizens to travel to the eu .
" these are ordinary people who have done something extraordinary and have so far never seen europe , " bozidar djelic , serbia 's deputy prime minister in charge of european integrations , told a press conference prior to the trip .
travel restrictions were lifted following a november 30 decision by the eu that nationals of macedonia , montenegro and serbia would be able to travel without visa to all its member states , except britain and ireland .
the plane carrying the serbian nationals – selected through the " europe for everyone " competition and who have not had the opportunity to visit the european union before – left belgrade for brussels shortly after midnight local time .
beside brussels , the group will also visit rome , berlin and paris , spending two days in each of the european capitals .
in brussels , the group would meet with european commissioner for enlargement olli rehn , and a number of other officials .
in the macedonian capital , skopje , several thousand people gathered at the main square to celebrate the abolition of visas .

" the conference decides to take note of the copenhagen accord of december 18 , 2009 , " the chairman of the plenary session of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- declared on saturday , swiftly banging down his gavel . after bitter exchanges through the night , the summit chair reportedly forced through the deal using a procedural tool that effectively dropped all obstacles to the copenhagen accord .
according to the decision , countries in favor and against the deal would be listed .
under conference rules , decisions by the 193 participating countries are made by consensus .
the summit stopped far from a full endorsement of the plan , which sets a target of limiting global warming to a maximum two degree celsius rise over pre-industrial times and holds out the prospect of $ 100 billion in annual aid from 2020 for developing nations .
however , the plan does not specify greenhouse gas cuts needed to achieve the two celsius goal that is seen as a threshold for dangerous changes such as more floods , droughts , mudslides , sandstorms and rising seas .
ban praises deal united nations secretary-general ban ki-moon praised the deal struck at the summit , while admitting that it did not meet expectations .
" it may not be everything we hoped for , but this decision of the conference of parties is an essential beginning , " ban told reporters .

this is a strong blow to preventing climate change , writes henrik boehme . it 's been almost two years since the climate conference in bali , where plans were made for signing a new climate treaty by december 2009 in copenhagen .
but it was clear months before this year 's meeting that no such agreement would be reached .
copenhagen was an odd conference .
truly everyone attending was in agreement that something must be done to stop climate change .
but conflicting interests got in the way of compromise : the chinese did n't want supervisors in their country ; the europeans did n't want to increase co-2 reduction goals ; the americans did n't want to go too far on any deal .
africans wanted more money , but had a problem with being transparent on how it would be spent .
in the end the conference reached a complete stand-still .
in order to not leave complete empty-handed , a few countries united on a meager agreement .
obama was content to call this deal " unprecedented , " but it was in fact only a trick to prevent the conference from being seen as a complete failure .
it 's not only about climate the results of this conference have widened the gap between the developed and developing world .
meetings such as these offer poorer nations the unique opportunity to discuss their problems on a world stage , and they have done so here with impressive assertiveness .
the conference was not just about climate : it also dealt with the global balance of power and safety and stability around the world .
the problems of this planet were clearly visible through the walls of the 70,000 square-meter conference center as if they were glass .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : henrik boehme , dw economics department for us president barack obama , copenhagen offers no good news .
his last trip in copenhagen was his failed attempt to bring the 2016 olympics to chicago .
now with the stakes much higher , he has failed again .
his speech was good – but others like brazil 's lula da silva were better .
his effort was good , but simply not good enough .
in terms of his leadership , there was little to be seen .
quo vadis , kyoto ?
so how will the world proceed with climate politics ?
whatever trust that had been built between industrial and developing nations is gone .
there now remains one last chance : rich countries , which produce the majority of greenhouse gases , must place themselves on the forefront of the movement without being bogged down by preconditions .
they can no longer just talk about change – they must also make it happen .
climate politics have moved forward but a millimeter in the past two years .
the model the kyoto protocol gave us may not yet be dead .
but the hope that the success of the 1997 conference could somehow be replicated in copenhagen has undeniably disappeared .

this is a strong blow to preventing climate change , writes henrik boehme . it 's been almost two years since the climate conference in bali , where plans were made for signing a new climate treaty by december 2009 in copenhagen .
but it was clear months before this year 's meeting that no such agreement would be reached .
copenhagen was an odd conference .
truly everyone attending was in agreement that something must be done to stop climate change .
but conflicting interests got in the way of compromise : the chinese did n't want supervisors in their country ; the europeans did n't want to increase co-2 reduction goals ; the americans did n't want to go too far on any deal .
africans wanted more money , but had a problem with being transparent on how it would be spent .
in the end the conference reached a complete stand-still .
in order to not leave complete empty-handed , a few countries united on a meager agreement .
obama was content to call this deal " unprecedented , " but it was in fact only a trick to prevent the conference from being seen as a complete failure .
it 's not only about climate the results of this conference have widened the gap between the developed and developing world .
meetings such as these offer poorer nations the unique opportunity to discuss their problems on a world stage , and they have done so here with impressive assertiveness .
the conference was not just about climate : it also dealt with the global balance of power and safety and stability around the world .
the problems of this planet were clearly visible through the walls of the 70,000 square-meter conference center as if they were glass .

his speech was good – but others like brazil 's lula da silva were better .
his effort was good , but simply not good enough .
in terms of his leadership , there was little to be seen .

so how will the world proceed with climate politics ?
whatever trust that had been built between industrial and developing nations is gone .
there now remains one last chance : rich countries , which produce the majority of greenhouse gases , must place themselves on the forefront of the movement without being bogged down by preconditions .
they can no longer just talk about change – they must also make it happen .
climate politics have moved forward but a millimeter in the past two years .
the model the kyoto protocol gave us may not yet be dead .

jewish groups say pope pius xii did not do enough to save jewish lives during the second world war . the vatican is at the center of criticism over a move that places former pope pius xii closer to becoming a saint .
pope benedict has approved a decree that recognizes the pontiff , who is accused of doing too little to help europe 's jews during world war ii , as having " heroic virtues . "
the posthumous honor gives the former pope the title " venerable " and places him two steps from full canonization .
pius xi has been accused of turning a blind eye to the nazi genocide of the jews , in a controversy that has strained relations between the vatican and israel .
when a department within the vatican submitted the decree to the pope in 2007 , it was decided that any decision should be postponed for a " period of reflection . "
pope benedict 's latest decision means that pius now needs only to be beatified as the next step before he can be canonized as a saint .
honors " not acceptable " attempts to beatify the former pope had been described as " unacceptable " by israel 's social affairs minister isaac herzog , who says that the vatican 's own laws required action at the time .
" throughout the period of the holocaust , the vatican knew very well what was happening in europe , " herzog told the haaretz newspaper in 2008 .
jews have called on the vatican to open archives on pius and to freeze the process that could make him a saint . they want the documents to be examined by scholars .
defense of pope the current pope , who as a child was a member of the hitler youth , has defended pius .
the vatican maintains that he saved many jews , hiding them in religious institutions , and that he kept silent to avoid aggravating their situation .
catholic supporters of pius , who was pope from 1939 to 1958 , have pressed for the process of his sainthood to be accelerated. rc / afp / reuter editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the conference decides to take note of the copenhagen accord of december 18 , 2009 , " the chairman of the plenary session of the un climate summit declared on saturday morning . the decision was announced after a marathon plenary session resumed on saturday after talks were adjourned following threats by some developing nations to reject the accord put forward on friday . un secretary general ban ki-moon welcomed the deal as an " essential beginning " , but admitted that it fell short of what many had expected . " it is not what everyone has hoped for , " ban ki-moon told reporters in copenhagen .
" we will try hard to have this legally binding treaty in 2010 . " " many will say that it lacks ambition , " he admitted .
" nonetheless , you have achieved much . "
ban pointed to pledges on financing by wealthy nations to developing states and said that the copenhagen accord would be " immediately operational " as of january 1 . open opposition countries including venezuela , sudan and tuvalu had criticized the deal spearheaded by the united states , china , india , south africa and brazil . opponents said the document , which sets a target of limiting global warming to a maximum 2 degree celsius rise over pre-industrial times and holds out the prospect of $ 100 billion in annual aid from 2020 for developing nations , was too weak . praise and criticism after talks with the leaders of china , india , and south africa , us president barack obama told reporters on friday that " for the first time in history all major economies are taking action against climate change . "
however , he admitted that the deal was " not enough . " climate activists have criticized the us-led deal saying it falls far short of expectations .
the environmental group friends of the earth branded the summit as an " abject failure " by rich countries which would impact on millions of people in poor countries .
wwf said a gap between rhetoric and reality could cost millions of lives .
greenpeace said the deal cited by obama contained " so many loopholes " it amounted to fraud . rb / afp / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the visit , organized by the serbian authorities and supported by the european commission 's directorate general for enlargement as well as by the embassies of france , italy and germany , symbolically marks the abolition of visas for serbian citizens to travel to the eu .
" these are ordinary people who have done something extraordinary and have so far never seen europe , " bozidar djelic , serbia 's deputy prime minister in charge of european integrations , told a press conference prior to the trip .
travel restrictions were lifted following a november 30 decision by the eu that nationals of macedonia , montenegro and serbia would be able to travel without visa to all its member states , except britain and ireland .
the plane carrying the serbian nationals – selected through the " europe for everyone " competition and who have not had the opportunity to visit the european union before – left belgrade for brussels shortly after midnight local time .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 19.12.2009 opinion : climate fiasco in copenhagen großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the copenhagen summit has widened the gap between rich and poor nations after 12 days of negotiations , the world climate conference in copenhagen has proven a failure .
this is a strong blow to preventing climate change , writes henrik boehme . it 's been almost two years since the climate conference in bali , where plans were made for signing a new climate treaty by december 2009 in copenhagen .
but it was clear months before this year 's meeting that no such agreement would be reached .
copenhagen was an odd conference .
truly everyone attending was in agreement that something must be done to stop climate change .
but conflicting interests got in the way of compromise : the chinese did n't want supervisors in their country ; the europeans did n't want to increase co-2 reduction goals ; the americans did n't want to go too far on any deal .
africans wanted more money , but had a problem with being transparent on how it would be spent .
in the end the conference reached a complete stand-still .
in order to not leave complete empty-handed , a few countries united on a meager agreement .
obama was content to call this deal " unprecedented , " but it was in fact only a trick to prevent the conference from being seen as a complete failure .
it 's not only about climate the results of this conference have widened the gap between the developed and developing world .
meetings such as these offer poorer nations the unique opportunity to discuss their problems on a world stage , and they have done so here with impressive assertiveness .
the conference was not just about climate : it also dealt with the global balance of power and safety and stability around the world .
the problems of this planet were clearly visible through the walls of the 70,000 square-meter conference center as if they were glass .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : henrik boehme , dw economics department for us president barack obama , copenhagen offers no good news .
his last trip in copenhagen was his failed attempt to bring the 2016 olympics to chicago .
now with the stakes much higher , he has failed again .
his speech was good – but others like brazil 's lula da silva were better .
his effort was good , but simply not good enough .
in terms of his leadership , there was little to be seen .
quo vadis , kyoto ?
so how will the world proceed with climate politics ?
whatever trust that had been built between industrial and developing nations is gone .
there now remains one last chance : rich countries , which produce the majority of greenhouse gases , must place themselves on the forefront of the movement without being bogged down by preconditions .
they can no longer just talk about change – they must also make it happen .
climate politics have moved forward but a millimeter in the past two years .
the model the kyoto protocol gave us may not yet be dead .
but the hope that the success of the 1997 conference could somehow be replicated in copenhagen has undeniably disappeared .

" the conference decides to take note of the copenhagen accord of december 18 , 2009 , " the chairman of the plenary session of the un climate summit declared on saturday morning . the decision was announced after a marathon plenary session resumed on saturday after talks were adjourned following threats by some developing nations to reject the accord put forward on friday . un secretary general ban ki-moon welcomed the deal as an " essential beginning " , but admitted that it fell short of what many had expected . " it is not what everyone has hoped for , " ban ki-moon told reporters in copenhagen .
" we will try hard to have this legally binding treaty in 2010 . " " many will say that it lacks ambition , " he admitted .
" nonetheless , you have achieved much . "
ban pointed to pledges on financing by wealthy nations to developing states and said that the copenhagen accord would be " immediately operational " as of january 1 . open opposition countries including venezuela , sudan and tuvalu had criticized the deal spearheaded by the united states , china , india , south africa and brazil . opponents said the document , which sets a target of limiting global warming to a maximum 2 degree celsius rise over pre-industrial times and holds out the prospect of $ 100 billion in annual aid from 2020 for developing nations , was too weak . praise and criticism after talks with the leaders of china , india , and south africa , us president barack obama told reporters on friday that " for the first time in history all major economies are taking action against climate change . "
however , he admitted that the deal was " not enough . " climate activists have criticized the us-led deal saying it falls far short of expectations .

" the conference decides to take note of the copenhagen accord of december 18 , 2009 , " the chairman of the plenary session of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- declared on saturday , swiftly banging down his gavel . after bitter exchanges through the night , the summit chair reportedly forced through the deal using a procedural tool that effectively dropped all obstacles to the copenhagen accord .
according to the decision , countries in favor and against the deal would be listed .
under conference rules , decisions by the 193 participating countries are made by consensus .
the summit stopped far from a full endorsement of the plan , which sets a target of limiting global warming to a maximum two degree celsius rise over pre-industrial times and holds out the prospect of $ 100 billion in annual aid from 2020 for developing nations .
however , the plan does not specify greenhouse gas cuts needed to achieve the two celsius goal that is seen as a threshold for dangerous changes such as more floods , droughts , mudslides , sandstorms and rising seas .
ban praises deal united nations secretary-general ban ki-moon praised the deal struck at the summit , while admitting that it did not meet expectations .
" it may not be everything we hoped for , but this decision of the conference of parties is an essential beginning , " ban told reporters .

"
critics point out that the decision at the 193-nation talks merely " took note " of the new accord , a non-binding deal for combating global warming led by the united states , china , india , brazil and south africa .
however , some experts say the move , which came a day after the climate negotiations were scheduled to end , clears the way for the accord to become operational in practice even though it has not been formally approved by the conference .
brink of collapse earlier , during a stormy overnight session , the talks were on the brink of collapse after sudan , nicaragua , cuba , venezuela and bolivia lined up to denounce the us-led plan following a meeting of about 120 world leaders on friday .
the all-night plenary session , chaired by danish prime minister lars lokke rasmussen , hit a low point when a sudanese delegate said the plan in africa would be like the holocaust .
the outcome may yield the initiative in forming world climate policy to the united states and china , the world 's top two emitters of greenhouse gases .
many nations said the deal fell far short of un ambitions for copenhagen , meant as a turning point to push the world economy towards renewable energies such as hydro , solar and wind power and away from fossil fuels .
european nations were lukewarm to a deal that cut out some goals mentioned previously in draft texts , such as a target of halving world greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 .

this is a strong blow to preventing climate change , writes henrik boehme . it 's been almost two years since the climate conference in bali , where plans were made for signing a new climate treaty by december 2009 in copenhagen .
but it was clear months before this year 's meeting that no such agreement would be reached .
copenhagen was an odd conference .
truly everyone attending was in agreement that something must be done to stop climate change .
but conflicting interests got in the way of compromise : the chinese did n't want supervisors in their country ; the europeans did n't want to increase co-2 reduction goals ; the americans did n't want to go too far on any deal .
africans wanted more money , but had a problem with being transparent on how it would be spent .
in the end the conference reached a complete stand-still .
in order to not leave complete empty-handed , a few countries united on a meager agreement .
obama was content to call this deal " unprecedented , " but it was in fact only a trick to prevent the conference from being seen as a complete failure .
it 's not only about climate the results of this conference have widened the gap between the developed and developing world .
meetings such as these offer poorer nations the unique opportunity to discuss their problems on a world stage , and they have done so here with impressive assertiveness .
the conference was not just about climate : it also dealt with the global balance of power and safety and stability around the world .
the problems of this planet were clearly visible through the walls of the 70,000 square-meter conference center as if they were glass .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : henrik boehme , dw economics department for us president barack obama , copenhagen offers no good news .
his last trip in copenhagen was his failed attempt to bring the 2016 olympics to chicago .
now with the stakes much higher , he has failed again .
his speech was good – but others like brazil 's lula da silva were better .
his effort was good , but simply not good enough .
in terms of his leadership , there was little to be seen .
quo vadis , kyoto ?
so how will the world proceed with climate politics ?
whatever trust that had been built between industrial and developing nations is gone .
there now remains one last chance : rich countries , which produce the majority of greenhouse gases , must place themselves on the forefront of the movement without being bogged down by preconditions .
they can no longer just talk about change – they must also make it happen .
climate politics have moved forward but a millimeter in the past two years .
the model the kyoto protocol gave us may not yet be dead .
but the hope that the success of the 1997 conference could somehow be replicated in copenhagen has undeniably disappeared .

jewish groups say pope pius xii did not do enough to save jewish lives during the second world war . the vatican is at the center of criticism over a move that places former pope pius xii closer to becoming a saint .
pope benedict has approved a decree that recognizes the pontiff , who is accused of doing too little to help europe 's jews during world war ii , as having " heroic virtues . "
the posthumous honor gives the former pope the title " venerable " and places him two steps from full canonization .
pius xi has been accused of turning a blind eye to the nazi genocide of the jews , in a controversy that has strained relations between the vatican and israel .
when a department within the vatican submitted the decree to the pope in 2007 , it was decided that any decision should be postponed for a " period of reflection . "
pope benedict 's latest decision means that pius now needs only to be beatified as the next step before he can be canonized as a saint .
honors " not acceptable " attempts to beatify the former pope had been described as " unacceptable " by israel 's social affairs minister isaac herzog , who says that the vatican 's own laws required action at the time .
" throughout the period of the holocaust , the vatican knew very well what was happening in europe , " herzog told the haaretz newspaper in 2008 .
jews have called on the vatican to open archives on pius and to freeze the process that could make him a saint . they want the documents to be examined by scholars .
defense of pope the current pope , who as a child was a member of the hitler youth , has defended pius .
the vatican maintains that he saved many jews , hiding them in religious institutions , and that he kept silent to avoid aggravating their situation .
catholic supporters of pius , who was pope from 1939 to 1958 , have pressed for the process of his sainthood to be accelerated. rc / afp / reuter editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this is a strong blow to preventing climate change , writes henrik boehme . it 's been almost two years since the climate conference in bali , where plans were made for signing a new climate treaty by december 2009 in copenhagen .
but it was clear months before this year 's meeting that no such agreement would be reached .
copenhagen was an odd conference .
truly everyone attending was in agreement that something must be done to stop climate change .
but conflicting interests got in the way of compromise : the chinese did n't want supervisors in their country ; the europeans did n't want to increase co-2 reduction goals ; the americans did n't want to go too far on any deal .
africans wanted more money , but had a problem with being transparent on how it would be spent .
in the end the conference reached a complete stand-still .
in order to not leave complete empty-handed , a few countries united on a meager agreement .
obama was content to call this deal " unprecedented , " but it was in fact only a trick to prevent the conference from being seen as a complete failure .
it 's not only about climate the results of this conference have widened the gap between the developed and developing world .
meetings such as these offer poorer nations the unique opportunity to discuss their problems on a world stage , and they have done so here with impressive assertiveness .
the conference was not just about climate : it also dealt with the global balance of power and safety and stability around the world .

but the deal has been strongly criticized for not setting tough limits on emissions . the outcome of the copenhagen summit has been branded an " abject failure " by environmentalists and " a betrayal " by developing countries . the copenhagen accord , which recognizes the need to limit global temperature increases to two degrees centigrade , was effectively passed after angry discussions at the danish capital 's bella centre . but it prompted criticism for not setting tough , legally binding limits on future climate emissions for the 193 nations present . friends of the earth said the conference had been an " abject failure " , adding that the effects of global warming would be felt most by the poor . " rich countries have condemned millions of the world 's poorest people to hunger , suffering and loss of life as climate change accelerates , " said international group chairman nnimmo bassey adding that the blame rested " squarely on the shoulders of developed nations .

but the deal has been strongly criticized for not setting tough limits on emissions . the outcome of the copenhagen summit has been branded an " abject failure " by environmentalists and " a betrayal " by developing countries . the copenhagen accord , which recognizes the need to limit global temperature increases to two degrees centigrade , was effectively passed after angry discussions at the danish capital 's bella centre . but it prompted criticism for not setting tough , legally binding limits on future climate emissions for the 193 nations present . friends of the earth said the conference had been an " abject failure " , adding that the effects of global warming would be felt most by the poor . " rich countries have condemned millions of the world 's poorest people to hunger , suffering and loss of life as climate change accelerates , " said international group chairman nnimmo bassey adding that the blame rested " squarely on the shoulders of developed nations . " " fleeing in shame " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the summit was close to collapse during the week greenpeace condemned conference participants for failing to achieve a meaningful deal and likened representatives to criminals " fleeing to the airport in shame . " " world leaders had a once in a generation chance to change the world for good , to avert catastrophic climate change , " said the group 's international head kumi naidoo . development charity oxfam said the accord " could not even be called a deal . " scientists unhappy german climate scientists also voiced their extreme disappointment . " i am utterly disappointed , " said mojib latif of the ifm-geomar leibniz institute for oceanography in kiel .

" the conference decides to take note of the copenhagen accord of december 18 , 2009 , " the chairman of the plenary session of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- declared on saturday , swiftly banging down his gavel . after bitter exchanges through the night , the summit chair reportedly forced through the deal using a procedural tool that effectively dropped all obstacles to the copenhagen accord .
according to the decision , countries in favor and against the deal would be listed .
under conference rules , decisions by the 193 participating countries are made by consensus .
the summit stopped far from a full endorsement of the plan , which sets a target of limiting global warming to a maximum two degree celsius rise over pre-industrial times and holds out the prospect of $ 100 billion in annual aid from 2020 for developing nations .
however , the plan does not specify greenhouse gas cuts needed to achieve the two celsius goal that is seen as a threshold for dangerous changes such as more floods , droughts , mudslides , sandstorms and rising seas .
ban praises deal united nations secretary-general ban ki-moon praised the deal struck at the summit , while admitting that it did not meet expectations .
" it may not be everything we hoped for , but this decision of the conference of parties is an essential beginning , " ban told reporters .

"
critics point out that the decision at the 193-nation talks merely " took note " of the new accord , a non-binding deal for combating global warming led by the united states , china , india , brazil and south africa .
however , some experts say the move , which came a day after the climate negotiations were scheduled to end , clears the way for the accord to become operational in practice even though it has not been formally approved by the conference .
brink of collapse earlier , during a stormy overnight session , the talks were on the brink of collapse after sudan , nicaragua , cuba , venezuela and bolivia lined up to denounce the us-led plan following a meeting of about 120 world leaders on friday .
the all-night plenary session , chaired by danish prime minister lars lokke rasmussen , hit a low point when a sudanese delegate said the plan in africa would be like the holocaust .
the outcome may yield the initiative in forming world climate policy to the united states and china , the world 's top two emitters of greenhouse gases .
many nations said the deal fell far short of un ambitions for copenhagen , meant as a turning point to push the world economy towards renewable energies such as hydro , solar and wind power and away from fossil fuels .
european nations were lukewarm to a deal that cut out some goals mentioned previously in draft texts , such as a target of halving world greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 .

authorities have also placed road blocks in the southern region and mobilized about 40 forensic experts to gather evidence on the museum grounds , said regional police spokesman dariusz nowak .
" this is an absolute priority for the polish police , " said national police spokeswoman grazyna puchalska .
the auschwitz museum has offered a 100,000-zloty reward -lrb- 24,000 euros or $ 34,000 -rrb- for information leading to the discovery of the sign .
polish police have offered an additional 5,000 zlotys .
first serious theft at auschwitz the thieves removed the iron sign by unscrewing it on one side of the gate and pulling it off the other side .
police have said they do not have any leads on the identity of the thieves but they are questioning museum guards and checking security camera footage .
museum spokesman jaroslaw mensfelt said it was the first serious case of theft at auschwitz .
" this was done by someone who knew what they wanted to do , " mensfelt told polish news agency pap .
" they had to know how to enter the museum grounds , how to remove the sign and the routes the guards take . "
a copy of the sign has now been placed on the entrance gate .

polish senate speaker bogdan borusewicz told polish radio that the incident was " deplorable and embarrassing " .
" i hope the police recover the sign soon and that it wo n't have been cut into pieces , " borusewicz said .
deputy foreign minister andrzej kremer told the pap news agency that he was shocked and said the sign was a " key symbol " of auschwitz .

" it 's a criminal act , " he said .
" it ca n't be comprehended any other way . "
outrage in israel there has also been a strong reaction in israel to the incident .
the head of jerusalem 's yad vashem holocaust memorial , avner shalev , called the theft a " declaration of war . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de travel -pipe- 19.12.2009 eu lifts visa requirements for balkan states großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visa forms are a thing of the past for travelers from three balkan states serbian , montenegrin and macedonian nationals can travel visa-free inside the eu 's borderless schengen zone from saturday . a group of 50 serbian nationals left belgrade after midnight for their first visa-free visit to several european union countries .
the visit , organized by the serbian authorities and supported by the european commission 's directorate general for enlargement as well as by the embassies of france , italy and germany , symbolically marks the abolition of visas for serbian citizens to travel to the eu .
" these are ordinary people who have done something extraordinary and have so far never seen europe , " bozidar djelic , serbia 's deputy prime minister in charge of european integrations , told a press conference prior to the trip .
travel restrictions were lifted following a november 30 decision by the eu that nationals of macedonia , montenegro and serbia would be able to travel without visa to all its member states , except britain and ireland .
the plane carrying the serbian nationals – selected through the " europe for everyone " competition and who have not had the opportunity to visit the european union before – left belgrade for brussels shortly after midnight local time .
beside brussels , the group will also visit rome , berlin and paris , spending two days in each of the european capitals .
in brussels , the group would meet with european commissioner for enlargement olli rehn , and a number of other officials .
in the macedonian capital , skopje , several thousand people gathered at the main square to celebrate the abolition of visas .
the macedonian government is also planning to organize a symbolic trip for its citizens .
and in montenegro , the authorities announced a celebratory visit by 100 citizens to rome on sunday .
serbia , macedonia and montenegro are all aspirants for eu membership , but only macedonia has formerly attained the status of a candidate .
serbia says it is currently engaged in talks with the eu and could decide next week on whether to apply for membership .
serbian entry has been stalled due to its failure to arrest ex-bosnian serb general ratko mladic , who has been charged with war crimes. rb / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the court ordered google to pay 300,000 euros in damages to the three publishers owned by the la martiniere group and a symbolic sum of one euro to the sne publishers ' association and the sgdl society of authors .
google must also pay an additional 10,000 euro per day for each day the books , or parts that have been digitized , remained in its data-base .
the court ruled that scanning the books and then making this available on the internet online amounted to copyright violations too .
google may now no longer scan any book without the consent of the publisher .
le seuil brought the case three years ago , and demanded compensation of 15 million euros plus 100,000 for every day the court order is not carried out .

" the conference decides to take note of the copenhagen accord of december 18 , 2009 , " the chairman of the plenary session of the un climate summit declared on saturday morning . the decision was announced after a marathon plenary session resumed on saturday after talks were adjourned following threats by some developing nations to reject the accord put forward on friday . un secretary general ban ki-moon welcomed the deal as an " essential beginning " , but admitted that it fell short of what many had expected . " it is not what everyone has hoped for , " ban ki-moon told reporters in copenhagen .
" we will try hard to have this legally binding treaty in 2010 . " " many will say that it lacks ambition , " he admitted .
" nonetheless , you have achieved much . "
ban pointed to pledges on financing by wealthy nations to developing states and said that the copenhagen accord would be " immediately operational " as of january 1 . open opposition countries including venezuela , sudan and tuvalu had criticized the deal spearheaded by the united states , china , india , south africa and brazil . opponents said the document , which sets a target of limiting global warming to a maximum 2 degree celsius rise over pre-industrial times and holds out the prospect of $ 100 billion in annual aid from 2020 for developing nations , was too weak . praise and criticism after talks with the leaders of china , india , and south africa , us president barack obama told reporters on friday that " for the first time in history all major economies are taking action against climate change . "
however , he admitted that the deal was " not enough . " climate activists have criticized the us-led deal saying it falls far short of expectations .

the visit , organized by the serbian authorities and supported by the european commission 's directorate general for enlargement as well as by the embassies of france , italy and germany , symbolically marks the abolition of visas for serbian citizens to travel to the eu .
" these are ordinary people who have done something extraordinary and have so far never seen europe , " bozidar djelic , serbia 's deputy prime minister in charge of european integrations , told a press conference prior to the trip .
travel restrictions were lifted following a november 30 decision by the eu that nationals of macedonia , montenegro and serbia would be able to travel without visa to all its member states , except britain and ireland .
the plane carrying the serbian nationals – selected through the " europe for everyone " competition and who have not had the opportunity to visit the european union before – left belgrade for brussels shortly after midnight local time .
beside brussels , the group will also visit rome , berlin and paris , spending two days in each of the european capitals .
in brussels , the group would meet with european commissioner for enlargement olli rehn , and a number of other officials .
in the macedonian capital , skopje , several thousand people gathered at the main square to celebrate the abolition of visas .
the macedonian government is also planning to organize a symbolic trip for its citizens .
and in montenegro , the authorities announced a celebratory visit by 100 citizens to rome on sunday .
serbia , macedonia and montenegro are all aspirants for eu membership , but only macedonia has formerly attained the status of a candidate .
serbia says it is currently engaged in talks with the eu and could decide next week on whether to apply for membership .

the visit , organized by the serbian authorities and supported by the european commission 's directorate general for enlargement as well as by the embassies of france , italy and germany , symbolically marks the abolition of visas for serbian citizens to travel to the eu .
" these are ordinary people who have done something extraordinary and have so far never seen europe , " bozidar djelic , serbia 's deputy prime minister in charge of european integrations , told a press conference prior to the trip .
travel restrictions were lifted following a november 30 decision by the eu that nationals of macedonia , montenegro and serbia would be able to travel without visa to all its member states , except britain and ireland .
the plane carrying the serbian nationals – selected through the " europe for everyone " competition and who have not had the opportunity to visit the european union before – left belgrade for brussels shortly after midnight local time .
beside brussels , the group will also visit rome , berlin and paris , spending two days in each of the european capitals .
in brussels , the group would meet with european commissioner for enlargement olli rehn , and a number of other officials .
in the macedonian capital , skopje , several thousand people gathered at the main square to celebrate the abolition of visas .
the macedonian government is also planning to organize a symbolic trip for its citizens .
and in montenegro , the authorities announced a celebratory visit by 100 citizens to rome on sunday .
serbia , macedonia and montenegro are all aspirants for eu membership , but only macedonia has formerly attained the status of a candidate .
serbia says it is currently engaged in talks with the eu and could decide next week on whether to apply for membership .
serbian entry has been stalled due to its failure to arrest ex-bosnian serb general ratko mladic , who has been charged with war crimes. rb / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the conference decides to take note of the copenhagen accord of december 18 , 2009 , " the chairman of the plenary session of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- declared on saturday , swiftly banging down his gavel . after bitter exchanges through the night , the summit chair reportedly forced through the deal using a procedural tool that effectively dropped all obstacles to the copenhagen accord .
according to the decision , countries in favor and against the deal would be listed .
under conference rules , decisions by the 193 participating countries are made by consensus .
the summit stopped far from a full endorsement of the plan , which sets a target of limiting global warming to a maximum two degree celsius rise over pre-industrial times and holds out the prospect of $ 100 billion in annual aid from 2020 for developing nations .
however , the plan does not specify greenhouse gas cuts needed to achieve the two celsius goal that is seen as a threshold for dangerous changes such as more floods , droughts , mudslides , sandstorms and rising seas .
ban praises deal united nations secretary-general ban ki-moon praised the deal struck at the summit , while admitting that it did not meet expectations .
" it may not be everything we hoped for , but this decision of the conference of parties is an essential beginning , " ban told reporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists have slammed the results of the talks as " abject failure " the un chief said that the copenhagen accord would be " immediately operational " as of january 1 , adding : " we will try to have a legally binding treaty as soon as possible in 2010 . "
critics point out that the decision at the 193-nation talks merely " took note " of the new accord , a non-binding deal for combating global warming led by the united states , china , india , brazil and south africa .
however , some experts say the move , which came a day after the climate negotiations were scheduled to end , clears the way for the accord to become operational in practice even though it has not been formally approved by the conference .
brink of collapse earlier , during a stormy overnight session , the talks were on the brink of collapse after sudan , nicaragua , cuba , venezuela and bolivia lined up to denounce the us-led plan following a meeting of about 120 world leaders on friday .
the all-night plenary session , chaired by danish prime minister lars lokke rasmussen , hit a low point when a sudanese delegate said the plan in africa would be like the holocaust .
the outcome may yield the initiative in forming world climate policy to the united states and china , the world 's top two emitters of greenhouse gases .
many nations said the deal fell far short of un ambitions for copenhagen , meant as a turning point to push the world economy towards renewable energies such as hydro , solar and wind power and away from fossil fuels .
european nations were lukewarm to a deal that cut out some goals mentioned previously in draft texts , such as a target of halving world greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 .

" the conference decides to take note of the copenhagen accord of december 18 , 2009 , " the chairman of the plenary session of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- declared on saturday , swiftly banging down his gavel . after bitter exchanges through the night , the summit chair reportedly forced through the deal using a procedural tool that effectively dropped all obstacles to the copenhagen accord .
according to the decision , countries in favor and against the deal would be listed .
under conference rules , decisions by the 193 participating countries are made by consensus .
the summit stopped far from a full endorsement of the plan , which sets a target of limiting global warming to a maximum two degree celsius rise over pre-industrial times and holds out the prospect of $ 100 billion in annual aid from 2020 for developing nations .
however , the plan does not specify greenhouse gas cuts needed to achieve the two celsius goal that is seen as a threshold for dangerous changes such as more floods , droughts , mudslides , sandstorms and rising seas .

"
critics point out that the decision at the 193-nation talks merely " took note " of the new accord , a non-binding deal for combating global warming led by the united states , china , india , brazil and south africa .
however , some experts say the move , which came a day after the climate negotiations were scheduled to end , clears the way for the accord to become operational in practice even though it has not been formally approved by the conference .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 19.12.2009 copenhagen accord is branded " abject failure " by activists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists are disappointed that the deal has not set firm limits after two weeks of discussion in copenhagen , an outline plan to tackle climate change was finally hammered out .
but the deal has been strongly criticized for not setting tough limits on emissions . the outcome of the copenhagen summit has been branded an " abject failure " by environmentalists and " a betrayal " by developing countries . the copenhagen accord , which recognizes the need to limit global temperature increases to two degrees centigrade , was effectively passed after angry discussions at the danish capital 's bella centre . but it prompted criticism for not setting tough , legally binding limits on future climate emissions for the 193 nations present . friends of the earth said the conference had been an " abject failure " , adding that the effects of global warming would be felt most by the poor . " rich countries have condemned millions of the world 's poorest people to hunger , suffering and loss of life as climate change accelerates , " said international group chairman nnimmo bassey adding that the blame rested " squarely on the shoulders of developed nations . " " fleeing in shame " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the summit was close to collapse during the week greenpeace condemned conference participants for failing to achieve a meaningful deal and likened representatives to criminals " fleeing to the airport in shame . " " world leaders had a once in a generation chance to change the world for good , to avert catastrophic climate change , " said the group 's international head kumi naidoo . development charity oxfam said the accord " could not even be called a deal . " scientists unhappy german climate scientists also voiced their extreme disappointment . " i am utterly disappointed , " said mojib latif of the ifm-geomar leibniz institute for oceanography in kiel .
" nothing substantial has come out of this .
in fact it 's a lot less than one might have expected in one 's worst nightmares . " another expert challenged the setting of temperature targets without limits on emissions . " without any agreed targets for reducing greenhouse gases , one can not limit global warming to two degrees celsius , " said peter lemke , chief climatologist at the alfred wegener institute in bremerhaven . last-minute talks talks had been close to collapse until a last-minute agreement by the us , china , brazil , india and south africa to recognize common goals . the resulting draft was hailed as a " meaningful agreement " by us president barack obama and an " essential beginning " by un secretary general ban ki-moon . among the components of the agreement are pledges on financial aid for tackling the effects of climate change .
the deal was savagely criticized at the proceedings for not doing enough to limit global warming itself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudanese delegate lumumba stanislaus was critical of the deal deal " a betrayal " representative ian fry , from the threatened island state of tuvalu , said " it looks like we are being offered 30 pieces of silver to betray our people and our future . " sudanese delegate lumumba stanislas dia-ping said the pact meant " incineration " for africa . the main opposition in the all-night session came from the latin american countries , including nicaragua and venezuela , who claimed it did not go far enough .
danish prime minister lars lokke rasmussen , as chairman , ruled that the meeting would " take note " of the agreement – one step short of formal acceptance . china and us blamed china and the us , as the world 's greatest emitters of greenhouse gases , have received the greatest criticism for not accepting tough emissions limits .

but the deal has been strongly criticized for not setting tough limits on emissions . the outcome of the copenhagen summit has been branded an " abject failure " by environmentalists and " a betrayal " by developing countries . the copenhagen accord , which recognizes the need to limit global temperature increases to two degrees centigrade , was effectively passed after angry discussions at the danish capital 's bella centre . but it prompted criticism for not setting tough , legally binding limits on future climate emissions for the 193 nations present . friends of the earth said the conference had been an " abject failure " , adding that the effects of global warming would be felt most by the poor . " rich countries have condemned millions of the world 's poorest people to hunger , suffering and loss of life as climate change accelerates , " said international group chairman nnimmo bassey adding that the blame rested " squarely on the shoulders of developed nations . " " fleeing in shame " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the summit was close to collapse during the week greenpeace condemned conference participants for failing to achieve a meaningful deal and likened representatives to criminals " fleeing to the airport in shame .

" scientists unhappy german climate scientists also voiced their extreme disappointment . " i am utterly disappointed , " said mojib latif of the ifm-geomar leibniz institute for oceanography in kiel .
" nothing substantial has come out of this .
in fact it 's a lot less than one might have expected in one 's worst nightmares . " another expert challenged the setting of temperature targets without limits on emissions . " without any agreed targets for reducing greenhouse gases , one can not limit global warming to two degrees celsius , " said peter lemke , chief climatologist at the alfred wegener institute in bremerhaven . last-minute talks talks had been close to collapse until a last-minute agreement by the us , china , brazil , india and south africa to recognize common goals . the resulting draft was hailed as a " meaningful agreement " by us president barack obama and an " essential beginning " by un secretary general ban ki-moon . among the components of the agreement are pledges on financial aid for tackling the effects of climate change .
the deal was savagely criticized at the proceedings for not doing enough to limit global warming itself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudanese delegate lumumba stanislaus was critical of the deal deal " a betrayal " representative ian fry , from the threatened island state of tuvalu , said " it looks like we are being offered 30 pieces of silver to betray our people and our future . " sudanese delegate lumumba stanislas dia-ping said the pact meant " incineration " for africa . the main opposition in the all-night session came from the latin american countries , including nicaragua and venezuela , who claimed it did not go far enough .
danish prime minister lars lokke rasmussen , as chairman , ruled that the meeting would " take note " of the agreement – one step short of formal acceptance . china and us blamed china and the us , as the world 's greatest emitters of greenhouse gases , have received the greatest criticism for not accepting tough emissions limits .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 19.12.2009 copenhagen accord is branded " abject failure " by activists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists are disappointed that the deal has not set firm limits after two weeks of discussion in copenhagen , an outline plan to tackle climate change was finally hammered out .
but the deal has been strongly criticized for not setting tough limits on emissions . the outcome of the copenhagen summit has been branded an " abject failure " by environmentalists and " a betrayal " by developing countries . the copenhagen accord , which recognizes the need to limit global temperature increases to two degrees centigrade , was effectively passed after angry discussions at the danish capital 's bella centre . but it prompted criticism for not setting tough , legally binding limits on future climate emissions for the 193 nations present . friends of the earth said the conference had been an " abject failure " , adding that the effects of global warming would be felt most by the poor . " rich countries have condemned millions of the world 's poorest people to hunger , suffering and loss of life as climate change accelerates , " said international group chairman nnimmo bassey adding that the blame rested " squarely on the shoulders of developed nations . " " fleeing in shame " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the summit was close to collapse during the week greenpeace condemned conference participants for failing to achieve a meaningful deal and likened representatives to criminals " fleeing to the airport in shame . " " world leaders had a once in a generation chance to change the world for good , to avert catastrophic climate change , " said the group 's international head kumi naidoo . development charity oxfam said the accord " could not even be called a deal . " scientists unhappy german climate scientists also voiced their extreme disappointment . " i am utterly disappointed , " said mojib latif of the ifm-geomar leibniz institute for oceanography in kiel .
" nothing substantial has come out of this .
in fact it 's a lot less than one might have expected in one 's worst nightmares . " another expert challenged the setting of temperature targets without limits on emissions . " without any agreed targets for reducing greenhouse gases , one can not limit global warming to two degrees celsius , " said peter lemke , chief climatologist at the alfred wegener institute in bremerhaven . last-minute talks talks had been close to collapse until a last-minute agreement by the us , china , brazil , india and south africa to recognize common goals . the resulting draft was hailed as a " meaningful agreement " by us president barack obama and an " essential beginning " by un secretary general ban ki-moon . among the components of the agreement are pledges on financial aid for tackling the effects of climate change .
the deal was savagely criticized at the proceedings for not doing enough to limit global warming itself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudanese delegate lumumba stanislaus was critical of the deal deal " a betrayal " representative ian fry , from the threatened island state of tuvalu , said " it looks like we are being offered 30 pieces of silver to betray our people and our future . " sudanese delegate lumumba stanislas dia-ping said the pact meant " incineration " for africa . the main opposition in the all-night session came from the latin american countries , including nicaragua and venezuela , who claimed it did not go far enough .
danish prime minister lars lokke rasmussen , as chairman , ruled that the meeting would " take note " of the agreement – one step short of formal acceptance . china and us blamed china and the us , as the world 's greatest emitters of greenhouse gases , have received the greatest criticism for not accepting tough emissions limits . " this progress did not come easily and we know this progress alone is not enough , " said president obama before leaving the summit .
" we 've come a long way but we have much further to go . " delegates from china , which did not want to accept demands for emissions inspections stipulated by the us , were more upbeat . " the meeting has had a positive result , everyone should be happy , " said xie zhenhua , head of china 's climate delegation. rc / dpa / afp / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the deal has been strongly criticized for not setting tough limits on emissions . the outcome of the copenhagen summit has been branded an " abject failure " by environmentalists and " a betrayal " by developing countries . the copenhagen accord , which recognizes the need to limit global temperature increases to two degrees centigrade , was effectively passed after angry discussions at the danish capital 's bella centre . but it prompted criticism for not setting tough , legally binding limits on future climate emissions for the 193 nations present . friends of the earth said the conference had been an " abject failure " , adding that the effects of global warming would be felt most by the poor .

this is a strong blow to preventing climate change , writes henrik boehme . it 's been almost two years since the climate conference in bali , where plans were made for signing a new climate treaty by december 2009 in copenhagen .
but it was clear months before this year 's meeting that no such agreement would be reached .
copenhagen was an odd conference .
truly everyone attending was in agreement that something must be done to stop climate change .
but conflicting interests got in the way of compromise : the chinese did n't want supervisors in their country ; the europeans did n't want to increase co-2 reduction goals ; the americans did n't want to go too far on any deal .
africans wanted more money , but had a problem with being transparent on how it would be spent .
in the end the conference reached a complete stand-still .
in order to not leave complete empty-handed , a few countries united on a meager agreement .
obama was content to call this deal " unprecedented , " but it was in fact only a trick to prevent the conference from being seen as a complete failure .
it 's not only about climate the results of this conference have widened the gap between the developed and developing world .
meetings such as these offer poorer nations the unique opportunity to discuss their problems on a world stage , and they have done so here with impressive assertiveness .
the conference was not just about climate : it also dealt with the global balance of power and safety and stability around the world .
the problems of this planet were clearly visible through the walls of the 70,000 square-meter conference center as if they were glass .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : henrik boehme , dw economics department for us president barack obama , copenhagen offers no good news .
his last trip in copenhagen was his failed attempt to bring the 2016 olympics to chicago .
now with the stakes much higher , he has failed again .
his speech was good – but others like brazil 's lula da silva were better .
his effort was good , but simply not good enough .
in terms of his leadership , there was little to be seen .
quo vadis , kyoto ?
so how will the world proceed with climate politics ?
whatever trust that had been built between industrial and developing nations is gone .
there now remains one last chance : rich countries , which produce the majority of greenhouse gases , must place themselves on the forefront of the movement without being bogged down by preconditions .
they can no longer just talk about change – they must also make it happen .
climate politics have moved forward but a millimeter in the past two years .
the model the kyoto protocol gave us may not yet be dead .
but the hope that the success of the 1997 conference could somehow be replicated in copenhagen has undeniably disappeared .

this is a strong blow to preventing climate change , writes henrik boehme . it 's been almost two years since the climate conference in bali , where plans were made for signing a new climate treaty by december 2009 in copenhagen .
but it was clear months before this year 's meeting that no such agreement would be reached .
copenhagen was an odd conference .
truly everyone attending was in agreement that something must be done to stop climate change .
but conflicting interests got in the way of compromise : the chinese did n't want supervisors in their country ; the europeans did n't want to increase co-2 reduction goals ; the americans did n't want to go too far on any deal .
africans wanted more money , but had a problem with being transparent on how it would be spent .
in the end the conference reached a complete stand-still .
in order to not leave complete empty-handed , a few countries united on a meager agreement .
obama was content to call this deal " unprecedented , " but it was in fact only a trick to prevent the conference from being seen as a complete failure .
it 's not only about climate the results of this conference have widened the gap between the developed and developing world .
meetings such as these offer poorer nations the unique opportunity to discuss their problems on a world stage , and they have done so here with impressive assertiveness .
the conference was not just about climate : it also dealt with the global balance of power and safety and stability around the world .
the problems of this planet were clearly visible through the walls of the 70,000 square-meter conference center as if they were glass .

his last trip in copenhagen was his failed attempt to bring the 2016 olympics to chicago .
now with the stakes much higher , he has failed again .
his speech was good – but others like brazil 's lula da silva were better .
his effort was good , but simply not good enough .
in terms of his leadership , there was little to be seen .
quo vadis , kyoto ?
so how will the world proceed with climate politics ?
whatever trust that had been built between industrial and developing nations is gone .
there now remains one last chance : rich countries , which produce the majority of greenhouse gases , must place themselves on the forefront of the movement without being bogged down by preconditions .
they can no longer just talk about change – they must also make it happen .
climate politics have moved forward but a millimeter in the past two years .
the model the kyoto protocol gave us may not yet be dead .
but the hope that the success of the 1997 conference could somehow be replicated in copenhagen has undeniably disappeared .

jewish groups say pope pius xii did not do enough to save jewish lives during the second world war . the vatican is at the center of criticism over a move that places former pope pius xii closer to becoming a saint .
pope benedict has approved a decree that recognizes the pontiff , who is accused of doing too little to help europe 's jews during world war ii , as having " heroic virtues . "
the posthumous honor gives the former pope the title " venerable " and places him two steps from full canonization .
pius xi has been accused of turning a blind eye to the nazi genocide of the jews , in a controversy that has strained relations between the vatican and israel .
when a department within the vatican submitted the decree to the pope in 2007 , it was decided that any decision should be postponed for a " period of reflection . "
pope benedict 's latest decision means that pius now needs only to be beatified as the next step before he can be canonized as a saint .
honors " not acceptable " attempts to beatify the former pope had been described as " unacceptable " by israel 's social affairs minister isaac herzog , who says that the vatican 's own laws required action at the time .

the us internet giant has also been barred from digitizating further french works without approval . google 's drive to digitize all the world 's books came to a skidding halt on friday after a paris court ruled that " google had committed acts of copyright violations " by digitizing 4,000 of works from one of france 's biggest publishing houses , la martiniere .
the court ordered google to pay 300,000 euros in damages to the three publishers owned by the la martiniere group and a symbolic sum of one euro to the sne publishers ' association and the sgdl society of authors .
google must also pay an additional 10,000 euro per day for each day the books , or parts that have been digitized , remained in its data-base .
the court ruled that scanning the books and then making this available on the internet online amounted to copyright violations too .
google may now no longer scan any book without the consent of the publisher .
le seuil brought the case three years ago , and demanded compensation of 15 million euros plus 100,000 for every day the court order is not carried out .
google 's decision to digitize the books was " illegal , dangerous and caused prejudice to the publishers , " said yann colin , the plaintiff 's lawyer told the court .
google has said it will immediately appeal the decision .

this is a strong blow to preventing climate change , writes henrik boehme . it 's been almost two years since the climate conference in bali , where plans were made for signing a new climate treaty by december 2009 in copenhagen .
but it was clear months before this year 's meeting that no such agreement would be reached .
copenhagen was an odd conference .
truly everyone attending was in agreement that something must be done to stop climate change .
but conflicting interests got in the way of compromise : the chinese did n't want supervisors in their country ; the europeans did n't want to increase co-2 reduction goals ; the americans did n't want to go too far on any deal .
africans wanted more money , but had a problem with being transparent on how it would be spent .
in the end the conference reached a complete stand-still .
in order to not leave complete empty-handed , a few countries united on a meager agreement .
obama was content to call this deal " unprecedented , " but it was in fact only a trick to prevent the conference from being seen as a complete failure .
it 's not only about climate the results of this conference have widened the gap between the developed and developing world .
meetings such as these offer poorer nations the unique opportunity to discuss their problems on a world stage , and they have done so here with impressive assertiveness .
the conference was not just about climate : it also dealt with the global balance of power and safety and stability around the world .

this is a strong blow to preventing climate change , writes henrik boehme . it 's been almost two years since the climate conference in bali , where plans were made for signing a new climate treaty by december 2009 in copenhagen .
but it was clear months before this year 's meeting that no such agreement would be reached .
copenhagen was an odd conference .
truly everyone attending was in agreement that something must be done to stop climate change .
but conflicting interests got in the way of compromise : the chinese did n't want supervisors in their country ; the europeans did n't want to increase co-2 reduction goals ; the americans did n't want to go too far on any deal .
africans wanted more money , but had a problem with being transparent on how it would be spent .
in the end the conference reached a complete stand-still .
in order to not leave complete empty-handed , a few countries united on a meager agreement .
obama was content to call this deal " unprecedented , " but it was in fact only a trick to prevent the conference from being seen as a complete failure .
it 's not only about climate the results of this conference have widened the gap between the developed and developing world .
meetings such as these offer poorer nations the unique opportunity to discuss their problems on a world stage , and they have done so here with impressive assertiveness .
the conference was not just about climate : it also dealt with the global balance of power and safety and stability around the world .
the problems of this planet were clearly visible through the walls of the 70,000 square-meter conference center as if they were glass .

but the deal has been strongly criticized for not setting tough limits on emissions . the outcome of the copenhagen summit has been branded an " abject failure " by environmentalists and " a betrayal " by developing countries . the copenhagen accord , which recognizes the need to limit global temperature increases to two degrees centigrade , was effectively passed after angry discussions at the danish capital 's bella centre . but it prompted criticism for not setting tough , legally binding limits on future climate emissions for the 193 nations present . friends of the earth said the conference had been an " abject failure " , adding that the effects of global warming would be felt most by the poor . " rich countries have condemned millions of the world 's poorest people to hunger , suffering and loss of life as climate change accelerates , " said international group chairman nnimmo bassey adding that the blame rested " squarely on the shoulders of developed nations . " " fleeing in shame " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the summit was close to collapse during the week greenpeace condemned conference participants for failing to achieve a meaningful deal and likened representatives to criminals " fleeing to the airport in shame . " " world leaders had a once in a generation chance to change the world for good , to avert catastrophic climate change , " said the group 's international head kumi naidoo . development charity oxfam said the accord " could not even be called a deal . " scientists unhappy german climate scientists also voiced their extreme disappointment . " i am utterly disappointed , " said mojib latif of the ifm-geomar leibniz institute for oceanography in kiel .
" nothing substantial has come out of this .
in fact it 's a lot less than one might have expected in one 's worst nightmares . " another expert challenged the setting of temperature targets without limits on emissions . " without any agreed targets for reducing greenhouse gases , one can not limit global warming to two degrees celsius , " said peter lemke , chief climatologist at the alfred wegener institute in bremerhaven . last-minute talks talks had been close to collapse until a last-minute agreement by the us , china , brazil , india and south africa to recognize common goals . the resulting draft was hailed as a " meaningful agreement " by us president barack obama and an " essential beginning " by un secretary general ban ki-moon . among the components of the agreement are pledges on financial aid for tackling the effects of climate change .
the deal was savagely criticized at the proceedings for not doing enough to limit global warming itself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudanese delegate lumumba stanislaus was critical of the deal deal " a betrayal " representative ian fry , from the threatened island state of tuvalu , said " it looks like we are being offered 30 pieces of silver to betray our people and our future . " sudanese delegate lumumba stanislas dia-ping said the pact meant " incineration " for africa . the main opposition in the all-night session came from the latin american countries , including nicaragua and venezuela , who claimed it did not go far enough .
danish prime minister lars lokke rasmussen , as chairman , ruled that the meeting would " take note " of the agreement – one step short of formal acceptance . china and us blamed china and the us , as the world 's greatest emitters of greenhouse gases , have received the greatest criticism for not accepting tough emissions limits . " this progress did not come easily and we know this progress alone is not enough , " said president obama before leaving the summit .
" we 've come a long way but we have much further to go . " delegates from china , which did not want to accept demands for emissions inspections stipulated by the us , were more upbeat . " the meeting has had a positive result , everyone should be happy , " said xie zhenhua , head of china 's climate delegation. rc / dpa / afp / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the deal has been strongly criticized for not setting tough limits on emissions . the outcome of the copenhagen summit has been branded an " abject failure " by environmentalists and " a betrayal " by developing countries . the copenhagen accord , which recognizes the need to limit global temperature increases to two degrees centigrade , was effectively passed after angry discussions at the danish capital 's bella centre . but it prompted criticism for not setting tough , legally binding limits on future climate emissions for the 193 nations present . friends of the earth said the conference had been an " abject failure " , adding that the effects of global warming would be felt most by the poor . " rich countries have condemned millions of the world 's poorest people to hunger , suffering and loss of life as climate change accelerates , " said international group chairman nnimmo bassey adding that the blame rested " squarely on the shoulders of developed nations .

" nothing substantial has come out of this .
in fact it 's a lot less than one might have expected in one 's worst nightmares . " another expert challenged the setting of temperature targets without limits on emissions . " without any agreed targets for reducing greenhouse gases , one can not limit global warming to two degrees celsius , " said peter lemke , chief climatologist at the alfred wegener institute in bremerhaven . last-minute talks talks had been close to collapse until a last-minute agreement by the us , china , brazil , india and south africa to recognize common goals . the resulting draft was hailed as a " meaningful agreement " by us president barack obama and an " essential beginning " by un secretary general ban ki-moon . among the components of the agreement are pledges on financial aid for tackling the effects of climate change .
the deal was savagely criticized at the proceedings for not doing enough to limit global warming itself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudanese delegate lumumba stanislaus was critical of the deal deal " a betrayal " representative ian fry , from the threatened island state of tuvalu , said " it looks like we are being offered 30 pieces of silver to betray our people and our future . " sudanese delegate lumumba stanislas dia-ping said the pact meant " incineration " for africa . the main opposition in the all-night session came from the latin american countries , including nicaragua and venezuela , who claimed it did not go far enough .
danish prime minister lars lokke rasmussen , as chairman , ruled that the meeting would " take note " of the agreement – one step short of formal acceptance . china and us blamed china and the us , as the world 's greatest emitters of greenhouse gases , have received the greatest criticism for not accepting tough emissions limits . " this progress did not come easily and we know this progress alone is not enough , " said president obama before leaving the summit .

" the conference decides to take note of the copenhagen accord of december 18 , 2009 , " the chairman of the plenary session of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- declared on saturday , swiftly banging down his gavel . after bitter exchanges through the night , the summit chair reportedly forced through the deal using a procedural tool that effectively dropped all obstacles to the copenhagen accord .
according to the decision , countries in favor and against the deal would be listed .
under conference rules , decisions by the 193 participating countries are made by consensus .
the summit stopped far from a full endorsement of the plan , which sets a target of limiting global warming to a maximum two degree celsius rise over pre-industrial times and holds out the prospect of $ 100 billion in annual aid from 2020 for developing nations .
however , the plan does not specify greenhouse gas cuts needed to achieve the two celsius goal that is seen as a threshold for dangerous changes such as more floods , droughts , mudslides , sandstorms and rising seas .

"
critics point out that the decision at the 193-nation talks merely " took note " of the new accord , a non-binding deal for combating global warming led by the united states , china , india , brazil and south africa .
however , some experts say the move , which came a day after the climate negotiations were scheduled to end , clears the way for the accord to become operational in practice even though it has not been formally approved by the conference .
brink of collapse earlier , during a stormy overnight session , the talks were on the brink of collapse after sudan , nicaragua , cuba , venezuela and bolivia lined up to denounce the us-led plan following a meeting of about 120 world leaders on friday .
the all-night plenary session , chaired by danish prime minister lars lokke rasmussen , hit a low point when a sudanese delegate said the plan in africa would be like the holocaust .
the outcome may yield the initiative in forming world climate policy to the united states and china , the world 's top two emitters of greenhouse gases .
many nations said the deal fell far short of un ambitions for copenhagen , meant as a turning point to push the world economy towards renewable energies such as hydro , solar and wind power and away from fossil fuels .
european nations were lukewarm to a deal that cut out some goals mentioned previously in draft texts , such as a target of halving world greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 .

" the conference decides to take note of the copenhagen accord of december 18 , 2009 , " the chairman of the plenary session of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- declared on saturday , swiftly banging down his gavel . after bitter exchanges through the night , the summit chair reportedly forced through the deal using a procedural tool that effectively dropped all obstacles to the copenhagen accord .
according to the decision , countries in favor and against the deal would be listed .
under conference rules , decisions by the 193 participating countries are made by consensus .
the summit stopped far from a full endorsement of the plan , which sets a target of limiting global warming to a maximum two degree celsius rise over pre-industrial times and holds out the prospect of $ 100 billion in annual aid from 2020 for developing nations .
however , the plan does not specify greenhouse gas cuts needed to achieve the two celsius goal that is seen as a threshold for dangerous changes such as more floods , droughts , mudslides , sandstorms and rising seas .
ban praises deal united nations secretary-general ban ki-moon praised the deal struck at the summit , while admitting that it did not meet expectations .
" it may not be everything we hoped for , but this decision of the conference of parties is an essential beginning , " ban told reporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists have slammed the results of the talks as " abject failure " the un chief said that the copenhagen accord would be " immediately operational " as of january 1 , adding : " we will try to have a legally binding treaty as soon as possible in 2010 . "
critics point out that the decision at the 193-nation talks merely " took note " of the new accord , a non-binding deal for combating global warming led by the united states , china , india , brazil and south africa .
however , some experts say the move , which came a day after the climate negotiations were scheduled to end , clears the way for the accord to become operational in practice even though it has not been formally approved by the conference .
brink of collapse earlier , during a stormy overnight session , the talks were on the brink of collapse after sudan , nicaragua , cuba , venezuela and bolivia lined up to denounce the us-led plan following a meeting of about 120 world leaders on friday .
the all-night plenary session , chaired by danish prime minister lars lokke rasmussen , hit a low point when a sudanese delegate said the plan in africa would be like the holocaust .
the outcome may yield the initiative in forming world climate policy to the united states and china , the world 's top two emitters of greenhouse gases .
many nations said the deal fell far short of un ambitions for copenhagen , meant as a turning point to push the world economy towards renewable energies such as hydro , solar and wind power and away from fossil fuels .
european nations were lukewarm to a deal that cut out some goals mentioned previously in draft texts , such as a target of halving world greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 .

" the conference decides to take note of the copenhagen accord of december 18 , 2009 , " the chairman of the plenary session of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- declared on saturday , swiftly banging down his gavel . after bitter exchanges through the night , the summit chair reportedly forced through the deal using a procedural tool that effectively dropped all obstacles to the copenhagen accord .
according to the decision , countries in favor and against the deal would be listed .
under conference rules , decisions by the 193 participating countries are made by consensus .
the summit stopped far from a full endorsement of the plan , which sets a target of limiting global warming to a maximum two degree celsius rise over pre-industrial times and holds out the prospect of $ 100 billion in annual aid from 2020 for developing nations .
however , the plan does not specify greenhouse gas cuts needed to achieve the two celsius goal that is seen as a threshold for dangerous changes such as more floods , droughts , mudslides , sandstorms and rising seas .
ban praises deal united nations secretary-general ban ki-moon praised the deal struck at the summit , while admitting that it did not meet expectations .
" it may not be everything we hoped for , but this decision of the conference of parties is an essential beginning , " ban told reporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists have slammed the results of the talks as " abject failure " the un chief said that the copenhagen accord would be " immediately operational " as of january 1 , adding : " we will try to have a legally binding treaty as soon as possible in 2010 . "
critics point out that the decision at the 193-nation talks merely " took note " of the new accord , a non-binding deal for combating global warming led by the united states , china , india , brazil and south africa .
however , some experts say the move , which came a day after the climate negotiations were scheduled to end , clears the way for the accord to become operational in practice even though it has not been formally approved by the conference .
brink of collapse earlier , during a stormy overnight session , the talks were on the brink of collapse after sudan , nicaragua , cuba , venezuela and bolivia lined up to denounce the us-led plan following a meeting of about 120 world leaders on friday .
the all-night plenary session , chaired by danish prime minister lars lokke rasmussen , hit a low point when a sudanese delegate said the plan in africa would be like the holocaust .
the outcome may yield the initiative in forming world climate policy to the united states and china , the world 's top two emitters of greenhouse gases .
many nations said the deal fell far short of un ambitions for copenhagen , meant as a turning point to push the world economy towards renewable energies such as hydro , solar and wind power and away from fossil fuels .
european nations were lukewarm to a deal that cut out some goals mentioned previously in draft texts , such as a target of halving world greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 .
the copenhagen deal sets an end-january 2010 deadline for all nations to submit plans for curbs on emissions to the united nations. rb / afp / dpa / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the visit , organized by the serbian authorities and supported by the european commission 's directorate general for enlargement as well as by the embassies of france , italy and germany , symbolically marks the abolition of visas for serbian citizens to travel to the eu .
" these are ordinary people who have done something extraordinary and have so far never seen europe , " bozidar djelic , serbia 's deputy prime minister in charge of european integrations , told a press conference prior to the trip .
travel restrictions were lifted following a november 30 decision by the eu that nationals of macedonia , montenegro and serbia would be able to travel without visa to all its member states , except britain and ireland .
the plane carrying the serbian nationals – selected through the " europe for everyone " competition and who have not had the opportunity to visit the european union before – left belgrade for brussels shortly after midnight local time .
beside brussels , the group will also visit rome , berlin and paris , spending two days in each of the european capitals .
in brussels , the group would meet with european commissioner for enlargement olli rehn , and a number of other officials .
in the macedonian capital , skopje , several thousand people gathered at the main square to celebrate the abolition of visas .
the macedonian government is also planning to organize a symbolic trip for its citizens .
and in montenegro , the authorities announced a celebratory visit by 100 citizens to rome on sunday .
serbia , macedonia and montenegro are all aspirants for eu membership , but only macedonia has formerly attained the status of a candidate .
serbia says it is currently engaged in talks with the eu and could decide next week on whether to apply for membership .

jewish groups say pope pius xii did not do enough to save jewish lives during the second world war . the vatican is at the center of criticism over a move that places former pope pius xii closer to becoming a saint .
pope benedict has approved a decree that recognizes the pontiff , who is accused of doing too little to help europe 's jews during world war ii , as having " heroic virtues . "
the posthumous honor gives the former pope the title " venerable " and places him two steps from full canonization .
pius xi has been accused of turning a blind eye to the nazi genocide of the jews , in a controversy that has strained relations between the vatican and israel .
when a department within the vatican submitted the decree to the pope in 2007 , it was decided that any decision should be postponed for a " period of reflection . "
pope benedict 's latest decision means that pius now needs only to be beatified as the next step before he can be canonized as a saint .
honors " not acceptable " attempts to beatify the former pope had been described as " unacceptable " by israel 's social affairs minister isaac herzog , who says that the vatican 's own laws required action at the time .
" throughout the period of the holocaust , the vatican knew very well what was happening in europe , " herzog told the haaretz newspaper in 2008 .
jews have called on the vatican to open archives on pius and to freeze the process that could make him a saint . they want the documents to be examined by scholars .
defense of pope the current pope , who as a child was a member of the hitler youth , has defended pius .
the vatican maintains that he saved many jews , hiding them in religious institutions , and that he kept silent to avoid aggravating their situation .
catholic supporters of pius , who was pope from 1939 to 1958 , have pressed for the process of his sainthood to be accelerated. rc / afp / reuter editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the visit , organized by the serbian authorities and supported by the european commission 's directorate general for enlargement as well as by the embassies of france , italy and germany , symbolically marks the abolition of visas for serbian citizens to travel to the eu .
" these are ordinary people who have done something extraordinary and have so far never seen europe , " bozidar djelic , serbia 's deputy prime minister in charge of european integrations , told a press conference prior to the trip .
travel restrictions were lifted following a november 30 decision by the eu that nationals of macedonia , montenegro and serbia would be able to travel without visa to all its member states , except britain and ireland .
the plane carrying the serbian nationals – selected through the " europe for everyone " competition and who have not had the opportunity to visit the european union before – left belgrade for brussels shortly after midnight local time .
beside brussels , the group will also visit rome , berlin and paris , spending two days in each of the european capitals .
in brussels , the group would meet with european commissioner for enlargement olli rehn , and a number of other officials .
in the macedonian capital , skopje , several thousand people gathered at the main square to celebrate the abolition of visas .
the macedonian government is also planning to organize a symbolic trip for its citizens .
and in montenegro , the authorities announced a celebratory visit by 100 citizens to rome on sunday .
serbia , macedonia and montenegro are all aspirants for eu membership , but only macedonia has formerly attained the status of a candidate .
serbia says it is currently engaged in talks with the eu and could decide next week on whether to apply for membership .

jewish groups say pope pius xii did not do enough to save jewish lives during the second world war . the vatican is at the center of criticism over a move that places former pope pius xii closer to becoming a saint .
pope benedict has approved a decree that recognizes the pontiff , who is accused of doing too little to help europe 's jews during world war ii , as having " heroic virtues . "
the posthumous honor gives the former pope the title " venerable " and places him two steps from full canonization .
pius xi has been accused of turning a blind eye to the nazi genocide of the jews , in a controversy that has strained relations between the vatican and israel .
when a department within the vatican submitted the decree to the pope in 2007 , it was decided that any decision should be postponed for a " period of reflection . "
pope benedict 's latest decision means that pius now needs only to be beatified as the next step before he can be canonized as a saint .
honors " not acceptable " attempts to beatify the former pope had been described as " unacceptable " by israel 's social affairs minister isaac herzog , who says that the vatican 's own laws required action at the time .
" throughout the period of the holocaust , the vatican knew very well what was happening in europe , " herzog told the haaretz newspaper in 2008 .
jews have called on the vatican to open archives on pius and to freeze the process that could make him a saint . they want the documents to be examined by scholars .
defense of pope the current pope , who as a child was a member of the hitler youth , has defended pius .
the vatican maintains that he saved many jews , hiding them in religious institutions , and that he kept silent to avoid aggravating their situation .
catholic supporters of pius , who was pope from 1939 to 1958 , have pressed for the process of his sainthood to be accelerated. rc / afp / reuter editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the deal has been strongly criticized for not setting tough limits on emissions . the outcome of the copenhagen summit has been branded an " abject failure " by environmentalists and " a betrayal " by developing countries . the copenhagen accord , which recognizes the need to limit global temperature increases to two degrees centigrade , was effectively passed after angry discussions at the danish capital 's bella centre . but it prompted criticism for not setting tough , legally binding limits on future climate emissions for the 193 nations present . friends of the earth said the conference had been an " abject failure " , adding that the effects of global warming would be felt most by the poor . " rich countries have condemned millions of the world 's poorest people to hunger , suffering and loss of life as climate change accelerates , " said international group chairman nnimmo bassey adding that the blame rested " squarely on the shoulders of developed nations . " " fleeing in shame " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the summit was close to collapse during the week greenpeace condemned conference participants for failing to achieve a meaningful deal and likened representatives to criminals " fleeing to the airport in shame . " " world leaders had a once in a generation chance to change the world for good , to avert catastrophic climate change , " said the group 's international head kumi naidoo . development charity oxfam said the accord " could not even be called a deal . " scientists unhappy german climate scientists also voiced their extreme disappointment . " i am utterly disappointed , " said mojib latif of the ifm-geomar leibniz institute for oceanography in kiel .
" nothing substantial has come out of this .
in fact it 's a lot less than one might have expected in one 's worst nightmares . " another expert challenged the setting of temperature targets without limits on emissions . " without any agreed targets for reducing greenhouse gases , one can not limit global warming to two degrees celsius , " said peter lemke , chief climatologist at the alfred wegener institute in bremerhaven . last-minute talks talks had been close to collapse until a last-minute agreement by the us , china , brazil , india and south africa to recognize common goals . the resulting draft was hailed as a " meaningful agreement " by us president barack obama and an " essential beginning " by un secretary general ban ki-moon . among the components of the agreement are pledges on financial aid for tackling the effects of climate change .
the deal was savagely criticized at the proceedings for not doing enough to limit global warming itself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudanese delegate lumumba stanislaus was critical of the deal deal " a betrayal " representative ian fry , from the threatened island state of tuvalu , said " it looks like we are being offered 30 pieces of silver to betray our people and our future . " sudanese delegate lumumba stanislas dia-ping said the pact meant " incineration " for africa . the main opposition in the all-night session came from the latin american countries , including nicaragua and venezuela , who claimed it did not go far enough .
danish prime minister lars lokke rasmussen , as chairman , ruled that the meeting would " take note " of the agreement – one step short of formal acceptance . china and us blamed china and the us , as the world 's greatest emitters of greenhouse gases , have received the greatest criticism for not accepting tough emissions limits . " this progress did not come easily and we know this progress alone is not enough , " said president obama before leaving the summit .
" we 've come a long way but we have much further to go . " delegates from china , which did not want to accept demands for emissions inspections stipulated by the us , were more upbeat . " the meeting has had a positive result , everyone should be happy , " said xie zhenhua , head of china 's climate delegation. rc / dpa / afp / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 19.12.2009 vatican under pressure as wartime pope is moved closer to sainthood großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope pius xii has been criticized for not doing enough to help jews in the war pope benedict xvi is facing criticism after he put a controversial wartime predecessor one step closer to sainthood .
jewish groups say pope pius xii did not do enough to save jewish lives during the second world war . the vatican is at the center of criticism over a move that places former pope pius xii closer to becoming a saint .
pope benedict has approved a decree that recognizes the pontiff , who is accused of doing too little to help europe 's jews during world war ii , as having " heroic virtues . "
the posthumous honor gives the former pope the title " venerable " and places him two steps from full canonization .
pius xi has been accused of turning a blind eye to the nazi genocide of the jews , in a controversy that has strained relations between the vatican and israel .
when a department within the vatican submitted the decree to the pope in 2007 , it was decided that any decision should be postponed for a " period of reflection . "
pope benedict 's latest decision means that pius now needs only to be beatified as the next step before he can be canonized as a saint .
honors " not acceptable " attempts to beatify the former pope had been described as " unacceptable " by israel 's social affairs minister isaac herzog , who says that the vatican 's own laws required action at the time .
" throughout the period of the holocaust , the vatican knew very well what was happening in europe , " herzog told the haaretz newspaper in 2008 .
jews have called on the vatican to open archives on pius and to freeze the process that could make him a saint . they want the documents to be examined by scholars .
defense of pope the current pope , who as a child was a member of the hitler youth , has defended pius .
the vatican maintains that he saved many jews , hiding them in religious institutions , and that he kept silent to avoid aggravating their situation .
catholic supporters of pius , who was pope from 1939 to 1958 , have pressed for the process of his sainthood to be accelerated. rc / afp / reuter editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the conference decides to take note of the copenhagen accord of december 18 , 2009 , " the chairman of the plenary session of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- declared on saturday , swiftly banging down his gavel . after bitter exchanges through the night , the summit chair reportedly forced through the deal using a procedural tool that effectively dropped all obstacles to the copenhagen accord .
according to the decision , countries in favor and against the deal would be listed .
under conference rules , decisions by the 193 participating countries are made by consensus .
the summit stopped far from a full endorsement of the plan , which sets a target of limiting global warming to a maximum two degree celsius rise over pre-industrial times and holds out the prospect of $ 100 billion in annual aid from 2020 for developing nations .
however , the plan does not specify greenhouse gas cuts needed to achieve the two celsius goal that is seen as a threshold for dangerous changes such as more floods , droughts , mudslides , sandstorms and rising seas .

" it may not be everything we hoped for , but this decision of the conference of parties is an essential beginning , " ban told reporters .

"
critics point out that the decision at the 193-nation talks merely " took note " of the new accord , a non-binding deal for combating global warming led by the united states , china , india , brazil and south africa .
however , some experts say the move , which came a day after the climate negotiations were scheduled to end , clears the way for the accord to become operational in practice even though it has not been formally approved by the conference .
brink of collapse earlier , during a stormy overnight session , the talks were on the brink of collapse after sudan , nicaragua , cuba , venezuela and bolivia lined up to denounce the us-led plan following a meeting of about 120 world leaders on friday .
the all-night plenary session , chaired by danish prime minister lars lokke rasmussen , hit a low point when a sudanese delegate said the plan in africa would be like the holocaust .
the outcome may yield the initiative in forming world climate policy to the united states and china , the world 's top two emitters of greenhouse gases .
many nations said the deal fell far short of un ambitions for copenhagen , meant as a turning point to push the world economy towards renewable energies such as hydro , solar and wind power and away from fossil fuels .
european nations were lukewarm to a deal that cut out some goals mentioned previously in draft texts , such as a target of halving world greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 .

jewish groups say pope pius xii did not do enough to save jewish lives during the second world war . the vatican is at the center of criticism over a move that places former pope pius xii closer to becoming a saint .
pope benedict has approved a decree that recognizes the pontiff , who is accused of doing too little to help europe 's jews during world war ii , as having " heroic virtues . "
the posthumous honor gives the former pope the title " venerable " and places him two steps from full canonization .
pius xi has been accused of turning a blind eye to the nazi genocide of the jews , in a controversy that has strained relations between the vatican and israel .
when a department within the vatican submitted the decree to the pope in 2007 , it was decided that any decision should be postponed for a " period of reflection . "
pope benedict 's latest decision means that pius now needs only to be beatified as the next step before he can be canonized as a saint .
honors " not acceptable " attempts to beatify the former pope had been described as " unacceptable " by israel 's social affairs minister isaac herzog , who says that the vatican 's own laws required action at the time .
" throughout the period of the holocaust , the vatican knew very well what was happening in europe , " herzog told the haaretz newspaper in 2008 .
jews have called on the vatican to open archives on pius and to freeze the process that could make him a saint . they want the documents to be examined by scholars .
defense of pope the current pope , who as a child was a member of the hitler youth , has defended pius .
the vatican maintains that he saved many jews , hiding them in religious institutions , and that he kept silent to avoid aggravating their situation .
catholic supporters of pius , who was pope from 1939 to 1958 , have pressed for the process of his sainthood to be accelerated. rc / afp / reuter editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the conference decides to take note of the copenhagen accord of december 18 , 2009 , " the chairman of the plenary session of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- declared on saturday , swiftly banging down his gavel . after bitter exchanges through the night , the summit chair reportedly forced through the deal using a procedural tool that effectively dropped all obstacles to the copenhagen accord .
according to the decision , countries in favor and against the deal would be listed .
under conference rules , decisions by the 193 participating countries are made by consensus .
the summit stopped far from a full endorsement of the plan , which sets a target of limiting global warming to a maximum two degree celsius rise over pre-industrial times and holds out the prospect of $ 100 billion in annual aid from 2020 for developing nations .
however , the plan does not specify greenhouse gas cuts needed to achieve the two celsius goal that is seen as a threshold for dangerous changes such as more floods , droughts , mudslides , sandstorms and rising seas .
ban praises deal united nations secretary-general ban ki-moon praised the deal struck at the summit , while admitting that it did not meet expectations .
" it may not be everything we hoped for , but this decision of the conference of parties is an essential beginning , " ban told reporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists have slammed the results of the talks as " abject failure " the un chief said that the copenhagen accord would be " immediately operational " as of january 1 , adding : " we will try to have a legally binding treaty as soon as possible in 2010 . "
critics point out that the decision at the 193-nation talks merely " took note " of the new accord , a non-binding deal for combating global warming led by the united states , china , india , brazil and south africa .
however , some experts say the move , which came a day after the climate negotiations were scheduled to end , clears the way for the accord to become operational in practice even though it has not been formally approved by the conference .
brink of collapse earlier , during a stormy overnight session , the talks were on the brink of collapse after sudan , nicaragua , cuba , venezuela and bolivia lined up to denounce the us-led plan following a meeting of about 120 world leaders on friday .
the all-night plenary session , chaired by danish prime minister lars lokke rasmussen , hit a low point when a sudanese delegate said the plan in africa would be like the holocaust .
the outcome may yield the initiative in forming world climate policy to the united states and china , the world 's top two emitters of greenhouse gases .

" the conference decides to take note of the copenhagen accord of december 18 , 2009 , " the chairman of the plenary session of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- declared on saturday , swiftly banging down his gavel . after bitter exchanges through the night , the summit chair reportedly forced through the deal using a procedural tool that effectively dropped all obstacles to the copenhagen accord .
according to the decision , countries in favor and against the deal would be listed .
under conference rules , decisions by the 193 participating countries are made by consensus .
the summit stopped far from a full endorsement of the plan , which sets a target of limiting global warming to a maximum two degree celsius rise over pre-industrial times and holds out the prospect of $ 100 billion in annual aid from 2020 for developing nations .
however , the plan does not specify greenhouse gas cuts needed to achieve the two celsius goal that is seen as a threshold for dangerous changes such as more floods , droughts , mudslides , sandstorms and rising seas .
ban praises deal united nations secretary-general ban ki-moon praised the deal struck at the summit , while admitting that it did not meet expectations .
" it may not be everything we hoped for , but this decision of the conference of parties is an essential beginning , " ban told reporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists have slammed the results of the talks as " abject failure " the un chief said that the copenhagen accord would be " immediately operational " as of january 1 , adding : " we will try to have a legally binding treaty as soon as possible in 2010 . "
critics point out that the decision at the 193-nation talks merely " took note " of the new accord , a non-binding deal for combating global warming led by the united states , china , india , brazil and south africa .
however , some experts say the move , which came a day after the climate negotiations were scheduled to end , clears the way for the accord to become operational in practice even though it has not been formally approved by the conference .
brink of collapse earlier , during a stormy overnight session , the talks were on the brink of collapse after sudan , nicaragua , cuba , venezuela and bolivia lined up to denounce the us-led plan following a meeting of about 120 world leaders on friday .
the all-night plenary session , chaired by danish prime minister lars lokke rasmussen , hit a low point when a sudanese delegate said the plan in africa would be like the holocaust .
the outcome may yield the initiative in forming world climate policy to the united states and china , the world 's top two emitters of greenhouse gases .
many nations said the deal fell far short of un ambitions for copenhagen , meant as a turning point to push the world economy towards renewable energies such as hydro , solar and wind power and away from fossil fuels .
european nations were lukewarm to a deal that cut out some goals mentioned previously in draft texts , such as a target of halving world greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 .
the copenhagen deal sets an end-january 2010 deadline for all nations to submit plans for curbs on emissions to the united nations. rb / afp / dpa / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
