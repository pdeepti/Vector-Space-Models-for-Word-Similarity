deutsche welle 's peter philipp looks at who stands to profit from the destabilization of afghanistan . in afghanistan 's eventful history , it was largely the interests of large foreign powers that prevented peace in the country at the foothills of the hindukush mountains . the foreign powers included the british , who pursued their own interests there , the russians and finally the americans - together with allies pakistan and saudi arabia . caught between powerful foreign interests the issues at stake were securing british supply lanes to india , ensuring russian access to the indian ocean , and finally repelling and beating back the soviet union with the help of the three-way alliance of washington , islamabad and riyadh . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche welle 's peter philipp those interests never focused on bolstering a strong afghan state , rather they were about installing an accommodating central government in kabul and maintaining a system of loyal regional chieftains in the country .
it was a system that had worked for centuries in afghanistan .
or sometimes it did n't . an afghan proverb speaks of a " a king under every tree . "
the king - and that included the presidents of the country - were merely seen as mayors of the capital kabul .
and their power was only recognized in the provinces if they sealed " deals " with the local rulers and gave them a free hand to run their own affairs . drugs trade flourishing that 's exactly what current president hamid karzai is doing .
once celebrated as the savior of afghanistan by the us and europe , karzai has long left the path of democracy and the rule of law . he has allied himself with regional " warlords " who are meant to ensure karzai power and influence in the provinces and who in return can thwart any attempt at normalization .
corruption is a daily occurrence but what 's worse is that the growing of poppy has reached record volumes in recent years , making afghanistan a notorious leading world exporter of drugs . ordinary farmers do n't earn a lot with their poppy fields but it 's still much more than what they would make with alternative crops such as wheat .
the " warlords " have long-turned into powerful " drug bosses " who rake in huge profits to finance their weapons and who are thus difficult to pressurize . these druglords are flexible and ready to hammer out an alliance with just about anybody .
the main thing is that their powerful positions are untouched . they also work together with the taliban , who are against the opium trade on religious and ideological grounds , but have long used this lucrative economic and agricultural sector for their own purposes . stabilizing afghanistan foreign nations - from afghanistan 's neighbors to europe and the us - are today more interested in calming the situation and stabilizing afghanistan . those interested in the opposite are primarily the regional rulers and the drug bosses who do n't want to give up their power and influence .
to curb their power , more pressure needs to be exerted on the central government and the president , the taliban needs to be defeated and ordinary afghans need to be given new opportunities to earn money . but none of that has happened so far .
still , about 50 drug dealers are included in the 367 names on an exhaustive wanted-persons list compiled by the us in afghanistan .

this marks an acceleration of the airline ’ s war against what it regards as online touts . ryanair lodged proceedings against leipzig-based internet firm unister at the high court in dublin this week .
the airline claims websites operated by unister use " screen-scraping " software to gather information from ryanair 's website without permission and then sell tickets to customers at inflated prices .
screen scraping is the process by which one computer program collects specific data from another .
in this case , unister 's software is constantly extracting information from other airline companies ' websites – rates , travel times , availability – and then neatly packaging and displaying that information on its own website for potential customers to search and compare .
while ryanair says it has no problem cooperating with authorized price comparison websites , it is unhappy that sites operated by unister hit customers with " hidden charges " . when a customer buys a return flight from duesseldorf to london on ryanair 's own website , for example , the final price including payment handling fees might be 93.25 euros .
if a customer buys the same ryanair flight using one of unister 's websites , additional fees push the final price up to 111.86 euros .
" ryanair is determined to continue its pro-consumer campaign against screen-scraper ticket-tout websites until the last screen scraper stops overcharging unsuspecting consumers , " ryanair spokesman stephen mcnamara said in a statement .
" our strategy of defending consumer rights in irish courts is proving successful and the number of active screen scrapers is rapidly decreasing , ” mcnamara said , adding : “ sadly , unister chose to continue overcharging consumers in breach of ryanair 's rights and left us no alternative but to refer them to the dublin high court . "
battle brewing unister spokesman konstantin korosides told deutsche welle that while management had not yet received official notification of the lawsuit , they were preparing for a legal battle .
“ we think that a german court is responsible , not an irish one , because we are a german online company .
that means jurisdiction has to be here , ” korosides said .
unister argues that screen-scraper software is not illegal and that its websites simply offer customers a service that helps them make a more informed decision when booking a flight .
“ we are an online travel agency , ” korosides said .
“ we charge a small fee for providing our service .
there 's nothing illegal with going to a travel agency , is there ? ”
“ we have 1.6 million visitors coming to one of our travel websites every month .
surely they would stop coming if they felt we were cheating them , ” he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german football star michael ballack is the face of one of unister 's online ad campaigns violation of terms of service ryanair , however , maintains that by reproducing information from its website without permission , unister and other screen scrapers are violating the ryanair website 's terms of service , which prohibit third parties from using its platform for commercial purposes .
the irish airline has intensified its legal campaign against german screen-scraping websites over the past 12 months , with mixed results .
in may , a hamburg court confirmed a 2008 injunction that banned german screen scraper vtours from reselling ryanair tickets because it was doing so in its own name .
in march , however , a frankfurt court blocked ryanair 's attempt to cancel bookings made through unauthorized screen scrapers , ruling that the german price comparison website cheaptickets.de did not break any laws when accessing ryanair 's database , and that the tickets purchased through the site were therefore valid .
since then ryanair has been pursuing screen scrapers through irish courts .
earlier this month , four german screen scrapers bowed to pressure from the airline 's lawyers and signed a binding agreement stating they would stop accessing the airline 's website and reselling its tickets .
legal grey zone ?
e-commerce experts say that depending on the exact application , screen scrapers often operate in a legal grey zone .
“ the law has n't caught up with this technology yet , ” said jason bellows , an it consultant at screen-scraper.com , a us-based company that sells the kind of software unister uses to harvest information from ryanair .
while many companies in the travel and financial sectors are happy about the extra business aggregator websites attract , bellows said he has often complied with large companies requesting that his firm decline assistance to third parties planning unauthorized access to their databases on several occasions .
common reasons for such requests include perceived harm to their brand 's reputation for value , a loss of potential online advertising revenue , and – for smaller firms – the technical strain screen scrapers place on low-capacity computer servers .
many complaints are based on alleged breaches of a website 's terms of use , but bellows said the strongest argument , in the us at least , was the threat of an intellectual property lawsuit .
“ people put the information on the internet to be used . our software just helps people find that information and use it better , ” bellows told deutsche welle . “ what we are always worried about , though , is copyright laws .
we never want our users to violate copyright laws . ”

this marks an acceleration of the airline ’ s war against what it regards as online touts . ryanair lodged proceedings against leipzig-based internet firm unister at the high court in dublin this week .
the airline claims websites operated by unister use " screen-scraping " software to gather information from ryanair 's website without permission and then sell tickets to customers at inflated prices .
screen scraping is the process by which one computer program collects specific data from another .
in this case , unister 's software is constantly extracting information from other airline companies ' websites – rates , travel times , availability – and then neatly packaging and displaying that information on its own website for potential customers to search and compare .
while ryanair says it has no problem cooperating with authorized price comparison websites , it is unhappy that sites operated by unister hit customers with " hidden charges " . when a customer buys a return flight from duesseldorf to london on ryanair 's own website , for example , the final price including payment handling fees might be 93.25 euros .
if a customer buys the same ryanair flight using one of unister 's websites , additional fees push the final price up to 111.86 euros .
" ryanair is determined to continue its pro-consumer campaign against screen-scraper ticket-tout websites until the last screen scraper stops overcharging unsuspecting consumers , " ryanair spokesman stephen mcnamara said in a statement .
" our strategy of defending consumer rights in irish courts is proving successful and the number of active screen scrapers is rapidly decreasing , ” mcnamara said , adding : “ sadly , unister chose to continue overcharging consumers in breach of ryanair 's rights and left us no alternative but to refer them to the dublin high court . "
battle brewing unister spokesman konstantin korosides told deutsche welle that while management had not yet received official notification of the lawsuit , they were preparing for a legal battle .
“ we think that a german court is responsible , not an irish one , because we are a german online company .
that means jurisdiction has to be here , ” korosides said .
unister argues that screen-scraper software is not illegal and that its websites simply offer customers a service that helps them make a more informed decision when booking a flight .
“ we are an online travel agency , ” korosides said .
“ we charge a small fee for providing our service .
there 's nothing illegal with going to a travel agency , is there ? ”
“ we have 1.6 million visitors coming to one of our travel websites every month .
surely they would stop coming if they felt we were cheating them , ” he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german football star michael ballack is the face of one of unister 's online ad campaigns violation of terms of service ryanair , however , maintains that by reproducing information from its website without permission , unister and other screen scrapers are violating the ryanair website 's terms of service , which prohibit third parties from using its platform for commercial purposes .
the irish airline has intensified its legal campaign against german screen-scraping websites over the past 12 months , with mixed results .
in may , a hamburg court confirmed a 2008 injunction that banned german screen scraper vtours from reselling ryanair tickets because it was doing so in its own name .
in march , however , a frankfurt court blocked ryanair 's attempt to cancel bookings made through unauthorized screen scrapers , ruling that the german price comparison website cheaptickets.de did not break any laws when accessing ryanair 's database , and that the tickets purchased through the site were therefore valid .
since then ryanair has been pursuing screen scrapers through irish courts .
earlier this month , four german screen scrapers bowed to pressure from the airline 's lawyers and signed a binding agreement stating they would stop accessing the airline 's website and reselling its tickets .
legal grey zone ?
e-commerce experts say that depending on the exact application , screen scrapers often operate in a legal grey zone .
“ the law has n't caught up with this technology yet , ” said jason bellows , an it consultant at screen-scraper.com , a us-based company that sells the kind of software unister uses to harvest information from ryanair .
while many companies in the travel and financial sectors are happy about the extra business aggregator websites attract , bellows said he has often complied with large companies requesting that his firm decline assistance to third parties planning unauthorized access to their databases on several occasions .
common reasons for such requests include perceived harm to their brand 's reputation for value , a loss of potential online advertising revenue , and – for smaller firms – the technical strain screen scrapers place on low-capacity computer servers .
many complaints are based on alleged breaches of a website 's terms of use , but bellows said the strongest argument , in the us at least , was the threat of an intellectual property lawsuit .
“ people put the information on the internet to be used . our software just helps people find that information and use it better , ” bellows told deutsche welle . “ what we are always worried about , though , is copyright laws .
we never want our users to violate copyright laws . ”

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 20.08.2009 afghans vote in presidential elections amid sporadic violence großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polling stations are seeing brisk trade despite the risks for only the second time in its history , afghanistan has been voting to elect a president .
officials say turnout has been healthy , despite sporadic violence by taliban militants determined to sabotage the ballot . a massive afghan and multinational force of 300,000 was put on full alert thursday to safeguard voting and prevent the taliban from unleashing a threatened onslaught .
two taliban insurgents were killed in a gun battle in kabul as sporadic violence across the country threatened to unsettle voters .
the attack , coming after the taliban said 20 of their fighters had infiltrated the capital , was the worst of several on polling stations and voters .
the taliban have struck repeatedly inside the capital in a bloody countdown to elections that are aimed at putting the country more firmly on the path to democracy eight years after the us-led invasion ousted the militia 's regime .
however , despite the violence in places like kandahar in the south and in the northern provinces of baghlan and takhar , the united nations said there were encouraging signs of high turnout .
" the vast majority of polling stations have been able to open and have received voting materials , " said aleem siddique , spokesman for the un mission in kabul .
" we are seeing queues forming at polling stations in the north , also in the capital , as well as , encouragingly , in the east . "
scores of people queued up at polling stations in the capital and major cities under government control , and some 95 percent of 6,500 polling stations opened on schedule , the independent election commission said .
" the turnout is very good , but we do n't have exact figures , " said deputy chief electoral officer zekria barakzai , predicting that it could reach around 50 percent overall .
seventeen million afghans have registered to elect a president and 420 councilors in 34 provinces across the largely rural , impoverished country .
it is a difficult process in a nation where more than 70 percent of people are illiterate and bound by fierce tribal and religious allegiances .
karzai bullish despite energetic abdullah bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai could face a run-off with his rival abdullah abdullah western-backed president hamid karzai hopes to win an outright majority to avoid a run-off , but his nervous government ordered a blackout on reporting on violence during polling day , threatening journalists with heavy penalties .
" i request my dear countrymen to come out and cast their vote to decide their future , " karzai said as he voted in a kabul boys ' school near his heavily fortified palace , dismissing fears of unrest .
however , one opinion poll carried out by a us organization predicted karzai would be forced into a run-off , winning 44 percent of the vote , and his rival abdullah abdullah , who has a northern powerbase and draws on ethnic tajik support , would take 26 percent .
there are around 30 other candidates .
abdullah hailed " a day of change " as he voted alongside his wife and young son amid a throng of journalists and phalanx of security men .
an energetic campaign by the ex-foreign minister has boosted the chance of a run-off , which would take place in around six weeks ' time .
the election is also a test for us president barack obama , who has ordered a massive troop build-up this year as part of a strategy to reverse taliban gains .
obama 's envoy for the region , richard holbrooke , toured polling stations in kabul and said what he 'd seen was " open and honest , " adding : " so far every prediction of disaster turned out to be wrong . "
nato troops on alert and ready to quell violence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attacks ahead of the election put isaf on red alert troops from nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- and afghan forces were still on high alert despite the level of violence being far below that predicted .
" we have been doing an immense amount of work to try and ensure the best possible security for the elections , " lieutenant general jim dutton , the deputy commander of the nato-led force drawn from about 40 nations , told reporters .
" of course the real test is election day , " the british general added .
the biggest threats facing troops were suicide bombers , rockets and maybe ambushes , he said .
" the mission , as for all coalition forces , is to be the least visible to show that this is an election organized by the afghans themselves , " said lieutenant colonel stephane chenel , another nato commander .
" if there is a threat , all forces will be able to intervene .
everyone will be deployed and , in an immediate threat , go anywhere at any moment , " the french officer said .
isaf officials said that despite rising taliban violence , less than one percent of polling stations were at risk of attack .
but isaf spokesman brigadier general eric tremblay acknowledged : " despite the best plans in place , there will always be some residual risk . "
around eight districts – out of 365 nationwide – contain " high risk " areas where polling stations are considered unlikely to open , mainly in the taliban heartland of southern afghanistan. nda / afp / reuters / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" megrahi now faces a sentence imposed by a higher power , " said scottish justice minister kenny macaskill at a news conference on thursday .
" it is terminal , final and irrevocable .
he is going to die . "
shortly afterwards megrahi boarded a libyan jet that had been sent from tripoli to collect him .
relatives of the victims and the united states government were opposed to his release .
on tuesday us secretary of state hillary clinton said that it would be " absolutely wrong " to free al-megrahi , who was responsible for a " horrendous crime . "
his guilt has always been in question .
some are convinced that he was responsible , while others have consistently labeled his conviction a miscarriage of justice .
either way , megrahi is the only one ever to be tried and convicted .
circumstantial evidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : megrahi is on his way back to libya megrahi , a father of five , was born in tripoli , libya in 1952 .
he has a good command of the english language , a skill he picked up when he studied in the us .
he had also visited britain several times .
he ran an international relations think tank in libya called the center for strategic studies , a job that the fbi has claimed provided him with the perfect cover to work as an operative for the libyan intelligence services -lrb- jso -rrb- .
for a time , he was also based in malta as director of security for libyan arab airways -lrb- laa -rrb- , a job that prosecutors said gave him knowledge and access to secure airlines .
the key piece of evidence in his trial was that pieces of clothing that megrahi had bought in malta were found wrapped around the bomb .
a fateful flight on december 22 , 1988 , pan am flight 103 took off from london 's heathrow airport , headed for new york .
on board were 259 passengers .
approximately 38 minutes into the flight , the plane exploded at 31,000 feet over lockerbie , scotland , killing all the passengers as well as 11 people on the ground .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pan am 103 memorial in arlington cemetary it took three years of painstaking investigation , but finally in 1999 , officials indicted two libyans , al-amin khalifa fhimah and abdelbaset ali mohmed al-megrahi , on 270 counts of murder .
by then the two men were home and libyan leader moammar gadhafi refused to hand them over .
thus began years of international pressure on libya .
in 1992 the un security council imposed sanctions on libya over its refusal to hand over the men .
it was not until six years later , in 1998 , that gadhafi finally said that the trial could take place , but only in a neutral country .
the us and britain proposed using scottish law in the netherlands and gadhafi agreed .
after nelson mandela visited gadhafi in 1999 , the men were finally extradited and the trial began at camp zeist in the netherlands .
justice takes time the trial began in 2000 , and from the start both of the accused denied any involvement in the lockerbie bombing .
the proceedings lasted a year and in the end , al-megrahi was sentenced to life in prison while al-amin khalifa fhimah , was found not guilty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al-amin khalifa fhimah was found not guilty al-megrahi immediately launched an appeal and fhimah went home .
in 2002 , a panel of five scottish judges began hearing his appeal which was denied three months later .
the next several years saw more legal wrangling between al-megrahi and the scottish legal system .
in 2007 , the scottish criminal cases review commission recommended that he should be granted a second appeal .
power politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libya 's moammar gadhafi paid compensation in the background of all the legal proceedings was a combination of money , oil and politics .
oil makes up a big part of the libyan economy .
according to the cia factbook , the libyan economy depends almost entirely on revenues from the oil sector , which contribute about 95 percent of export earnings , about one quarter of the gross domestic product , and roughly 60 percent of public sector wages .
in other words , un sanctions hit libya very hard .
libya clearly felt the strain and within the last few years the libyans have renounced nuclear arms and agreed to pay compensation to the families of the lockerbie victims .
former british prime minister tony blair was among the first politicians to become involved in helping british petroleum -lrb- bp -rrb- and shell win exploration acreage in libya .

" megrahi now faces a sentence imposed by a higher power , " said scottish justice minister kenny macaskill at a news conference on thursday .
" it is terminal , final and irrevocable .
he is going to die . "
shortly afterwards megrahi boarded a libyan jet that had been sent from tripoli to collect him .
relatives of the victims and the united states government were opposed to his release .
on tuesday us secretary of state hillary clinton said that it would be " absolutely wrong " to free al-megrahi , who was responsible for a " horrendous crime . "
his guilt has always been in question .
some are convinced that he was responsible , while others have consistently labeled his conviction a miscarriage of justice .
either way , megrahi is the only one ever to be tried and convicted .
circumstantial evidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : megrahi is on his way back to libya megrahi , a father of five , was born in tripoli , libya in 1952 .
he has a good command of the english language , a skill he picked up when he studied in the us .
he had also visited britain several times .
he ran an international relations think tank in libya called the center for strategic studies , a job that the fbi has claimed provided him with the perfect cover to work as an operative for the libyan intelligence services -lrb- jso -rrb- .
for a time , he was also based in malta as director of security for libyan arab airways -lrb- laa -rrb- , a job that prosecutors said gave him knowledge and access to secure airlines .
the key piece of evidence in his trial was that pieces of clothing that megrahi had bought in malta were found wrapped around the bomb .
a fateful flight on december 22 , 1988 , pan am flight 103 took off from london 's heathrow airport , headed for new york .
on board were 259 passengers .
approximately 38 minutes into the flight , the plane exploded at 31,000 feet over lockerbie , scotland , killing all the passengers as well as 11 people on the ground .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pan am 103 memorial in arlington cemetary it took three years of painstaking investigation , but finally in 1999 , officials indicted two libyans , al-amin khalifa fhimah and abdelbaset ali mohmed al-megrahi , on 270 counts of murder .
by then the two men were home and libyan leader moammar gadhafi refused to hand them over .
thus began years of international pressure on libya .
in 1992 the un security council imposed sanctions on libya over its refusal to hand over the men .
it was not until six years later , in 1998 , that gadhafi finally said that the trial could take place , but only in a neutral country .
the us and britain proposed using scottish law in the netherlands and gadhafi agreed .
after nelson mandela visited gadhafi in 1999 , the men were finally extradited and the trial began at camp zeist in the netherlands .
justice takes time the trial began in 2000 , and from the start both of the accused denied any involvement in the lockerbie bombing .
the proceedings lasted a year and in the end , al-megrahi was sentenced to life in prison while al-amin khalifa fhimah , was found not guilty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al-amin khalifa fhimah was found not guilty al-megrahi immediately launched an appeal and fhimah went home .
in 2002 , a panel of five scottish judges began hearing his appeal which was denied three months later .
the next several years saw more legal wrangling between al-megrahi and the scottish legal system .
in 2007 , the scottish criminal cases review commission recommended that he should be granted a second appeal .
power politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libya 's moammar gadhafi paid compensation in the background of all the legal proceedings was a combination of money , oil and politics .
oil makes up a big part of the libyan economy .
according to the cia factbook , the libyan economy depends almost entirely on revenues from the oil sector , which contribute about 95 percent of export earnings , about one quarter of the gross domestic product , and roughly 60 percent of public sector wages .
in other words , un sanctions hit libya very hard .
libya clearly felt the strain and within the last few years the libyans have renounced nuclear arms and agreed to pay compensation to the families of the lockerbie victims .
former british prime minister tony blair was among the first politicians to become involved in helping british petroleum -lrb- bp -rrb- and shell win exploration acreage in libya .
the release of al-megrahi could ease tensions between britain and libya and open further business opportunities .

" the recent tragic events at the sayano-shushenskaya hydroelectric plant showed with all clarity how much more we should do to increase reliability of technical constructions on the whole and hydrotechnical ones in particular , " he said .
" technological discipline is very low . "
the official death toll from the catastrophic flood that engulfed russia 's largest hydroelectric station in the country 's khakassia region rose to 17 on thursday after search teams found another three bodies .
russian officials said there was still some hope that some of the 58 people still missing after the aug .
17 accident could be found in air pockets amid the flooded wreckage .
some 100 workers were in the main turbine room early on monday when a massive wave of water flooded in .
officials from the company that owns the hydroelectric dam , rushydro , said many workers would have either drowned or been crushed .
the authorities have yet to give a clear explanation of how the accident occurred , with explanations ranging from a sudden pressure surge to a fault in one of the turbines .
rushydro said a faulty turbine at the plant , commissioned 30 years ago , was the likely cause of the accident .
slim hopes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plant 's second hydroelectric generating unit was destroyed emergencies minister sergei shoigu said around 2,000 rescue workers were working around the clock to clear rubble and drain water in an effort to locate potential survivors .
" my job is not to lose hope , " shoigu told government newspaper rossiiskaya gazeta , adding that the final toll would only be clear after two or three more days of searching .
" do n't ask about possible causes .
some people have rushed to express their own opinions .
completely pointless , " shoigu said .
" the -lrb- investigative -rrb- commission has to work everything out .
" it 's a unique disaster .
its nature is not comprehensible .
nothing like this has ever been seen in the world . "
meanwhile , russian president dmitry medvedev has said steps needed to be taken to shore up power supply to industries affected by monday 's accident .

" the recent tragic events at the sayano-shushenskaya hydroelectric plant showed with all clarity how much more we should do to increase reliability of technical constructions on the whole and hydrotechnical ones in particular , " he said .
" technological discipline is very low . "
the official death toll from the catastrophic flood that engulfed russia 's largest hydroelectric station in the country 's khakassia region rose to 17 on thursday after search teams found another three bodies .
russian officials said there was still some hope that some of the 58 people still missing after the aug .
17 accident could be found in air pockets amid the flooded wreckage .
some 100 workers were in the main turbine room early on monday when a massive wave of water flooded in .
officials from the company that owns the hydroelectric dam , rushydro , said many workers would have either drowned or been crushed .
the authorities have yet to give a clear explanation of how the accident occurred , with explanations ranging from a sudden pressure surge to a fault in one of the turbines .
rushydro said a faulty turbine at the plant , commissioned 30 years ago , was the likely cause of the accident .
slim hopes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plant 's second hydroelectric generating unit was destroyed emergencies minister sergei shoigu said around 2,000 rescue workers were working around the clock to clear rubble and drain water in an effort to locate potential survivors .

" do n't ask about possible causes .
some people have rushed to express their own opinions .
completely pointless , " shoigu said .
" the -lrb- investigative -rrb- commission has to work everything out .
" it 's a unique disaster .
its nature is not comprehensible .
nothing like this has ever been seen in the world . "
meanwhile , russian president dmitry medvedev has said steps needed to be taken to shore up power supply to industries affected by monday 's accident .

a nomadic film project wants to change that – in the tradition of travelling cinema . a big old bus bumps over the cobblestones of a village road in eastern germany , close to the polish border .
it is pulling the kinomobilny - a blue and white trailer transformed into a cinema-popcorn-bar .
the driver , 30-year-old janosch from berlin , is proud of the kinomobilny .
" this is an ' intercamp 2000 , ' a trailer from the gdr .
back then they had small trailers costing 8,000 east german marks , but we got the version they sold for 40,000 , " janosch said .
" this was the export version , made for the western market .
but they only produced 50 because nobody in the west was really interested in premium trailers from the gdr . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crew of " kinomobilny " are taking their show to several towns along the border janosch is one of the 20-strong cinema crew touring along the german-polish border region this summer .
financed partly by the eu , the crew are zigzagging their way along the border in order to screen short films on both sides of the oder and neisse , the rivers separating germany and poland .
tomek from the kulturalny kolletyw team at the university of gdansk organized the polish side of the tour .
he hopes the kinomobilny will bring people on both sides of the border closer together .
" although the border is open , people stick to their own country .
they do not speak a different language than their own and they do not even go to the other side .
this is really strange to me .
i mean , it is so easy to get to the other side of the border , but people are not really interested , " said tomek .
cycling through terra incognita the project 's equipment travels with some of the crew by bus and trailer .
as there are only four seats available , the rest of the german-polish crew are left to make their way using pedal power .
every day they cycle up to 35 miles -lrb- 56 kilometers -rrb- , passing through nature reserves and sleepy villages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : every day the organizers cycle up to 35 miles none of the team members has been to the border region before .

" it is so beautiful and peaceful here .
the bike path runs along the oder and neisse rivers and the landscape is really amazing , " said miriam .
" it is interesting to think that there is so much political meaning to such an idyllic area . "
no rest for the cycling cinema crew as soon as they arrive at the village of boxberg in eastern germany , the crew sets up their open-air cinema .
this involves hanging light bulbs , putting up recliners and checking the projector for the evening 's screening .
some of the crew head into the village to hand out flyers to the local inhabitants .
after sunset the first villagers show up .
they seem surprised that an intercultural project like kinomobilny has stopped in their village .
most of the villagers feel the german-polish relationship is best left to politicians and not something to be tackled in their own backyards - even if poland is only a stone 's throw away .
the program consists of seven german and polish short films that focus on cliches and stereotypes .
but they also show a new , refreshing perspective on polish-german relations .
for example , there 's a rabbit looking for the love of his life at the berlin wall , polish hooligans and the perceived madness of german red tape .
each film is screened in its original language with subtitles in german or polish .
bringing poles and germans closer even though only 20 villagers turned up for the screening , the german-polish cinema initiative went down very well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the open-air cinema shows films in their original language " for sure this film program brings us closer to the poles , there are a lot of people especially in eastern germany that do n't have a clue about what is happening in poland , " said one of the visitors , judith .
" i hope a lot of people get to see these films , " added judith 's boyfriend tobias .

i mean , it is so easy to get to the other side of the border , but people are not really interested , " said tomek .
cycling through terra incognita the project 's equipment travels with some of the crew by bus and trailer .
as there are only four seats available , the rest of the german-polish crew are left to make their way using pedal power .
every day they cycle up to 35 miles -lrb- 56 kilometers -rrb- , passing through nature reserves and sleepy villages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : every day the organizers cycle up to 35 miles none of the team members has been to the border region before .
for 30-year-old miriam from berlin it 's a chance to explore some terra incognita .
" it is so beautiful and peaceful here .
the bike path runs along the oder and neisse rivers and the landscape is really amazing , " said miriam .
" it is interesting to think that there is so much political meaning to such an idyllic area . "
no rest for the cycling cinema crew as soon as they arrive at the village of boxberg in eastern germany , the crew sets up their open-air cinema .
this involves hanging light bulbs , putting up recliners and checking the projector for the evening 's screening .
some of the crew head into the village to hand out flyers to the local inhabitants .
after sunset the first villagers show up .
they seem surprised that an intercultural project like kinomobilny has stopped in their village .
most of the villagers feel the german-polish relationship is best left to politicians and not something to be tackled in their own backyards - even if poland is only a stone 's throw away .
the program consists of seven german and polish short films that focus on cliches and stereotypes .
but they also show a new , refreshing perspective on polish-german relations .
for example , there 's a rabbit looking for the love of his life at the berlin wall , polish hooligans and the perceived madness of german red tape .
each film is screened in its original language with subtitles in german or polish .
bringing poles and germans closer even though only 20 villagers turned up for the screening , the german-polish cinema initiative went down very well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the open-air cinema shows films in their original language " for sure this film program brings us closer to the poles , there are a lot of people especially in eastern germany that do n't have a clue about what is happening in poland , " said one of the visitors , judith .
" i hope a lot of people get to see these films , " added judith 's boyfriend tobias .
thanks to the kinomobilny team , tobias ' wish will be fulfilled .
after boxberg the travelling cinema-come-trailer has eight more stops planned all along the polish-german border .

" the recent tragic events at the sayano-shushenskaya hydroelectric plant showed with all clarity how much more we should do to increase reliability of technical constructions on the whole and hydrotechnical ones in particular , " he said .
" technological discipline is very low . "
the official death toll from the catastrophic flood that engulfed russia 's largest hydroelectric station in the country 's khakassia region rose to 17 on thursday after search teams found another three bodies .
russian officials said there was still some hope that some of the 58 people still missing after the aug .
17 accident could be found in air pockets amid the flooded wreckage .
some 100 workers were in the main turbine room early on monday when a massive wave of water flooded in .
officials from the company that owns the hydroelectric dam , rushydro , said many workers would have either drowned or been crushed .
the authorities have yet to give a clear explanation of how the accident occurred , with explanations ranging from a sudden pressure surge to a fault in one of the turbines .
rushydro said a faulty turbine at the plant , commissioned 30 years ago , was the likely cause of the accident .

the day saw relatively little violence although concerns remain over a possible low turnout due to threats of taliban attacks . " our assessment is that , in general , these elections went much better than we anticipated , " ettore sequi , the european union 's special representative to afghanistan , told afp .
the roughly 6,200 election centers which were able to accept voters was " an achievement considering the concerns before the election , " he added .

he congratulated the voters for their courage in the face of taliban threats .
" seen from a security point of view , the election has been a success , " he said .
" the most important thing is that the election will be considered credible in the eyes of the afghan people . "

the day saw relatively little violence although concerns remain over a possible low turnout due to threats of taliban attacks . " our assessment is that , in general , these elections went much better than we anticipated , " ettore sequi , the european union 's special representative to afghanistan , told afp .
the roughly 6,200 election centers which were able to accept voters was " an achievement considering the concerns before the election , " he added .
despite dozens of taliban missiles and bombs and the deaths of more than 20 people , many international leaders agreed with sequi 's statement .
german chancellor angela merkel called the election " an important chapter in the democratic development of the country . "
nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen said the election was " a testimony to the determination of the afghan people to build democracy . "
he congratulated the voters for their courage in the face of taliban threats .
" seen from a security point of view , the election has been a success , " he said .
" the most important thing is that the election will be considered credible in the eyes of the afghan people . "
while no official voter turnout figures have been released , there is concern that if a low percentage of the 15 million registered voters showed up to cast their ballots , it would diminish the legitimacy of the election .
taliban attacks close some polls , delay voting as voting continued across the country during the day , taliban militants stormed a town in northern afghanistan , launching a multi-pronged assault that left at least eight of them dead and kept polling stations from opening , officials said .

fighting has been going on since morning , " provincial police chief mohammad kabir andarabi told reporters in baghlan .

we have killed 22 terrorists .
most of their bodies are left on the ground , " he added .
abdul majeed azimi , head of the provincial intelligence agency , confirmed the incident but said the corpses of only eight rebels were found .
the local district police chief and one of his guards were also killed .
a 12-year-old boy was wounded in the clashes , he added .
azimi said polling stations did not open in the small town on the highway between pul-i-khumri , the capital of baghlan province , and kunduz province .
" no elections there .
i do n't think there will be because fighting is ongoing , " he said .
residents confirmed to local media that no polling stations were open .

a nomadic film project wants to change that – in the tradition of travelling cinema . a big old bus bumps over the cobblestones of a village road in eastern germany , close to the polish border .
it is pulling the kinomobilny - a blue and white trailer transformed into a cinema-popcorn-bar .
the driver , 30-year-old janosch from berlin , is proud of the kinomobilny .
" this is an ' intercamp 2000 , ' a trailer from the gdr .
back then they had small trailers costing 8,000 east german marks , but we got the version they sold for 40,000 , " janosch said .
" this was the export version , made for the western market .
but they only produced 50 because nobody in the west was really interested in premium trailers from the gdr . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crew of " kinomobilny " are taking their show to several towns along the border janosch is one of the 20-strong cinema crew touring along the german-polish border region this summer .
financed partly by the eu , the crew are zigzagging their way along the border in order to screen short films on both sides of the oder and neisse , the rivers separating germany and poland .
tomek from the kulturalny kolletyw team at the university of gdansk organized the polish side of the tour .
he hopes the kinomobilny will bring people on both sides of the border closer together .
" although the border is open , people stick to their own country .
they do not speak a different language than their own and they do not even go to the other side .
this is really strange to me .
i mean , it is so easy to get to the other side of the border , but people are not really interested , " said tomek .
cycling through terra incognita the project 's equipment travels with some of the crew by bus and trailer .
as there are only four seats available , the rest of the german-polish crew are left to make their way using pedal power .
every day they cycle up to 35 miles -lrb- 56 kilometers -rrb- , passing through nature reserves and sleepy villages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : every day the organizers cycle up to 35 miles none of the team members has been to the border region before .
for 30-year-old miriam from berlin it 's a chance to explore some terra incognita .
" it is so beautiful and peaceful here .
the bike path runs along the oder and neisse rivers and the landscape is really amazing , " said miriam .
" it is interesting to think that there is so much political meaning to such an idyllic area . "
no rest for the cycling cinema crew as soon as they arrive at the village of boxberg in eastern germany , the crew sets up their open-air cinema .
this involves hanging light bulbs , putting up recliners and checking the projector for the evening 's screening .
some of the crew head into the village to hand out flyers to the local inhabitants .
after sunset the first villagers show up .
they seem surprised that an intercultural project like kinomobilny has stopped in their village .
most of the villagers feel the german-polish relationship is best left to politicians and not something to be tackled in their own backyards - even if poland is only a stone 's throw away .
the program consists of seven german and polish short films that focus on cliches and stereotypes .
but they also show a new , refreshing perspective on polish-german relations .
for example , there 's a rabbit looking for the love of his life at the berlin wall , polish hooligans and the perceived madness of german red tape .
each film is screened in its original language with subtitles in german or polish .
bringing poles and germans closer even though only 20 villagers turned up for the screening , the german-polish cinema initiative went down very well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the open-air cinema shows films in their original language " for sure this film program brings us closer to the poles , there are a lot of people especially in eastern germany that do n't have a clue about what is happening in poland , " said one of the visitors , judith .
" i hope a lot of people get to see these films , " added judith 's boyfriend tobias .
thanks to the kinomobilny team , tobias ' wish will be fulfilled .
after boxberg the travelling cinema-come-trailer has eight more stops planned all along the polish-german border .

the day saw relatively little violence although concerns remain over a possible low turnout due to threats of taliban attacks . " our assessment is that , in general , these elections went much better than we anticipated , " ettore sequi , the european union 's special representative to afghanistan , told afp .
the roughly 6,200 election centers which were able to accept voters was " an achievement considering the concerns before the election , " he added .
despite dozens of taliban missiles and bombs and the deaths of more than 20 people , many international leaders agreed with sequi 's statement .
german chancellor angela merkel called the election " an important chapter in the democratic development of the country . "
nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen said the election was " a testimony to the determination of the afghan people to build democracy . "
he congratulated the voters for their courage in the face of taliban threats .
" seen from a security point of view , the election has been a success , " he said .
" the most important thing is that the election will be considered credible in the eyes of the afghan people . "
while no official voter turnout figures have been released , there is concern that if a low percentage of the 15 million registered voters showed up to cast their ballots , it would diminish the legitimacy of the election .
taliban attacks close some polls , delay voting as voting continued across the country during the day , taliban militants stormed a town in northern afghanistan , launching a multi-pronged assault that left at least eight of them dead and kept polling stations from opening , officials said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban attacks disrupted voting in some areas " terrorists attacked from several directions .
fighting has been going on since morning , " provincial police chief mohammad kabir andarabi told reporters in baghlan .
" now , as we speak , the enemy has been pushed back .
we have killed 22 terrorists .
most of their bodies are left on the ground , " he added .
abdul majeed azimi , head of the provincial intelligence agency , confirmed the incident but said the corpses of only eight rebels were found .
the local district police chief and one of his guards were also killed .
a 12-year-old boy was wounded in the clashes , he added .
azimi said polling stations did not open in the small town on the highway between pul-i-khumri , the capital of baghlan province , and kunduz province .
" no elections there .
i do n't think there will be because fighting is ongoing , " he said .
residents confirmed to local media that no polling stations were open .
eu calls on afghans to resist taliban pressure the eu had called on the afghan people to defy the taliban and cast their ballots , as a team of about 100 eu observers kept a watchful eye on the voting process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu and nato commended afghans on their election " we encourage the afghan people to go out and vote on this very important day , which sets the path towards democracy for the afghan nation and its people , " european commission spokesman john clancy said in brussels . clancy said no eu monitors had been injured in any attacks . the eu has the largest international observer mission in afghanistan . european election mission to monitor results headed by philippe morillon , a former french general and now a member of the european parliament , the mission has been monitoring the election campaign and is now focusing on polling , counting and tallying the results . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : morillon 's team will begin monitoring the election results it plans to condemn any serious breach of electoral rules and procedures , with a preliminary statement from morillon expected on saturday . so far , its biggest worry has been with proxy voting . concerns have been fuelled by a suspiciously high rate of registration for female voters in traditionally conservative parts of the country .
despite being escorted by afghan and nato forces , the monitors have not been deployed throughout the country owing to the precarious security situation . the eu is a major donor to afghanistan .
the bloc 's brussels-based executive arm , the european commission , has provided the country with 1.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 2 billion -rrb- in aid since 2002 .
in all , 18 of the eu 's 27 member states have embassies in kabul. hf / nda / afp / dpa / reuters editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the top ten list features japanese cars in the first six places .
" as a member of the green party i want people to buy modern cars with the lowest co2 emissions , " she said , suggesting that the vcd list was a good reference point for these cars .
she expressed regret that the highest-placed german car came in at number seven – the two-seater smart car – and added that german manufacturers " should act as quickly as possible to provide different cars and to secure jobs . "
kuenast found herself in similar trouble two years ago when she called on people to buy the toyota prius hybrid car for its low environmental impact in comparison to other cars .
her statement was seen as a vote of no-confidence in the german car industry .
she also said that she was annoyed with the executive committees at german auto manufacturers which continued to fight at a european level to keep co2 emissions for cars at the highest level possible .

" the government rescue of the struggling hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- mortgage lender prevented a " global financial meltdown , " according to finance minister peer steinbrueck .
the social democrat , answering questions from a parliamentary enquiry investigating the bailout of hre , described the german government 's actions as " appropriate and correct . "
" we made the right decisions , " steinbrueck said .
" it was n't us politicians who caused this financial crisis , but we were the ones who mastered it . "
hypo real estate needed a series of state bailouts to keep it from going under .

" between september 15 and october 5 the financial world stood millimeters away from the cliff edge , " steinbrueck said .
the german finance minister also questioned the us decision to let lehmann brothers fall , describing it as a test with disastrous consequences .

" therefore , i 'm not going to even discuss it . "
steinbrueck said that asmussen had n't negotiated poorly , but rather he 'd fought " tooth and nail - right up to the pain barrier . "
triggered by lehman collapse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors , who were later escorted out of the hearing , disagree with steinbrueck when asked about the tipping point for hypo real estate , steinbrueck pointed to the collapse of us lender lehman brothers in september 2008 , dismissing the political opposition 's claims that the bank was already headed for trouble much earlier in the year .
he said that the lehmann brothers bankruptcy put a dramatic stop to inter-bank lending , thus crippling hypo real estate .
hre and its irish subsidiary depfa had been relying on loans from other lenders in order to keep supplying mortgages for months before lehmann brothers went under .
" between september 15 and october 5 the financial world stood millimeters away from the cliff edge , " steinbrueck said .
the german finance minister also questioned the us decision to let lehmann brothers fall , describing it as a test with disastrous consequences .
after the bankruptcy , leading industrial nations committed not to let similar large financial institutions go bankrupt .
the german government decided that hre - with a value of around 400 billion euros - qualified as an irreplaceable money lender. msh / ap / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 25-year-old vlasic , meanwhile , claimed gold with a jump of 2.04 meters .
friedrich and vlasic have been engaged in a tussle at the peak of world high jumping for the past 12 months , with the german coming out on top in three of the four competitions in which they have faced each other this year in the lead up to the current meet in berlin .
at a golden league event in berlin earlier this year , friedrich leaped to a german record of 2.06 meters - also the highest jump of the year - to take first place .
she was bettered only a few weeks later in monaco , however , when the croat consigned her to her first second-place finish of the year .
but in qualifying for thursday 's final , friedrich sent a clear message to her rival by clearing the 1.95-meter qualifying height on her first jump .
vlasic needed a few extra jumps to clear the same height .
coming into the championships friedrich was considered one of the german athletes most likely to bag a medal .
she is also one of the most recognizable athletes on the track .
her pink knee-high socks , large sunglasses and bleach-blond hair are unmistakable .

panama 's alonso edwards came in second , trailing by 0.62 seconds , and wallace spearmon of the us took bronze .
usain bolt broke the world record in the 100 meters earlier in the week .

terrence trammell and david payne , both of the us , came in second and third .
the women 's 400-meter hurdles final was won by melaine walker of jamaica in 52.42 seconds .

officials say turnout has been healthy , despite sporadic violence by taliban militants determined to sabotage the ballot . a massive afghan and multinational force of 300,000 was put on full alert thursday to safeguard voting and prevent the taliban from unleashing a threatened onslaught .
two taliban insurgents were killed in a gun battle in kabul as sporadic violence across the country threatened to unsettle voters .
the attack , coming after the taliban said 20 of their fighters had infiltrated the capital , was the worst of several on polling stations and voters .
the taliban have struck repeatedly inside the capital in a bloody countdown to elections that are aimed at putting the country more firmly on the path to democracy eight years after the us-led invasion ousted the militia 's regime .
however , despite the violence in places like kandahar in the south and in the northern provinces of baghlan and takhar , the united nations said there were encouraging signs of high turnout .
" the vast majority of polling stations have been able to open and have received voting materials , " said aleem siddique , spokesman for the un mission in kabul .
" we are seeing queues forming at polling stations in the north , also in the capital , as well as , encouragingly , in the east . "
scores of people queued up at polling stations in the capital and major cities under government control , and some 95 percent of 6,500 polling stations opened on schedule , the independent election commission said .
" the turnout is very good , but we do n't have exact figures , " said deputy chief electoral officer zekria barakzai , predicting that it could reach around 50 percent overall .
seventeen million afghans have registered to elect a president and 420 councilors in 34 provinces across the largely rural , impoverished country .
it is a difficult process in a nation where more than 70 percent of people are illiterate and bound by fierce tribal and religious allegiances .
karzai bullish despite energetic abdullah bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai could face a run-off with his rival abdullah abdullah western-backed president hamid karzai hopes to win an outright majority to avoid a run-off , but his nervous government ordered a blackout on reporting on violence during polling day , threatening journalists with heavy penalties .
" i request my dear countrymen to come out and cast their vote to decide their future , " karzai said as he voted in a kabul boys ' school near his heavily fortified palace , dismissing fears of unrest .
however , one opinion poll carried out by a us organization predicted karzai would be forced into a run-off , winning 44 percent of the vote , and his rival abdullah abdullah , who has a northern powerbase and draws on ethnic tajik support , would take 26 percent .
there are around 30 other candidates .
abdullah hailed " a day of change " as he voted alongside his wife and young son amid a throng of journalists and phalanx of security men .
an energetic campaign by the ex-foreign minister has boosted the chance of a run-off , which would take place in around six weeks ' time .
the election is also a test for us president barack obama , who has ordered a massive troop build-up this year as part of a strategy to reverse taliban gains .
obama 's envoy for the region , richard holbrooke , toured polling stations in kabul and said what he 'd seen was " open and honest , " adding : " so far every prediction of disaster turned out to be wrong . "
nato troops on alert and ready to quell violence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attacks ahead of the election put isaf on red alert troops from nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- and afghan forces were still on high alert despite the level of violence being far below that predicted .
" we have been doing an immense amount of work to try and ensure the best possible security for the elections , " lieutenant general jim dutton , the deputy commander of the nato-led force drawn from about 40 nations , told reporters .
" of course the real test is election day , " the british general added .
the biggest threats facing troops were suicide bombers , rockets and maybe ambushes , he said .
" the mission , as for all coalition forces , is to be the least visible to show that this is an election organized by the afghans themselves , " said lieutenant colonel stephane chenel , another nato commander .
" if there is a threat , all forces will be able to intervene .
everyone will be deployed and , in an immediate threat , go anywhere at any moment , " the french officer said .
isaf officials said that despite rising taliban violence , less than one percent of polling stations were at risk of attack .
but isaf spokesman brigadier general eric tremblay acknowledged : " despite the best plans in place , there will always be some residual risk . "
around eight districts – out of 365 nationwide – contain " high risk " areas where polling stations are considered unlikely to open , mainly in the taliban heartland of southern afghanistan. nda / afp / reuters / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

officials say turnout has been healthy , despite sporadic violence by taliban militants determined to sabotage the ballot . a massive afghan and multinational force of 300,000 was put on full alert thursday to safeguard voting and prevent the taliban from unleashing a threatened onslaught .
two taliban insurgents were killed in a gun battle in kabul as sporadic violence across the country threatened to unsettle voters .
the attack , coming after the taliban said 20 of their fighters had infiltrated the capital , was the worst of several on polling stations and voters .
the taliban have struck repeatedly inside the capital in a bloody countdown to elections that are aimed at putting the country more firmly on the path to democracy eight years after the us-led invasion ousted the militia 's regime .
however , despite the violence in places like kandahar in the south and in the northern provinces of baghlan and takhar , the united nations said there were encouraging signs of high turnout .
" the vast majority of polling stations have been able to open and have received voting materials , " said aleem siddique , spokesman for the un mission in kabul .
" we are seeing queues forming at polling stations in the north , also in the capital , as well as , encouragingly , in the east . "
scores of people queued up at polling stations in the capital and major cities under government control , and some 95 percent of 6,500 polling stations opened on schedule , the independent election commission said .
" the turnout is very good , but we do n't have exact figures , " said deputy chief electoral officer zekria barakzai , predicting that it could reach around 50 percent overall .
seventeen million afghans have registered to elect a president and 420 councilors in 34 provinces across the largely rural , impoverished country .
it is a difficult process in a nation where more than 70 percent of people are illiterate and bound by fierce tribal and religious allegiances .
karzai bullish despite energetic abdullah bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai could face a run-off with his rival abdullah abdullah western-backed president hamid karzai hopes to win an outright majority to avoid a run-off , but his nervous government ordered a blackout on reporting on violence during polling day , threatening journalists with heavy penalties .
" i request my dear countrymen to come out and cast their vote to decide their future , " karzai said as he voted in a kabul boys ' school near his heavily fortified palace , dismissing fears of unrest .
however , one opinion poll carried out by a us organization predicted karzai would be forced into a run-off , winning 44 percent of the vote , and his rival abdullah abdullah , who has a northern powerbase and draws on ethnic tajik support , would take 26 percent .
there are around 30 other candidates .
abdullah hailed " a day of change " as he voted alongside his wife and young son amid a throng of journalists and phalanx of security men .
an energetic campaign by the ex-foreign minister has boosted the chance of a run-off , which would take place in around six weeks ' time .
the election is also a test for us president barack obama , who has ordered a massive troop build-up this year as part of a strategy to reverse taliban gains .
obama 's envoy for the region , richard holbrooke , toured polling stations in kabul and said what he 'd seen was " open and honest , " adding : " so far every prediction of disaster turned out to be wrong . "
nato troops on alert and ready to quell violence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attacks ahead of the election put isaf on red alert troops from nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- and afghan forces were still on high alert despite the level of violence being far below that predicted .
" we have been doing an immense amount of work to try and ensure the best possible security for the elections , " lieutenant general jim dutton , the deputy commander of the nato-led force drawn from about 40 nations , told reporters .
" of course the real test is election day , " the british general added .
the biggest threats facing troops were suicide bombers , rockets and maybe ambushes , he said .
" the mission , as for all coalition forces , is to be the least visible to show that this is an election organized by the afghans themselves , " said lieutenant colonel stephane chenel , another nato commander .
" if there is a threat , all forces will be able to intervene .
everyone will be deployed and , in an immediate threat , go anywhere at any moment , " the french officer said .
isaf officials said that despite rising taliban violence , less than one percent of polling stations were at risk of attack .
but isaf spokesman brigadier general eric tremblay acknowledged : " despite the best plans in place , there will always be some residual risk . "
around eight districts – out of 365 nationwide – contain " high risk " areas where polling stations are considered unlikely to open , mainly in the taliban heartland of southern afghanistan. nda / afp / reuters / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

former porsche chief wendelin wiedeking is also under investigation . dealings by wiedeking and former porsche chief financial officer holger haerter , both of whom resigned from their posts last month , are being examined by germany 's financial supervisory authority -lrb- bafin -rrb- on suspicion of market manipulation .
part of the bafin investigation will focus on recent fluctuations in share prices at competitor-cum-merger partner volkswagen .
during the drawn-out merger negotiations between vw and porsche , a collection of cash settlement options in vw shares earned porsche billions as the stock climbed in value .
the stock revaluation that resulted briefly made porsche the world 's biggest company by market capitalization .
until a few months ago porsche was making more money from its financial dealings than from car sales at a time when carmakers around the world were suffering from a collapse in global auto markets .
under wiedeking , porsche accumulated a 51-percent stake in its much larger rival vw , europe 's largest carmaker , and wanted to take full control but the attempt failed and left porsche squeezed under a huge debt pile .
following a tip from bafin , stuttgart prosecutors launched a separate inquiry into porsche with police seizing documents in their raid on thursday .
porsche has denied the allegations of market manipulation and said it would cooperate and assist investigators .

under wiedeking , porsche accumulated a 51-percent stake in its much larger rival vw , europe 's largest carmaker , and wanted to take full control but the attempt failed and left porsche squeezed under a huge debt pile .

just germany 's latest political sensation : a comedian in the guise of a scruffy small-time journalist named horst schlaemmer , whose fake bid for the german chancellorship has injected some real humor into a boring campaign season .
the undeniably unappealing alter ego of popular german funnyman hape kerkeling is the star of his own feature film , which debuted to throngs of fans in berlin on thursday .
the movie , " isch kandidiere " -lrb- " i 'm running for chancellor ! " -rrb- follows the faux candidate as he looks for support among the common people and german stars like rapper bushido and ex-racing champion michael schumacher .
bushido also contributed schlaemmer 's campaign song .
" first of all , i 'd like to point out that the horst schlaemmer party stands for justice , and of course it stands for freedom , and yes , women 's emancipation - but i 've forgotten the rest of your question , " schlaemmer told deutsche welle .

" his trademark look includes an ill-fitting trench coat , glasses that cover what little of his face is n't hidden behind his bushy mustache , and a dirty grey wig .
schlaemmer has gained the kind of media exposure and enthusiasm that more legitimate contenders for the chancellor 's seat can only dream of .
but perhaps that 's to be expected when your campaign promises include state-subsidized tanning and cradle-to-grave income .
two major german television channels aired live coverage of schlaemmer 's first press conference for nearly two hours .
in contrast , those same networks cut away from real-life candidate frank-walter steinmeier as he was explaining how he 'd fulfill a campaign promise of creating 4 million jobs by 2020 .
eighteen percent of the people surveyed by german polling institute forsa said they could imagine voting for schlaemmer 's party if it did in fact exist in real life .
that 's not so much less than the latest poll numbers for the social democratic party , currently in opposition , which garnered just 22 percent of registered voters ' support , according to forsa .
" schlaemmer is an alternative to your usual grey-suited politician in germany , " political scientist gero neugebauer of berlin 's free university told afp .

his poll ratings are the envy of many real-life politicians . what snorts like a warthog rooting for grubs , has hair like a vintage rabbit pelt , and sports an overbite rarely seen outside of the animal kingdom ?
just germany 's latest political sensation : a comedian in the guise of a scruffy small-time journalist named horst schlaemmer , whose fake bid for the german chancellorship has injected some real humor into a boring campaign season .
the undeniably unappealing alter ego of popular german funnyman hape kerkeling is the star of his own feature film , which debuted to throngs of fans in berlin on thursday .
the movie , " isch kandidiere " -lrb- " i 'm running for chancellor ! " -rrb- follows the faux candidate as he looks for support among the common people and german stars like rapper bushido and ex-racing champion michael schumacher .
bushido also contributed schlaemmer 's campaign song .
" first of all , i 'd like to point out that the horst schlaemmer party stands for justice , and of course it stands for freedom , and yes , women 's emancipation - but i 've forgotten the rest of your question , " schlaemmer told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people were taken in by hape kerkeling 's 1991 impersonation of queen beatrix of the netherlands riffing off of the slogan that won barack obama the american presidency , schlaemmer 's campaign catchphrase is " yes weekend . " his trademark look includes an ill-fitting trench coat , glasses that cover what little of his face is n't hidden behind his bushy mustache , and a dirty grey wig .
schlaemmer has gained the kind of media exposure and enthusiasm that more legitimate contenders for the chancellor 's seat can only dream of .
but perhaps that 's to be expected when your campaign promises include state-subsidized tanning and cradle-to-grave income .
two major german television channels aired live coverage of schlaemmer 's first press conference for nearly two hours .
in contrast , those same networks cut away from real-life candidate frank-walter steinmeier as he was explaining how he 'd fulfill a campaign promise of creating 4 million jobs by 2020 .
eighteen percent of the people surveyed by german polling institute forsa said they could imagine voting for schlaemmer 's party if it did in fact exist in real life .
that 's not so much less than the latest poll numbers for the social democratic party , currently in opposition , which garnered just 22 percent of registered voters ' support , according to forsa .
" schlaemmer is an alternative to your usual grey-suited politician in germany , " political scientist gero neugebauer of berlin 's free university told afp .
" i can imagine people are fed up with politics and politicians ... the boring campaign makes schlaemmer more interesting . "

meanwhile , caster semenya 's win struck some observers as a bit too resounding . spectators at berlin 's olympic stadium got a treat wednesday evening , cheering on a local athlete to victory in the discus .
robert harting , on his last throw of the competition , bested poland 's piotr malachowski by 28 centimeters , casting his disc 69.43 meters .
the mark was a personal best for the berlin resident , and he said the home crowd had driven him to it .
" that last meter in my final throw was thanks to this crowd , " harting told reporters .
" the fans were unbelievable , and they screamed their hearts out .
the crowd helped me in this final throw . "
it was harting 's first world championship gold medal after a silver in 2007 , and germany 's second of the competition .
reigning olympic champion and 2007 winner gerd kanter of estonia came third with a throw of 66.88 meters .
taboo breaker harting 's win , which he celebrated in style by ripping his shirt off for the camera and picking up the games ' mascot , marked a happy end to a turbulent couple of weeks for the athlete .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harting tore off his shirt after winning in an interview less than two weeks before the world championships he had said that he thought the anti-doping movement was misguided .
“ where there 's money , there will be doping , ” said harting .
“ sometimes i ask myself whether it might be better to allow doping in some form … at least that would stop people from getting so worked up about it . ”
germany 's athletic federation came out strongly against harting 's statements , and he tried to mollify them on his website in the days that followed .
still , once the meet began , harting could n't resist one more shot at the anti-doping crusaders .
as part of a campaign on behalf of former east german athletes who had been doped in the communist era , a group had given out cardboard eyeglasses frames to spectators , so that they might show their support for taking an even closer look into doping in sports .
harting , when asked what he thought of the glasses , quipped that he hoped his discus might spring up and take out a pair on the bounce .
the comment landed harting in hot water with the sport 's power brokers again , but judging from the crowd 's reaction , it did n't hurt his popularity among fans .
difficult question for south africa 's caster semenya , meanwhile , the controversy is just beginning .
she blew away the rest of the field in the women 's 800 meters , clocking in at 1:55.45 , more than two seconds and 15 meters ahead of the next best runner , janeth jepkosgei of kenya .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : semenya 's gender is to be tested but semenya 's powerful build , deep voice and rapid improvement in recent months has led some , including world athletics body iaaf , to seek to find out whether she belongs in the women 's competition at all .
the 18-year-old now faces a series of tests to confirm her gender , which officials say could take months to complete .
" at the moment there is no proof .
the benefit of the doubt has to be with the athlete , " said iaaf general secretary pierre weiss .
" but if at the end it is proven -lsb- that she is not a woman -rsb- then the medal will be withdrawn . "
the 18-year-old was shielded from the media , while jepkosgei and britain 's third place finisher jenny meadows did not want to comment on the controversy .

meanwhile , caster semenya 's win struck some observers as a bit too resounding . spectators at berlin 's olympic stadium got a treat wednesday evening , cheering on a local athlete to victory in the discus .
robert harting , on his last throw of the competition , bested poland 's piotr malachowski by 28 centimeters , casting his disc 69.43 meters .
the mark was a personal best for the berlin resident , and he said the home crowd had driven him to it .
" that last meter in my final throw was thanks to this crowd , " harting told reporters .
" the fans were unbelievable , and they screamed their hearts out .
the crowd helped me in this final throw . "
it was harting 's first world championship gold medal after a silver in 2007 , and germany 's second of the competition .
reigning olympic champion and 2007 winner gerd kanter of estonia came third with a throw of 66.88 meters .
taboo breaker harting 's win , which he celebrated in style by ripping his shirt off for the camera and picking up the games ' mascot , marked a happy end to a turbulent couple of weeks for the athlete .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harting tore off his shirt after winning in an interview less than two weeks before the world championships he had said that he thought the anti-doping movement was misguided .
“ where there 's money , there will be doping , ” said harting .
“ sometimes i ask myself whether it might be better to allow doping in some form … at least that would stop people from getting so worked up about it . ”
germany 's athletic federation came out strongly against harting 's statements , and he tried to mollify them on his website in the days that followed .
still , once the meet began , harting could n't resist one more shot at the anti-doping crusaders .
as part of a campaign on behalf of former east german athletes who had been doped in the communist era , a group had given out cardboard eyeglasses frames to spectators , so that they might show their support for taking an even closer look into doping in sports .
harting , when asked what he thought of the glasses , quipped that he hoped his discus might spring up and take out a pair on the bounce .
the comment landed harting in hot water with the sport 's power brokers again , but judging from the crowd 's reaction , it did n't hurt his popularity among fans .
difficult question for south africa 's caster semenya , meanwhile , the controversy is just beginning .
she blew away the rest of the field in the women 's 800 meters , clocking in at 1:55.45 , more than two seconds and 15 meters ahead of the next best runner , janeth jepkosgei of kenya .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : semenya 's gender is to be tested but semenya 's powerful build , deep voice and rapid improvement in recent months has led some , including world athletics body iaaf , to seek to find out whether she belongs in the women 's competition at all .
the 18-year-old now faces a series of tests to confirm her gender , which officials say could take months to complete .
" at the moment there is no proof .
the benefit of the doubt has to be with the athlete , " said iaaf general secretary pierre weiss .
" but if at the end it is proven -lsb- that she is not a woman -rsb- then the medal will be withdrawn . "
the 18-year-old was shielded from the media , while jepkosgei and britain 's third place finisher jenny meadows did not want to comment on the controversy .

the attacks were the worst since the beginning of the us withdrawal , writes rainer sollich , head of dw 's arabic service . statistics frequently say little about actual circumstances , such as whether or not the most recent terror attacks in iraq are a result of the us troop draw down .
the number of victims in the weeks before american troops began leaving iraqi city centers had actually increased .
after their withdrawal , the violence decreased at first , only to re-emerge in the form of a bloodbath in the middle of baghdad .
if there are any conclusions to be drawn from this , then only that with or without us troops , iraq remains in the clutches of violence and terror .
security , of course , has markedly improved in the last couple of years , but the official iraqi and american claims that the situation is under control display a rather peculiar interpretation of calm .
iraq is still gripped by the constant threat of violence .
attacks continue unabated attacks are reported on almost a daily basis , although the general public is not aware of many of them .
it is a sad but logical consequence of the never-ending media coverage that the topic of " terror in iraq " has worn thin and now garners little international interest .
an attack with " just " four or five dead no longer warrants a headline , but then , when the number of victims jumps dramatically , the customary response mechanisms shift into gear .
the un security council , the white house and the european union all condemn the violence in unison , and media outlets provide the public with the gory details of death and destruction as well as displays of dismay , anger and sympathy .
people around the world see the images on television and ask themselves : where does all this hate come from and how can people be capable of subjecting others to such senseless pain and suffering ?

fertile ground for terrorists the latest wave of violence in baghdad illustrates the deficits within the iraqi government to guarantee security and promote national reconciliation .
the government has announced plans to close the existing gaps in security , and that is an important first step .
but it can not be the only one .
terrorists will always find fertile ground and support from segments of the iraqi population , or from abroad , as long as the conflict between ethnic and religious groups and their leaders is unresolved .
the lack of mutual respect and the thirst for revenge will not disappear overnight – and neither will the thirst for power and the country 's oil reserves .
it may seem bold , even risky , that the united states is sticking to its plan to withdraw from iraq completely by the end of 2011 .
however , this may be the appropriate leverage to force the government in baghdad to undertake greater efforts to solve its domestic conflicts and pursue a path of national reconciliation .

the number of victims in the weeks before american troops began leaving iraqi city centers had actually increased .
after their withdrawal , the violence decreased at first , only to re-emerge in the form of a bloodbath in the middle of baghdad .
if there are any conclusions to be drawn from this , then only that with or without us troops , iraq remains in the clutches of violence and terror .
security , of course , has markedly improved in the last couple of years , but the official iraqi and american claims that the situation is under control display a rather peculiar interpretation of calm .
iraq is still gripped by the constant threat of violence .
attacks continue unabated attacks are reported on almost a daily basis , although the general public is not aware of many of them .
it is a sad but logical consequence of the never-ending media coverage that the topic of " terror in iraq " has worn thin and now garners little international interest .
an attack with " just " four or five dead no longer warrants a headline , but then , when the number of victims jumps dramatically , the customary response mechanisms shift into gear .
the un security council , the white house and the european union all condemn the violence in unison , and media outlets provide the public with the gory details of death and destruction as well as displays of dismay , anger and sympathy .
people around the world see the images on television and ask themselves : where does all this hate come from and how can people be capable of subjecting others to such senseless pain and suffering ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainer sollich , head of dw 's arabic service the answer is as simple as it is cynical .
it is done expressly for that purpose .
the perpetrators intended to strike the innocent and spread fear .
they do not want iraq to be peaceful ; they enjoy the international condemnation .
and they want to see their deeds on television .
every form of media attention lends weight to their acts of terror .
however , no revamping of media ethics – no matter how sophisticated – can help .
what is needed , first and foremost , is drastically improved security .
fertile ground for terrorists the latest wave of violence in baghdad illustrates the deficits within the iraqi government to guarantee security and promote national reconciliation .
the government has announced plans to close the existing gaps in security , and that is an important first step .
but it can not be the only one .
terrorists will always find fertile ground and support from segments of the iraqi population , or from abroad , as long as the conflict between ethnic and religious groups and their leaders is unresolved .
the lack of mutual respect and the thirst for revenge will not disappear overnight – and neither will the thirst for power and the country 's oil reserves .
it may seem bold , even risky , that the united states is sticking to its plan to withdraw from iraq completely by the end of 2011 .
however , this may be the appropriate leverage to force the government in baghdad to undertake greater efforts to solve its domestic conflicts and pursue a path of national reconciliation .

in addition , four eu countries have privately told the administration that they are committed to resettling detainees , and five other eu nations are considering taking some , according to officials in us president barack obama 's administration , who spoke to the newspaper on the condition of anonymity .
there are still 229 prisoners at the camp , which was opened in january 2002 by then president george w. bush to hold " enemy combatants " in the us " war on terror . "
obama has ordered the camp to be closed by january 22 , 2010 .
to meet that goal , the administration has appointed daniel fried , a longtime diplomat with deep ties to eastern europe and parts of the former soviet union , to lead negotiations with other countries .
some 80 prisoners are ready for release .
the post said that if resettling agreements could be made , a reduced detainee population would likely ease the politically charged debate on moving remaining prisoners to a facility on us soil .
of the detainees cleared for release so far , eleven have been transferred home or to third countries , including bermuda , which accepted four chinese uighurs .
the pacific island of palau has agreed to resettle the 13 remaining uighur detainees , and more than half of them are willing to go or are seriously considering the offer .
us looking towards eastern europe in addition , the administration has held positive talks with australia and georgia , and it has formally approached or is planning to hold talks with countries in south america , the persian gulf , the balkans and the former soviet union , the post wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama has pledged to close the camp by 2010 congress has blocked the white house from resettling any detainees in the united states , a move that us and some european officials feared would lead other countries , particularly in the eu , to refuse to help close the military prison .
but the issue has proved relatively unproblematic , officials said .
" obama has a lot of political capital .
countries want to do something for him , and that allows us to say , ' this is it , this is what we want you to do , " ' said a senior administration official quoted in the report .
" this is going a lot better than we might have thought . "
one senior administration official said negotiations in eastern europe will intensify once detainees arrive in larger eu countries , such as italy and spain .
the post also reported that us and european officials believe stalled negotiations with berlin can be rekindled after germany holds national parliamentary elections next month .

there are still 229 prisoners at the camp , which was opened in january 2002 by then president george w. bush to hold " enemy combatants " in the us " war on terror . "
obama has ordered the camp to be closed by january 22 , 2010 .
to meet that goal , the administration has appointed daniel fried , a longtime diplomat with deep ties to eastern europe and parts of the former soviet union , to lead negotiations with other countries .
some 80 prisoners are ready for release .
the post said that if resettling agreements could be made , a reduced detainee population would likely ease the politically charged debate on moving remaining prisoners to a facility on us soil .

deutsche welle 's peter philipp looks at who stands to profit from the destabilization of afghanistan . in afghanistan 's eventful history , it was largely the interests of large foreign powers that prevented peace in the country at the foothills of the hindukush mountains . the foreign powers included the british , who pursued their own interests there , the russians and finally the americans - together with allies pakistan and saudi arabia . caught between powerful foreign interests the issues at stake were securing british supply lanes to india , ensuring russian access to the indian ocean , and finally repelling and beating back the soviet union with the help of the three-way alliance of washington , islamabad and riyadh . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche welle 's peter philipp those interests never focused on bolstering a strong afghan state , rather they were about installing an accommodating central government in kabul and maintaining a system of loyal regional chieftains in the country .
it was a system that had worked for centuries in afghanistan .
or sometimes it did n't . an afghan proverb speaks of a " a king under every tree . "
the king - and that included the presidents of the country - were merely seen as mayors of the capital kabul .
and their power was only recognized in the provinces if they sealed " deals " with the local rulers and gave them a free hand to run their own affairs . drugs trade flourishing that 's exactly what current president hamid karzai is doing .
once celebrated as the savior of afghanistan by the us and europe , karzai has long left the path of democracy and the rule of law . he has allied himself with regional " warlords " who are meant to ensure karzai power and influence in the provinces and who in return can thwart any attempt at normalization .
corruption is a daily occurrence but what 's worse is that the growing of poppy has reached record volumes in recent years , making afghanistan a notorious leading world exporter of drugs . ordinary farmers do n't earn a lot with their poppy fields but it 's still much more than what they would make with alternative crops such as wheat .
the " warlords " have long-turned into powerful " drug bosses " who rake in huge profits to finance their weapons and who are thus difficult to pressurize . these druglords are flexible and ready to hammer out an alliance with just about anybody .
the main thing is that their powerful positions are untouched . they also work together with the taliban , who are against the opium trade on religious and ideological grounds , but have long used this lucrative economic and agricultural sector for their own purposes . stabilizing afghanistan foreign nations - from afghanistan 's neighbors to europe and the us - are today more interested in calming the situation and stabilizing afghanistan . those interested in the opposite are primarily the regional rulers and the drug bosses who do n't want to give up their power and influence .
to curb their power , more pressure needs to be exerted on the central government and the president , the taliban needs to be defeated and ordinary afghans need to be given new opportunities to earn money . but none of that has happened so far .
still , about 50 drug dealers are included in the 367 names on an exhaustive wanted-persons list compiled by the us in afghanistan .
they are accused of cooperating with the taliban . but those who work together with the central government in kabul are n't included in any list .
this despite the fact that they pose a similar obstacle to normalization in afghanistan . peter philipp is deutsche welle 's an expert on the middle east . -lrb- sp -rrb- editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it is pulling the kinomobilny - a blue and white trailer transformed into a cinema-popcorn-bar .
the driver , 30-year-old janosch from berlin , is proud of the kinomobilny .
" this is an ' intercamp 2000 , ' a trailer from the gdr .
back then they had small trailers costing 8,000 east german marks , but we got the version they sold for 40,000 , " janosch said .
" this was the export version , made for the western market .
but they only produced 50 because nobody in the west was really interested in premium trailers from the gdr . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crew of " kinomobilny " are taking their show to several towns along the border janosch is one of the 20-strong cinema crew touring along the german-polish border region this summer .
financed partly by the eu , the crew are zigzagging their way along the border in order to screen short films on both sides of the oder and neisse , the rivers separating germany and poland .
tomek from the kulturalny kolletyw team at the university of gdansk organized the polish side of the tour .
he hopes the kinomobilny will bring people on both sides of the border closer together .
" although the border is open , people stick to their own country .
they do not speak a different language than their own and they do not even go to the other side .
this is really strange to me .
i mean , it is so easy to get to the other side of the border , but people are not really interested , " said tomek .
cycling through terra incognita the project 's equipment travels with some of the crew by bus and trailer .
as there are only four seats available , the rest of the german-polish crew are left to make their way using pedal power .
every day they cycle up to 35 miles -lrb- 56 kilometers -rrb- , passing through nature reserves and sleepy villages .

for 30-year-old miriam from berlin it 's a chance to explore some terra incognita .
" it is so beautiful and peaceful here .
the bike path runs along the oder and neisse rivers and the landscape is really amazing , " said miriam .
" it is interesting to think that there is so much political meaning to such an idyllic area . "
no rest for the cycling cinema crew as soon as they arrive at the village of boxberg in eastern germany , the crew sets up their open-air cinema .
this involves hanging light bulbs , putting up recliners and checking the projector for the evening 's screening .
some of the crew head into the village to hand out flyers to the local inhabitants .
after sunset the first villagers show up .
they seem surprised that an intercultural project like kinomobilny has stopped in their village .
most of the villagers feel the german-polish relationship is best left to politicians and not something to be tackled in their own backyards - even if poland is only a stone 's throw away .
the program consists of seven german and polish short films that focus on cliches and stereotypes .
but they also show a new , refreshing perspective on polish-german relations .
for example , there 's a rabbit looking for the love of his life at the berlin wall , polish hooligans and the perceived madness of german red tape .
each film is screened in its original language with subtitles in german or polish .
bringing poles and germans closer even though only 20 villagers turned up for the screening , the german-polish cinema initiative went down very well .

a nomadic film project wants to change that – in the tradition of travelling cinema . a big old bus bumps over the cobblestones of a village road in eastern germany , close to the polish border .
it is pulling the kinomobilny - a blue and white trailer transformed into a cinema-popcorn-bar .
the driver , 30-year-old janosch from berlin , is proud of the kinomobilny .
" this is an ' intercamp 2000 , ' a trailer from the gdr .
back then they had small trailers costing 8,000 east german marks , but we got the version they sold for 40,000 , " janosch said .
" this was the export version , made for the western market .
but they only produced 50 because nobody in the west was really interested in premium trailers from the gdr . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crew of " kinomobilny " are taking their show to several towns along the border janosch is one of the 20-strong cinema crew touring along the german-polish border region this summer .
financed partly by the eu , the crew are zigzagging their way along the border in order to screen short films on both sides of the oder and neisse , the rivers separating germany and poland .
tomek from the kulturalny kolletyw team at the university of gdansk organized the polish side of the tour .
he hopes the kinomobilny will bring people on both sides of the border closer together .
" although the border is open , people stick to their own country .
they do not speak a different language than their own and they do not even go to the other side .
this is really strange to me .
i mean , it is so easy to get to the other side of the border , but people are not really interested , " said tomek .
cycling through terra incognita the project 's equipment travels with some of the crew by bus and trailer .
as there are only four seats available , the rest of the german-polish crew are left to make their way using pedal power .
every day they cycle up to 35 miles -lrb- 56 kilometers -rrb- , passing through nature reserves and sleepy villages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : every day the organizers cycle up to 35 miles none of the team members has been to the border region before .
for 30-year-old miriam from berlin it 's a chance to explore some terra incognita .
" it is so beautiful and peaceful here .
the bike path runs along the oder and neisse rivers and the landscape is really amazing , " said miriam .
" it is interesting to think that there is so much political meaning to such an idyllic area . "
no rest for the cycling cinema crew as soon as they arrive at the village of boxberg in eastern germany , the crew sets up their open-air cinema .
this involves hanging light bulbs , putting up recliners and checking the projector for the evening 's screening .
some of the crew head into the village to hand out flyers to the local inhabitants .
after sunset the first villagers show up .
they seem surprised that an intercultural project like kinomobilny has stopped in their village .
most of the villagers feel the german-polish relationship is best left to politicians and not something to be tackled in their own backyards - even if poland is only a stone 's throw away .
the program consists of seven german and polish short films that focus on cliches and stereotypes .
but they also show a new , refreshing perspective on polish-german relations .
for example , there 's a rabbit looking for the love of his life at the berlin wall , polish hooligans and the perceived madness of german red tape .
each film is screened in its original language with subtitles in german or polish .
bringing poles and germans closer even though only 20 villagers turned up for the screening , the german-polish cinema initiative went down very well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the open-air cinema shows films in their original language " for sure this film program brings us closer to the poles , there are a lot of people especially in eastern germany that do n't have a clue about what is happening in poland , " said one of the visitors , judith .
" i hope a lot of people get to see these films , " added judith 's boyfriend tobias .
thanks to the kinomobilny team , tobias ' wish will be fulfilled .
after boxberg the travelling cinema-come-trailer has eight more stops planned all along the polish-german border .

the 25-year-old vlasic , meanwhile , claimed gold with a jump of 2.04 meters .
friedrich and vlasic have been engaged in a tussle at the peak of world high jumping for the past 12 months , with the german coming out on top in three of the four competitions in which they have faced each other this year in the lead up to the current meet in berlin .
at a golden league event in berlin earlier this year , friedrich leaped to a german record of 2.06 meters - also the highest jump of the year - to take first place .
she was bettered only a few weeks later in monaco , however , when the croat consigned her to her first second-place finish of the year .
but in qualifying for thursday 's final , friedrich sent a clear message to her rival by clearing the 1.95-meter qualifying height on her first jump .
vlasic needed a few extra jumps to clear the same height .
coming into the championships friedrich was considered one of the german athletes most likely to bag a medal .
she is also one of the most recognizable athletes on the track .
her pink knee-high socks , large sunglasses and bleach-blond hair are unmistakable .

meanwhile , caster semenya 's win struck some observers as a bit too resounding . spectators at berlin 's olympic stadium got a treat wednesday evening , cheering on a local athlete to victory in the discus .
robert harting , on his last throw of the competition , bested poland 's piotr malachowski by 28 centimeters , casting his disc 69.43 meters .
the mark was a personal best for the berlin resident , and he said the home crowd had driven him to it .
" that last meter in my final throw was thanks to this crowd , " harting told reporters .
" the fans were unbelievable , and they screamed their hearts out .
the crowd helped me in this final throw . "
it was harting 's first world championship gold medal after a silver in 2007 , and germany 's second of the competition .
reigning olympic champion and 2007 winner gerd kanter of estonia came third with a throw of 66.88 meters .
taboo breaker harting 's win , which he celebrated in style by ripping his shirt off for the camera and picking up the games ' mascot , marked a happy end to a turbulent couple of weeks for the athlete .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harting tore off his shirt after winning in an interview less than two weeks before the world championships he had said that he thought the anti-doping movement was misguided .
“ where there 's money , there will be doping , ” said harting .
“ sometimes i ask myself whether it might be better to allow doping in some form … at least that would stop people from getting so worked up about it . ”
germany 's athletic federation came out strongly against harting 's statements , and he tried to mollify them on his website in the days that followed .
still , once the meet began , harting could n't resist one more shot at the anti-doping crusaders .
as part of a campaign on behalf of former east german athletes who had been doped in the communist era , a group had given out cardboard eyeglasses frames to spectators , so that they might show their support for taking an even closer look into doping in sports .
harting , when asked what he thought of the glasses , quipped that he hoped his discus might spring up and take out a pair on the bounce .
the comment landed harting in hot water with the sport 's power brokers again , but judging from the crowd 's reaction , it did n't hurt his popularity among fans .
difficult question for south africa 's caster semenya , meanwhile , the controversy is just beginning .
she blew away the rest of the field in the women 's 800 meters , clocking in at 1:55.45 , more than two seconds and 15 meters ahead of the next best runner , janeth jepkosgei of kenya .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : semenya 's gender is to be tested but semenya 's powerful build , deep voice and rapid improvement in recent months has led some , including world athletics body iaaf , to seek to find out whether she belongs in the women 's competition at all .
the 18-year-old now faces a series of tests to confirm her gender , which officials say could take months to complete .
" at the moment there is no proof .
the benefit of the doubt has to be with the athlete , " said iaaf general secretary pierre weiss .
" but if at the end it is proven -lsb- that she is not a woman -rsb- then the medal will be withdrawn . "
the 18-year-old was shielded from the media , while jepkosgei and britain 's third place finisher jenny meadows did not want to comment on the controversy .

meanwhile , caster semenya 's win struck some observers as a bit too resounding . spectators at berlin 's olympic stadium got a treat wednesday evening , cheering on a local athlete to victory in the discus .
robert harting , on his last throw of the competition , bested poland 's piotr malachowski by 28 centimeters , casting his disc 69.43 meters .
the mark was a personal best for the berlin resident , and he said the home crowd had driven him to it .
" that last meter in my final throw was thanks to this crowd , " harting told reporters .
" the fans were unbelievable , and they screamed their hearts out .
the crowd helped me in this final throw . "
it was harting 's first world championship gold medal after a silver in 2007 , and germany 's second of the competition .
reigning olympic champion and 2007 winner gerd kanter of estonia came third with a throw of 66.88 meters .
taboo breaker harting 's win , which he celebrated in style by ripping his shirt off for the camera and picking up the games ' mascot , marked a happy end to a turbulent couple of weeks for the athlete .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harting tore off his shirt after winning in an interview less than two weeks before the world championships he had said that he thought the anti-doping movement was misguided .
“ where there 's money , there will be doping , ” said harting .
“ sometimes i ask myself whether it might be better to allow doping in some form … at least that would stop people from getting so worked up about it . ”
germany 's athletic federation came out strongly against harting 's statements , and he tried to mollify them on his website in the days that followed .
still , once the meet began , harting could n't resist one more shot at the anti-doping crusaders .
as part of a campaign on behalf of former east german athletes who had been doped in the communist era , a group had given out cardboard eyeglasses frames to spectators , so that they might show their support for taking an even closer look into doping in sports .
harting , when asked what he thought of the glasses , quipped that he hoped his discus might spring up and take out a pair on the bounce .
the comment landed harting in hot water with the sport 's power brokers again , but judging from the crowd 's reaction , it did n't hurt his popularity among fans .
difficult question for south africa 's caster semenya , meanwhile , the controversy is just beginning .
she blew away the rest of the field in the women 's 800 meters , clocking in at 1:55.45 , more than two seconds and 15 meters ahead of the next best runner , janeth jepkosgei of kenya .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : semenya 's gender is to be tested but semenya 's powerful build , deep voice and rapid improvement in recent months has led some , including world athletics body iaaf , to seek to find out whether she belongs in the women 's competition at all .
the 18-year-old now faces a series of tests to confirm her gender , which officials say could take months to complete .
" at the moment there is no proof .
the benefit of the doubt has to be with the athlete , " said iaaf general secretary pierre weiss .
" but if at the end it is proven -lsb- that she is not a woman -rsb- then the medal will be withdrawn . "
the 18-year-old was shielded from the media , while jepkosgei and britain 's third place finisher jenny meadows did not want to comment on the controversy .

former foreign minister abdullah abdullah , former finance minister ashraf ghani and former planning minister ramazan bashardost are the main challengers to karzai .
in the past , all three have served in his government .
voters are also electing 420 provincial council members spread out over the country 's 34 provinces .
death threats taliban militants vowed to disrupt the vote and have threatened to slit the throats and chop off fingers of anyone who votes on thursday .
afghan and nato military officials offered assurances that more than 100,000 international troops and around 200,000 afghan forces were on high alert and were prepared to neutralize any attack that might be mounted by the taliban .
in kabul , shops and business were closed and round-the-clock squads of extra police checked the few cars on the roads .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai hopes to stay on in office president hamid karzai called on afghans to defy taliban threats and vote in the election , which could prove the toughest test yet of his own mandate and his nation 's fragile democracy .
" enemies will do their best , but it wo n't help , " he told reporters late on wednesday .
global support more than 270,000 election observers , including 2,000 from abroad , are overseeing the balloting at more than 6,500 polling centres , while the commission said it was unable to open voting stations in nine districts that remain outside government control .
polling stations opened at 9:30 am local time -lrb- 0500 utc -rrb- and voting is to continue until 4 pm -lrb- 1130 gmt -rrb- .
results are not expected until about 48 hours after the polls are closed , according to the independent election commission .
while karzai leads in recent opinion polls , he is not expected to receive more than 50 percent to win the elections outright .
if no candidate posts a first-round majority , a run-off would be held around first week of october. mrh / dpa / afp editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the attacks were the worst since the beginning of the us withdrawal , writes rainer sollich , head of dw 's arabic service . statistics frequently say little about actual circumstances , such as whether or not the most recent terror attacks in iraq are a result of the us troop draw down .
the number of victims in the weeks before american troops began leaving iraqi city centers had actually increased .
after their withdrawal , the violence decreased at first , only to re-emerge in the form of a bloodbath in the middle of baghdad .
if there are any conclusions to be drawn from this , then only that with or without us troops , iraq remains in the clutches of violence and terror .
security , of course , has markedly improved in the last couple of years , but the official iraqi and american claims that the situation is under control display a rather peculiar interpretation of calm .
iraq is still gripped by the constant threat of violence .
attacks continue unabated attacks are reported on almost a daily basis , although the general public is not aware of many of them .
it is a sad but logical consequence of the never-ending media coverage that the topic of " terror in iraq " has worn thin and now garners little international interest .
an attack with " just " four or five dead no longer warrants a headline , but then , when the number of victims jumps dramatically , the customary response mechanisms shift into gear .
the un security council , the white house and the european union all condemn the violence in unison , and media outlets provide the public with the gory details of death and destruction as well as displays of dismay , anger and sympathy .
people around the world see the images on television and ask themselves : where does all this hate come from and how can people be capable of subjecting others to such senseless pain and suffering ? # b # the answer is as simple as it is cynical .
it is done expressly for that purpose .
the perpetrators intended to strike the innocent and spread fear .
they do not want iraq to be peaceful ; they enjoy the international condemnation .
and they want to see their deeds on television .
every form of media attention lends weight to their acts of terror .
however , no revamping of media ethics – no matter how sophisticated – can help .
what is needed , first and foremost , is drastically improved security .
fertile ground for terrorists the latest wave of violence in baghdad illustrates the deficits within the iraqi government to guarantee security and promote national reconciliation .
the government has announced plans to close the existing gaps in security , and that is an important first step .
but it can not be the only one .
terrorists will always find fertile ground and support from segments of the iraqi population , or from abroad , as long as the conflict between ethnic and religious groups and their leaders is unresolved .
the lack of mutual respect and the thirst for revenge will not disappear overnight – and neither will the thirst for power and the country 's oil reserves .
it may seem bold , even risky , that the united states is sticking to its plan to withdraw from iraq completely by the end of 2011 .
however , this may be the appropriate leverage to force the government in baghdad to undertake greater efforts to solve its domestic conflicts and pursue a path of national reconciliation .

the attacks were the worst since the beginning of the us withdrawal , writes rainer sollich , head of dw 's arabic service . statistics frequently say little about actual circumstances , such as whether or not the most recent terror attacks in iraq are a result of the us troop draw down .
the number of victims in the weeks before american troops began leaving iraqi city centers had actually increased .
after their withdrawal , the violence decreased at first , only to re-emerge in the form of a bloodbath in the middle of baghdad .
if there are any conclusions to be drawn from this , then only that with or without us troops , iraq remains in the clutches of violence and terror .
security , of course , has markedly improved in the last couple of years , but the official iraqi and american claims that the situation is under control display a rather peculiar interpretation of calm .
iraq is still gripped by the constant threat of violence .
attacks continue unabated attacks are reported on almost a daily basis , although the general public is not aware of many of them .
it is a sad but logical consequence of the never-ending media coverage that the topic of " terror in iraq " has worn thin and now garners little international interest .
an attack with " just " four or five dead no longer warrants a headline , but then , when the number of victims jumps dramatically , the customary response mechanisms shift into gear .
the un security council , the white house and the european union all condemn the violence in unison , and media outlets provide the public with the gory details of death and destruction as well as displays of dismay , anger and sympathy .
people around the world see the images on television and ask themselves : where does all this hate come from and how can people be capable of subjecting others to such senseless pain and suffering ? # b # the answer is as simple as it is cynical .
it is done expressly for that purpose .
the perpetrators intended to strike the innocent and spread fear .
they do not want iraq to be peaceful ; they enjoy the international condemnation .
and they want to see their deeds on television .
every form of media attention lends weight to their acts of terror .
however , no revamping of media ethics – no matter how sophisticated – can help .
what is needed , first and foremost , is drastically improved security .
fertile ground for terrorists the latest wave of violence in baghdad illustrates the deficits within the iraqi government to guarantee security and promote national reconciliation .
the government has announced plans to close the existing gaps in security , and that is an important first step .
but it can not be the only one .
terrorists will always find fertile ground and support from segments of the iraqi population , or from abroad , as long as the conflict between ethnic and religious groups and their leaders is unresolved .
the lack of mutual respect and the thirst for revenge will not disappear overnight – and neither will the thirst for power and the country 's oil reserves .
it may seem bold , even risky , that the united states is sticking to its plan to withdraw from iraq completely by the end of 2011 .
however , this may be the appropriate leverage to force the government in baghdad to undertake greater efforts to solve its domestic conflicts and pursue a path of national reconciliation .

in addition , four eu countries have privately told the administration that they are committed to resettling detainees , and five other eu nations are considering taking some , according to officials in us president barack obama 's administration , who spoke to the newspaper on the condition of anonymity .
there are still 229 prisoners at the camp , which was opened in january 2002 by then president george w. bush to hold " enemy combatants " in the us " war on terror . "
obama has ordered the camp to be closed by january 22 , 2010 .
to meet that goal , the administration has appointed daniel fried , a longtime diplomat with deep ties to eastern europe and parts of the former soviet union , to lead negotiations with other countries .
some 80 prisoners are ready for release .
the post said that if resettling agreements could be made , a reduced detainee population would likely ease the politically charged debate on moving remaining prisoners to a facility on us soil .
of the detainees cleared for release so far , eleven have been transferred home or to third countries , including bermuda , which accepted four chinese uighurs .
the pacific island of palau has agreed to resettle the 13 remaining uighur detainees , and more than half of them are willing to go or are seriously considering the offer .
us looking towards eastern europe in addition , the administration has held positive talks with australia and georgia , and it has formally approached or is planning to hold talks with countries in south america , the persian gulf , the balkans and the former soviet union , the post wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama has pledged to close the camp by 2010 congress has blocked the white house from resettling any detainees in the united states , a move that us and some european officials feared would lead other countries , particularly in the eu , to refuse to help close the military prison .
but the issue has proved relatively unproblematic , officials said .
" obama has a lot of political capital .
countries want to do something for him , and that allows us to say , ' this is it , this is what we want you to do , " ' said a senior administration official quoted in the report .
" this is going a lot better than we might have thought . "
one senior administration official said negotiations in eastern europe will intensify once detainees arrive in larger eu countries , such as italy and spain .
the post also reported that us and european officials believe stalled negotiations with berlin can be rekindled after germany holds national parliamentary elections next month .

deutsche welle 's peter philipp looks at who stands to profit from the destabilization of afghanistan . in afghanistan 's eventful history , it was largely the interests of large foreign powers that prevented peace in the country at the foothills of the hindukush mountains . the foreign powers included the british , who pursued their own interests there , the russians and finally the americans - together with allies pakistan and saudi arabia . caught between powerful foreign interests the issues at stake were securing british supply lanes to india , ensuring russian access to the indian ocean , and finally repelling and beating back the soviet union with the help of the three-way alliance of washington , islamabad and riyadh . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche welle 's peter philipp those interests never focused on bolstering a strong afghan state , rather they were about installing an accommodating central government in kabul and maintaining a system of loyal regional chieftains in the country .
it was a system that had worked for centuries in afghanistan .
or sometimes it did n't . an afghan proverb speaks of a " a king under every tree . "
the king - and that included the presidents of the country - were merely seen as mayors of the capital kabul .
and their power was only recognized in the provinces if they sealed " deals " with the local rulers and gave them a free hand to run their own affairs . drugs trade flourishing that 's exactly what current president hamid karzai is doing .
once celebrated as the savior of afghanistan by the us and europe , karzai has long left the path of democracy and the rule of law . he has allied himself with regional " warlords " who are meant to ensure karzai power and influence in the provinces and who in return can thwart any attempt at normalization .
corruption is a daily occurrence but what 's worse is that the growing of poppy has reached record volumes in recent years , making afghanistan a notorious leading world exporter of drugs . ordinary farmers do n't earn a lot with their poppy fields but it 's still much more than what they would make with alternative crops such as wheat .
the " warlords " have long-turned into powerful " drug bosses " who rake in huge profits to finance their weapons and who are thus difficult to pressurize . these druglords are flexible and ready to hammer out an alliance with just about anybody .
the main thing is that their powerful positions are untouched . they also work together with the taliban , who are against the opium trade on religious and ideological grounds , but have long used this lucrative economic and agricultural sector for their own purposes . stabilizing afghanistan foreign nations - from afghanistan 's neighbors to europe and the us - are today more interested in calming the situation and stabilizing afghanistan . those interested in the opposite are primarily the regional rulers and the drug bosses who do n't want to give up their power and influence .
to curb their power , more pressure needs to be exerted on the central government and the president , the taliban needs to be defeated and ordinary afghans need to be given new opportunities to earn money . but none of that has happened so far .
still , about 50 drug dealers are included in the 367 names on an exhaustive wanted-persons list compiled by the us in afghanistan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 20.08.2009 ryanair sues german online travel comparison sites großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ryanair says that sites operated by unister hit customers with hidden charges irish low-cost airline ryanair is suing a german company for allegedly reselling airline tickets without authorization .
this marks an acceleration of the airline ’ s war against what it regards as online touts . ryanair lodged proceedings against leipzig-based internet firm unister at the high court in dublin this week .
the airline claims websites operated by unister use " screen-scraping " software to gather information from ryanair 's website without permission and then sell tickets to customers at inflated prices .
screen scraping is the process by which one computer program collects specific data from another .
in this case , unister 's software is constantly extracting information from other airline companies ' websites – rates , travel times , availability – and then neatly packaging and displaying that information on its own website for potential customers to search and compare .
while ryanair says it has no problem cooperating with authorized price comparison websites , it is unhappy that sites operated by unister hit customers with " hidden charges " . when a customer buys a return flight from duesseldorf to london on ryanair 's own website , for example , the final price including payment handling fees might be 93.25 euros .
if a customer buys the same ryanair flight using one of unister 's websites , additional fees push the final price up to 111.86 euros .
" ryanair is determined to continue its pro-consumer campaign against screen-scraper ticket-tout websites until the last screen scraper stops overcharging unsuspecting consumers , " ryanair spokesman stephen mcnamara said in a statement .
" our strategy of defending consumer rights in irish courts is proving successful and the number of active screen scrapers is rapidly decreasing , ” mcnamara said , adding : “ sadly , unister chose to continue overcharging consumers in breach of ryanair 's rights and left us no alternative but to refer them to the dublin high court . "
battle brewing unister spokesman konstantin korosides told deutsche welle that while management had not yet received official notification of the lawsuit , they were preparing for a legal battle .
“ we think that a german court is responsible , not an irish one , because we are a german online company .
that means jurisdiction has to be here , ” korosides said .
unister argues that screen-scraper software is not illegal and that its websites simply offer customers a service that helps them make a more informed decision when booking a flight .
“ we are an online travel agency , ” korosides said .
“ we charge a small fee for providing our service .
there 's nothing illegal with going to a travel agency , is there ? ”
“ we have 1.6 million visitors coming to one of our travel websites every month .
surely they would stop coming if they felt we were cheating them , ” he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german football star michael ballack is the face of one of unister 's online ad campaigns violation of terms of service ryanair , however , maintains that by reproducing information from its website without permission , unister and other screen scrapers are violating the ryanair website 's terms of service , which prohibit third parties from using its platform for commercial purposes .
the irish airline has intensified its legal campaign against german screen-scraping websites over the past 12 months , with mixed results .
in may , a hamburg court confirmed a 2008 injunction that banned german screen scraper vtours from reselling ryanair tickets because it was doing so in its own name .
in march , however , a frankfurt court blocked ryanair 's attempt to cancel bookings made through unauthorized screen scrapers , ruling that the german price comparison website cheaptickets.de did not break any laws when accessing ryanair 's database , and that the tickets purchased through the site were therefore valid .
since then ryanair has been pursuing screen scrapers through irish courts .
earlier this month , four german screen scrapers bowed to pressure from the airline 's lawyers and signed a binding agreement stating they would stop accessing the airline 's website and reselling its tickets .
legal grey zone ?
e-commerce experts say that depending on the exact application , screen scrapers often operate in a legal grey zone .
“ the law has n't caught up with this technology yet , ” said jason bellows , an it consultant at screen-scraper.com , a us-based company that sells the kind of software unister uses to harvest information from ryanair .
while many companies in the travel and financial sectors are happy about the extra business aggregator websites attract , bellows said he has often complied with large companies requesting that his firm decline assistance to third parties planning unauthorized access to their databases on several occasions .
common reasons for such requests include perceived harm to their brand 's reputation for value , a loss of potential online advertising revenue , and – for smaller firms – the technical strain screen scrapers place on low-capacity computer servers .
many complaints are based on alleged breaches of a website 's terms of use , but bellows said the strongest argument , in the us at least , was the threat of an intellectual property lawsuit .
“ people put the information on the internet to be used . our software just helps people find that information and use it better , ” bellows told deutsche welle . “ what we are always worried about , though , is copyright laws .
we never want our users to violate copyright laws . ”

in may , a hamburg court confirmed a 2008 injunction that banned german screen scraper vtours from reselling ryanair tickets because it was doing so in its own name .
in march , however , a frankfurt court blocked ryanair 's attempt to cancel bookings made through unauthorized screen scrapers , ruling that the german price comparison website cheaptickets.de did not break any laws when accessing ryanair 's database , and that the tickets purchased through the site were therefore valid .
since then ryanair has been pursuing screen scrapers through irish courts .
earlier this month , four german screen scrapers bowed to pressure from the airline 's lawyers and signed a binding agreement stating they would stop accessing the airline 's website and reselling its tickets .
legal grey zone ?
e-commerce experts say that depending on the exact application , screen scrapers often operate in a legal grey zone .
“ the law has n't caught up with this technology yet , ” said jason bellows , an it consultant at screen-scraper.com , a us-based company that sells the kind of software unister uses to harvest information from ryanair .
while many companies in the travel and financial sectors are happy about the extra business aggregator websites attract , bellows said he has often complied with large companies requesting that his firm decline assistance to third parties planning unauthorized access to their databases on several occasions .
common reasons for such requests include perceived harm to their brand 's reputation for value , a loss of potential online advertising revenue , and – for smaller firms – the technical strain screen scrapers place on low-capacity computer servers .
many complaints are based on alleged breaches of a website 's terms of use , but bellows said the strongest argument , in the us at least , was the threat of an intellectual property lawsuit .
“ people put the information on the internet to be used . our software just helps people find that information and use it better , ” bellows told deutsche welle . “ what we are always worried about , though , is copyright laws .
we never want our users to violate copyright laws . ”

this marks an acceleration of the airline ’ s war against what it regards as online touts . ryanair lodged proceedings against leipzig-based internet firm unister at the high court in dublin this week .
the airline claims websites operated by unister use " screen-scraping " software to gather information from ryanair 's website without permission and then sell tickets to customers at inflated prices .
screen scraping is the process by which one computer program collects specific data from another .
in this case , unister 's software is constantly extracting information from other airline companies ' websites – rates , travel times , availability – and then neatly packaging and displaying that information on its own website for potential customers to search and compare .
while ryanair says it has no problem cooperating with authorized price comparison websites , it is unhappy that sites operated by unister hit customers with " hidden charges " . when a customer buys a return flight from duesseldorf to london on ryanair 's own website , for example , the final price including payment handling fees might be 93.25 euros .
if a customer buys the same ryanair flight using one of unister 's websites , additional fees push the final price up to 111.86 euros .
" ryanair is determined to continue its pro-consumer campaign against screen-scraper ticket-tout websites until the last screen scraper stops overcharging unsuspecting consumers , " ryanair spokesman stephen mcnamara said in a statement .
" our strategy of defending consumer rights in irish courts is proving successful and the number of active screen scrapers is rapidly decreasing , ” mcnamara said , adding : “ sadly , unister chose to continue overcharging consumers in breach of ryanair 's rights and left us no alternative but to refer them to the dublin high court . "
battle brewing unister spokesman konstantin korosides told deutsche welle that while management had not yet received official notification of the lawsuit , they were preparing for a legal battle .
“ we think that a german court is responsible , not an irish one , because we are a german online company .
that means jurisdiction has to be here , ” korosides said .
unister argues that screen-scraper software is not illegal and that its websites simply offer customers a service that helps them make a more informed decision when booking a flight .
“ we are an online travel agency , ” korosides said .
“ we charge a small fee for providing our service .
there 's nothing illegal with going to a travel agency , is there ? ”
“ we have 1.6 million visitors coming to one of our travel websites every month .
surely they would stop coming if they felt we were cheating them , ” he said .

this marks an acceleration of the airline ’ s war against what it regards as online touts . ryanair lodged proceedings against leipzig-based internet firm unister at the high court in dublin this week .
the airline claims websites operated by unister use " screen-scraping " software to gather information from ryanair 's website without permission and then sell tickets to customers at inflated prices .
screen scraping is the process by which one computer program collects specific data from another .
in this case , unister 's software is constantly extracting information from other airline companies ' websites – rates , travel times , availability – and then neatly packaging and displaying that information on its own website for potential customers to search and compare .
while ryanair says it has no problem cooperating with authorized price comparison websites , it is unhappy that sites operated by unister hit customers with " hidden charges " . when a customer buys a return flight from duesseldorf to london on ryanair 's own website , for example , the final price including payment handling fees might be 93.25 euros .
if a customer buys the same ryanair flight using one of unister 's websites , additional fees push the final price up to 111.86 euros .
" ryanair is determined to continue its pro-consumer campaign against screen-scraper ticket-tout websites until the last screen scraper stops overcharging unsuspecting consumers , " ryanair spokesman stephen mcnamara said in a statement .
" our strategy of defending consumer rights in irish courts is proving successful and the number of active screen scrapers is rapidly decreasing , ” mcnamara said , adding : “ sadly , unister chose to continue overcharging consumers in breach of ryanair 's rights and left us no alternative but to refer them to the dublin high court . "
battle brewing unister spokesman konstantin korosides told deutsche welle that while management had not yet received official notification of the lawsuit , they were preparing for a legal battle .
“ we think that a german court is responsible , not an irish one , because we are a german online company .
that means jurisdiction has to be here , ” korosides said .
unister argues that screen-scraper software is not illegal and that its websites simply offer customers a service that helps them make a more informed decision when booking a flight .
“ we are an online travel agency , ” korosides said .
“ we charge a small fee for providing our service .
there 's nothing illegal with going to a travel agency , is there ? ”
“ we have 1.6 million visitors coming to one of our travel websites every month .
surely they would stop coming if they felt we were cheating them , ” he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german football star michael ballack is the face of one of unister 's online ad campaigns violation of terms of service ryanair , however , maintains that by reproducing information from its website without permission , unister and other screen scrapers are violating the ryanair website 's terms of service , which prohibit third parties from using its platform for commercial purposes .
the irish airline has intensified its legal campaign against german screen-scraping websites over the past 12 months , with mixed results .
in may , a hamburg court confirmed a 2008 injunction that banned german screen scraper vtours from reselling ryanair tickets because it was doing so in its own name .
in march , however , a frankfurt court blocked ryanair 's attempt to cancel bookings made through unauthorized screen scrapers , ruling that the german price comparison website cheaptickets.de did not break any laws when accessing ryanair 's database , and that the tickets purchased through the site were therefore valid .
since then ryanair has been pursuing screen scrapers through irish courts .
earlier this month , four german screen scrapers bowed to pressure from the airline 's lawyers and signed a binding agreement stating they would stop accessing the airline 's website and reselling its tickets .
legal grey zone ?
e-commerce experts say that depending on the exact application , screen scrapers often operate in a legal grey zone .
“ the law has n't caught up with this technology yet , ” said jason bellows , an it consultant at screen-scraper.com , a us-based company that sells the kind of software unister uses to harvest information from ryanair .
while many companies in the travel and financial sectors are happy about the extra business aggregator websites attract , bellows said he has often complied with large companies requesting that his firm decline assistance to third parties planning unauthorized access to their databases on several occasions .

officials say turnout has been healthy , despite sporadic violence by taliban militants determined to sabotage the ballot . a massive afghan and multinational force of 300,000 was put on full alert thursday to safeguard voting and prevent the taliban from unleashing a threatened onslaught .
two taliban insurgents were killed in a gun battle in kabul as sporadic violence across the country threatened to unsettle voters .
the attack , coming after the taliban said 20 of their fighters had infiltrated the capital , was the worst of several on polling stations and voters .
the taliban have struck repeatedly inside the capital in a bloody countdown to elections that are aimed at putting the country more firmly on the path to democracy eight years after the us-led invasion ousted the militia 's regime .
however , despite the violence in places like kandahar in the south and in the northern provinces of baghlan and takhar , the united nations said there were encouraging signs of high turnout .
" the vast majority of polling stations have been able to open and have received voting materials , " said aleem siddique , spokesman for the un mission in kabul .
" we are seeing queues forming at polling stations in the north , also in the capital , as well as , encouragingly , in the east . "
scores of people queued up at polling stations in the capital and major cities under government control , and some 95 percent of 6,500 polling stations opened on schedule , the independent election commission said .
" the turnout is very good , but we do n't have exact figures , " said deputy chief electoral officer zekria barakzai , predicting that it could reach around 50 percent overall .
seventeen million afghans have registered to elect a president and 420 councilors in 34 provinces across the largely rural , impoverished country .
it is a difficult process in a nation where more than 70 percent of people are illiterate and bound by fierce tribal and religious allegiances .

" i request my dear countrymen to come out and cast their vote to decide their future , " karzai said as he voted in a kabul boys ' school near his heavily fortified palace , dismissing fears of unrest .
however , one opinion poll carried out by a us organization predicted karzai would be forced into a run-off , winning 44 percent of the vote , and his rival abdullah abdullah , who has a northern powerbase and draws on ethnic tajik support , would take 26 percent .
there are around 30 other candidates .
abdullah hailed " a day of change " as he voted alongside his wife and young son amid a throng of journalists and phalanx of security men .
an energetic campaign by the ex-foreign minister has boosted the chance of a run-off , which would take place in around six weeks ' time .
the election is also a test for us president barack obama , who has ordered a massive troop build-up this year as part of a strategy to reverse taliban gains .
obama 's envoy for the region , richard holbrooke , toured polling stations in kabul and said what he 'd seen was " open and honest , " adding : " so far every prediction of disaster turned out to be wrong . "

" of course the real test is election day , " the british general added .
the biggest threats facing troops were suicide bombers , rockets and maybe ambushes , he said .

but isaf spokesman brigadier general eric tremblay acknowledged : " despite the best plans in place , there will always be some residual risk . "

officials say turnout has been healthy , despite sporadic violence by taliban militants determined to sabotage the ballot . a massive afghan and multinational force of 300,000 was put on full alert thursday to safeguard voting and prevent the taliban from unleashing a threatened onslaught .
two taliban insurgents were killed in a gun battle in kabul as sporadic violence across the country threatened to unsettle voters .
the attack , coming after the taliban said 20 of their fighters had infiltrated the capital , was the worst of several on polling stations and voters .
the taliban have struck repeatedly inside the capital in a bloody countdown to elections that are aimed at putting the country more firmly on the path to democracy eight years after the us-led invasion ousted the militia 's regime .
however , despite the violence in places like kandahar in the south and in the northern provinces of baghlan and takhar , the united nations said there were encouraging signs of high turnout .
" the vast majority of polling stations have been able to open and have received voting materials , " said aleem siddique , spokesman for the un mission in kabul .
" we are seeing queues forming at polling stations in the north , also in the capital , as well as , encouragingly , in the east . "
scores of people queued up at polling stations in the capital and major cities under government control , and some 95 percent of 6,500 polling stations opened on schedule , the independent election commission said .
" the turnout is very good , but we do n't have exact figures , " said deputy chief electoral officer zekria barakzai , predicting that it could reach around 50 percent overall .
seventeen million afghans have registered to elect a president and 420 councilors in 34 provinces across the largely rural , impoverished country .
it is a difficult process in a nation where more than 70 percent of people are illiterate and bound by fierce tribal and religious allegiances .
karzai bullish despite energetic abdullah bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai could face a run-off with his rival abdullah abdullah western-backed president hamid karzai hopes to win an outright majority to avoid a run-off , but his nervous government ordered a blackout on reporting on violence during polling day , threatening journalists with heavy penalties .
" i request my dear countrymen to come out and cast their vote to decide their future , " karzai said as he voted in a kabul boys ' school near his heavily fortified palace , dismissing fears of unrest .
however , one opinion poll carried out by a us organization predicted karzai would be forced into a run-off , winning 44 percent of the vote , and his rival abdullah abdullah , who has a northern powerbase and draws on ethnic tajik support , would take 26 percent .
there are around 30 other candidates .
abdullah hailed " a day of change " as he voted alongside his wife and young son amid a throng of journalists and phalanx of security men .
an energetic campaign by the ex-foreign minister has boosted the chance of a run-off , which would take place in around six weeks ' time .
the election is also a test for us president barack obama , who has ordered a massive troop build-up this year as part of a strategy to reverse taliban gains .
obama 's envoy for the region , richard holbrooke , toured polling stations in kabul and said what he 'd seen was " open and honest , " adding : " so far every prediction of disaster turned out to be wrong . "
nato troops on alert and ready to quell violence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attacks ahead of the election put isaf on red alert troops from nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- and afghan forces were still on high alert despite the level of violence being far below that predicted .
" we have been doing an immense amount of work to try and ensure the best possible security for the elections , " lieutenant general jim dutton , the deputy commander of the nato-led force drawn from about 40 nations , told reporters .
" of course the real test is election day , " the british general added .
the biggest threats facing troops were suicide bombers , rockets and maybe ambushes , he said .
" the mission , as for all coalition forces , is to be the least visible to show that this is an election organized by the afghans themselves , " said lieutenant colonel stephane chenel , another nato commander .

nato troops on alert and ready to quell violence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attacks ahead of the election put isaf on red alert troops from nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- and afghan forces were still on high alert despite the level of violence being far below that predicted .
" we have been doing an immense amount of work to try and ensure the best possible security for the elections , " lieutenant general jim dutton , the deputy commander of the nato-led force drawn from about 40 nations , told reporters .
" of course the real test is election day , " the british general added .
the biggest threats facing troops were suicide bombers , rockets and maybe ambushes , he said .
" the mission , as for all coalition forces , is to be the least visible to show that this is an election organized by the afghans themselves , " said lieutenant colonel stephane chenel , another nato commander .
" if there is a threat , all forces will be able to intervene .
everyone will be deployed and , in an immediate threat , go anywhere at any moment , " the french officer said .
isaf officials said that despite rising taliban violence , less than one percent of polling stations were at risk of attack .
but isaf spokesman brigadier general eric tremblay acknowledged : " despite the best plans in place , there will always be some residual risk . "
around eight districts – out of 365 nationwide – contain " high risk " areas where polling stations are considered unlikely to open , mainly in the taliban heartland of southern afghanistan. nda / afp / reuters / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 20.08.2009 german finance minister defends hypo real estate bailout großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck went into the hearing with guns blazing the german finance minister has told a bundestag probe that the string of state bailouts worth an excess of 100 billion euros for lender hypo real estate was " appropriate and correct . " the government rescue of the struggling hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- mortgage lender prevented a " global financial meltdown , " according to finance minister peer steinbrueck .
the social democrat , answering questions from a parliamentary enquiry investigating the bailout of hre , described the german government 's actions as " appropriate and correct . "
" we made the right decisions , " steinbrueck said .
" it was n't us politicians who caused this financial crisis , but we were the ones who mastered it . "
hypo real estate needed a series of state bailouts to keep it from going under .
the loans and credit guarantees offered to hre total 102 billion euros -lrb- $ 145 billion -rrb- , with 87 billion coming from the government in berlin and the remainder from other german banks .
" we had to make decisions in real time , contending with enormous time pressures .
and we did n't always have all the relevant information at our disposal . "
steinbrueck also dismissed criticism that his right hand man at the time , state finance secretary joerg asmussen , was unprepared during the negotiations and allowed the banks to pull the wool over his eyes .
" that is absurd and has been disproven , " he said .
" therefore , i 'm not going to even discuss it . "
steinbrueck said that asmussen had n't negotiated poorly , but rather he 'd fought " tooth and nail - right up to the pain barrier . "
triggered by lehman collapse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors , who were later escorted out of the hearing , disagree with steinbrueck when asked about the tipping point for hypo real estate , steinbrueck pointed to the collapse of us lender lehman brothers in september 2008 , dismissing the political opposition 's claims that the bank was already headed for trouble much earlier in the year .
he said that the lehmann brothers bankruptcy put a dramatic stop to inter-bank lending , thus crippling hypo real estate .
hre and its irish subsidiary depfa had been relying on loans from other lenders in order to keep supplying mortgages for months before lehmann brothers went under .
" between september 15 and october 5 the financial world stood millimeters away from the cliff edge , " steinbrueck said .
the german finance minister also questioned the us decision to let lehmann brothers fall , describing it as a test with disastrous consequences .
after the bankruptcy , leading industrial nations committed not to let similar large financial institutions go bankrupt .
the german government decided that hre - with a value of around 400 billion euros - qualified as an irreplaceable money lender. msh / ap / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de inquiry into hypo real estate rescue enters final phase a parliamentary inquiry into the german government 's 100-billion-euro -lrb- $ 140 billion -rrb- rescue of mortgage lender hypo real estate is drawing to an end .
its findings are to be presented just prior to the september 27 polls .

" the government rescue of the struggling hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- mortgage lender prevented a " global financial meltdown , " according to finance minister peer steinbrueck .
the social democrat , answering questions from a parliamentary enquiry investigating the bailout of hre , described the german government 's actions as " appropriate and correct . "
" we made the right decisions , " steinbrueck said .
" it was n't us politicians who caused this financial crisis , but we were the ones who mastered it . "

" between september 15 and october 5 the financial world stood millimeters away from the cliff edge , " steinbrueck said .
the german finance minister also questioned the us decision to let lehmann brothers fall , describing it as a test with disastrous consequences .

" the government rescue of the struggling hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- mortgage lender prevented a " global financial meltdown , " according to finance minister peer steinbrueck .
the social democrat , answering questions from a parliamentary enquiry investigating the bailout of hre , described the german government 's actions as " appropriate and correct . "
" we made the right decisions , " steinbrueck said .
" it was n't us politicians who caused this financial crisis , but we were the ones who mastered it . "
hypo real estate needed a series of state bailouts to keep it from going under .
the loans and credit guarantees offered to hre total 102 billion euros -lrb- $ 145 billion -rrb- , with 87 billion coming from the government in berlin and the remainder from other german banks .
" we had to make decisions in real time , contending with enormous time pressures .
and we did n't always have all the relevant information at our disposal . "
steinbrueck also dismissed criticism that his right hand man at the time , state finance secretary joerg asmussen , was unprepared during the negotiations and allowed the banks to pull the wool over his eyes .
" that is absurd and has been disproven , " he said .
" therefore , i 'm not going to even discuss it . "
steinbrueck said that asmussen had n't negotiated poorly , but rather he 'd fought " tooth and nail - right up to the pain barrier . "

the top ten list features japanese cars in the first six places .
" as a member of the green party i want people to buy modern cars with the lowest co2 emissions , " she said , suggesting that the vcd list was a good reference point for these cars .
she expressed regret that the highest-placed german car came in at number seven – the two-seater smart car – and added that german manufacturers " should act as quickly as possible to provide different cars and to secure jobs . "
kuenast found herself in similar trouble two years ago when she called on people to buy the toyota prius hybrid car for its low environmental impact in comparison to other cars .
her statement was seen as a vote of no-confidence in the german car industry .
she also said that she was annoyed with the executive committees at german auto manufacturers which continued to fight at a european level to keep co2 emissions for cars at the highest level possible .
" if the germans are too stupid to build modern cars , then one must recommend that people should buy a toyota prius , " she said. nda / dpa / ap editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the day saw relatively little violence although concerns remain over a possible low turnout due to threats of taliban attacks . " our assessment is that , in general , these elections went much better than we anticipated , " ettore sequi , the european union 's special representative to afghanistan , told afp .
the roughly 6,200 election centers which were able to accept voters was " an achievement considering the concerns before the election , " he added .
despite dozens of taliban missiles and bombs and the deaths of more than 20 people , many international leaders agreed with sequi 's statement .
german chancellor angela merkel called the election " an important chapter in the democratic development of the country . "
nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen said the election was " a testimony to the determination of the afghan people to build democracy . "
he congratulated the voters for their courage in the face of taliban threats .
" seen from a security point of view , the election has been a success , " he said .
" the most important thing is that the election will be considered credible in the eyes of the afghan people . "
while no official voter turnout figures have been released , there is concern that if a low percentage of the 15 million registered voters showed up to cast their ballots , it would diminish the legitimacy of the election .

the day saw relatively little violence although concerns remain over a possible low turnout due to threats of taliban attacks . " our assessment is that , in general , these elections went much better than we anticipated , " ettore sequi , the european union 's special representative to afghanistan , told afp .
the roughly 6,200 election centers which were able to accept voters was " an achievement considering the concerns before the election , " he added .
despite dozens of taliban missiles and bombs and the deaths of more than 20 people , many international leaders agreed with sequi 's statement .
german chancellor angela merkel called the election " an important chapter in the democratic development of the country . "
nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen said the election was " a testimony to the determination of the afghan people to build democracy . "
he congratulated the voters for their courage in the face of taliban threats .
" seen from a security point of view , the election has been a success , " he said .
" the most important thing is that the election will be considered credible in the eyes of the afghan people . "
while no official voter turnout figures have been released , there is concern that if a low percentage of the 15 million registered voters showed up to cast their ballots , it would diminish the legitimacy of the election .
taliban attacks close some polls , delay voting as voting continued across the country during the day , taliban militants stormed a town in northern afghanistan , launching a multi-pronged assault that left at least eight of them dead and kept polling stations from opening , officials said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban attacks disrupted voting in some areas " terrorists attacked from several directions .
fighting has been going on since morning , " provincial police chief mohammad kabir andarabi told reporters in baghlan .
" now , as we speak , the enemy has been pushed back .
we have killed 22 terrorists .
most of their bodies are left on the ground , " he added .
abdul majeed azimi , head of the provincial intelligence agency , confirmed the incident but said the corpses of only eight rebels were found .
the local district police chief and one of his guards were also killed .
a 12-year-old boy was wounded in the clashes , he added .
azimi said polling stations did not open in the small town on the highway between pul-i-khumri , the capital of baghlan province , and kunduz province .
" no elections there .
i do n't think there will be because fighting is ongoing , " he said .
residents confirmed to local media that no polling stations were open .
eu calls on afghans to resist taliban pressure the eu had called on the afghan people to defy the taliban and cast their ballots , as a team of about 100 eu observers kept a watchful eye on the voting process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu and nato commended afghans on their election " we encourage the afghan people to go out and vote on this very important day , which sets the path towards democracy for the afghan nation and its people , " european commission spokesman john clancy said in brussels . clancy said no eu monitors had been injured in any attacks . the eu has the largest international observer mission in afghanistan . european election mission to monitor results headed by philippe morillon , a former french general and now a member of the european parliament , the mission has been monitoring the election campaign and is now focusing on polling , counting and tallying the results . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : morillon 's team will begin monitoring the election results it plans to condemn any serious breach of electoral rules and procedures , with a preliminary statement from morillon expected on saturday . so far , its biggest worry has been with proxy voting . concerns have been fuelled by a suspiciously high rate of registration for female voters in traditionally conservative parts of the country .
despite being escorted by afghan and nato forces , the monitors have not been deployed throughout the country owing to the precarious security situation . the eu is a major donor to afghanistan .
the bloc 's brussels-based executive arm , the european commission , has provided the country with 1.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 2 billion -rrb- in aid since 2002 .

" megrahi now faces a sentence imposed by a higher power , " said scottish justice minister kenny macaskill at a news conference on thursday .
" it is terminal , final and irrevocable .
he is going to die . "
shortly afterwards megrahi boarded a libyan jet that had been sent from tripoli to collect him .
relatives of the victims and the united states government were opposed to his release .
on tuesday us secretary of state hillary clinton said that it would be " absolutely wrong " to free al-megrahi , who was responsible for a " horrendous crime . "
his guilt has always been in question .
some are convinced that he was responsible , while others have consistently labeled his conviction a miscarriage of justice .
either way , megrahi is the only one ever to be tried and convicted .
circumstantial evidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : megrahi is on his way back to libya megrahi , a father of five , was born in tripoli , libya in 1952 .
he has a good command of the english language , a skill he picked up when he studied in the us .
he had also visited britain several times .
he ran an international relations think tank in libya called the center for strategic studies , a job that the fbi has claimed provided him with the perfect cover to work as an operative for the libyan intelligence services -lrb- jso -rrb- .
for a time , he was also based in malta as director of security for libyan arab airways -lrb- laa -rrb- , a job that prosecutors said gave him knowledge and access to secure airlines .
the key piece of evidence in his trial was that pieces of clothing that megrahi had bought in malta were found wrapped around the bomb .
a fateful flight on december 22 , 1988 , pan am flight 103 took off from london 's heathrow airport , headed for new york .
on board were 259 passengers .
approximately 38 minutes into the flight , the plane exploded at 31,000 feet over lockerbie , scotland , killing all the passengers as well as 11 people on the ground .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pan am 103 memorial in arlington cemetary it took three years of painstaking investigation , but finally in 1999 , officials indicted two libyans , al-amin khalifa fhimah and abdelbaset ali mohmed al-megrahi , on 270 counts of murder .
by then the two men were home and libyan leader moammar gadhafi refused to hand them over .
thus began years of international pressure on libya .
in 1992 the un security council imposed sanctions on libya over its refusal to hand over the men .
it was not until six years later , in 1998 , that gadhafi finally said that the trial could take place , but only in a neutral country .
the us and britain proposed using scottish law in the netherlands and gadhafi agreed .
after nelson mandela visited gadhafi in 1999 , the men were finally extradited and the trial began at camp zeist in the netherlands .
justice takes time the trial began in 2000 , and from the start both of the accused denied any involvement in the lockerbie bombing .
the proceedings lasted a year and in the end , al-megrahi was sentenced to life in prison while al-amin khalifa fhimah , was found not guilty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al-amin khalifa fhimah was found not guilty al-megrahi immediately launched an appeal and fhimah went home .
in 2002 , a panel of five scottish judges began hearing his appeal which was denied three months later .
the next several years saw more legal wrangling between al-megrahi and the scottish legal system .
in 2007 , the scottish criminal cases review commission recommended that he should be granted a second appeal .
power politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libya 's moammar gadhafi paid compensation in the background of all the legal proceedings was a combination of money , oil and politics .
oil makes up a big part of the libyan economy .
according to the cia factbook , the libyan economy depends almost entirely on revenues from the oil sector , which contribute about 95 percent of export earnings , about one quarter of the gross domestic product , and roughly 60 percent of public sector wages .
in other words , un sanctions hit libya very hard .
libya clearly felt the strain and within the last few years the libyans have renounced nuclear arms and agreed to pay compensation to the families of the lockerbie victims .
former british prime minister tony blair was among the first politicians to become involved in helping british petroleum -lrb- bp -rrb- and shell win exploration acreage in libya .
the release of al-megrahi could ease tensions between britain and libya and open further business opportunities .
in fact some of the relatives of the victims of the lockerbie bombings have intimated that a deal has been struck. av / reuters / afp / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

circumstantial evidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : megrahi is on his way back to libya megrahi , a father of five , was born in tripoli , libya in 1952 .
he has a good command of the english language , a skill he picked up when he studied in the us .
he had also visited britain several times .
he ran an international relations think tank in libya called the center for strategic studies , a job that the fbi has claimed provided him with the perfect cover to work as an operative for the libyan intelligence services -lrb- jso -rrb- .
for a time , he was also based in malta as director of security for libyan arab airways -lrb- laa -rrb- , a job that prosecutors said gave him knowledge and access to secure airlines .
the key piece of evidence in his trial was that pieces of clothing that megrahi had bought in malta were found wrapped around the bomb .
a fateful flight on december 22 , 1988 , pan am flight 103 took off from london 's heathrow airport , headed for new york .
on board were 259 passengers .
approximately 38 minutes into the flight , the plane exploded at 31,000 feet over lockerbie , scotland , killing all the passengers as well as 11 people on the ground .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pan am 103 memorial in arlington cemetary it took three years of painstaking investigation , but finally in 1999 , officials indicted two libyans , al-amin khalifa fhimah and abdelbaset ali mohmed al-megrahi , on 270 counts of murder .
by then the two men were home and libyan leader moammar gadhafi refused to hand them over .
thus began years of international pressure on libya .
in 1992 the un security council imposed sanctions on libya over its refusal to hand over the men .
it was not until six years later , in 1998 , that gadhafi finally said that the trial could take place , but only in a neutral country .
the us and britain proposed using scottish law in the netherlands and gadhafi agreed .
after nelson mandela visited gadhafi in 1999 , the men were finally extradited and the trial began at camp zeist in the netherlands .
justice takes time the trial began in 2000 , and from the start both of the accused denied any involvement in the lockerbie bombing .
the proceedings lasted a year and in the end , al-megrahi was sentenced to life in prison while al-amin khalifa fhimah , was found not guilty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al-amin khalifa fhimah was found not guilty al-megrahi immediately launched an appeal and fhimah went home .
in 2002 , a panel of five scottish judges began hearing his appeal which was denied three months later .
the next several years saw more legal wrangling between al-megrahi and the scottish legal system .
in 2007 , the scottish criminal cases review commission recommended that he should be granted a second appeal .
power politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libya 's moammar gadhafi paid compensation in the background of all the legal proceedings was a combination of money , oil and politics .
oil makes up a big part of the libyan economy .
according to the cia factbook , the libyan economy depends almost entirely on revenues from the oil sector , which contribute about 95 percent of export earnings , about one quarter of the gross domestic product , and roughly 60 percent of public sector wages .
in other words , un sanctions hit libya very hard .
libya clearly felt the strain and within the last few years the libyans have renounced nuclear arms and agreed to pay compensation to the families of the lockerbie victims .
former british prime minister tony blair was among the first politicians to become involved in helping british petroleum -lrb- bp -rrb- and shell win exploration acreage in libya .
the release of al-megrahi could ease tensions between britain and libya and open further business opportunities .

" megrahi now faces a sentence imposed by a higher power , " said scottish justice minister kenny macaskill at a news conference on thursday .
" it is terminal , final and irrevocable .
he is going to die . "
shortly afterwards megrahi boarded a libyan jet that had been sent from tripoli to collect him .
relatives of the victims and the united states government were opposed to his release .
on tuesday us secretary of state hillary clinton said that it would be " absolutely wrong " to free al-megrahi , who was responsible for a " horrendous crime . "
his guilt has always been in question .
some are convinced that he was responsible , while others have consistently labeled his conviction a miscarriage of justice .
either way , megrahi is the only one ever to be tried and convicted .
circumstantial evidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : megrahi is on his way back to libya megrahi , a father of five , was born in tripoli , libya in 1952 .
he has a good command of the english language , a skill he picked up when he studied in the us .
he had also visited britain several times .
he ran an international relations think tank in libya called the center for strategic studies , a job that the fbi has claimed provided him with the perfect cover to work as an operative for the libyan intelligence services -lrb- jso -rrb- .
for a time , he was also based in malta as director of security for libyan arab airways -lrb- laa -rrb- , a job that prosecutors said gave him knowledge and access to secure airlines .
the key piece of evidence in his trial was that pieces of clothing that megrahi had bought in malta were found wrapped around the bomb .
a fateful flight on december 22 , 1988 , pan am flight 103 took off from london 's heathrow airport , headed for new york .
on board were 259 passengers .
approximately 38 minutes into the flight , the plane exploded at 31,000 feet over lockerbie , scotland , killing all the passengers as well as 11 people on the ground .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pan am 103 memorial in arlington cemetary it took three years of painstaking investigation , but finally in 1999 , officials indicted two libyans , al-amin khalifa fhimah and abdelbaset ali mohmed al-megrahi , on 270 counts of murder .
by then the two men were home and libyan leader moammar gadhafi refused to hand them over .
thus began years of international pressure on libya .
in 1992 the un security council imposed sanctions on libya over its refusal to hand over the men .
it was not until six years later , in 1998 , that gadhafi finally said that the trial could take place , but only in a neutral country .
the us and britain proposed using scottish law in the netherlands and gadhafi agreed .
after nelson mandela visited gadhafi in 1999 , the men were finally extradited and the trial began at camp zeist in the netherlands .
justice takes time the trial began in 2000 , and from the start both of the accused denied any involvement in the lockerbie bombing .
the proceedings lasted a year and in the end , al-megrahi was sentenced to life in prison while al-amin khalifa fhimah , was found not guilty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al-amin khalifa fhimah was found not guilty al-megrahi immediately launched an appeal and fhimah went home .
in 2002 , a panel of five scottish judges began hearing his appeal which was denied three months later .
the next several years saw more legal wrangling between al-megrahi and the scottish legal system .
in 2007 , the scottish criminal cases review commission recommended that he should be granted a second appeal .
power politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libya 's moammar gadhafi paid compensation in the background of all the legal proceedings was a combination of money , oil and politics .
oil makes up a big part of the libyan economy .
according to the cia factbook , the libyan economy depends almost entirely on revenues from the oil sector , which contribute about 95 percent of export earnings , about one quarter of the gross domestic product , and roughly 60 percent of public sector wages .
in other words , un sanctions hit libya very hard .
libya clearly felt the strain and within the last few years the libyans have renounced nuclear arms and agreed to pay compensation to the families of the lockerbie victims .
former british prime minister tony blair was among the first politicians to become involved in helping british petroleum -lrb- bp -rrb- and shell win exploration acreage in libya .
the release of al-megrahi could ease tensions between britain and libya and open further business opportunities .

just germany 's latest political sensation : a comedian in the guise of a scruffy small-time journalist named horst schlaemmer , whose fake bid for the german chancellorship has injected some real humor into a boring campaign season .
the undeniably unappealing alter ego of popular german funnyman hape kerkeling is the star of his own feature film , which debuted to throngs of fans in berlin on thursday .
the movie , " isch kandidiere " -lrb- " i 'm running for chancellor ! " -rrb- follows the faux candidate as he looks for support among the common people and german stars like rapper bushido and ex-racing champion michael schumacher .
bushido also contributed schlaemmer 's campaign song .
" first of all , i 'd like to point out that the horst schlaemmer party stands for justice , and of course it stands for freedom , and yes , women 's emancipation - but i 've forgotten the rest of your question , " schlaemmer told deutsche welle .

schlaemmer has gained the kind of media exposure and enthusiasm that more legitimate contenders for the chancellor 's seat can only dream of .
but perhaps that 's to be expected when your campaign promises include state-subsidized tanning and cradle-to-grave income .
two major german television channels aired live coverage of schlaemmer 's first press conference for nearly two hours .
in contrast , those same networks cut away from real-life candidate frank-walter steinmeier as he was explaining how he 'd fulfill a campaign promise of creating 4 million jobs by 2020 .
eighteen percent of the people surveyed by german polling institute forsa said they could imagine voting for schlaemmer 's party if it did in fact exist in real life .
that 's not so much less than the latest poll numbers for the social democratic party , currently in opposition , which garnered just 22 percent of registered voters ' support , according to forsa .

just germany 's latest political sensation : a comedian in the guise of a scruffy small-time journalist named horst schlaemmer , whose fake bid for the german chancellorship has injected some real humor into a boring campaign season .
the undeniably unappealing alter ego of popular german funnyman hape kerkeling is the star of his own feature film , which debuted to throngs of fans in berlin on thursday .
the movie , " isch kandidiere " -lrb- " i 'm running for chancellor ! " -rrb- follows the faux candidate as he looks for support among the common people and german stars like rapper bushido and ex-racing champion michael schumacher .
bushido also contributed schlaemmer 's campaign song .
" first of all , i 'd like to point out that the horst schlaemmer party stands for justice , and of course it stands for freedom , and yes , women 's emancipation - but i 've forgotten the rest of your question , " schlaemmer told deutsche welle .

schlaemmer has gained the kind of media exposure and enthusiasm that more legitimate contenders for the chancellor 's seat can only dream of .
but perhaps that 's to be expected when your campaign promises include state-subsidized tanning and cradle-to-grave income .
two major german television channels aired live coverage of schlaemmer 's first press conference for nearly two hours .
in contrast , those same networks cut away from real-life candidate frank-walter steinmeier as he was explaining how he 'd fulfill a campaign promise of creating 4 million jobs by 2020 .
eighteen percent of the people surveyed by german polling institute forsa said they could imagine voting for schlaemmer 's party if it did in fact exist in real life .
that 's not so much less than the latest poll numbers for the social democratic party , currently in opposition , which garnered just 22 percent of registered voters ' support , according to forsa .

former porsche chief wendelin wiedeking is also under investigation . dealings by wiedeking and former porsche chief financial officer holger haerter , both of whom resigned from their posts last month , are being examined by germany 's financial supervisory authority -lrb- bafin -rrb- on suspicion of market manipulation .

former porsche chief wendelin wiedeking is also under investigation . dealings by wiedeking and former porsche chief financial officer holger haerter , both of whom resigned from their posts last month , are being examined by germany 's financial supervisory authority -lrb- bafin -rrb- on suspicion of market manipulation .
part of the bafin investigation will focus on recent fluctuations in share prices at competitor-cum-merger partner volkswagen .
during the drawn-out merger negotiations between vw and porsche , a collection of cash settlement options in vw shares earned porsche billions as the stock climbed in value .
the stock revaluation that resulted briefly made porsche the world 's biggest company by market capitalization .
until a few months ago porsche was making more money from its financial dealings than from car sales at a time when carmakers around the world were suffering from a collapse in global auto markets .
under wiedeking , porsche accumulated a 51-percent stake in its much larger rival vw , europe 's largest carmaker , and wanted to take full control but the attempt failed and left porsche squeezed under a huge debt pile .
following a tip from bafin , stuttgart prosecutors launched a separate inquiry into porsche with police seizing documents in their raid on thursday .

his poll ratings are the envy of many real-life politicians . what snorts like a warthog rooting for grubs , has hair like a vintage rabbit pelt , and sports an overbite rarely seen outside of the animal kingdom ?
just germany 's latest political sensation : a comedian in the guise of a scruffy small-time journalist named horst schlaemmer , whose fake bid for the german chancellorship has injected some real humor into a boring campaign season .
the undeniably unappealing alter ego of popular german funnyman hape kerkeling is the star of his own feature film , which debuted to throngs of fans in berlin on thursday .
the movie , " isch kandidiere " -lrb- " i 'm running for chancellor ! " -rrb- follows the faux candidate as he looks for support among the common people and german stars like rapper bushido and ex-racing champion michael schumacher .
bushido also contributed schlaemmer 's campaign song .
" first of all , i 'd like to point out that the horst schlaemmer party stands for justice , and of course it stands for freedom , and yes , women 's emancipation - but i 've forgotten the rest of your question , " schlaemmer told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people were taken in by hape kerkeling 's 1991 impersonation of queen beatrix of the netherlands riffing off of the slogan that won barack obama the american presidency , schlaemmer 's campaign catchphrase is " yes weekend . " his trademark look includes an ill-fitting trench coat , glasses that cover what little of his face is n't hidden behind his bushy mustache , and a dirty grey wig .
schlaemmer has gained the kind of media exposure and enthusiasm that more legitimate contenders for the chancellor 's seat can only dream of .
but perhaps that 's to be expected when your campaign promises include state-subsidized tanning and cradle-to-grave income .
two major german television channels aired live coverage of schlaemmer 's first press conference for nearly two hours .
in contrast , those same networks cut away from real-life candidate frank-walter steinmeier as he was explaining how he 'd fulfill a campaign promise of creating 4 million jobs by 2020 .
eighteen percent of the people surveyed by german polling institute forsa said they could imagine voting for schlaemmer 's party if it did in fact exist in real life .
that 's not so much less than the latest poll numbers for the social democratic party , currently in opposition , which garnered just 22 percent of registered voters ' support , according to forsa .
" schlaemmer is an alternative to your usual grey-suited politician in germany , " political scientist gero neugebauer of berlin 's free university told afp .
" i can imagine people are fed up with politics and politicians ... the boring campaign makes schlaemmer more interesting . "
germany 's general elections will be held on september 27. svs / afp / ap editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

two taliban insurgents were killed in a gun battle in kabul as sporadic violence across the country threatened to unsettle voters .
the attack , coming after the taliban said 20 of their fighters had infiltrated the capital , was the worst of several on polling stations and voters .
the taliban have struck repeatedly inside the capital in a bloody countdown to elections that are aimed at putting the country more firmly on the path to democracy eight years after the us-led invasion ousted the militia 's regime .
however , despite the violence in places like kandahar in the south and in the northern provinces of baghlan and takhar , the united nations said there were encouraging signs of high turnout .
" the vast majority of polling stations have been able to open and have received voting materials , " said aleem siddique , spokesman for the un mission in kabul .
" we are seeing queues forming at polling stations in the north , also in the capital , as well as , encouragingly , in the east . "
scores of people queued up at polling stations in the capital and major cities under government control , and some 95 percent of 6,500 polling stations opened on schedule , the independent election commission said .
" the turnout is very good , but we do n't have exact figures , " said deputy chief electoral officer zekria barakzai , predicting that it could reach around 50 percent overall .
seventeen million afghans have registered to elect a president and 420 councilors in 34 provinces across the largely rural , impoverished country .
it is a difficult process in a nation where more than 70 percent of people are illiterate and bound by fierce tribal and religious allegiances .
karzai bullish despite energetic abdullah bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai could face a run-off with his rival abdullah abdullah western-backed president hamid karzai hopes to win an outright majority to avoid a run-off , but his nervous government ordered a blackout on reporting on violence during polling day , threatening journalists with heavy penalties .
" i request my dear countrymen to come out and cast their vote to decide their future , " karzai said as he voted in a kabul boys ' school near his heavily fortified palace , dismissing fears of unrest .
however , one opinion poll carried out by a us organization predicted karzai would be forced into a run-off , winning 44 percent of the vote , and his rival abdullah abdullah , who has a northern powerbase and draws on ethnic tajik support , would take 26 percent .
there are around 30 other candidates .
abdullah hailed " a day of change " as he voted alongside his wife and young son amid a throng of journalists and phalanx of security men .
an energetic campaign by the ex-foreign minister has boosted the chance of a run-off , which would take place in around six weeks ' time .
the election is also a test for us president barack obama , who has ordered a massive troop build-up this year as part of a strategy to reverse taliban gains .
obama 's envoy for the region , richard holbrooke , toured polling stations in kabul and said what he 'd seen was " open and honest , " adding : " so far every prediction of disaster turned out to be wrong . "
nato troops on alert and ready to quell violence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attacks ahead of the election put isaf on red alert troops from nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- and afghan forces were still on high alert despite the level of violence being far below that predicted .
" we have been doing an immense amount of work to try and ensure the best possible security for the elections , " lieutenant general jim dutton , the deputy commander of the nato-led force drawn from about 40 nations , told reporters .
" of course the real test is election day , " the british general added .
the biggest threats facing troops were suicide bombers , rockets and maybe ambushes , he said .
" the mission , as for all coalition forces , is to be the least visible to show that this is an election organized by the afghans themselves , " said lieutenant colonel stephane chenel , another nato commander .
" if there is a threat , all forces will be able to intervene .
everyone will be deployed and , in an immediate threat , go anywhere at any moment , " the french officer said .
isaf officials said that despite rising taliban violence , less than one percent of polling stations were at risk of attack .
but isaf spokesman brigadier general eric tremblay acknowledged : " despite the best plans in place , there will always be some residual risk . "
around eight districts – out of 365 nationwide – contain " high risk " areas where polling stations are considered unlikely to open , mainly in the taliban heartland of southern afghanistan. nda / afp / reuters / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this marks an acceleration of the airline ’ s war against what it regards as online touts . ryanair lodged proceedings against leipzig-based internet firm unister at the high court in dublin this week .
the airline claims websites operated by unister use " screen-scraping " software to gather information from ryanair 's website without permission and then sell tickets to customers at inflated prices .
screen scraping is the process by which one computer program collects specific data from another .
in this case , unister 's software is constantly extracting information from other airline companies ' websites – rates , travel times , availability – and then neatly packaging and displaying that information on its own website for potential customers to search and compare .
while ryanair says it has no problem cooperating with authorized price comparison websites , it is unhappy that sites operated by unister hit customers with " hidden charges " . when a customer buys a return flight from duesseldorf to london on ryanair 's own website , for example , the final price including payment handling fees might be 93.25 euros .
if a customer buys the same ryanair flight using one of unister 's websites , additional fees push the final price up to 111.86 euros .
" ryanair is determined to continue its pro-consumer campaign against screen-scraper ticket-tout websites until the last screen scraper stops overcharging unsuspecting consumers , " ryanair spokesman stephen mcnamara said in a statement .
" our strategy of defending consumer rights in irish courts is proving successful and the number of active screen scrapers is rapidly decreasing , ” mcnamara said , adding : “ sadly , unister chose to continue overcharging consumers in breach of ryanair 's rights and left us no alternative but to refer them to the dublin high court . "
battle brewing unister spokesman konstantin korosides told deutsche welle that while management had not yet received official notification of the lawsuit , they were preparing for a legal battle .
“ we think that a german court is responsible , not an irish one , because we are a german online company .
that means jurisdiction has to be here , ” korosides said .
unister argues that screen-scraper software is not illegal and that its websites simply offer customers a service that helps them make a more informed decision when booking a flight .
“ we are an online travel agency , ” korosides said .
“ we charge a small fee for providing our service .
there 's nothing illegal with going to a travel agency , is there ? ”
“ we have 1.6 million visitors coming to one of our travel websites every month .
surely they would stop coming if they felt we were cheating them , ” he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german football star michael ballack is the face of one of unister 's online ad campaigns violation of terms of service ryanair , however , maintains that by reproducing information from its website without permission , unister and other screen scrapers are violating the ryanair website 's terms of service , which prohibit third parties from using its platform for commercial purposes .
the irish airline has intensified its legal campaign against german screen-scraping websites over the past 12 months , with mixed results .
in may , a hamburg court confirmed a 2008 injunction that banned german screen scraper vtours from reselling ryanair tickets because it was doing so in its own name .
in march , however , a frankfurt court blocked ryanair 's attempt to cancel bookings made through unauthorized screen scrapers , ruling that the german price comparison website cheaptickets.de did not break any laws when accessing ryanair 's database , and that the tickets purchased through the site were therefore valid .
since then ryanair has been pursuing screen scrapers through irish courts .
earlier this month , four german screen scrapers bowed to pressure from the airline 's lawyers and signed a binding agreement stating they would stop accessing the airline 's website and reselling its tickets .
legal grey zone ?
e-commerce experts say that depending on the exact application , screen scrapers often operate in a legal grey zone .
“ the law has n't caught up with this technology yet , ” said jason bellows , an it consultant at screen-scraper.com , a us-based company that sells the kind of software unister uses to harvest information from ryanair .
while many companies in the travel and financial sectors are happy about the extra business aggregator websites attract , bellows said he has often complied with large companies requesting that his firm decline assistance to third parties planning unauthorized access to their databases on several occasions .
common reasons for such requests include perceived harm to their brand 's reputation for value , a loss of potential online advertising revenue , and – for smaller firms – the technical strain screen scrapers place on low-capacity computer servers .
many complaints are based on alleged breaches of a website 's terms of use , but bellows said the strongest argument , in the us at least , was the threat of an intellectual property lawsuit .
“ people put the information on the internet to be used . our software just helps people find that information and use it better , ” bellows told deutsche welle . “ what we are always worried about , though , is copyright laws .
we never want our users to violate copyright laws . ”

global support more than 270,000 election observers , including 2,000 from abroad , are overseeing the balloting at more than 6,500 polling centres , while the commission said it was unable to open voting stations in nine districts that remain outside government control .
polling stations opened at 9:30 am local time -lrb- 0500 utc -rrb- and voting is to continue until 4 pm -lrb- 1130 gmt -rrb- .
results are not expected until about 48 hours after the polls are closed , according to the independent election commission .
while karzai leads in recent opinion polls , he is not expected to receive more than 50 percent to win the elections outright .
if no candidate posts a first-round majority , a run-off would be held around first week of october. mrh / dpa / afp editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

us first lady michelle obama and secretary of state hillary clinton failed to even make the top 30 . the magazine highlighted merkel 's role as leader of the huge german economy and her likely re-election in september .
she was lauded for her efforts in overhauling the german health and tax systems and strict line on curbing expanding european union budgets .
she has topped the list four times since becoming the first female chancellor of germany in 2005 .
merkel was among only four non-american women to make the top 10 .
britain 's cynthia carroll , chief executive at anglo american – one of the world 's largest diversified mining and natural resource groups – came in fourth .
ho ching , the chief executive of investment giant temasek holdings in singapore , came fifth .
anne lauvergeon , chief executive of france 's nuclear power company areva , came in at number nine .
the 2009 list was dominated by businesswomen , mostly from the united states .

two notches below her , at 42 , came britain 's queen elizabeth ii .

" highly ambitious women ... are moving across companies and industries , making big leaps with each change , and repositioning themselves for opportunities that allow them to gain a breadth of experience , " the business magazine said .

deutsche welle 's peter philipp looks at who stands to profit from the destabilization of afghanistan . in afghanistan 's eventful history , it was largely the interests of large foreign powers that prevented peace in the country at the foothills of the hindukush mountains . the foreign powers included the british , who pursued their own interests there , the russians and finally the americans - together with allies pakistan and saudi arabia . caught between powerful foreign interests the issues at stake were securing british supply lanes to india , ensuring russian access to the indian ocean , and finally repelling and beating back the soviet union with the help of the three-way alliance of washington , islamabad and riyadh . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche welle 's peter philipp those interests never focused on bolstering a strong afghan state , rather they were about installing an accommodating central government in kabul and maintaining a system of loyal regional chieftains in the country .
it was a system that had worked for centuries in afghanistan .
or sometimes it did n't . an afghan proverb speaks of a " a king under every tree . "
the king - and that included the presidents of the country - were merely seen as mayors of the capital kabul .
and their power was only recognized in the provinces if they sealed " deals " with the local rulers and gave them a free hand to run their own affairs . drugs trade flourishing that 's exactly what current president hamid karzai is doing .
once celebrated as the savior of afghanistan by the us and europe , karzai has long left the path of democracy and the rule of law . he has allied himself with regional " warlords " who are meant to ensure karzai power and influence in the provinces and who in return can thwart any attempt at normalization .
corruption is a daily occurrence but what 's worse is that the growing of poppy has reached record volumes in recent years , making afghanistan a notorious leading world exporter of drugs . ordinary farmers do n't earn a lot with their poppy fields but it 's still much more than what they would make with alternative crops such as wheat .
the " warlords " have long-turned into powerful " drug bosses " who rake in huge profits to finance their weapons and who are thus difficult to pressurize . these druglords are flexible and ready to hammer out an alliance with just about anybody .
the main thing is that their powerful positions are untouched . they also work together with the taliban , who are against the opium trade on religious and ideological grounds , but have long used this lucrative economic and agricultural sector for their own purposes . stabilizing afghanistan foreign nations - from afghanistan 's neighbors to europe and the us - are today more interested in calming the situation and stabilizing afghanistan . those interested in the opposite are primarily the regional rulers and the drug bosses who do n't want to give up their power and influence .

in addition , four eu countries have privately told the administration that they are committed to resettling detainees , and five other eu nations are considering taking some , according to officials in us president barack obama 's administration , who spoke to the newspaper on the condition of anonymity .
there are still 229 prisoners at the camp , which was opened in january 2002 by then president george w. bush to hold " enemy combatants " in the us " war on terror . "
obama has ordered the camp to be closed by january 22 , 2010 .
to meet that goal , the administration has appointed daniel fried , a longtime diplomat with deep ties to eastern europe and parts of the former soviet union , to lead negotiations with other countries .
some 80 prisoners are ready for release .
the post said that if resettling agreements could be made , a reduced detainee population would likely ease the politically charged debate on moving remaining prisoners to a facility on us soil .
of the detainees cleared for release so far , eleven have been transferred home or to third countries , including bermuda , which accepted four chinese uighurs .
the pacific island of palau has agreed to resettle the 13 remaining uighur detainees , and more than half of them are willing to go or are seriously considering the offer .
us looking towards eastern europe in addition , the administration has held positive talks with australia and georgia , and it has formally approached or is planning to hold talks with countries in south america , the persian gulf , the balkans and the former soviet union , the post wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama has pledged to close the camp by 2010 congress has blocked the white house from resettling any detainees in the united states , a move that us and some european officials feared would lead other countries , particularly in the eu , to refuse to help close the military prison .
but the issue has proved relatively unproblematic , officials said .
" obama has a lot of political capital .
countries want to do something for him , and that allows us to say , ' this is it , this is what we want you to do , " ' said a senior administration official quoted in the report .
" this is going a lot better than we might have thought . "
one senior administration official said negotiations in eastern europe will intensify once detainees arrive in larger eu countries , such as italy and spain .
the post also reported that us and european officials believe stalled negotiations with berlin can be rekindled after germany holds national parliamentary elections next month .
and there is some expectation that france , which has taken one detainee , may accept more. nda / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the attacks were the worst since the beginning of the us withdrawal , writes rainer sollich , head of dw 's arabic service . statistics frequently say little about actual circumstances , such as whether or not the most recent terror attacks in iraq are a result of the us troop draw down .
the number of victims in the weeks before american troops began leaving iraqi city centers had actually increased .
after their withdrawal , the violence decreased at first , only to re-emerge in the form of a bloodbath in the middle of baghdad .
if there are any conclusions to be drawn from this , then only that with or without us troops , iraq remains in the clutches of violence and terror .
security , of course , has markedly improved in the last couple of years , but the official iraqi and american claims that the situation is under control display a rather peculiar interpretation of calm .
iraq is still gripped by the constant threat of violence .
attacks continue unabated attacks are reported on almost a daily basis , although the general public is not aware of many of them .
it is a sad but logical consequence of the never-ending media coverage that the topic of " terror in iraq " has worn thin and now garners little international interest .
an attack with " just " four or five dead no longer warrants a headline , but then , when the number of victims jumps dramatically , the customary response mechanisms shift into gear .
the un security council , the white house and the european union all condemn the violence in unison , and media outlets provide the public with the gory details of death and destruction as well as displays of dismay , anger and sympathy .
people around the world see the images on television and ask themselves : where does all this hate come from and how can people be capable of subjecting others to such senseless pain and suffering ? # b # the answer is as simple as it is cynical .
it is done expressly for that purpose .
the perpetrators intended to strike the innocent and spread fear .
they do not want iraq to be peaceful ; they enjoy the international condemnation .
and they want to see their deeds on television .
every form of media attention lends weight to their acts of terror .
however , no revamping of media ethics – no matter how sophisticated – can help .
what is needed , first and foremost , is drastically improved security .
fertile ground for terrorists the latest wave of violence in baghdad illustrates the deficits within the iraqi government to guarantee security and promote national reconciliation .
the government has announced plans to close the existing gaps in security , and that is an important first step .
but it can not be the only one .
terrorists will always find fertile ground and support from segments of the iraqi population , or from abroad , as long as the conflict between ethnic and religious groups and their leaders is unresolved .
the lack of mutual respect and the thirst for revenge will not disappear overnight – and neither will the thirst for power and the country 's oil reserves .
it may seem bold , even risky , that the united states is sticking to its plan to withdraw from iraq completely by the end of 2011 .
however , this may be the appropriate leverage to force the government in baghdad to undertake greater efforts to solve its domestic conflicts and pursue a path of national reconciliation .

the day saw relatively little violence although concerns remain over a possible low turnout due to threats of taliban attacks . " our assessment is that , in general , these elections went much better than we anticipated , " ettore sequi , the european union 's special representative to afghanistan , told afp .
the roughly 6,200 election centers which were able to accept voters was " an achievement considering the concerns before the election , " he added .
despite dozens of taliban missiles and bombs and the deaths of more than 20 people , many international leaders agreed with sequi 's statement .
german chancellor angela merkel called the election " an important chapter in the democratic development of the country . "
nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen said the election was " a testimony to the determination of the afghan people to build democracy . "
he congratulated the voters for their courage in the face of taliban threats .
" seen from a security point of view , the election has been a success , " he said .
" the most important thing is that the election will be considered credible in the eyes of the afghan people . "
while no official voter turnout figures have been released , there is concern that if a low percentage of the 15 million registered voters showed up to cast their ballots , it would diminish the legitimacy of the election .
taliban attacks close some polls , delay voting as voting continued across the country during the day , taliban militants stormed a town in northern afghanistan , launching a multi-pronged assault that left at least eight of them dead and kept polling stations from opening , officials said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban attacks disrupted voting in some areas " terrorists attacked from several directions .
fighting has been going on since morning , " provincial police chief mohammad kabir andarabi told reporters in baghlan .
" now , as we speak , the enemy has been pushed back .
we have killed 22 terrorists .
most of their bodies are left on the ground , " he added .
abdul majeed azimi , head of the provincial intelligence agency , confirmed the incident but said the corpses of only eight rebels were found .
the local district police chief and one of his guards were also killed .
a 12-year-old boy was wounded in the clashes , he added .
azimi said polling stations did not open in the small town on the highway between pul-i-khumri , the capital of baghlan province , and kunduz province .
" no elections there .
i do n't think there will be because fighting is ongoing , " he said .
residents confirmed to local media that no polling stations were open .
eu calls on afghans to resist taliban pressure the eu had called on the afghan people to defy the taliban and cast their ballots , as a team of about 100 eu observers kept a watchful eye on the voting process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu and nato commended afghans on their election " we encourage the afghan people to go out and vote on this very important day , which sets the path towards democracy for the afghan nation and its people , " european commission spokesman john clancy said in brussels . clancy said no eu monitors had been injured in any attacks . the eu has the largest international observer mission in afghanistan . european election mission to monitor results headed by philippe morillon , a former french general and now a member of the european parliament , the mission has been monitoring the election campaign and is now focusing on polling , counting and tallying the results . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : morillon 's team will begin monitoring the election results it plans to condemn any serious breach of electoral rules and procedures , with a preliminary statement from morillon expected on saturday . so far , its biggest worry has been with proxy voting . concerns have been fuelled by a suspiciously high rate of registration for female voters in traditionally conservative parts of the country .
despite being escorted by afghan and nato forces , the monitors have not been deployed throughout the country owing to the precarious security situation . the eu is a major donor to afghanistan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 20.08.2009 german finance minister defends hypo real estate bailout großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck went into the hearing with guns blazing the german finance minister has told a bundestag probe that the string of state bailouts worth an excess of 100 billion euros for lender hypo real estate was " appropriate and correct . " the government rescue of the struggling hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- mortgage lender prevented a " global financial meltdown , " according to finance minister peer steinbrueck .
the social democrat , answering questions from a parliamentary enquiry investigating the bailout of hre , described the german government 's actions as " appropriate and correct . "
" we made the right decisions , " steinbrueck said .
" it was n't us politicians who caused this financial crisis , but we were the ones who mastered it . "
hypo real estate needed a series of state bailouts to keep it from going under .
the loans and credit guarantees offered to hre total 102 billion euros -lrb- $ 145 billion -rrb- , with 87 billion coming from the government in berlin and the remainder from other german banks .
" we had to make decisions in real time , contending with enormous time pressures .
and we did n't always have all the relevant information at our disposal . "
steinbrueck also dismissed criticism that his right hand man at the time , state finance secretary joerg asmussen , was unprepared during the negotiations and allowed the banks to pull the wool over his eyes .
" that is absurd and has been disproven , " he said .
" therefore , i 'm not going to even discuss it . "
steinbrueck said that asmussen had n't negotiated poorly , but rather he 'd fought " tooth and nail - right up to the pain barrier . "
triggered by lehman collapse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors , who were later escorted out of the hearing , disagree with steinbrueck when asked about the tipping point for hypo real estate , steinbrueck pointed to the collapse of us lender lehman brothers in september 2008 , dismissing the political opposition 's claims that the bank was already headed for trouble much earlier in the year .
he said that the lehmann brothers bankruptcy put a dramatic stop to inter-bank lending , thus crippling hypo real estate .
hre and its irish subsidiary depfa had been relying on loans from other lenders in order to keep supplying mortgages for months before lehmann brothers went under .
" between september 15 and october 5 the financial world stood millimeters away from the cliff edge , " steinbrueck said .
the german finance minister also questioned the us decision to let lehmann brothers fall , describing it as a test with disastrous consequences .
after the bankruptcy , leading industrial nations committed not to let similar large financial institutions go bankrupt .
the german government decided that hre - with a value of around 400 billion euros - qualified as an irreplaceable money lender. msh / ap / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" megrahi now faces a sentence imposed by a higher power , " said scottish justice minister kenny macaskill at a news conference on thursday .
" it is terminal , final and irrevocable .
he is going to die . "
shortly afterwards megrahi boarded a libyan jet that had been sent from tripoli to collect him .
relatives of the victims and the united states government were opposed to his release .
on tuesday us secretary of state hillary clinton said that it would be " absolutely wrong " to free al-megrahi , who was responsible for a " horrendous crime . "
his guilt has always been in question .
some are convinced that he was responsible , while others have consistently labeled his conviction a miscarriage of justice .
either way , megrahi is the only one ever to be tried and convicted .
circumstantial evidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : megrahi is on his way back to libya megrahi , a father of five , was born in tripoli , libya in 1952 .
he has a good command of the english language , a skill he picked up when he studied in the us .
he had also visited britain several times .
he ran an international relations think tank in libya called the center for strategic studies , a job that the fbi has claimed provided him with the perfect cover to work as an operative for the libyan intelligence services -lrb- jso -rrb- .
for a time , he was also based in malta as director of security for libyan arab airways -lrb- laa -rrb- , a job that prosecutors said gave him knowledge and access to secure airlines .
the key piece of evidence in his trial was that pieces of clothing that megrahi had bought in malta were found wrapped around the bomb .
a fateful flight on december 22 , 1988 , pan am flight 103 took off from london 's heathrow airport , headed for new york .
on board were 259 passengers .
approximately 38 minutes into the flight , the plane exploded at 31,000 feet over lockerbie , scotland , killing all the passengers as well as 11 people on the ground .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pan am 103 memorial in arlington cemetary it took three years of painstaking investigation , but finally in 1999 , officials indicted two libyans , al-amin khalifa fhimah and abdelbaset ali mohmed al-megrahi , on 270 counts of murder .
by then the two men were home and libyan leader moammar gadhafi refused to hand them over .
thus began years of international pressure on libya .
in 1992 the un security council imposed sanctions on libya over its refusal to hand over the men .
it was not until six years later , in 1998 , that gadhafi finally said that the trial could take place , but only in a neutral country .
the us and britain proposed using scottish law in the netherlands and gadhafi agreed .
after nelson mandela visited gadhafi in 1999 , the men were finally extradited and the trial began at camp zeist in the netherlands .
justice takes time the trial began in 2000 , and from the start both of the accused denied any involvement in the lockerbie bombing .
the proceedings lasted a year and in the end , al-megrahi was sentenced to life in prison while al-amin khalifa fhimah , was found not guilty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al-amin khalifa fhimah was found not guilty al-megrahi immediately launched an appeal and fhimah went home .
in 2002 , a panel of five scottish judges began hearing his appeal which was denied three months later .
the next several years saw more legal wrangling between al-megrahi and the scottish legal system .
in 2007 , the scottish criminal cases review commission recommended that he should be granted a second appeal .
power politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libya 's moammar gadhafi paid compensation in the background of all the legal proceedings was a combination of money , oil and politics .
oil makes up a big part of the libyan economy .
according to the cia factbook , the libyan economy depends almost entirely on revenues from the oil sector , which contribute about 95 percent of export earnings , about one quarter of the gross domestic product , and roughly 60 percent of public sector wages .
in other words , un sanctions hit libya very hard .
libya clearly felt the strain and within the last few years the libyans have renounced nuclear arms and agreed to pay compensation to the families of the lockerbie victims .
former british prime minister tony blair was among the first politicians to become involved in helping british petroleum -lrb- bp -rrb- and shell win exploration acreage in libya .
the release of al-megrahi could ease tensions between britain and libya and open further business opportunities .
in fact some of the relatives of the victims of the lockerbie bombings have intimated that a deal has been struck. av / reuters / afp / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his poll ratings are the envy of many real-life politicians . what snorts like a warthog rooting for grubs , has hair like a vintage rabbit pelt , and sports an overbite rarely seen outside of the animal kingdom ?
just germany 's latest political sensation : a comedian in the guise of a scruffy small-time journalist named horst schlaemmer , whose fake bid for the german chancellorship has injected some real humor into a boring campaign season .
the undeniably unappealing alter ego of popular german funnyman hape kerkeling is the star of his own feature film , which debuted to throngs of fans in berlin on thursday .
the movie , " isch kandidiere " -lrb- " i 'm running for chancellor ! " -rrb- follows the faux candidate as he looks for support among the common people and german stars like rapper bushido and ex-racing champion michael schumacher .
bushido also contributed schlaemmer 's campaign song .
" first of all , i 'd like to point out that the horst schlaemmer party stands for justice , and of course it stands for freedom , and yes , women 's emancipation - but i 've forgotten the rest of your question , " schlaemmer told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people were taken in by hape kerkeling 's 1991 impersonation of queen beatrix of the netherlands riffing off of the slogan that won barack obama the american presidency , schlaemmer 's campaign catchphrase is " yes weekend . " his trademark look includes an ill-fitting trench coat , glasses that cover what little of his face is n't hidden behind his bushy mustache , and a dirty grey wig .
schlaemmer has gained the kind of media exposure and enthusiasm that more legitimate contenders for the chancellor 's seat can only dream of .
but perhaps that 's to be expected when your campaign promises include state-subsidized tanning and cradle-to-grave income .
two major german television channels aired live coverage of schlaemmer 's first press conference for nearly two hours .
in contrast , those same networks cut away from real-life candidate frank-walter steinmeier as he was explaining how he 'd fulfill a campaign promise of creating 4 million jobs by 2020 .
eighteen percent of the people surveyed by german polling institute forsa said they could imagine voting for schlaemmer 's party if it did in fact exist in real life .
that 's not so much less than the latest poll numbers for the social democratic party , currently in opposition , which garnered just 22 percent of registered voters ' support , according to forsa .
" schlaemmer is an alternative to your usual grey-suited politician in germany , " political scientist gero neugebauer of berlin 's free university told afp .
" i can imagine people are fed up with politics and politicians ... the boring campaign makes schlaemmer more interesting . "
germany 's general elections will be held on september 27. svs / afp / ap editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a nomadic film project wants to change that – in the tradition of travelling cinema . a big old bus bumps over the cobblestones of a village road in eastern germany , close to the polish border .
it is pulling the kinomobilny - a blue and white trailer transformed into a cinema-popcorn-bar .
the driver , 30-year-old janosch from berlin , is proud of the kinomobilny .
" this is an ' intercamp 2000 , ' a trailer from the gdr .
back then they had small trailers costing 8,000 east german marks , but we got the version they sold for 40,000 , " janosch said .
" this was the export version , made for the western market .
but they only produced 50 because nobody in the west was really interested in premium trailers from the gdr . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crew of " kinomobilny " are taking their show to several towns along the border janosch is one of the 20-strong cinema crew touring along the german-polish border region this summer .
financed partly by the eu , the crew are zigzagging their way along the border in order to screen short films on both sides of the oder and neisse , the rivers separating germany and poland .
tomek from the kulturalny kolletyw team at the university of gdansk organized the polish side of the tour .
he hopes the kinomobilny will bring people on both sides of the border closer together .
" although the border is open , people stick to their own country .
they do not speak a different language than their own and they do not even go to the other side .
this is really strange to me .
i mean , it is so easy to get to the other side of the border , but people are not really interested , " said tomek .
cycling through terra incognita the project 's equipment travels with some of the crew by bus and trailer .
as there are only four seats available , the rest of the german-polish crew are left to make their way using pedal power .
every day they cycle up to 35 miles -lrb- 56 kilometers -rrb- , passing through nature reserves and sleepy villages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : every day the organizers cycle up to 35 miles none of the team members has been to the border region before .
for 30-year-old miriam from berlin it 's a chance to explore some terra incognita .
" it is so beautiful and peaceful here .
the bike path runs along the oder and neisse rivers and the landscape is really amazing , " said miriam .
" it is interesting to think that there is so much political meaning to such an idyllic area . "
no rest for the cycling cinema crew as soon as they arrive at the village of boxberg in eastern germany , the crew sets up their open-air cinema .
this involves hanging light bulbs , putting up recliners and checking the projector for the evening 's screening .
some of the crew head into the village to hand out flyers to the local inhabitants .
after sunset the first villagers show up .
they seem surprised that an intercultural project like kinomobilny has stopped in their village .
most of the villagers feel the german-polish relationship is best left to politicians and not something to be tackled in their own backyards - even if poland is only a stone 's throw away .
the program consists of seven german and polish short films that focus on cliches and stereotypes .
but they also show a new , refreshing perspective on polish-german relations .
for example , there 's a rabbit looking for the love of his life at the berlin wall , polish hooligans and the perceived madness of german red tape .
each film is screened in its original language with subtitles in german or polish .

his poll ratings are the envy of many real-life politicians . what snorts like a warthog rooting for grubs , has hair like a vintage rabbit pelt , and sports an overbite rarely seen outside of the animal kingdom ?
just germany 's latest political sensation : a comedian in the guise of a scruffy small-time journalist named horst schlaemmer , whose fake bid for the german chancellorship has injected some real humor into a boring campaign season .
the undeniably unappealing alter ego of popular german funnyman hape kerkeling is the star of his own feature film , which debuted to throngs of fans in berlin on thursday .

part of the bafin investigation will focus on recent fluctuations in share prices at competitor-cum-merger partner volkswagen .
during the drawn-out merger negotiations between vw and porsche , a collection of cash settlement options in vw shares earned porsche billions as the stock climbed in value .
the stock revaluation that resulted briefly made porsche the world 's biggest company by market capitalization .

under wiedeking , porsche accumulated a 51-percent stake in its much larger rival vw , europe 's largest carmaker , and wanted to take full control but the attempt failed and left porsche squeezed under a huge debt pile .
following a tip from bafin , stuttgart prosecutors launched a separate inquiry into porsche with police seizing documents in their raid on thursday .

former porsche chief wendelin wiedeking is also under investigation . dealings by wiedeking and former porsche chief financial officer holger haerter , both of whom resigned from their posts last month , are being examined by germany 's financial supervisory authority -lrb- bafin -rrb- on suspicion of market manipulation .
part of the bafin investigation will focus on recent fluctuations in share prices at competitor-cum-merger partner volkswagen .
during the drawn-out merger negotiations between vw and porsche , a collection of cash settlement options in vw shares earned porsche billions as the stock climbed in value .
the stock revaluation that resulted briefly made porsche the world 's biggest company by market capitalization .
until a few months ago porsche was making more money from its financial dealings than from car sales at a time when carmakers around the world were suffering from a collapse in global auto markets .
under wiedeking , porsche accumulated a 51-percent stake in its much larger rival vw , europe 's largest carmaker , and wanted to take full control but the attempt failed and left porsche squeezed under a huge debt pile .
following a tip from bafin , stuttgart prosecutors launched a separate inquiry into porsche with police seizing documents in their raid on thursday .
porsche has denied the allegations of market manipulation and said it would cooperate and assist investigators .

the 25-year-old vlasic , meanwhile , claimed gold with a jump of 2.04 meters .
friedrich and vlasic have been engaged in a tussle at the peak of world high jumping for the past 12 months , with the german coming out on top in three of the four competitions in which they have faced each other this year in the lead up to the current meet in berlin .
at a golden league event in berlin earlier this year , friedrich leaped to a german record of 2.06 meters - also the highest jump of the year - to take first place .
she was bettered only a few weeks later in monaco , however , when the croat consigned her to her first second-place finish of the year .
but in qualifying for thursday 's final , friedrich sent a clear message to her rival by clearing the 1.95-meter qualifying height on her first jump .
vlasic needed a few extra jumps to clear the same height .
coming into the championships friedrich was considered one of the german athletes most likely to bag a medal .
she is also one of the most recognizable athletes on the track .
her pink knee-high socks , large sunglasses and bleach-blond hair are unmistakable .

the 25-year-old vlasic , meanwhile , claimed gold with a jump of 2.04 meters .
friedrich and vlasic have been engaged in a tussle at the peak of world high jumping for the past 12 months , with the german coming out on top in three of the four competitions in which they have faced each other this year in the lead up to the current meet in berlin .
at a golden league event in berlin earlier this year , friedrich leaped to a german record of 2.06 meters - also the highest jump of the year - to take first place .
she was bettered only a few weeks later in monaco , however , when the croat consigned her to her first second-place finish of the year .
but in qualifying for thursday 's final , friedrich sent a clear message to her rival by clearing the 1.95-meter qualifying height on her first jump .
vlasic needed a few extra jumps to clear the same height .
coming into the championships friedrich was considered one of the german athletes most likely to bag a medal .
she is also one of the most recognizable athletes on the track .

the 25-year-old vlasic , meanwhile , claimed gold with a jump of 2.04 meters .
friedrich and vlasic have been engaged in a tussle at the peak of world high jumping for the past 12 months , with the german coming out on top in three of the four competitions in which they have faced each other this year in the lead up to the current meet in berlin .
at a golden league event in berlin earlier this year , friedrich leaped to a german record of 2.06 meters - also the highest jump of the year - to take first place .
she was bettered only a few weeks later in monaco , however , when the croat consigned her to her first second-place finish of the year .
but in qualifying for thursday 's final , friedrich sent a clear message to her rival by clearing the 1.95-meter qualifying height on her first jump .
vlasic needed a few extra jumps to clear the same height .
coming into the championships friedrich was considered one of the german athletes most likely to bag a medal .
she is also one of the most recognizable athletes on the track .
her pink knee-high socks , large sunglasses and bleach-blond hair are unmistakable .

just germany 's latest political sensation : a comedian in the guise of a scruffy small-time journalist named horst schlaemmer , whose fake bid for the german chancellorship has injected some real humor into a boring campaign season .
the undeniably unappealing alter ego of popular german funnyman hape kerkeling is the star of his own feature film , which debuted to throngs of fans in berlin on thursday .
the movie , " isch kandidiere " -lrb- " i 'm running for chancellor ! " -rrb- follows the faux candidate as he looks for support among the common people and german stars like rapper bushido and ex-racing champion michael schumacher .
bushido also contributed schlaemmer 's campaign song .
" first of all , i 'd like to point out that the horst schlaemmer party stands for justice , and of course it stands for freedom , and yes , women 's emancipation - but i 've forgotten the rest of your question , " schlaemmer told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people were taken in by hape kerkeling 's 1991 impersonation of queen beatrix of the netherlands riffing off of the slogan that won barack obama the american presidency , schlaemmer 's campaign catchphrase is " yes weekend . " his trademark look includes an ill-fitting trench coat , glasses that cover what little of his face is n't hidden behind his bushy mustache , and a dirty grey wig .
schlaemmer has gained the kind of media exposure and enthusiasm that more legitimate contenders for the chancellor 's seat can only dream of .
but perhaps that 's to be expected when your campaign promises include state-subsidized tanning and cradle-to-grave income .
two major german television channels aired live coverage of schlaemmer 's first press conference for nearly two hours .
in contrast , those same networks cut away from real-life candidate frank-walter steinmeier as he was explaining how he 'd fulfill a campaign promise of creating 4 million jobs by 2020 .
eighteen percent of the people surveyed by german polling institute forsa said they could imagine voting for schlaemmer 's party if it did in fact exist in real life .
that 's not so much less than the latest poll numbers for the social democratic party , currently in opposition , which garnered just 22 percent of registered voters ' support , according to forsa .
" schlaemmer is an alternative to your usual grey-suited politician in germany , " political scientist gero neugebauer of berlin 's free university told afp .

" megrahi now faces a sentence imposed by a higher power , " said scottish justice minister kenny macaskill at a news conference on thursday .
" it is terminal , final and irrevocable .
he is going to die . "
shortly afterwards megrahi boarded a libyan jet that had been sent from tripoli to collect him .
relatives of the victims and the united states government were opposed to his release .
on tuesday us secretary of state hillary clinton said that it would be " absolutely wrong " to free al-megrahi , who was responsible for a " horrendous crime . "
his guilt has always been in question .
some are convinced that he was responsible , while others have consistently labeled his conviction a miscarriage of justice .
either way , megrahi is the only one ever to be tried and convicted .
circumstantial evidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : megrahi is on his way back to libya megrahi , a father of five , was born in tripoli , libya in 1952 .
he has a good command of the english language , a skill he picked up when he studied in the us .
he had also visited britain several times .
he ran an international relations think tank in libya called the center for strategic studies , a job that the fbi has claimed provided him with the perfect cover to work as an operative for the libyan intelligence services -lrb- jso -rrb- .
for a time , he was also based in malta as director of security for libyan arab airways -lrb- laa -rrb- , a job that prosecutors said gave him knowledge and access to secure airlines .
the key piece of evidence in his trial was that pieces of clothing that megrahi had bought in malta were found wrapped around the bomb .
a fateful flight on december 22 , 1988 , pan am flight 103 took off from london 's heathrow airport , headed for new york .
on board were 259 passengers .
approximately 38 minutes into the flight , the plane exploded at 31,000 feet over lockerbie , scotland , killing all the passengers as well as 11 people on the ground .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pan am 103 memorial in arlington cemetary it took three years of painstaking investigation , but finally in 1999 , officials indicted two libyans , al-amin khalifa fhimah and abdelbaset ali mohmed al-megrahi , on 270 counts of murder .
by then the two men were home and libyan leader moammar gadhafi refused to hand them over .
thus began years of international pressure on libya .
in 1992 the un security council imposed sanctions on libya over its refusal to hand over the men .
it was not until six years later , in 1998 , that gadhafi finally said that the trial could take place , but only in a neutral country .
the us and britain proposed using scottish law in the netherlands and gadhafi agreed .
after nelson mandela visited gadhafi in 1999 , the men were finally extradited and the trial began at camp zeist in the netherlands .
justice takes time the trial began in 2000 , and from the start both of the accused denied any involvement in the lockerbie bombing .
the proceedings lasted a year and in the end , al-megrahi was sentenced to life in prison while al-amin khalifa fhimah , was found not guilty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al-amin khalifa fhimah was found not guilty al-megrahi immediately launched an appeal and fhimah went home .
in 2002 , a panel of five scottish judges began hearing his appeal which was denied three months later .
the next several years saw more legal wrangling between al-megrahi and the scottish legal system .
in 2007 , the scottish criminal cases review commission recommended that he should be granted a second appeal .
power politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libya 's moammar gadhafi paid compensation in the background of all the legal proceedings was a combination of money , oil and politics .
oil makes up a big part of the libyan economy .
according to the cia factbook , the libyan economy depends almost entirely on revenues from the oil sector , which contribute about 95 percent of export earnings , about one quarter of the gross domestic product , and roughly 60 percent of public sector wages .
in other words , un sanctions hit libya very hard .
libya clearly felt the strain and within the last few years the libyans have renounced nuclear arms and agreed to pay compensation to the families of the lockerbie victims .
former british prime minister tony blair was among the first politicians to become involved in helping british petroleum -lrb- bp -rrb- and shell win exploration acreage in libya .
the release of al-megrahi could ease tensions between britain and libya and open further business opportunities .
in fact some of the relatives of the victims of the lockerbie bombings have intimated that a deal has been struck. av / reuters / afp / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

meanwhile , caster semenya 's win struck some observers as a bit too resounding . spectators at berlin 's olympic stadium got a treat wednesday evening , cheering on a local athlete to victory in the discus .
robert harting , on his last throw of the competition , bested poland 's piotr malachowski by 28 centimeters , casting his disc 69.43 meters .
the mark was a personal best for the berlin resident , and he said the home crowd had driven him to it .
" that last meter in my final throw was thanks to this crowd , " harting told reporters .
" the fans were unbelievable , and they screamed their hearts out .
the crowd helped me in this final throw . "
it was harting 's first world championship gold medal after a silver in 2007 , and germany 's second of the competition .
reigning olympic champion and 2007 winner gerd kanter of estonia came third with a throw of 66.88 meters .
taboo breaker harting 's win , which he celebrated in style by ripping his shirt off for the camera and picking up the games ' mascot , marked a happy end to a turbulent couple of weeks for the athlete .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harting tore off his shirt after winning in an interview less than two weeks before the world championships he had said that he thought the anti-doping movement was misguided .
“ where there 's money , there will be doping , ” said harting .
“ sometimes i ask myself whether it might be better to allow doping in some form … at least that would stop people from getting so worked up about it . ”
germany 's athletic federation came out strongly against harting 's statements , and he tried to mollify them on his website in the days that followed .
still , once the meet began , harting could n't resist one more shot at the anti-doping crusaders .
as part of a campaign on behalf of former east german athletes who had been doped in the communist era , a group had given out cardboard eyeglasses frames to spectators , so that they might show their support for taking an even closer look into doping in sports .
harting , when asked what he thought of the glasses , quipped that he hoped his discus might spring up and take out a pair on the bounce .
the comment landed harting in hot water with the sport 's power brokers again , but judging from the crowd 's reaction , it did n't hurt his popularity among fans .
difficult question for south africa 's caster semenya , meanwhile , the controversy is just beginning .
she blew away the rest of the field in the women 's 800 meters , clocking in at 1:55.45 , more than two seconds and 15 meters ahead of the next best runner , janeth jepkosgei of kenya .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : semenya 's gender is to be tested but semenya 's powerful build , deep voice and rapid improvement in recent months has led some , including world athletics body iaaf , to seek to find out whether she belongs in the women 's competition at all .
the 18-year-old now faces a series of tests to confirm her gender , which officials say could take months to complete .
" at the moment there is no proof .
the benefit of the doubt has to be with the athlete , " said iaaf general secretary pierre weiss .
" but if at the end it is proven -lsb- that she is not a woman -rsb- then the medal will be withdrawn . "
the 18-year-old was shielded from the media , while jepkosgei and britain 's third place finisher jenny meadows did not want to comment on the controversy .

meanwhile , caster semenya 's win struck some observers as a bit too resounding . spectators at berlin 's olympic stadium got a treat wednesday evening , cheering on a local athlete to victory in the discus .
robert harting , on his last throw of the competition , bested poland 's piotr malachowski by 28 centimeters , casting his disc 69.43 meters .
the mark was a personal best for the berlin resident , and he said the home crowd had driven him to it .
" that last meter in my final throw was thanks to this crowd , " harting told reporters .
" the fans were unbelievable , and they screamed their hearts out .
the crowd helped me in this final throw . "
it was harting 's first world championship gold medal after a silver in 2007 , and germany 's second of the competition .
reigning olympic champion and 2007 winner gerd kanter of estonia came third with a throw of 66.88 meters .
taboo breaker harting 's win , which he celebrated in style by ripping his shirt off for the camera and picking up the games ' mascot , marked a happy end to a turbulent couple of weeks for the athlete .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harting tore off his shirt after winning in an interview less than two weeks before the world championships he had said that he thought the anti-doping movement was misguided .
“ where there 's money , there will be doping , ” said harting .
“ sometimes i ask myself whether it might be better to allow doping in some form … at least that would stop people from getting so worked up about it . ”
germany 's athletic federation came out strongly against harting 's statements , and he tried to mollify them on his website in the days that followed .
still , once the meet began , harting could n't resist one more shot at the anti-doping crusaders .
as part of a campaign on behalf of former east german athletes who had been doped in the communist era , a group had given out cardboard eyeglasses frames to spectators , so that they might show their support for taking an even closer look into doping in sports .
harting , when asked what he thought of the glasses , quipped that he hoped his discus might spring up and take out a pair on the bounce .
the comment landed harting in hot water with the sport 's power brokers again , but judging from the crowd 's reaction , it did n't hurt his popularity among fans .
difficult question for south africa 's caster semenya , meanwhile , the controversy is just beginning .
she blew away the rest of the field in the women 's 800 meters , clocking in at 1:55.45 , more than two seconds and 15 meters ahead of the next best runner , janeth jepkosgei of kenya .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : semenya 's gender is to be tested but semenya 's powerful build , deep voice and rapid improvement in recent months has led some , including world athletics body iaaf , to seek to find out whether she belongs in the women 's competition at all .
the 18-year-old now faces a series of tests to confirm her gender , which officials say could take months to complete .
" at the moment there is no proof .
the benefit of the doubt has to be with the athlete , " said iaaf general secretary pierre weiss .
" but if at the end it is proven -lsb- that she is not a woman -rsb- then the medal will be withdrawn . "
the 18-year-old was shielded from the media , while jepkosgei and britain 's third place finisher jenny meadows did not want to comment on the controversy .

the attacks were the worst since the beginning of the us withdrawal , writes rainer sollich , head of dw 's arabic service . statistics frequently say little about actual circumstances , such as whether or not the most recent terror attacks in iraq are a result of the us troop draw down .
the number of victims in the weeks before american troops began leaving iraqi city centers had actually increased .
after their withdrawal , the violence decreased at first , only to re-emerge in the form of a bloodbath in the middle of baghdad .
if there are any conclusions to be drawn from this , then only that with or without us troops , iraq remains in the clutches of violence and terror .
security , of course , has markedly improved in the last couple of years , but the official iraqi and american claims that the situation is under control display a rather peculiar interpretation of calm .
iraq is still gripped by the constant threat of violence .
attacks continue unabated attacks are reported on almost a daily basis , although the general public is not aware of many of them .
it is a sad but logical consequence of the never-ending media coverage that the topic of " terror in iraq " has worn thin and now garners little international interest .
an attack with " just " four or five dead no longer warrants a headline , but then , when the number of victims jumps dramatically , the customary response mechanisms shift into gear .
the un security council , the white house and the european union all condemn the violence in unison , and media outlets provide the public with the gory details of death and destruction as well as displays of dismay , anger and sympathy .

fertile ground for terrorists the latest wave of violence in baghdad illustrates the deficits within the iraqi government to guarantee security and promote national reconciliation .
the government has announced plans to close the existing gaps in security , and that is an important first step .
but it can not be the only one .
terrorists will always find fertile ground and support from segments of the iraqi population , or from abroad , as long as the conflict between ethnic and religious groups and their leaders is unresolved .
the lack of mutual respect and the thirst for revenge will not disappear overnight – and neither will the thirst for power and the country 's oil reserves .
it may seem bold , even risky , that the united states is sticking to its plan to withdraw from iraq completely by the end of 2011 .
however , this may be the appropriate leverage to force the government in baghdad to undertake greater efforts to solve its domestic conflicts and pursue a path of national reconciliation .

in addition , four eu countries have privately told the administration that they are committed to resettling detainees , and five other eu nations are considering taking some , according to officials in us president barack obama 's administration , who spoke to the newspaper on the condition of anonymity .
there are still 229 prisoners at the camp , which was opened in january 2002 by then president george w. bush to hold " enemy combatants " in the us " war on terror . "
obama has ordered the camp to be closed by january 22 , 2010 .
to meet that goal , the administration has appointed daniel fried , a longtime diplomat with deep ties to eastern europe and parts of the former soviet union , to lead negotiations with other countries .
some 80 prisoners are ready for release .
the post said that if resettling agreements could be made , a reduced detainee population would likely ease the politically charged debate on moving remaining prisoners to a facility on us soil .
of the detainees cleared for release so far , eleven have been transferred home or to third countries , including bermuda , which accepted four chinese uighurs .
the pacific island of palau has agreed to resettle the 13 remaining uighur detainees , and more than half of them are willing to go or are seriously considering the offer .
us looking towards eastern europe in addition , the administration has held positive talks with australia and georgia , and it has formally approached or is planning to hold talks with countries in south america , the persian gulf , the balkans and the former soviet union , the post wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama has pledged to close the camp by 2010 congress has blocked the white house from resettling any detainees in the united states , a move that us and some european officials feared would lead other countries , particularly in the eu , to refuse to help close the military prison .
but the issue has proved relatively unproblematic , officials said .
" obama has a lot of political capital .
countries want to do something for him , and that allows us to say , ' this is it , this is what we want you to do , " ' said a senior administration official quoted in the report .
" this is going a lot better than we might have thought . "
one senior administration official said negotiations in eastern europe will intensify once detainees arrive in larger eu countries , such as italy and spain .
the post also reported that us and european officials believe stalled negotiations with berlin can be rekindled after germany holds national parliamentary elections next month .
and there is some expectation that france , which has taken one detainee , may accept more. nda / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche welle 's peter philipp looks at who stands to profit from the destabilization of afghanistan . in afghanistan 's eventful history , it was largely the interests of large foreign powers that prevented peace in the country at the foothills of the hindukush mountains . the foreign powers included the british , who pursued their own interests there , the russians and finally the americans - together with allies pakistan and saudi arabia . caught between powerful foreign interests the issues at stake were securing british supply lanes to india , ensuring russian access to the indian ocean , and finally repelling and beating back the soviet union with the help of the three-way alliance of washington , islamabad and riyadh . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche welle 's peter philipp those interests never focused on bolstering a strong afghan state , rather they were about installing an accommodating central government in kabul and maintaining a system of loyal regional chieftains in the country .
it was a system that had worked for centuries in afghanistan .
or sometimes it did n't . an afghan proverb speaks of a " a king under every tree . "
the king - and that included the presidents of the country - were merely seen as mayors of the capital kabul .
and their power was only recognized in the provinces if they sealed " deals " with the local rulers and gave them a free hand to run their own affairs . drugs trade flourishing that 's exactly what current president hamid karzai is doing .
once celebrated as the savior of afghanistan by the us and europe , karzai has long left the path of democracy and the rule of law . he has allied himself with regional " warlords " who are meant to ensure karzai power and influence in the provinces and who in return can thwart any attempt at normalization .
corruption is a daily occurrence but what 's worse is that the growing of poppy has reached record volumes in recent years , making afghanistan a notorious leading world exporter of drugs . ordinary farmers do n't earn a lot with their poppy fields but it 's still much more than what they would make with alternative crops such as wheat .
the " warlords " have long-turned into powerful " drug bosses " who rake in huge profits to finance their weapons and who are thus difficult to pressurize . these druglords are flexible and ready to hammer out an alliance with just about anybody .
the main thing is that their powerful positions are untouched . they also work together with the taliban , who are against the opium trade on religious and ideological grounds , but have long used this lucrative economic and agricultural sector for their own purposes . stabilizing afghanistan foreign nations - from afghanistan 's neighbors to europe and the us - are today more interested in calming the situation and stabilizing afghanistan . those interested in the opposite are primarily the regional rulers and the drug bosses who do n't want to give up their power and influence .
to curb their power , more pressure needs to be exerted on the central government and the president , the taliban needs to be defeated and ordinary afghans need to be given new opportunities to earn money . but none of that has happened so far .
still , about 50 drug dealers are included in the 367 names on an exhaustive wanted-persons list compiled by the us in afghanistan .
they are accused of cooperating with the taliban . but those who work together with the central government in kabul are n't included in any list .

deutsche welle 's peter philipp looks at who stands to profit from the destabilization of afghanistan . in afghanistan 's eventful history , it was largely the interests of large foreign powers that prevented peace in the country at the foothills of the hindukush mountains . the foreign powers included the british , who pursued their own interests there , the russians and finally the americans - together with allies pakistan and saudi arabia . caught between powerful foreign interests the issues at stake were securing british supply lanes to india , ensuring russian access to the indian ocean , and finally repelling and beating back the soviet union with the help of the three-way alliance of washington , islamabad and riyadh . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche welle 's peter philipp those interests never focused on bolstering a strong afghan state , rather they were about installing an accommodating central government in kabul and maintaining a system of loyal regional chieftains in the country .
it was a system that had worked for centuries in afghanistan .
or sometimes it did n't . an afghan proverb speaks of a " a king under every tree . "
the king - and that included the presidents of the country - were merely seen as mayors of the capital kabul .
and their power was only recognized in the provinces if they sealed " deals " with the local rulers and gave them a free hand to run their own affairs . drugs trade flourishing that 's exactly what current president hamid karzai is doing .
once celebrated as the savior of afghanistan by the us and europe , karzai has long left the path of democracy and the rule of law . he has allied himself with regional " warlords " who are meant to ensure karzai power and influence in the provinces and who in return can thwart any attempt at normalization .
corruption is a daily occurrence but what 's worse is that the growing of poppy has reached record volumes in recent years , making afghanistan a notorious leading world exporter of drugs . ordinary farmers do n't earn a lot with their poppy fields but it 's still much more than what they would make with alternative crops such as wheat .
the " warlords " have long-turned into powerful " drug bosses " who rake in huge profits to finance their weapons and who are thus difficult to pressurize . these druglords are flexible and ready to hammer out an alliance with just about anybody .
the main thing is that their powerful positions are untouched . they also work together with the taliban , who are against the opium trade on religious and ideological grounds , but have long used this lucrative economic and agricultural sector for their own purposes . stabilizing afghanistan foreign nations - from afghanistan 's neighbors to europe and the us - are today more interested in calming the situation and stabilizing afghanistan . those interested in the opposite are primarily the regional rulers and the drug bosses who do n't want to give up their power and influence .
to curb their power , more pressure needs to be exerted on the central government and the president , the taliban needs to be defeated and ordinary afghans need to be given new opportunities to earn money . but none of that has happened so far .
still , about 50 drug dealers are included in the 367 names on an exhaustive wanted-persons list compiled by the us in afghanistan .
they are accused of cooperating with the taliban . but those who work together with the central government in kabul are n't included in any list .
this despite the fact that they pose a similar obstacle to normalization in afghanistan . peter philipp is deutsche welle 's an expert on the middle east . -lrb- sp -rrb- editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 20.08.2009 ryanair sues german online travel comparison sites großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ryanair says that sites operated by unister hit customers with hidden charges irish low-cost airline ryanair is suing a german company for allegedly reselling airline tickets without authorization .
this marks an acceleration of the airline ’ s war against what it regards as online touts . ryanair lodged proceedings against leipzig-based internet firm unister at the high court in dublin this week .
the airline claims websites operated by unister use " screen-scraping " software to gather information from ryanair 's website without permission and then sell tickets to customers at inflated prices .
screen scraping is the process by which one computer program collects specific data from another .
in this case , unister 's software is constantly extracting information from other airline companies ' websites – rates , travel times , availability – and then neatly packaging and displaying that information on its own website for potential customers to search and compare .
while ryanair says it has no problem cooperating with authorized price comparison websites , it is unhappy that sites operated by unister hit customers with " hidden charges " . when a customer buys a return flight from duesseldorf to london on ryanair 's own website , for example , the final price including payment handling fees might be 93.25 euros .
if a customer buys the same ryanair flight using one of unister 's websites , additional fees push the final price up to 111.86 euros .
" ryanair is determined to continue its pro-consumer campaign against screen-scraper ticket-tout websites until the last screen scraper stops overcharging unsuspecting consumers , " ryanair spokesman stephen mcnamara said in a statement .
" our strategy of defending consumer rights in irish courts is proving successful and the number of active screen scrapers is rapidly decreasing , ” mcnamara said , adding : “ sadly , unister chose to continue overcharging consumers in breach of ryanair 's rights and left us no alternative but to refer them to the dublin high court . "
battle brewing unister spokesman konstantin korosides told deutsche welle that while management had not yet received official notification of the lawsuit , they were preparing for a legal battle .
“ we think that a german court is responsible , not an irish one , because we are a german online company .
that means jurisdiction has to be here , ” korosides said .
unister argues that screen-scraper software is not illegal and that its websites simply offer customers a service that helps them make a more informed decision when booking a flight .
“ we are an online travel agency , ” korosides said .
“ we charge a small fee for providing our service .
there 's nothing illegal with going to a travel agency , is there ? ”
“ we have 1.6 million visitors coming to one of our travel websites every month .
surely they would stop coming if they felt we were cheating them , ” he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german football star michael ballack is the face of one of unister 's online ad campaigns violation of terms of service ryanair , however , maintains that by reproducing information from its website without permission , unister and other screen scrapers are violating the ryanair website 's terms of service , which prohibit third parties from using its platform for commercial purposes .
the irish airline has intensified its legal campaign against german screen-scraping websites over the past 12 months , with mixed results .
in may , a hamburg court confirmed a 2008 injunction that banned german screen scraper vtours from reselling ryanair tickets because it was doing so in its own name .
in march , however , a frankfurt court blocked ryanair 's attempt to cancel bookings made through unauthorized screen scrapers , ruling that the german price comparison website cheaptickets.de did not break any laws when accessing ryanair 's database , and that the tickets purchased through the site were therefore valid .
since then ryanair has been pursuing screen scrapers through irish courts .
earlier this month , four german screen scrapers bowed to pressure from the airline 's lawyers and signed a binding agreement stating they would stop accessing the airline 's website and reselling its tickets .
legal grey zone ?
e-commerce experts say that depending on the exact application , screen scrapers often operate in a legal grey zone .
“ the law has n't caught up with this technology yet , ” said jason bellows , an it consultant at screen-scraper.com , a us-based company that sells the kind of software unister uses to harvest information from ryanair .
while many companies in the travel and financial sectors are happy about the extra business aggregator websites attract , bellows said he has often complied with large companies requesting that his firm decline assistance to third parties planning unauthorized access to their databases on several occasions .
common reasons for such requests include perceived harm to their brand 's reputation for value , a loss of potential online advertising revenue , and – for smaller firms – the technical strain screen scrapers place on low-capacity computer servers .
many complaints are based on alleged breaches of a website 's terms of use , but bellows said the strongest argument , in the us at least , was the threat of an intellectual property lawsuit .
“ people put the information on the internet to be used . our software just helps people find that information and use it better , ” bellows told deutsche welle . “ what we are always worried about , though , is copyright laws .
we never want our users to violate copyright laws . ”

this marks an acceleration of the airline ’ s war against what it regards as online touts . ryanair lodged proceedings against leipzig-based internet firm unister at the high court in dublin this week .
the airline claims websites operated by unister use " screen-scraping " software to gather information from ryanair 's website without permission and then sell tickets to customers at inflated prices .
screen scraping is the process by which one computer program collects specific data from another .
in this case , unister 's software is constantly extracting information from other airline companies ' websites – rates , travel times , availability – and then neatly packaging and displaying that information on its own website for potential customers to search and compare .
while ryanair says it has no problem cooperating with authorized price comparison websites , it is unhappy that sites operated by unister hit customers with " hidden charges " . when a customer buys a return flight from duesseldorf to london on ryanair 's own website , for example , the final price including payment handling fees might be 93.25 euros .
if a customer buys the same ryanair flight using one of unister 's websites , additional fees push the final price up to 111.86 euros .
" ryanair is determined to continue its pro-consumer campaign against screen-scraper ticket-tout websites until the last screen scraper stops overcharging unsuspecting consumers , " ryanair spokesman stephen mcnamara said in a statement .
" our strategy of defending consumer rights in irish courts is proving successful and the number of active screen scrapers is rapidly decreasing , ” mcnamara said , adding : “ sadly , unister chose to continue overcharging consumers in breach of ryanair 's rights and left us no alternative but to refer them to the dublin high court . "
battle brewing unister spokesman konstantin korosides told deutsche welle that while management had not yet received official notification of the lawsuit , they were preparing for a legal battle .
“ we think that a german court is responsible , not an irish one , because we are a german online company .
that means jurisdiction has to be here , ” korosides said .
unister argues that screen-scraper software is not illegal and that its websites simply offer customers a service that helps them make a more informed decision when booking a flight .
“ we are an online travel agency , ” korosides said .
“ we charge a small fee for providing our service .
there 's nothing illegal with going to a travel agency , is there ? ”
“ we have 1.6 million visitors coming to one of our travel websites every month .
surely they would stop coming if they felt we were cheating them , ” he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german football star michael ballack is the face of one of unister 's online ad campaigns violation of terms of service ryanair , however , maintains that by reproducing information from its website without permission , unister and other screen scrapers are violating the ryanair website 's terms of service , which prohibit third parties from using its platform for commercial purposes .
the irish airline has intensified its legal campaign against german screen-scraping websites over the past 12 months , with mixed results .
in may , a hamburg court confirmed a 2008 injunction that banned german screen scraper vtours from reselling ryanair tickets because it was doing so in its own name .
in march , however , a frankfurt court blocked ryanair 's attempt to cancel bookings made through unauthorized screen scrapers , ruling that the german price comparison website cheaptickets.de did not break any laws when accessing ryanair 's database , and that the tickets purchased through the site were therefore valid .
since then ryanair has been pursuing screen scrapers through irish courts .
earlier this month , four german screen scrapers bowed to pressure from the airline 's lawyers and signed a binding agreement stating they would stop accessing the airline 's website and reselling its tickets .
legal grey zone ?
e-commerce experts say that depending on the exact application , screen scrapers often operate in a legal grey zone .
“ the law has n't caught up with this technology yet , ” said jason bellows , an it consultant at screen-scraper.com , a us-based company that sells the kind of software unister uses to harvest information from ryanair .
while many companies in the travel and financial sectors are happy about the extra business aggregator websites attract , bellows said he has often complied with large companies requesting that his firm decline assistance to third parties planning unauthorized access to their databases on several occasions .
common reasons for such requests include perceived harm to their brand 's reputation for value , a loss of potential online advertising revenue , and – for smaller firms – the technical strain screen scrapers place on low-capacity computer servers .
many complaints are based on alleged breaches of a website 's terms of use , but bellows said the strongest argument , in the us at least , was the threat of an intellectual property lawsuit .
“ people put the information on the internet to be used . our software just helps people find that information and use it better , ” bellows told deutsche welle . “ what we are always worried about , though , is copyright laws .
we never want our users to violate copyright laws . ”

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 20.08.2009 afghans vote in presidential elections amid sporadic violence großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polling stations are seeing brisk trade despite the risks for only the second time in its history , afghanistan has been voting to elect a president .
officials say turnout has been healthy , despite sporadic violence by taliban militants determined to sabotage the ballot . a massive afghan and multinational force of 300,000 was put on full alert thursday to safeguard voting and prevent the taliban from unleashing a threatened onslaught .
two taliban insurgents were killed in a gun battle in kabul as sporadic violence across the country threatened to unsettle voters .
the attack , coming after the taliban said 20 of their fighters had infiltrated the capital , was the worst of several on polling stations and voters .
the taliban have struck repeatedly inside the capital in a bloody countdown to elections that are aimed at putting the country more firmly on the path to democracy eight years after the us-led invasion ousted the militia 's regime .
however , despite the violence in places like kandahar in the south and in the northern provinces of baghlan and takhar , the united nations said there were encouraging signs of high turnout .
" the vast majority of polling stations have been able to open and have received voting materials , " said aleem siddique , spokesman for the un mission in kabul .
" we are seeing queues forming at polling stations in the north , also in the capital , as well as , encouragingly , in the east . "
scores of people queued up at polling stations in the capital and major cities under government control , and some 95 percent of 6,500 polling stations opened on schedule , the independent election commission said .
" the turnout is very good , but we do n't have exact figures , " said deputy chief electoral officer zekria barakzai , predicting that it could reach around 50 percent overall .
seventeen million afghans have registered to elect a president and 420 councilors in 34 provinces across the largely rural , impoverished country .
it is a difficult process in a nation where more than 70 percent of people are illiterate and bound by fierce tribal and religious allegiances .
karzai bullish despite energetic abdullah bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai could face a run-off with his rival abdullah abdullah western-backed president hamid karzai hopes to win an outright majority to avoid a run-off , but his nervous government ordered a blackout on reporting on violence during polling day , threatening journalists with heavy penalties .
" i request my dear countrymen to come out and cast their vote to decide their future , " karzai said as he voted in a kabul boys ' school near his heavily fortified palace , dismissing fears of unrest .
however , one opinion poll carried out by a us organization predicted karzai would be forced into a run-off , winning 44 percent of the vote , and his rival abdullah abdullah , who has a northern powerbase and draws on ethnic tajik support , would take 26 percent .
there are around 30 other candidates .
abdullah hailed " a day of change " as he voted alongside his wife and young son amid a throng of journalists and phalanx of security men .
an energetic campaign by the ex-foreign minister has boosted the chance of a run-off , which would take place in around six weeks ' time .
the election is also a test for us president barack obama , who has ordered a massive troop build-up this year as part of a strategy to reverse taliban gains .
obama 's envoy for the region , richard holbrooke , toured polling stations in kabul and said what he 'd seen was " open and honest , " adding : " so far every prediction of disaster turned out to be wrong . "
nato troops on alert and ready to quell violence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attacks ahead of the election put isaf on red alert troops from nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- and afghan forces were still on high alert despite the level of violence being far below that predicted .
" we have been doing an immense amount of work to try and ensure the best possible security for the elections , " lieutenant general jim dutton , the deputy commander of the nato-led force drawn from about 40 nations , told reporters .
" of course the real test is election day , " the british general added .
the biggest threats facing troops were suicide bombers , rockets and maybe ambushes , he said .
" the mission , as for all coalition forces , is to be the least visible to show that this is an election organized by the afghans themselves , " said lieutenant colonel stephane chenel , another nato commander .
" if there is a threat , all forces will be able to intervene .
everyone will be deployed and , in an immediate threat , go anywhere at any moment , " the french officer said .
isaf officials said that despite rising taliban violence , less than one percent of polling stations were at risk of attack .
but isaf spokesman brigadier general eric tremblay acknowledged : " despite the best plans in place , there will always be some residual risk . "
around eight districts – out of 365 nationwide – contain " high risk " areas where polling stations are considered unlikely to open , mainly in the taliban heartland of southern afghanistan. nda / afp / reuters / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

officials say turnout has been healthy , despite sporadic violence by taliban militants determined to sabotage the ballot . a massive afghan and multinational force of 300,000 was put on full alert thursday to safeguard voting and prevent the taliban from unleashing a threatened onslaught .
two taliban insurgents were killed in a gun battle in kabul as sporadic violence across the country threatened to unsettle voters .
the attack , coming after the taliban said 20 of their fighters had infiltrated the capital , was the worst of several on polling stations and voters .
the taliban have struck repeatedly inside the capital in a bloody countdown to elections that are aimed at putting the country more firmly on the path to democracy eight years after the us-led invasion ousted the militia 's regime .
however , despite the violence in places like kandahar in the south and in the northern provinces of baghlan and takhar , the united nations said there were encouraging signs of high turnout .
" the vast majority of polling stations have been able to open and have received voting materials , " said aleem siddique , spokesman for the un mission in kabul .
" we are seeing queues forming at polling stations in the north , also in the capital , as well as , encouragingly , in the east . "
scores of people queued up at polling stations in the capital and major cities under government control , and some 95 percent of 6,500 polling stations opened on schedule , the independent election commission said .
" the turnout is very good , but we do n't have exact figures , " said deputy chief electoral officer zekria barakzai , predicting that it could reach around 50 percent overall .
seventeen million afghans have registered to elect a president and 420 councilors in 34 provinces across the largely rural , impoverished country .
it is a difficult process in a nation where more than 70 percent of people are illiterate and bound by fierce tribal and religious allegiances .
karzai bullish despite energetic abdullah bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai could face a run-off with his rival abdullah abdullah western-backed president hamid karzai hopes to win an outright majority to avoid a run-off , but his nervous government ordered a blackout on reporting on violence during polling day , threatening journalists with heavy penalties .
" i request my dear countrymen to come out and cast their vote to decide their future , " karzai said as he voted in a kabul boys ' school near his heavily fortified palace , dismissing fears of unrest .
however , one opinion poll carried out by a us organization predicted karzai would be forced into a run-off , winning 44 percent of the vote , and his rival abdullah abdullah , who has a northern powerbase and draws on ethnic tajik support , would take 26 percent .
there are around 30 other candidates .
abdullah hailed " a day of change " as he voted alongside his wife and young son amid a throng of journalists and phalanx of security men .
an energetic campaign by the ex-foreign minister has boosted the chance of a run-off , which would take place in around six weeks ' time .
the election is also a test for us president barack obama , who has ordered a massive troop build-up this year as part of a strategy to reverse taliban gains .
obama 's envoy for the region , richard holbrooke , toured polling stations in kabul and said what he 'd seen was " open and honest , " adding : " so far every prediction of disaster turned out to be wrong . "
nato troops on alert and ready to quell violence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attacks ahead of the election put isaf on red alert troops from nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- and afghan forces were still on high alert despite the level of violence being far below that predicted .
" we have been doing an immense amount of work to try and ensure the best possible security for the elections , " lieutenant general jim dutton , the deputy commander of the nato-led force drawn from about 40 nations , told reporters .
" of course the real test is election day , " the british general added .
the biggest threats facing troops were suicide bombers , rockets and maybe ambushes , he said .
" the mission , as for all coalition forces , is to be the least visible to show that this is an election organized by the afghans themselves , " said lieutenant colonel stephane chenel , another nato commander .
" if there is a threat , all forces will be able to intervene .
everyone will be deployed and , in an immediate threat , go anywhere at any moment , " the french officer said .
isaf officials said that despite rising taliban violence , less than one percent of polling stations were at risk of attack .
but isaf spokesman brigadier general eric tremblay acknowledged : " despite the best plans in place , there will always be some residual risk . "
around eight districts – out of 365 nationwide – contain " high risk " areas where polling stations are considered unlikely to open , mainly in the taliban heartland of southern afghanistan. nda / afp / reuters / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the government rescue of the struggling hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- mortgage lender prevented a " global financial meltdown , " according to finance minister peer steinbrueck .
the social democrat , answering questions from a parliamentary enquiry investigating the bailout of hre , described the german government 's actions as " appropriate and correct . "

" it was n't us politicians who caused this financial crisis , but we were the ones who mastered it . "

the top ten list features japanese cars in the first six places .
" as a member of the green party i want people to buy modern cars with the lowest co2 emissions , " she said , suggesting that the vcd list was a good reference point for these cars .
she expressed regret that the highest-placed german car came in at number seven – the two-seater smart car – and added that german manufacturers " should act as quickly as possible to provide different cars and to secure jobs . "
kuenast found herself in similar trouble two years ago when she called on people to buy the toyota prius hybrid car for its low environmental impact in comparison to other cars .
her statement was seen as a vote of no-confidence in the german car industry .
she also said that she was annoyed with the executive committees at german auto manufacturers which continued to fight at a european level to keep co2 emissions for cars at the highest level possible .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 20.08.2009 eu and german leaders praise afghan election as success großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban threats to disrupt afghanistan 's presidential elections did n't keep this woman from voting after an extension of one hour , polling stations in afghanistan closed .
the day saw relatively little violence although concerns remain over a possible low turnout due to threats of taliban attacks . " our assessment is that , in general , these elections went much better than we anticipated , " ettore sequi , the european union 's special representative to afghanistan , told afp .
the roughly 6,200 election centers which were able to accept voters was " an achievement considering the concerns before the election , " he added .
despite dozens of taliban missiles and bombs and the deaths of more than 20 people , many international leaders agreed with sequi 's statement .
german chancellor angela merkel called the election " an important chapter in the democratic development of the country . "
nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen said the election was " a testimony to the determination of the afghan people to build democracy . "
he congratulated the voters for their courage in the face of taliban threats .
" seen from a security point of view , the election has been a success , " he said .
" the most important thing is that the election will be considered credible in the eyes of the afghan people . "
while no official voter turnout figures have been released , there is concern that if a low percentage of the 15 million registered voters showed up to cast their ballots , it would diminish the legitimacy of the election .
taliban attacks close some polls , delay voting as voting continued across the country during the day , taliban militants stormed a town in northern afghanistan , launching a multi-pronged assault that left at least eight of them dead and kept polling stations from opening , officials said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban attacks disrupted voting in some areas " terrorists attacked from several directions .
fighting has been going on since morning , " provincial police chief mohammad kabir andarabi told reporters in baghlan .
" now , as we speak , the enemy has been pushed back .
we have killed 22 terrorists .
most of their bodies are left on the ground , " he added .
abdul majeed azimi , head of the provincial intelligence agency , confirmed the incident but said the corpses of only eight rebels were found .
the local district police chief and one of his guards were also killed .
a 12-year-old boy was wounded in the clashes , he added .
azimi said polling stations did not open in the small town on the highway between pul-i-khumri , the capital of baghlan province , and kunduz province .
" no elections there .
i do n't think there will be because fighting is ongoing , " he said .
residents confirmed to local media that no polling stations were open .
eu calls on afghans to resist taliban pressure the eu had called on the afghan people to defy the taliban and cast their ballots , as a team of about 100 eu observers kept a watchful eye on the voting process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu and nato commended afghans on their election " we encourage the afghan people to go out and vote on this very important day , which sets the path towards democracy for the afghan nation and its people , " european commission spokesman john clancy said in brussels . clancy said no eu monitors had been injured in any attacks . the eu has the largest international observer mission in afghanistan . european election mission to monitor results headed by philippe morillon , a former french general and now a member of the european parliament , the mission has been monitoring the election campaign and is now focusing on polling , counting and tallying the results . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : morillon 's team will begin monitoring the election results it plans to condemn any serious breach of electoral rules and procedures , with a preliminary statement from morillon expected on saturday . so far , its biggest worry has been with proxy voting . concerns have been fuelled by a suspiciously high rate of registration for female voters in traditionally conservative parts of the country .
despite being escorted by afghan and nato forces , the monitors have not been deployed throughout the country owing to the precarious security situation . the eu is a major donor to afghanistan .
the bloc 's brussels-based executive arm , the european commission , has provided the country with 1.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 2 billion -rrb- in aid since 2002 .

the day saw relatively little violence although concerns remain over a possible low turnout due to threats of taliban attacks . " our assessment is that , in general , these elections went much better than we anticipated , " ettore sequi , the european union 's special representative to afghanistan , told afp .
the roughly 6,200 election centers which were able to accept voters was " an achievement considering the concerns before the election , " he added .
despite dozens of taliban missiles and bombs and the deaths of more than 20 people , many international leaders agreed with sequi 's statement .
german chancellor angela merkel called the election " an important chapter in the democratic development of the country . "
nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen said the election was " a testimony to the determination of the afghan people to build democracy . "
he congratulated the voters for their courage in the face of taliban threats .
" seen from a security point of view , the election has been a success , " he said .
" the most important thing is that the election will be considered credible in the eyes of the afghan people . "

" the recent tragic events at the sayano-shushenskaya hydroelectric plant showed with all clarity how much more we should do to increase reliability of technical constructions on the whole and hydrotechnical ones in particular , " he said .
" technological discipline is very low . "
the official death toll from the catastrophic flood that engulfed russia 's largest hydroelectric station in the country 's khakassia region rose to 17 on thursday after search teams found another three bodies .
russian officials said there was still some hope that some of the 58 people still missing after the aug .
17 accident could be found in air pockets amid the flooded wreckage .
some 100 workers were in the main turbine room early on monday when a massive wave of water flooded in .
officials from the company that owns the hydroelectric dam , rushydro , said many workers would have either drowned or been crushed .
the authorities have yet to give a clear explanation of how the accident occurred , with explanations ranging from a sudden pressure surge to a fault in one of the turbines .
rushydro said a faulty turbine at the plant , commissioned 30 years ago , was the likely cause of the accident .
slim hopes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plant 's second hydroelectric generating unit was destroyed emergencies minister sergei shoigu said around 2,000 rescue workers were working around the clock to clear rubble and drain water in an effort to locate potential survivors .
" my job is not to lose hope , " shoigu told government newspaper rossiiskaya gazeta , adding that the final toll would only be clear after two or three more days of searching .
" do n't ask about possible causes .
some people have rushed to express their own opinions .
completely pointless , " shoigu said .
" the -lrb- investigative -rrb- commission has to work everything out .
" it 's a unique disaster .
its nature is not comprehensible .
nothing like this has ever been seen in the world . "
meanwhile , russian president dmitry medvedev has said steps needed to be taken to shore up power supply to industries affected by monday 's accident .
he said in a statement on thursday that the government had to " take measures to resolve the consequences of the accident and to provide uninterrupted energy supply to industrial enterprises , social institutions and the population .

the 25-year-old vlasic , meanwhile , claimed gold with a jump of 2.04 meters .
friedrich and vlasic have been engaged in a tussle at the peak of world high jumping for the past 12 months , with the german coming out on top in three of the four competitions in which they have faced each other this year in the lead up to the current meet in berlin .
at a golden league event in berlin earlier this year , friedrich leaped to a german record of 2.06 meters - also the highest jump of the year - to take first place .
she was bettered only a few weeks later in monaco , however , when the croat consigned her to her first second-place finish of the year .
but in qualifying for thursday 's final , friedrich sent a clear message to her rival by clearing the 1.95-meter qualifying height on her first jump .
vlasic needed a few extra jumps to clear the same height .
coming into the championships friedrich was considered one of the german athletes most likely to bag a medal .
she is also one of the most recognizable athletes on the track .
her pink knee-high socks , large sunglasses and bleach-blond hair are unmistakable .

panama 's alonso edwards came in second , trailing by 0.62 seconds , and wallace spearmon of the us took bronze .

former porsche chief wendelin wiedeking is also under investigation . dealings by wiedeking and former porsche chief financial officer holger haerter , both of whom resigned from their posts last month , are being examined by germany 's financial supervisory authority -lrb- bafin -rrb- on suspicion of market manipulation .
part of the bafin investigation will focus on recent fluctuations in share prices at competitor-cum-merger partner volkswagen .
during the drawn-out merger negotiations between vw and porsche , a collection of cash settlement options in vw shares earned porsche billions as the stock climbed in value .
the stock revaluation that resulted briefly made porsche the world 's biggest company by market capitalization .
until a few months ago porsche was making more money from its financial dealings than from car sales at a time when carmakers around the world were suffering from a collapse in global auto markets .
under wiedeking , porsche accumulated a 51-percent stake in its much larger rival vw , europe 's largest carmaker , and wanted to take full control but the attempt failed and left porsche squeezed under a huge debt pile .
following a tip from bafin , stuttgart prosecutors launched a separate inquiry into porsche with police seizing documents in their raid on thursday .
porsche has denied the allegations of market manipulation and said it would cooperate and assist investigators .
the automaker said it was also facing allegations of breaching information publication requirements as specified under the german stock corporation act . dfm / afp / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

just germany 's latest political sensation : a comedian in the guise of a scruffy small-time journalist named horst schlaemmer , whose fake bid for the german chancellorship has injected some real humor into a boring campaign season .
the undeniably unappealing alter ego of popular german funnyman hape kerkeling is the star of his own feature film , which debuted to throngs of fans in berlin on thursday .
the movie , " isch kandidiere " -lrb- " i 'm running for chancellor ! " -rrb- follows the faux candidate as he looks for support among the common people and german stars like rapper bushido and ex-racing champion michael schumacher .

schlaemmer has gained the kind of media exposure and enthusiasm that more legitimate contenders for the chancellor 's seat can only dream of .
but perhaps that 's to be expected when your campaign promises include state-subsidized tanning and cradle-to-grave income .
two major german television channels aired live coverage of schlaemmer 's first press conference for nearly two hours .
in contrast , those same networks cut away from real-life candidate frank-walter steinmeier as he was explaining how he 'd fulfill a campaign promise of creating 4 million jobs by 2020 .
eighteen percent of the people surveyed by german polling institute forsa said they could imagine voting for schlaemmer 's party if it did in fact exist in real life .
that 's not so much less than the latest poll numbers for the social democratic party , currently in opposition , which garnered just 22 percent of registered voters ' support , according to forsa .

" megrahi now faces a sentence imposed by a higher power , " said scottish justice minister kenny macaskill at a news conference on thursday .
" it is terminal , final and irrevocable .
he is going to die . "
shortly afterwards megrahi boarded a libyan jet that had been sent from tripoli to collect him .
relatives of the victims and the united states government were opposed to his release .
on tuesday us secretary of state hillary clinton said that it would be " absolutely wrong " to free al-megrahi , who was responsible for a " horrendous crime . "
his guilt has always been in question .
some are convinced that he was responsible , while others have consistently labeled his conviction a miscarriage of justice .
either way , megrahi is the only one ever to be tried and convicted .
circumstantial evidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : megrahi is on his way back to libya megrahi , a father of five , was born in tripoli , libya in 1952 .
he has a good command of the english language , a skill he picked up when he studied in the us .
he had also visited britain several times .
he ran an international relations think tank in libya called the center for strategic studies , a job that the fbi has claimed provided him with the perfect cover to work as an operative for the libyan intelligence services -lrb- jso -rrb- .
for a time , he was also based in malta as director of security for libyan arab airways -lrb- laa -rrb- , a job that prosecutors said gave him knowledge and access to secure airlines .
the key piece of evidence in his trial was that pieces of clothing that megrahi had bought in malta were found wrapped around the bomb .
a fateful flight on december 22 , 1988 , pan am flight 103 took off from london 's heathrow airport , headed for new york .
on board were 259 passengers .
approximately 38 minutes into the flight , the plane exploded at 31,000 feet over lockerbie , scotland , killing all the passengers as well as 11 people on the ground .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pan am 103 memorial in arlington cemetary it took three years of painstaking investigation , but finally in 1999 , officials indicted two libyans , al-amin khalifa fhimah and abdelbaset ali mohmed al-megrahi , on 270 counts of murder .
by then the two men were home and libyan leader moammar gadhafi refused to hand them over .
thus began years of international pressure on libya .
in 1992 the un security council imposed sanctions on libya over its refusal to hand over the men .
it was not until six years later , in 1998 , that gadhafi finally said that the trial could take place , but only in a neutral country .
the us and britain proposed using scottish law in the netherlands and gadhafi agreed .
after nelson mandela visited gadhafi in 1999 , the men were finally extradited and the trial began at camp zeist in the netherlands .
justice takes time the trial began in 2000 , and from the start both of the accused denied any involvement in the lockerbie bombing .
the proceedings lasted a year and in the end , al-megrahi was sentenced to life in prison while al-amin khalifa fhimah , was found not guilty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al-amin khalifa fhimah was found not guilty al-megrahi immediately launched an appeal and fhimah went home .
in 2002 , a panel of five scottish judges began hearing his appeal which was denied three months later .
the next several years saw more legal wrangling between al-megrahi and the scottish legal system .
in 2007 , the scottish criminal cases review commission recommended that he should be granted a second appeal .
power politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libya 's moammar gadhafi paid compensation in the background of all the legal proceedings was a combination of money , oil and politics .
oil makes up a big part of the libyan economy .
according to the cia factbook , the libyan economy depends almost entirely on revenues from the oil sector , which contribute about 95 percent of export earnings , about one quarter of the gross domestic product , and roughly 60 percent of public sector wages .
in other words , un sanctions hit libya very hard .
libya clearly felt the strain and within the last few years the libyans have renounced nuclear arms and agreed to pay compensation to the families of the lockerbie victims .
former british prime minister tony blair was among the first politicians to become involved in helping british petroleum -lrb- bp -rrb- and shell win exploration acreage in libya .
the release of al-megrahi could ease tensions between britain and libya and open further business opportunities .
in fact some of the relatives of the victims of the lockerbie bombings have intimated that a deal has been struck. av / reuters / afp / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 25-year-old vlasic , meanwhile , claimed gold with a jump of 2.04 meters .
friedrich and vlasic have been engaged in a tussle at the peak of world high jumping for the past 12 months , with the german coming out on top in three of the four competitions in which they have faced each other this year in the lead up to the current meet in berlin .
at a golden league event in berlin earlier this year , friedrich leaped to a german record of 2.06 meters - also the highest jump of the year - to take first place .
she was bettered only a few weeks later in monaco , however , when the croat consigned her to her first second-place finish of the year .
but in qualifying for thursday 's final , friedrich sent a clear message to her rival by clearing the 1.95-meter qualifying height on her first jump .
vlasic needed a few extra jumps to clear the same height .
coming into the championships friedrich was considered one of the german athletes most likely to bag a medal .
she is also one of the most recognizable athletes on the track .
her pink knee-high socks , large sunglasses and bleach-blond hair are unmistakable .

" the recent tragic events at the sayano-shushenskaya hydroelectric plant showed with all clarity how much more we should do to increase reliability of technical constructions on the whole and hydrotechnical ones in particular , " he said .
" technological discipline is very low . "
the official death toll from the catastrophic flood that engulfed russia 's largest hydroelectric station in the country 's khakassia region rose to 17 on thursday after search teams found another three bodies .
russian officials said there was still some hope that some of the 58 people still missing after the aug .
17 accident could be found in air pockets amid the flooded wreckage .
some 100 workers were in the main turbine room early on monday when a massive wave of water flooded in .
officials from the company that owns the hydroelectric dam , rushydro , said many workers would have either drowned or been crushed .
the authorities have yet to give a clear explanation of how the accident occurred , with explanations ranging from a sudden pressure surge to a fault in one of the turbines .
rushydro said a faulty turbine at the plant , commissioned 30 years ago , was the likely cause of the accident .
slim hopes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plant 's second hydroelectric generating unit was destroyed emergencies minister sergei shoigu said around 2,000 rescue workers were working around the clock to clear rubble and drain water in an effort to locate potential survivors .
" my job is not to lose hope , " shoigu told government newspaper rossiiskaya gazeta , adding that the final toll would only be clear after two or three more days of searching .
" do n't ask about possible causes .
some people have rushed to express their own opinions .
completely pointless , " shoigu said .
" the -lrb- investigative -rrb- commission has to work everything out .
" it 's a unique disaster .
its nature is not comprehensible .
nothing like this has ever been seen in the world . "
meanwhile , russian president dmitry medvedev has said steps needed to be taken to shore up power supply to industries affected by monday 's accident .
he said in a statement on thursday that the government had to " take measures to resolve the consequences of the accident and to provide uninterrupted energy supply to industrial enterprises , social institutions and the population .

officials say turnout has been healthy , despite sporadic violence by taliban militants determined to sabotage the ballot . a massive afghan and multinational force of 300,000 was put on full alert thursday to safeguard voting and prevent the taliban from unleashing a threatened onslaught .
two taliban insurgents were killed in a gun battle in kabul as sporadic violence across the country threatened to unsettle voters .
the attack , coming after the taliban said 20 of their fighters had infiltrated the capital , was the worst of several on polling stations and voters .
the taliban have struck repeatedly inside the capital in a bloody countdown to elections that are aimed at putting the country more firmly on the path to democracy eight years after the us-led invasion ousted the militia 's regime .
however , despite the violence in places like kandahar in the south and in the northern provinces of baghlan and takhar , the united nations said there were encouraging signs of high turnout .
" the vast majority of polling stations have been able to open and have received voting materials , " said aleem siddique , spokesman for the un mission in kabul .
" we are seeing queues forming at polling stations in the north , also in the capital , as well as , encouragingly , in the east . "
scores of people queued up at polling stations in the capital and major cities under government control , and some 95 percent of 6,500 polling stations opened on schedule , the independent election commission said .
" the turnout is very good , but we do n't have exact figures , " said deputy chief electoral officer zekria barakzai , predicting that it could reach around 50 percent overall .
seventeen million afghans have registered to elect a president and 420 councilors in 34 provinces across the largely rural , impoverished country .
it is a difficult process in a nation where more than 70 percent of people are illiterate and bound by fierce tribal and religious allegiances .
karzai bullish despite energetic abdullah bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai could face a run-off with his rival abdullah abdullah western-backed president hamid karzai hopes to win an outright majority to avoid a run-off , but his nervous government ordered a blackout on reporting on violence during polling day , threatening journalists with heavy penalties .
" i request my dear countrymen to come out and cast their vote to decide their future , " karzai said as he voted in a kabul boys ' school near his heavily fortified palace , dismissing fears of unrest .
however , one opinion poll carried out by a us organization predicted karzai would be forced into a run-off , winning 44 percent of the vote , and his rival abdullah abdullah , who has a northern powerbase and draws on ethnic tajik support , would take 26 percent .
there are around 30 other candidates .
abdullah hailed " a day of change " as he voted alongside his wife and young son amid a throng of journalists and phalanx of security men .
an energetic campaign by the ex-foreign minister has boosted the chance of a run-off , which would take place in around six weeks ' time .
the election is also a test for us president barack obama , who has ordered a massive troop build-up this year as part of a strategy to reverse taliban gains .
obama 's envoy for the region , richard holbrooke , toured polling stations in kabul and said what he 'd seen was " open and honest , " adding : " so far every prediction of disaster turned out to be wrong . "
nato troops on alert and ready to quell violence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attacks ahead of the election put isaf on red alert troops from nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- and afghan forces were still on high alert despite the level of violence being far below that predicted .
" we have been doing an immense amount of work to try and ensure the best possible security for the elections , " lieutenant general jim dutton , the deputy commander of the nato-led force drawn from about 40 nations , told reporters .
" of course the real test is election day , " the british general added .
the biggest threats facing troops were suicide bombers , rockets and maybe ambushes , he said .
" the mission , as for all coalition forces , is to be the least visible to show that this is an election organized by the afghans themselves , " said lieutenant colonel stephane chenel , another nato commander .
" if there is a threat , all forces will be able to intervene .
everyone will be deployed and , in an immediate threat , go anywhere at any moment , " the french officer said .
isaf officials said that despite rising taliban violence , less than one percent of polling stations were at risk of attack .
but isaf spokesman brigadier general eric tremblay acknowledged : " despite the best plans in place , there will always be some residual risk . "
around eight districts – out of 365 nationwide – contain " high risk " areas where polling stations are considered unlikely to open , mainly in the taliban heartland of southern afghanistan. nda / afp / reuters / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

former porsche chief wendelin wiedeking is also under investigation . dealings by wiedeking and former porsche chief financial officer holger haerter , both of whom resigned from their posts last month , are being examined by germany 's financial supervisory authority -lrb- bafin -rrb- on suspicion of market manipulation .
part of the bafin investigation will focus on recent fluctuations in share prices at competitor-cum-merger partner volkswagen .
during the drawn-out merger negotiations between vw and porsche , a collection of cash settlement options in vw shares earned porsche billions as the stock climbed in value .

under wiedeking , porsche accumulated a 51-percent stake in its much larger rival vw , europe 's largest carmaker , and wanted to take full control but the attempt failed and left porsche squeezed under a huge debt pile .
following a tip from bafin , stuttgart prosecutors launched a separate inquiry into porsche with police seizing documents in their raid on thursday .

" the recent tragic events at the sayano-shushenskaya hydroelectric plant showed with all clarity how much more we should do to increase reliability of technical constructions on the whole and hydrotechnical ones in particular , " he said .
" technological discipline is very low . "
the official death toll from the catastrophic flood that engulfed russia 's largest hydroelectric station in the country 's khakassia region rose to 17 on thursday after search teams found another three bodies .
russian officials said there was still some hope that some of the 58 people still missing after the aug .
17 accident could be found in air pockets amid the flooded wreckage .
some 100 workers were in the main turbine room early on monday when a massive wave of water flooded in .
officials from the company that owns the hydroelectric dam , rushydro , said many workers would have either drowned or been crushed .
the authorities have yet to give a clear explanation of how the accident occurred , with explanations ranging from a sudden pressure surge to a fault in one of the turbines .
rushydro said a faulty turbine at the plant , commissioned 30 years ago , was the likely cause of the accident .

officials say turnout has been healthy , despite sporadic violence by taliban militants determined to sabotage the ballot . a massive afghan and multinational force of 300,000 was put on full alert thursday to safeguard voting and prevent the taliban from unleashing a threatened onslaught .
two taliban insurgents were killed in a gun battle in kabul as sporadic violence across the country threatened to unsettle voters .
the attack , coming after the taliban said 20 of their fighters had infiltrated the capital , was the worst of several on polling stations and voters .
the taliban have struck repeatedly inside the capital in a bloody countdown to elections that are aimed at putting the country more firmly on the path to democracy eight years after the us-led invasion ousted the militia 's regime .
however , despite the violence in places like kandahar in the south and in the northern provinces of baghlan and takhar , the united nations said there were encouraging signs of high turnout .
" the vast majority of polling stations have been able to open and have received voting materials , " said aleem siddique , spokesman for the un mission in kabul .
" we are seeing queues forming at polling stations in the north , also in the capital , as well as , encouragingly , in the east . "
scores of people queued up at polling stations in the capital and major cities under government control , and some 95 percent of 6,500 polling stations opened on schedule , the independent election commission said .
" the turnout is very good , but we do n't have exact figures , " said deputy chief electoral officer zekria barakzai , predicting that it could reach around 50 percent overall .
seventeen million afghans have registered to elect a president and 420 councilors in 34 provinces across the largely rural , impoverished country .
it is a difficult process in a nation where more than 70 percent of people are illiterate and bound by fierce tribal and religious allegiances .
karzai bullish despite energetic abdullah bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai could face a run-off with his rival abdullah abdullah western-backed president hamid karzai hopes to win an outright majority to avoid a run-off , but his nervous government ordered a blackout on reporting on violence during polling day , threatening journalists with heavy penalties .
" i request my dear countrymen to come out and cast their vote to decide their future , " karzai said as he voted in a kabul boys ' school near his heavily fortified palace , dismissing fears of unrest .
however , one opinion poll carried out by a us organization predicted karzai would be forced into a run-off , winning 44 percent of the vote , and his rival abdullah abdullah , who has a northern powerbase and draws on ethnic tajik support , would take 26 percent .
there are around 30 other candidates .
abdullah hailed " a day of change " as he voted alongside his wife and young son amid a throng of journalists and phalanx of security men .
an energetic campaign by the ex-foreign minister has boosted the chance of a run-off , which would take place in around six weeks ' time .
the election is also a test for us president barack obama , who has ordered a massive troop build-up this year as part of a strategy to reverse taliban gains .
obama 's envoy for the region , richard holbrooke , toured polling stations in kabul and said what he 'd seen was " open and honest , " adding : " so far every prediction of disaster turned out to be wrong . "
nato troops on alert and ready to quell violence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attacks ahead of the election put isaf on red alert troops from nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- and afghan forces were still on high alert despite the level of violence being far below that predicted .
" we have been doing an immense amount of work to try and ensure the best possible security for the elections , " lieutenant general jim dutton , the deputy commander of the nato-led force drawn from about 40 nations , told reporters .
" of course the real test is election day , " the british general added .
the biggest threats facing troops were suicide bombers , rockets and maybe ambushes , he said .
" the mission , as for all coalition forces , is to be the least visible to show that this is an election organized by the afghans themselves , " said lieutenant colonel stephane chenel , another nato commander .
" if there is a threat , all forces will be able to intervene .
everyone will be deployed and , in an immediate threat , go anywhere at any moment , " the french officer said .
isaf officials said that despite rising taliban violence , less than one percent of polling stations were at risk of attack .
but isaf spokesman brigadier general eric tremblay acknowledged : " despite the best plans in place , there will always be some residual risk . "
around eight districts – out of 365 nationwide – contain " high risk " areas where polling stations are considered unlikely to open , mainly in the taliban heartland of southern afghanistan. nda / afp / reuters / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

officials say turnout has been healthy , despite sporadic violence by taliban militants determined to sabotage the ballot . a massive afghan and multinational force of 300,000 was put on full alert thursday to safeguard voting and prevent the taliban from unleashing a threatened onslaught .
two taliban insurgents were killed in a gun battle in kabul as sporadic violence across the country threatened to unsettle voters .
the attack , coming after the taliban said 20 of their fighters had infiltrated the capital , was the worst of several on polling stations and voters .
the taliban have struck repeatedly inside the capital in a bloody countdown to elections that are aimed at putting the country more firmly on the path to democracy eight years after the us-led invasion ousted the militia 's regime .
however , despite the violence in places like kandahar in the south and in the northern provinces of baghlan and takhar , the united nations said there were encouraging signs of high turnout .
" the vast majority of polling stations have been able to open and have received voting materials , " said aleem siddique , spokesman for the un mission in kabul .
" we are seeing queues forming at polling stations in the north , also in the capital , as well as , encouragingly , in the east . "
scores of people queued up at polling stations in the capital and major cities under government control , and some 95 percent of 6,500 polling stations opened on schedule , the independent election commission said .
" the turnout is very good , but we do n't have exact figures , " said deputy chief electoral officer zekria barakzai , predicting that it could reach around 50 percent overall .
seventeen million afghans have registered to elect a president and 420 councilors in 34 provinces across the largely rural , impoverished country .
it is a difficult process in a nation where more than 70 percent of people are illiterate and bound by fierce tribal and religious allegiances .
karzai bullish despite energetic abdullah bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai could face a run-off with his rival abdullah abdullah western-backed president hamid karzai hopes to win an outright majority to avoid a run-off , but his nervous government ordered a blackout on reporting on violence during polling day , threatening journalists with heavy penalties .
" i request my dear countrymen to come out and cast their vote to decide their future , " karzai said as he voted in a kabul boys ' school near his heavily fortified palace , dismissing fears of unrest .
however , one opinion poll carried out by a us organization predicted karzai would be forced into a run-off , winning 44 percent of the vote , and his rival abdullah abdullah , who has a northern powerbase and draws on ethnic tajik support , would take 26 percent .
there are around 30 other candidates .
abdullah hailed " a day of change " as he voted alongside his wife and young son amid a throng of journalists and phalanx of security men .
an energetic campaign by the ex-foreign minister has boosted the chance of a run-off , which would take place in around six weeks ' time .
the election is also a test for us president barack obama , who has ordered a massive troop build-up this year as part of a strategy to reverse taliban gains .
obama 's envoy for the region , richard holbrooke , toured polling stations in kabul and said what he 'd seen was " open and honest , " adding : " so far every prediction of disaster turned out to be wrong . "
nato troops on alert and ready to quell violence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attacks ahead of the election put isaf on red alert troops from nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- and afghan forces were still on high alert despite the level of violence being far below that predicted .
" we have been doing an immense amount of work to try and ensure the best possible security for the elections , " lieutenant general jim dutton , the deputy commander of the nato-led force drawn from about 40 nations , told reporters .
" of course the real test is election day , " the british general added .
the biggest threats facing troops were suicide bombers , rockets and maybe ambushes , he said .
" the mission , as for all coalition forces , is to be the least visible to show that this is an election organized by the afghans themselves , " said lieutenant colonel stephane chenel , another nato commander .
" if there is a threat , all forces will be able to intervene .
everyone will be deployed and , in an immediate threat , go anywhere at any moment , " the french officer said .
isaf officials said that despite rising taliban violence , less than one percent of polling stations were at risk of attack .
but isaf spokesman brigadier general eric tremblay acknowledged : " despite the best plans in place , there will always be some residual risk . "
around eight districts – out of 365 nationwide – contain " high risk " areas where polling stations are considered unlikely to open , mainly in the taliban heartland of southern afghanistan. nda / afp / reuters / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the government rescue of the struggling hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- mortgage lender prevented a " global financial meltdown , " according to finance minister peer steinbrueck .
the social democrat , answering questions from a parliamentary enquiry investigating the bailout of hre , described the german government 's actions as " appropriate and correct . "
" we made the right decisions , " steinbrueck said .
" it was n't us politicians who caused this financial crisis , but we were the ones who mastered it . "
hypo real estate needed a series of state bailouts to keep it from going under .
the loans and credit guarantees offered to hre total 102 billion euros -lrb- $ 145 billion -rrb- , with 87 billion coming from the government in berlin and the remainder from other german banks .
" we had to make decisions in real time , contending with enormous time pressures .
and we did n't always have all the relevant information at our disposal . "
steinbrueck also dismissed criticism that his right hand man at the time , state finance secretary joerg asmussen , was unprepared during the negotiations and allowed the banks to pull the wool over his eyes .
" that is absurd and has been disproven , " he said .
" therefore , i 'm not going to even discuss it . "
steinbrueck said that asmussen had n't negotiated poorly , but rather he 'd fought " tooth and nail - right up to the pain barrier . "

he said that the lehmann brothers bankruptcy put a dramatic stop to inter-bank lending , thus crippling hypo real estate .
hre and its irish subsidiary depfa had been relying on loans from other lenders in order to keep supplying mortgages for months before lehmann brothers went under .
" between september 15 and october 5 the financial world stood millimeters away from the cliff edge , " steinbrueck said .
the german finance minister also questioned the us decision to let lehmann brothers fall , describing it as a test with disastrous consequences .
after the bankruptcy , leading industrial nations committed not to let similar large financial institutions go bankrupt .

robert harting , on his last throw of the competition , bested poland 's piotr malachowski by 28 centimeters , casting his disc 69.43 meters .
the mark was a personal best for the berlin resident , and he said the home crowd had driven him to it .
" that last meter in my final throw was thanks to this crowd , " harting told reporters .
" the fans were unbelievable , and they screamed their hearts out .
the crowd helped me in this final throw . "
it was harting 's first world championship gold medal after a silver in 2007 , and germany 's second of the competition .
reigning olympic champion and 2007 winner gerd kanter of estonia came third with a throw of 66.88 meters .
taboo breaker harting 's win , which he celebrated in style by ripping his shirt off for the camera and picking up the games ' mascot , marked a happy end to a turbulent couple of weeks for the athlete .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harting tore off his shirt after winning in an interview less than two weeks before the world championships he had said that he thought the anti-doping movement was misguided .
“ where there 's money , there will be doping , ” said harting .
“ sometimes i ask myself whether it might be better to allow doping in some form … at least that would stop people from getting so worked up about it . ”
germany 's athletic federation came out strongly against harting 's statements , and he tried to mollify them on his website in the days that followed .
still , once the meet began , harting could n't resist one more shot at the anti-doping crusaders .
as part of a campaign on behalf of former east german athletes who had been doped in the communist era , a group had given out cardboard eyeglasses frames to spectators , so that they might show their support for taking an even closer look into doping in sports .
harting , when asked what he thought of the glasses , quipped that he hoped his discus might spring up and take out a pair on the bounce .
the comment landed harting in hot water with the sport 's power brokers again , but judging from the crowd 's reaction , it did n't hurt his popularity among fans .
difficult question for south africa 's caster semenya , meanwhile , the controversy is just beginning .
she blew away the rest of the field in the women 's 800 meters , clocking in at 1:55.45 , more than two seconds and 15 meters ahead of the next best runner , janeth jepkosgei of kenya .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : semenya 's gender is to be tested but semenya 's powerful build , deep voice and rapid improvement in recent months has led some , including world athletics body iaaf , to seek to find out whether she belongs in the women 's competition at all .
the 18-year-old now faces a series of tests to confirm her gender , which officials say could take months to complete .
" at the moment there is no proof .
the benefit of the doubt has to be with the athlete , " said iaaf general secretary pierre weiss .
" but if at the end it is proven -lsb- that she is not a woman -rsb- then the medal will be withdrawn . "
the 18-year-old was shielded from the media , while jepkosgei and britain 's third place finisher jenny meadows did not want to comment on the controversy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european ties -pipe- 20.08.2009 film project looks to open up the german-polish cultural border großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an old east german trailer has been converted to provide a unique cinematic experience the last border controls between germany and poland disappeared in 2007 , but germans and poles still do not know much about each other .
a nomadic film project wants to change that – in the tradition of travelling cinema . a big old bus bumps over the cobblestones of a village road in eastern germany , close to the polish border .
it is pulling the kinomobilny - a blue and white trailer transformed into a cinema-popcorn-bar .
the driver , 30-year-old janosch from berlin , is proud of the kinomobilny .
" this is an ' intercamp 2000 , ' a trailer from the gdr .
back then they had small trailers costing 8,000 east german marks , but we got the version they sold for 40,000 , " janosch said .
" this was the export version , made for the western market .
but they only produced 50 because nobody in the west was really interested in premium trailers from the gdr . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crew of " kinomobilny " are taking their show to several towns along the border janosch is one of the 20-strong cinema crew touring along the german-polish border region this summer .
financed partly by the eu , the crew are zigzagging their way along the border in order to screen short films on both sides of the oder and neisse , the rivers separating germany and poland .
tomek from the kulturalny kolletyw team at the university of gdansk organized the polish side of the tour .
he hopes the kinomobilny will bring people on both sides of the border closer together .
" although the border is open , people stick to their own country .
they do not speak a different language than their own and they do not even go to the other side .
this is really strange to me .
i mean , it is so easy to get to the other side of the border , but people are not really interested , " said tomek .
cycling through terra incognita the project 's equipment travels with some of the crew by bus and trailer .
as there are only four seats available , the rest of the german-polish crew are left to make their way using pedal power .
every day they cycle up to 35 miles -lrb- 56 kilometers -rrb- , passing through nature reserves and sleepy villages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : every day the organizers cycle up to 35 miles none of the team members has been to the border region before .
for 30-year-old miriam from berlin it 's a chance to explore some terra incognita .
" it is so beautiful and peaceful here .
the bike path runs along the oder and neisse rivers and the landscape is really amazing , " said miriam .
" it is interesting to think that there is so much political meaning to such an idyllic area . "
no rest for the cycling cinema crew as soon as they arrive at the village of boxberg in eastern germany , the crew sets up their open-air cinema .
this involves hanging light bulbs , putting up recliners and checking the projector for the evening 's screening .
some of the crew head into the village to hand out flyers to the local inhabitants .
after sunset the first villagers show up .
they seem surprised that an intercultural project like kinomobilny has stopped in their village .
most of the villagers feel the german-polish relationship is best left to politicians and not something to be tackled in their own backyards - even if poland is only a stone 's throw away .
the program consists of seven german and polish short films that focus on cliches and stereotypes .
but they also show a new , refreshing perspective on polish-german relations .
for example , there 's a rabbit looking for the love of his life at the berlin wall , polish hooligans and the perceived madness of german red tape .
each film is screened in its original language with subtitles in german or polish .
bringing poles and germans closer even though only 20 villagers turned up for the screening , the german-polish cinema initiative went down very well .

" the government rescue of the struggling hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- mortgage lender prevented a " global financial meltdown , " according to finance minister peer steinbrueck .
the social democrat , answering questions from a parliamentary enquiry investigating the bailout of hre , described the german government 's actions as " appropriate and correct . "
" we made the right decisions , " steinbrueck said .
" it was n't us politicians who caused this financial crisis , but we were the ones who mastered it . "
hypo real estate needed a series of state bailouts to keep it from going under .
the loans and credit guarantees offered to hre total 102 billion euros -lrb- $ 145 billion -rrb- , with 87 billion coming from the government in berlin and the remainder from other german banks .
" we had to make decisions in real time , contending with enormous time pressures .
and we did n't always have all the relevant information at our disposal . "
steinbrueck also dismissed criticism that his right hand man at the time , state finance secretary joerg asmussen , was unprepared during the negotiations and allowed the banks to pull the wool over his eyes .
" that is absurd and has been disproven , " he said .
" therefore , i 'm not going to even discuss it . "
steinbrueck said that asmussen had n't negotiated poorly , but rather he 'd fought " tooth and nail - right up to the pain barrier . "
triggered by lehman collapse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors , who were later escorted out of the hearing , disagree with steinbrueck when asked about the tipping point for hypo real estate , steinbrueck pointed to the collapse of us lender lehman brothers in september 2008 , dismissing the political opposition 's claims that the bank was already headed for trouble much earlier in the year .
he said that the lehmann brothers bankruptcy put a dramatic stop to inter-bank lending , thus crippling hypo real estate .
hre and its irish subsidiary depfa had been relying on loans from other lenders in order to keep supplying mortgages for months before lehmann brothers went under .
" between september 15 and october 5 the financial world stood millimeters away from the cliff edge , " steinbrueck said .
the german finance minister also questioned the us decision to let lehmann brothers fall , describing it as a test with disastrous consequences .
after the bankruptcy , leading industrial nations committed not to let similar large financial institutions go bankrupt .
the german government decided that hre - with a value of around 400 billion euros - qualified as an irreplaceable money lender. msh / ap / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de inquiry into hypo real estate rescue enters final phase a parliamentary inquiry into the german government 's 100-billion-euro -lrb- $ 140 billion -rrb- rescue of mortgage lender hypo real estate is drawing to an end .
its findings are to be presented just prior to the september 27 polls .
-lrb- 18.08.2009 -rrb- bankers surprised by extent of hre crisis private bankers in germany were surprised by the serious difficulties plaguing hypo real estate , an expert in the sector told a committee investigating the bank 's failure and subsequent bailout .

" this is an ' intercamp 2000 , ' a trailer from the gdr .
back then they had small trailers costing 8,000 east german marks , but we got the version they sold for 40,000 , " janosch said .

" it is so beautiful and peaceful here .
the bike path runs along the oder and neisse rivers and the landscape is really amazing , " said miriam .
" it is interesting to think that there is so much political meaning to such an idyllic area . "
no rest for the cycling cinema crew as soon as they arrive at the village of boxberg in eastern germany , the crew sets up their open-air cinema .
this involves hanging light bulbs , putting up recliners and checking the projector for the evening 's screening .
some of the crew head into the village to hand out flyers to the local inhabitants .
after sunset the first villagers show up .
they seem surprised that an intercultural project like kinomobilny has stopped in their village .
most of the villagers feel the german-polish relationship is best left to politicians and not something to be tackled in their own backyards - even if poland is only a stone 's throw away .
the program consists of seven german and polish short films that focus on cliches and stereotypes .

tomek from the kulturalny kolletyw team at the university of gdansk organized the polish side of the tour .

this involves hanging light bulbs , putting up recliners and checking the projector for the evening 's screening .

they seem surprised that an intercultural project like kinomobilny has stopped in their village .
most of the villagers feel the german-polish relationship is best left to politicians and not something to be tackled in their own backyards - even if poland is only a stone 's throw away .
the program consists of seven german and polish short films that focus on cliches and stereotypes .

meanwhile , caster semenya 's win struck some observers as a bit too resounding . spectators at berlin 's olympic stadium got a treat wednesday evening , cheering on a local athlete to victory in the discus .
robert harting , on his last throw of the competition , bested poland 's piotr malachowski by 28 centimeters , casting his disc 69.43 meters .
the mark was a personal best for the berlin resident , and he said the home crowd had driven him to it .
" that last meter in my final throw was thanks to this crowd , " harting told reporters .
" the fans were unbelievable , and they screamed their hearts out .
the crowd helped me in this final throw . "
it was harting 's first world championship gold medal after a silver in 2007 , and germany 's second of the competition .
reigning olympic champion and 2007 winner gerd kanter of estonia came third with a throw of 66.88 meters .
taboo breaker harting 's win , which he celebrated in style by ripping his shirt off for the camera and picking up the games ' mascot , marked a happy end to a turbulent couple of weeks for the athlete .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harting tore off his shirt after winning in an interview less than two weeks before the world championships he had said that he thought the anti-doping movement was misguided .
“ where there 's money , there will be doping , ” said harting .
“ sometimes i ask myself whether it might be better to allow doping in some form … at least that would stop people from getting so worked up about it . ”
germany 's athletic federation came out strongly against harting 's statements , and he tried to mollify them on his website in the days that followed .
still , once the meet began , harting could n't resist one more shot at the anti-doping crusaders .
as part of a campaign on behalf of former east german athletes who had been doped in the communist era , a group had given out cardboard eyeglasses frames to spectators , so that they might show their support for taking an even closer look into doping in sports .
harting , when asked what he thought of the glasses , quipped that he hoped his discus might spring up and take out a pair on the bounce .
the comment landed harting in hot water with the sport 's power brokers again , but judging from the crowd 's reaction , it did n't hurt his popularity among fans .
difficult question for south africa 's caster semenya , meanwhile , the controversy is just beginning .
she blew away the rest of the field in the women 's 800 meters , clocking in at 1:55.45 , more than two seconds and 15 meters ahead of the next best runner , janeth jepkosgei of kenya .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : semenya 's gender is to be tested but semenya 's powerful build , deep voice and rapid improvement in recent months has led some , including world athletics body iaaf , to seek to find out whether she belongs in the women 's competition at all .
the 18-year-old now faces a series of tests to confirm her gender , which officials say could take months to complete .
" at the moment there is no proof .
the benefit of the doubt has to be with the athlete , " said iaaf general secretary pierre weiss .
" but if at the end it is proven -lsb- that she is not a woman -rsb- then the medal will be withdrawn . "
the 18-year-old was shielded from the media , while jepkosgei and britain 's third place finisher jenny meadows did not want to comment on the controversy .
jepkosgei said only that " we competed , she beat us , everyone is surprised by her . " mrh / dpa / afp editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

former porsche chief wendelin wiedeking is also under investigation . dealings by wiedeking and former porsche chief financial officer holger haerter , both of whom resigned from their posts last month , are being examined by germany 's financial supervisory authority -lrb- bafin -rrb- on suspicion of market manipulation .
part of the bafin investigation will focus on recent fluctuations in share prices at competitor-cum-merger partner volkswagen .
during the drawn-out merger negotiations between vw and porsche , a collection of cash settlement options in vw shares earned porsche billions as the stock climbed in value .
the stock revaluation that resulted briefly made porsche the world 's biggest company by market capitalization .
until a few months ago porsche was making more money from its financial dealings than from car sales at a time when carmakers around the world were suffering from a collapse in global auto markets .
under wiedeking , porsche accumulated a 51-percent stake in its much larger rival vw , europe 's largest carmaker , and wanted to take full control but the attempt failed and left porsche squeezed under a huge debt pile .
following a tip from bafin , stuttgart prosecutors launched a separate inquiry into porsche with police seizing documents in their raid on thursday .
porsche has denied the allegations of market manipulation and said it would cooperate and assist investigators .
the automaker said it was also facing allegations of breaching information publication requirements as specified under the german stock corporation act . dfm / afp / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the attacks were the worst since the beginning of the us withdrawal , writes rainer sollich , head of dw 's arabic service . statistics frequently say little about actual circumstances , such as whether or not the most recent terror attacks in iraq are a result of the us troop draw down .
the number of victims in the weeks before american troops began leaving iraqi city centers had actually increased .
after their withdrawal , the violence decreased at first , only to re-emerge in the form of a bloodbath in the middle of baghdad .
if there are any conclusions to be drawn from this , then only that with or without us troops , iraq remains in the clutches of violence and terror .
security , of course , has markedly improved in the last couple of years , but the official iraqi and american claims that the situation is under control display a rather peculiar interpretation of calm .
iraq is still gripped by the constant threat of violence .
attacks continue unabated attacks are reported on almost a daily basis , although the general public is not aware of many of them .
it is a sad but logical consequence of the never-ending media coverage that the topic of " terror in iraq " has worn thin and now garners little international interest .
an attack with " just " four or five dead no longer warrants a headline , but then , when the number of victims jumps dramatically , the customary response mechanisms shift into gear .
the un security council , the white house and the european union all condemn the violence in unison , and media outlets provide the public with the gory details of death and destruction as well as displays of dismay , anger and sympathy .
people around the world see the images on television and ask themselves : where does all this hate come from and how can people be capable of subjecting others to such senseless pain and suffering ? # b # the answer is as simple as it is cynical .
it is done expressly for that purpose .
the perpetrators intended to strike the innocent and spread fear .
they do not want iraq to be peaceful ; they enjoy the international condemnation .
and they want to see their deeds on television .
every form of media attention lends weight to their acts of terror .
however , no revamping of media ethics – no matter how sophisticated – can help .
what is needed , first and foremost , is drastically improved security .
fertile ground for terrorists the latest wave of violence in baghdad illustrates the deficits within the iraqi government to guarantee security and promote national reconciliation .
the government has announced plans to close the existing gaps in security , and that is an important first step .
but it can not be the only one .
terrorists will always find fertile ground and support from segments of the iraqi population , or from abroad , as long as the conflict between ethnic and religious groups and their leaders is unresolved .
the lack of mutual respect and the thirst for revenge will not disappear overnight – and neither will the thirst for power and the country 's oil reserves .
it may seem bold , even risky , that the united states is sticking to its plan to withdraw from iraq completely by the end of 2011 .
however , this may be the appropriate leverage to force the government in baghdad to undertake greater efforts to solve its domestic conflicts and pursue a path of national reconciliation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 20.08.2009 german finance minister defends hypo real estate bailout großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck went into the hearing with guns blazing the german finance minister has told a bundestag probe that the string of state bailouts worth an excess of 100 billion euros for lender hypo real estate was " appropriate and correct . " the government rescue of the struggling hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- mortgage lender prevented a " global financial meltdown , " according to finance minister peer steinbrueck .
the social democrat , answering questions from a parliamentary enquiry investigating the bailout of hre , described the german government 's actions as " appropriate and correct . "
" we made the right decisions , " steinbrueck said .
" it was n't us politicians who caused this financial crisis , but we were the ones who mastered it . "
hypo real estate needed a series of state bailouts to keep it from going under .
the loans and credit guarantees offered to hre total 102 billion euros -lrb- $ 145 billion -rrb- , with 87 billion coming from the government in berlin and the remainder from other german banks .
" we had to make decisions in real time , contending with enormous time pressures .
and we did n't always have all the relevant information at our disposal . "
steinbrueck also dismissed criticism that his right hand man at the time , state finance secretary joerg asmussen , was unprepared during the negotiations and allowed the banks to pull the wool over his eyes .
" that is absurd and has been disproven , " he said .
" therefore , i 'm not going to even discuss it . "
steinbrueck said that asmussen had n't negotiated poorly , but rather he 'd fought " tooth and nail - right up to the pain barrier . "
triggered by lehman collapse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors , who were later escorted out of the hearing , disagree with steinbrueck when asked about the tipping point for hypo real estate , steinbrueck pointed to the collapse of us lender lehman brothers in september 2008 , dismissing the political opposition 's claims that the bank was already headed for trouble much earlier in the year .
he said that the lehmann brothers bankruptcy put a dramatic stop to inter-bank lending , thus crippling hypo real estate .
hre and its irish subsidiary depfa had been relying on loans from other lenders in order to keep supplying mortgages for months before lehmann brothers went under .
" between september 15 and october 5 the financial world stood millimeters away from the cliff edge , " steinbrueck said .
the german finance minister also questioned the us decision to let lehmann brothers fall , describing it as a test with disastrous consequences .
after the bankruptcy , leading industrial nations committed not to let similar large financial institutions go bankrupt .
the german government decided that hre - with a value of around 400 billion euros - qualified as an irreplaceable money lender. msh / ap / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de inquiry into hypo real estate rescue enters final phase a parliamentary inquiry into the german government 's 100-billion-euro -lrb- $ 140 billion -rrb- rescue of mortgage lender hypo real estate is drawing to an end .
its findings are to be presented just prior to the september 27 polls .
-lrb- 18.08.2009 -rrb- bankers surprised by extent of hre crisis private bankers in germany were surprised by the serious difficulties plaguing hypo real estate , an expert in the sector told a committee investigating the bank 's failure and subsequent bailout .

" the government rescue of the struggling hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- mortgage lender prevented a " global financial meltdown , " according to finance minister peer steinbrueck .
the social democrat , answering questions from a parliamentary enquiry investigating the bailout of hre , described the german government 's actions as " appropriate and correct . "
" we made the right decisions , " steinbrueck said .
" it was n't us politicians who caused this financial crisis , but we were the ones who mastered it . "
hypo real estate needed a series of state bailouts to keep it from going under .
the loans and credit guarantees offered to hre total 102 billion euros -lrb- $ 145 billion -rrb- , with 87 billion coming from the government in berlin and the remainder from other german banks .
" we had to make decisions in real time , contending with enormous time pressures .
and we did n't always have all the relevant information at our disposal . "
steinbrueck also dismissed criticism that his right hand man at the time , state finance secretary joerg asmussen , was unprepared during the negotiations and allowed the banks to pull the wool over his eyes .
" that is absurd and has been disproven , " he said .
" therefore , i 'm not going to even discuss it . "
steinbrueck said that asmussen had n't negotiated poorly , but rather he 'd fought " tooth and nail - right up to the pain barrier . "
triggered by lehman collapse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors , who were later escorted out of the hearing , disagree with steinbrueck when asked about the tipping point for hypo real estate , steinbrueck pointed to the collapse of us lender lehman brothers in september 2008 , dismissing the political opposition 's claims that the bank was already headed for trouble much earlier in the year .
he said that the lehmann brothers bankruptcy put a dramatic stop to inter-bank lending , thus crippling hypo real estate .
hre and its irish subsidiary depfa had been relying on loans from other lenders in order to keep supplying mortgages for months before lehmann brothers went under .
" between september 15 and october 5 the financial world stood millimeters away from the cliff edge , " steinbrueck said .
the german finance minister also questioned the us decision to let lehmann brothers fall , describing it as a test with disastrous consequences .
after the bankruptcy , leading industrial nations committed not to let similar large financial institutions go bankrupt .
the german government decided that hre - with a value of around 400 billion euros - qualified as an irreplaceable money lender. msh / ap / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

her statement was seen as a vote of no-confidence in the german car industry .

the top ten list features japanese cars in the first six places .
" as a member of the green party i want people to buy modern cars with the lowest co2 emissions , " she said , suggesting that the vcd list was a good reference point for these cars .
she expressed regret that the highest-placed german car came in at number seven – the two-seater smart car – and added that german manufacturers " should act as quickly as possible to provide different cars and to secure jobs . "
kuenast found herself in similar trouble two years ago when she called on people to buy the toyota prius hybrid car for its low environmental impact in comparison to other cars .
her statement was seen as a vote of no-confidence in the german car industry .
she also said that she was annoyed with the executive committees at german auto manufacturers which continued to fight at a european level to keep co2 emissions for cars at the highest level possible .
" if the germans are too stupid to build modern cars , then one must recommend that people should buy a toyota prius , " she said. nda / dpa / ap editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 25-year-old vlasic , meanwhile , claimed gold with a jump of 2.04 meters .
friedrich and vlasic have been engaged in a tussle at the peak of world high jumping for the past 12 months , with the german coming out on top in three of the four competitions in which they have faced each other this year in the lead up to the current meet in berlin .
at a golden league event in berlin earlier this year , friedrich leaped to a german record of 2.06 meters - also the highest jump of the year - to take first place .
she was bettered only a few weeks later in monaco , however , when the croat consigned her to her first second-place finish of the year .
but in qualifying for thursday 's final , friedrich sent a clear message to her rival by clearing the 1.95-meter qualifying height on her first jump .
vlasic needed a few extra jumps to clear the same height .
coming into the championships friedrich was considered one of the german athletes most likely to bag a medal .
she is also one of the most recognizable athletes on the track .
her pink knee-high socks , large sunglasses and bleach-blond hair are unmistakable .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 20.08.2009 ryanair sues german online travel comparison sites großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ryanair says that sites operated by unister hit customers with hidden charges irish low-cost airline ryanair is suing a german company for allegedly reselling airline tickets without authorization .
this marks an acceleration of the airline ’ s war against what it regards as online touts . ryanair lodged proceedings against leipzig-based internet firm unister at the high court in dublin this week .
the airline claims websites operated by unister use " screen-scraping " software to gather information from ryanair 's website without permission and then sell tickets to customers at inflated prices .
screen scraping is the process by which one computer program collects specific data from another .
in this case , unister 's software is constantly extracting information from other airline companies ' websites – rates , travel times , availability – and then neatly packaging and displaying that information on its own website for potential customers to search and compare .
while ryanair says it has no problem cooperating with authorized price comparison websites , it is unhappy that sites operated by unister hit customers with " hidden charges " . when a customer buys a return flight from duesseldorf to london on ryanair 's own website , for example , the final price including payment handling fees might be 93.25 euros .
if a customer buys the same ryanair flight using one of unister 's websites , additional fees push the final price up to 111.86 euros .
" ryanair is determined to continue its pro-consumer campaign against screen-scraper ticket-tout websites until the last screen scraper stops overcharging unsuspecting consumers , " ryanair spokesman stephen mcnamara said in a statement .
" our strategy of defending consumer rights in irish courts is proving successful and the number of active screen scrapers is rapidly decreasing , ” mcnamara said , adding : “ sadly , unister chose to continue overcharging consumers in breach of ryanair 's rights and left us no alternative but to refer them to the dublin high court . "
battle brewing unister spokesman konstantin korosides told deutsche welle that while management had not yet received official notification of the lawsuit , they were preparing for a legal battle .
“ we think that a german court is responsible , not an irish one , because we are a german online company .
that means jurisdiction has to be here , ” korosides said .
unister argues that screen-scraper software is not illegal and that its websites simply offer customers a service that helps them make a more informed decision when booking a flight .
“ we are an online travel agency , ” korosides said .
“ we charge a small fee for providing our service .
there 's nothing illegal with going to a travel agency , is there ? ”
“ we have 1.6 million visitors coming to one of our travel websites every month .
surely they would stop coming if they felt we were cheating them , ” he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german football star michael ballack is the face of one of unister 's online ad campaigns violation of terms of service ryanair , however , maintains that by reproducing information from its website without permission , unister and other screen scrapers are violating the ryanair website 's terms of service , which prohibit third parties from using its platform for commercial purposes .
the irish airline has intensified its legal campaign against german screen-scraping websites over the past 12 months , with mixed results .
in may , a hamburg court confirmed a 2008 injunction that banned german screen scraper vtours from reselling ryanair tickets because it was doing so in its own name .
in march , however , a frankfurt court blocked ryanair 's attempt to cancel bookings made through unauthorized screen scrapers , ruling that the german price comparison website cheaptickets.de did not break any laws when accessing ryanair 's database , and that the tickets purchased through the site were therefore valid .
since then ryanair has been pursuing screen scrapers through irish courts .
earlier this month , four german screen scrapers bowed to pressure from the airline 's lawyers and signed a binding agreement stating they would stop accessing the airline 's website and reselling its tickets .
legal grey zone ?
e-commerce experts say that depending on the exact application , screen scrapers often operate in a legal grey zone .
“ the law has n't caught up with this technology yet , ” said jason bellows , an it consultant at screen-scraper.com , a us-based company that sells the kind of software unister uses to harvest information from ryanair .
while many companies in the travel and financial sectors are happy about the extra business aggregator websites attract , bellows said he has often complied with large companies requesting that his firm decline assistance to third parties planning unauthorized access to their databases on several occasions .
common reasons for such requests include perceived harm to their brand 's reputation for value , a loss of potential online advertising revenue , and – for smaller firms – the technical strain screen scrapers place on low-capacity computer servers .
many complaints are based on alleged breaches of a website 's terms of use , but bellows said the strongest argument , in the us at least , was the threat of an intellectual property lawsuit .
“ people put the information on the internet to be used . our software just helps people find that information and use it better , ” bellows told deutsche welle . “ what we are always worried about , though , is copyright laws .
we never want our users to violate copyright laws . ”

this marks an acceleration of the airline ’ s war against what it regards as online touts . ryanair lodged proceedings against leipzig-based internet firm unister at the high court in dublin this week .
the airline claims websites operated by unister use " screen-scraping " software to gather information from ryanair 's website without permission and then sell tickets to customers at inflated prices .
screen scraping is the process by which one computer program collects specific data from another .
in this case , unister 's software is constantly extracting information from other airline companies ' websites – rates , travel times , availability – and then neatly packaging and displaying that information on its own website for potential customers to search and compare .
while ryanair says it has no problem cooperating with authorized price comparison websites , it is unhappy that sites operated by unister hit customers with " hidden charges " . when a customer buys a return flight from duesseldorf to london on ryanair 's own website , for example , the final price including payment handling fees might be 93.25 euros .
if a customer buys the same ryanair flight using one of unister 's websites , additional fees push the final price up to 111.86 euros .
" ryanair is determined to continue its pro-consumer campaign against screen-scraper ticket-tout websites until the last screen scraper stops overcharging unsuspecting consumers , " ryanair spokesman stephen mcnamara said in a statement .
" our strategy of defending consumer rights in irish courts is proving successful and the number of active screen scrapers is rapidly decreasing , ” mcnamara said , adding : “ sadly , unister chose to continue overcharging consumers in breach of ryanair 's rights and left us no alternative but to refer them to the dublin high court . "
battle brewing unister spokesman konstantin korosides told deutsche welle that while management had not yet received official notification of the lawsuit , they were preparing for a legal battle .
“ we think that a german court is responsible , not an irish one , because we are a german online company .
that means jurisdiction has to be here , ” korosides said .
unister argues that screen-scraper software is not illegal and that its websites simply offer customers a service that helps them make a more informed decision when booking a flight .
“ we are an online travel agency , ” korosides said .
“ we charge a small fee for providing our service .
there 's nothing illegal with going to a travel agency , is there ? ”
“ we have 1.6 million visitors coming to one of our travel websites every month .
surely they would stop coming if they felt we were cheating them , ” he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german football star michael ballack is the face of one of unister 's online ad campaigns violation of terms of service ryanair , however , maintains that by reproducing information from its website without permission , unister and other screen scrapers are violating the ryanair website 's terms of service , which prohibit third parties from using its platform for commercial purposes .
the irish airline has intensified its legal campaign against german screen-scraping websites over the past 12 months , with mixed results .
in may , a hamburg court confirmed a 2008 injunction that banned german screen scraper vtours from reselling ryanair tickets because it was doing so in its own name .
in march , however , a frankfurt court blocked ryanair 's attempt to cancel bookings made through unauthorized screen scrapers , ruling that the german price comparison website cheaptickets.de did not break any laws when accessing ryanair 's database , and that the tickets purchased through the site were therefore valid .
since then ryanair has been pursuing screen scrapers through irish courts .
earlier this month , four german screen scrapers bowed to pressure from the airline 's lawyers and signed a binding agreement stating they would stop accessing the airline 's website and reselling its tickets .
legal grey zone ?
e-commerce experts say that depending on the exact application , screen scrapers often operate in a legal grey zone .
“ the law has n't caught up with this technology yet , ” said jason bellows , an it consultant at screen-scraper.com , a us-based company that sells the kind of software unister uses to harvest information from ryanair .
while many companies in the travel and financial sectors are happy about the extra business aggregator websites attract , bellows said he has often complied with large companies requesting that his firm decline assistance to third parties planning unauthorized access to their databases on several occasions .
common reasons for such requests include perceived harm to their brand 's reputation for value , a loss of potential online advertising revenue , and – for smaller firms – the technical strain screen scrapers place on low-capacity computer servers .
many complaints are based on alleged breaches of a website 's terms of use , but bellows said the strongest argument , in the us at least , was the threat of an intellectual property lawsuit .
“ people put the information on the internet to be used . our software just helps people find that information and use it better , ” bellows told deutsche welle . “ what we are always worried about , though , is copyright laws .
we never want our users to violate copyright laws . ”

his poll ratings are the envy of many real-life politicians . what snorts like a warthog rooting for grubs , has hair like a vintage rabbit pelt , and sports an overbite rarely seen outside of the animal kingdom ?
just germany 's latest political sensation : a comedian in the guise of a scruffy small-time journalist named horst schlaemmer , whose fake bid for the german chancellorship has injected some real humor into a boring campaign season .
the undeniably unappealing alter ego of popular german funnyman hape kerkeling is the star of his own feature film , which debuted to throngs of fans in berlin on thursday .
the movie , " isch kandidiere " -lrb- " i 'm running for chancellor ! " -rrb- follows the faux candidate as he looks for support among the common people and german stars like rapper bushido and ex-racing champion michael schumacher .
bushido also contributed schlaemmer 's campaign song .
" first of all , i 'd like to point out that the horst schlaemmer party stands for justice , and of course it stands for freedom , and yes , women 's emancipation - but i 've forgotten the rest of your question , " schlaemmer told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people were taken in by hape kerkeling 's 1991 impersonation of queen beatrix of the netherlands riffing off of the slogan that won barack obama the american presidency , schlaemmer 's campaign catchphrase is " yes weekend . " his trademark look includes an ill-fitting trench coat , glasses that cover what little of his face is n't hidden behind his bushy mustache , and a dirty grey wig .
schlaemmer has gained the kind of media exposure and enthusiasm that more legitimate contenders for the chancellor 's seat can only dream of .
but perhaps that 's to be expected when your campaign promises include state-subsidized tanning and cradle-to-grave income .
two major german television channels aired live coverage of schlaemmer 's first press conference for nearly two hours .
in contrast , those same networks cut away from real-life candidate frank-walter steinmeier as he was explaining how he 'd fulfill a campaign promise of creating 4 million jobs by 2020 .
eighteen percent of the people surveyed by german polling institute forsa said they could imagine voting for schlaemmer 's party if it did in fact exist in real life .
that 's not so much less than the latest poll numbers for the social democratic party , currently in opposition , which garnered just 22 percent of registered voters ' support , according to forsa .
" schlaemmer is an alternative to your usual grey-suited politician in germany , " political scientist gero neugebauer of berlin 's free university told afp .
" i can imagine people are fed up with politics and politicians ... the boring campaign makes schlaemmer more interesting . "

the top ten list features japanese cars in the first six places .
" as a member of the green party i want people to buy modern cars with the lowest co2 emissions , " she said , suggesting that the vcd list was a good reference point for these cars .
she expressed regret that the highest-placed german car came in at number seven – the two-seater smart car – and added that german manufacturers " should act as quickly as possible to provide different cars and to secure jobs . "
kuenast found herself in similar trouble two years ago when she called on people to buy the toyota prius hybrid car for its low environmental impact in comparison to other cars .
her statement was seen as a vote of no-confidence in the german car industry .
she also said that she was annoyed with the executive committees at german auto manufacturers which continued to fight at a european level to keep co2 emissions for cars at the highest level possible .

the top ten list features japanese cars in the first six places .
" as a member of the green party i want people to buy modern cars with the lowest co2 emissions , " she said , suggesting that the vcd list was a good reference point for these cars .
she expressed regret that the highest-placed german car came in at number seven – the two-seater smart car – and added that german manufacturers " should act as quickly as possible to provide different cars and to secure jobs . "
kuenast found herself in similar trouble two years ago when she called on people to buy the toyota prius hybrid car for its low environmental impact in comparison to other cars .
her statement was seen as a vote of no-confidence in the german car industry .
she also said that she was annoyed with the executive committees at german auto manufacturers which continued to fight at a european level to keep co2 emissions for cars at the highest level possible .
" if the germans are too stupid to build modern cars , then one must recommend that people should buy a toyota prius , " she said. nda / dpa / ap editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 25-year-old vlasic , meanwhile , claimed gold with a jump of 2.04 meters .
friedrich and vlasic have been engaged in a tussle at the peak of world high jumping for the past 12 months , with the german coming out on top in three of the four competitions in which they have faced each other this year in the lead up to the current meet in berlin .
at a golden league event in berlin earlier this year , friedrich leaped to a german record of 2.06 meters - also the highest jump of the year - to take first place .
she was bettered only a few weeks later in monaco , however , when the croat consigned her to her first second-place finish of the year .
but in qualifying for thursday 's final , friedrich sent a clear message to her rival by clearing the 1.95-meter qualifying height on her first jump .
vlasic needed a few extra jumps to clear the same height .
coming into the championships friedrich was considered one of the german athletes most likely to bag a medal .
she is also one of the most recognizable athletes on the track .
her pink knee-high socks , large sunglasses and bleach-blond hair are unmistakable .

the movie , " isch kandidiere " -lrb- " i 'm running for chancellor ! " -rrb- follows the faux candidate as he looks for support among the common people and german stars like rapper bushido and ex-racing champion michael schumacher .
bushido also contributed schlaemmer 's campaign song .
" first of all , i 'd like to point out that the horst schlaemmer party stands for justice , and of course it stands for freedom , and yes , women 's emancipation - but i 've forgotten the rest of your question , " schlaemmer told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people were taken in by hape kerkeling 's 1991 impersonation of queen beatrix of the netherlands riffing off of the slogan that won barack obama the american presidency , schlaemmer 's campaign catchphrase is " yes weekend . " his trademark look includes an ill-fitting trench coat , glasses that cover what little of his face is n't hidden behind his bushy mustache , and a dirty grey wig .
schlaemmer has gained the kind of media exposure and enthusiasm that more legitimate contenders for the chancellor 's seat can only dream of .
but perhaps that 's to be expected when your campaign promises include state-subsidized tanning and cradle-to-grave income .
two major german television channels aired live coverage of schlaemmer 's first press conference for nearly two hours .
in contrast , those same networks cut away from real-life candidate frank-walter steinmeier as he was explaining how he 'd fulfill a campaign promise of creating 4 million jobs by 2020 .
eighteen percent of the people surveyed by german polling institute forsa said they could imagine voting for schlaemmer 's party if it did in fact exist in real life .
that 's not so much less than the latest poll numbers for the social democratic party , currently in opposition , which garnered just 22 percent of registered voters ' support , according to forsa .
" schlaemmer is an alternative to your usual grey-suited politician in germany , " political scientist gero neugebauer of berlin 's free university told afp .
" i can imagine people are fed up with politics and politicians ... the boring campaign makes schlaemmer more interesting . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 20.08.2009 ryanair sues german online travel comparison sites großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ryanair says that sites operated by unister hit customers with hidden charges irish low-cost airline ryanair is suing a german company for allegedly reselling airline tickets without authorization .
this marks an acceleration of the airline ’ s war against what it regards as online touts . ryanair lodged proceedings against leipzig-based internet firm unister at the high court in dublin this week .
the airline claims websites operated by unister use " screen-scraping " software to gather information from ryanair 's website without permission and then sell tickets to customers at inflated prices .
screen scraping is the process by which one computer program collects specific data from another .
in this case , unister 's software is constantly extracting information from other airline companies ' websites – rates , travel times , availability – and then neatly packaging and displaying that information on its own website for potential customers to search and compare .
while ryanair says it has no problem cooperating with authorized price comparison websites , it is unhappy that sites operated by unister hit customers with " hidden charges " . when a customer buys a return flight from duesseldorf to london on ryanair 's own website , for example , the final price including payment handling fees might be 93.25 euros .
if a customer buys the same ryanair flight using one of unister 's websites , additional fees push the final price up to 111.86 euros .
" ryanair is determined to continue its pro-consumer campaign against screen-scraper ticket-tout websites until the last screen scraper stops overcharging unsuspecting consumers , " ryanair spokesman stephen mcnamara said in a statement .
" our strategy of defending consumer rights in irish courts is proving successful and the number of active screen scrapers is rapidly decreasing , ” mcnamara said , adding : “ sadly , unister chose to continue overcharging consumers in breach of ryanair 's rights and left us no alternative but to refer them to the dublin high court . "
battle brewing unister spokesman konstantin korosides told deutsche welle that while management had not yet received official notification of the lawsuit , they were preparing for a legal battle .
“ we think that a german court is responsible , not an irish one , because we are a german online company .
that means jurisdiction has to be here , ” korosides said .
unister argues that screen-scraper software is not illegal and that its websites simply offer customers a service that helps them make a more informed decision when booking a flight .
“ we are an online travel agency , ” korosides said .
“ we charge a small fee for providing our service .
there 's nothing illegal with going to a travel agency , is there ? ”
“ we have 1.6 million visitors coming to one of our travel websites every month .
surely they would stop coming if they felt we were cheating them , ” he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german football star michael ballack is the face of one of unister 's online ad campaigns violation of terms of service ryanair , however , maintains that by reproducing information from its website without permission , unister and other screen scrapers are violating the ryanair website 's terms of service , which prohibit third parties from using its platform for commercial purposes .
the irish airline has intensified its legal campaign against german screen-scraping websites over the past 12 months , with mixed results .
in may , a hamburg court confirmed a 2008 injunction that banned german screen scraper vtours from reselling ryanair tickets because it was doing so in its own name .
in march , however , a frankfurt court blocked ryanair 's attempt to cancel bookings made through unauthorized screen scrapers , ruling that the german price comparison website cheaptickets.de did not break any laws when accessing ryanair 's database , and that the tickets purchased through the site were therefore valid .
since then ryanair has been pursuing screen scrapers through irish courts .
earlier this month , four german screen scrapers bowed to pressure from the airline 's lawyers and signed a binding agreement stating they would stop accessing the airline 's website and reselling its tickets .
legal grey zone ?
e-commerce experts say that depending on the exact application , screen scrapers often operate in a legal grey zone .
“ the law has n't caught up with this technology yet , ” said jason bellows , an it consultant at screen-scraper.com , a us-based company that sells the kind of software unister uses to harvest information from ryanair .
while many companies in the travel and financial sectors are happy about the extra business aggregator websites attract , bellows said he has often complied with large companies requesting that his firm decline assistance to third parties planning unauthorized access to their databases on several occasions .
common reasons for such requests include perceived harm to their brand 's reputation for value , a loss of potential online advertising revenue , and – for smaller firms – the technical strain screen scrapers place on low-capacity computer servers .
many complaints are based on alleged breaches of a website 's terms of use , but bellows said the strongest argument , in the us at least , was the threat of an intellectual property lawsuit .
“ people put the information on the internet to be used . our software just helps people find that information and use it better , ” bellows told deutsche welle . “ what we are always worried about , though , is copyright laws .
we never want our users to violate copyright laws . ”

" the recent tragic events at the sayano-shushenskaya hydroelectric plant showed with all clarity how much more we should do to increase reliability of technical constructions on the whole and hydrotechnical ones in particular , " he said .
" technological discipline is very low . "
the official death toll from the catastrophic flood that engulfed russia 's largest hydroelectric station in the country 's khakassia region rose to 17 on thursday after search teams found another three bodies .
russian officials said there was still some hope that some of the 58 people still missing after the aug .
17 accident could be found in air pockets amid the flooded wreckage .
some 100 workers were in the main turbine room early on monday when a massive wave of water flooded in .
officials from the company that owns the hydroelectric dam , rushydro , said many workers would have either drowned or been crushed .
the authorities have yet to give a clear explanation of how the accident occurred , with explanations ranging from a sudden pressure surge to a fault in one of the turbines .
rushydro said a faulty turbine at the plant , commissioned 30 years ago , was the likely cause of the accident .
slim hopes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plant 's second hydroelectric generating unit was destroyed emergencies minister sergei shoigu said around 2,000 rescue workers were working around the clock to clear rubble and drain water in an effort to locate potential survivors .
" my job is not to lose hope , " shoigu told government newspaper rossiiskaya gazeta , adding that the final toll would only be clear after two or three more days of searching .
" do n't ask about possible causes .
some people have rushed to express their own opinions .
completely pointless , " shoigu said .
" the -lrb- investigative -rrb- commission has to work everything out .
" it 's a unique disaster .
its nature is not comprehensible .
nothing like this has ever been seen in the world . "
meanwhile , russian president dmitry medvedev has said steps needed to be taken to shore up power supply to industries affected by monday 's accident .
he said in a statement on thursday that the government had to " take measures to resolve the consequences of the accident and to provide uninterrupted energy supply to industrial enterprises , social institutions and the population .

the 25-year-old vlasic , meanwhile , claimed gold with a jump of 2.04 meters .
friedrich and vlasic have been engaged in a tussle at the peak of world high jumping for the past 12 months , with the german coming out on top in three of the four competitions in which they have faced each other this year in the lead up to the current meet in berlin .
at a golden league event in berlin earlier this year , friedrich leaped to a german record of 2.06 meters - also the highest jump of the year - to take first place .
she was bettered only a few weeks later in monaco , however , when the croat consigned her to her first second-place finish of the year .
but in qualifying for thursday 's final , friedrich sent a clear message to her rival by clearing the 1.95-meter qualifying height on her first jump .
vlasic needed a few extra jumps to clear the same height .
coming into the championships friedrich was considered one of the german athletes most likely to bag a medal .
she is also one of the most recognizable athletes on the track .

the day saw relatively little violence although concerns remain over a possible low turnout due to threats of taliban attacks . " our assessment is that , in general , these elections went much better than we anticipated , " ettore sequi , the european union 's special representative to afghanistan , told afp .
the roughly 6,200 election centers which were able to accept voters was " an achievement considering the concerns before the election , " he added .
despite dozens of taliban missiles and bombs and the deaths of more than 20 people , many international leaders agreed with sequi 's statement .
german chancellor angela merkel called the election " an important chapter in the democratic development of the country . "
nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen said the election was " a testimony to the determination of the afghan people to build democracy . "
he congratulated the voters for their courage in the face of taliban threats .
" seen from a security point of view , the election has been a success , " he said .
" the most important thing is that the election will be considered credible in the eyes of the afghan people . "
while no official voter turnout figures have been released , there is concern that if a low percentage of the 15 million registered voters showed up to cast their ballots , it would diminish the legitimacy of the election .
taliban attacks close some polls , delay voting as voting continued across the country during the day , taliban militants stormed a town in northern afghanistan , launching a multi-pronged assault that left at least eight of them dead and kept polling stations from opening , officials said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban attacks disrupted voting in some areas " terrorists attacked from several directions .

" now , as we speak , the enemy has been pushed back .
we have killed 22 terrorists .
most of their bodies are left on the ground , " he added .
abdul majeed azimi , head of the provincial intelligence agency , confirmed the incident but said the corpses of only eight rebels were found .
the local district police chief and one of his guards were also killed .
a 12-year-old boy was wounded in the clashes , he added .
azimi said polling stations did not open in the small town on the highway between pul-i-khumri , the capital of baghlan province , and kunduz province .
" no elections there .

the day saw relatively little violence although concerns remain over a possible low turnout due to threats of taliban attacks . " our assessment is that , in general , these elections went much better than we anticipated , " ettore sequi , the european union 's special representative to afghanistan , told afp .
the roughly 6,200 election centers which were able to accept voters was " an achievement considering the concerns before the election , " he added .
despite dozens of taliban missiles and bombs and the deaths of more than 20 people , many international leaders agreed with sequi 's statement .
german chancellor angela merkel called the election " an important chapter in the democratic development of the country . "
nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen said the election was " a testimony to the determination of the afghan people to build democracy . "
he congratulated the voters for their courage in the face of taliban threats .
" seen from a security point of view , the election has been a success , " he said .
" the most important thing is that the election will be considered credible in the eyes of the afghan people . "
while no official voter turnout figures have been released , there is concern that if a low percentage of the 15 million registered voters showed up to cast their ballots , it would diminish the legitimacy of the election .
taliban attacks close some polls , delay voting as voting continued across the country during the day , taliban militants stormed a town in northern afghanistan , launching a multi-pronged assault that left at least eight of them dead and kept polling stations from opening , officials said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban attacks disrupted voting in some areas " terrorists attacked from several directions .
fighting has been going on since morning , " provincial police chief mohammad kabir andarabi told reporters in baghlan .
" now , as we speak , the enemy has been pushed back .
we have killed 22 terrorists .
most of their bodies are left on the ground , " he added .
abdul majeed azimi , head of the provincial intelligence agency , confirmed the incident but said the corpses of only eight rebels were found .
the local district police chief and one of his guards were also killed .
a 12-year-old boy was wounded in the clashes , he added .
azimi said polling stations did not open in the small town on the highway between pul-i-khumri , the capital of baghlan province , and kunduz province .
" no elections there .
i do n't think there will be because fighting is ongoing , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 20.08.2009 comedian 's election platform : laughs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bumbling grotesque horst schlaemmer mocks the staid facade of german politics a german comedian is getting real attention with a fictitious political party ahead of general elections in september .
his poll ratings are the envy of many real-life politicians . what snorts like a warthog rooting for grubs , has hair like a vintage rabbit pelt , and sports an overbite rarely seen outside of the animal kingdom ?
just germany 's latest political sensation : a comedian in the guise of a scruffy small-time journalist named horst schlaemmer , whose fake bid for the german chancellorship has injected some real humor into a boring campaign season .
the undeniably unappealing alter ego of popular german funnyman hape kerkeling is the star of his own feature film , which debuted to throngs of fans in berlin on thursday .
the movie , " isch kandidiere " -lrb- " i 'm running for chancellor ! " -rrb- follows the faux candidate as he looks for support among the common people and german stars like rapper bushido and ex-racing champion michael schumacher .
bushido also contributed schlaemmer 's campaign song .
" first of all , i 'd like to point out that the horst schlaemmer party stands for justice , and of course it stands for freedom , and yes , women 's emancipation - but i 've forgotten the rest of your question , " schlaemmer told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people were taken in by hape kerkeling 's 1991 impersonation of queen beatrix of the netherlands riffing off of the slogan that won barack obama the american presidency , schlaemmer 's campaign catchphrase is " yes weekend . " his trademark look includes an ill-fitting trench coat , glasses that cover what little of his face is n't hidden behind his bushy mustache , and a dirty grey wig .
schlaemmer has gained the kind of media exposure and enthusiasm that more legitimate contenders for the chancellor 's seat can only dream of .
but perhaps that 's to be expected when your campaign promises include state-subsidized tanning and cradle-to-grave income .
two major german television channels aired live coverage of schlaemmer 's first press conference for nearly two hours .
in contrast , those same networks cut away from real-life candidate frank-walter steinmeier as he was explaining how he 'd fulfill a campaign promise of creating 4 million jobs by 2020 .
eighteen percent of the people surveyed by german polling institute forsa said they could imagine voting for schlaemmer 's party if it did in fact exist in real life .
that 's not so much less than the latest poll numbers for the social democratic party , currently in opposition , which garnered just 22 percent of registered voters ' support , according to forsa .
" schlaemmer is an alternative to your usual grey-suited politician in germany , " political scientist gero neugebauer of berlin 's free university told afp .
" i can imagine people are fed up with politics and politicians ... the boring campaign makes schlaemmer more interesting . "

" megrahi now faces a sentence imposed by a higher power , " said scottish justice minister kenny macaskill at a news conference on thursday .
" it is terminal , final and irrevocable .
he is going to die . "
shortly afterwards megrahi boarded a libyan jet that had been sent from tripoli to collect him .
relatives of the victims and the united states government were opposed to his release .
on tuesday us secretary of state hillary clinton said that it would be " absolutely wrong " to free al-megrahi , who was responsible for a " horrendous crime . "
his guilt has always been in question .
some are convinced that he was responsible , while others have consistently labeled his conviction a miscarriage of justice .
either way , megrahi is the only one ever to be tried and convicted .
circumstantial evidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : megrahi is on his way back to libya megrahi , a father of five , was born in tripoli , libya in 1952 .
he has a good command of the english language , a skill he picked up when he studied in the us .
he had also visited britain several times .
he ran an international relations think tank in libya called the center for strategic studies , a job that the fbi has claimed provided him with the perfect cover to work as an operative for the libyan intelligence services -lrb- jso -rrb- .
for a time , he was also based in malta as director of security for libyan arab airways -lrb- laa -rrb- , a job that prosecutors said gave him knowledge and access to secure airlines .
the key piece of evidence in his trial was that pieces of clothing that megrahi had bought in malta were found wrapped around the bomb .
a fateful flight on december 22 , 1988 , pan am flight 103 took off from london 's heathrow airport , headed for new york .
on board were 259 passengers .
approximately 38 minutes into the flight , the plane exploded at 31,000 feet over lockerbie , scotland , killing all the passengers as well as 11 people on the ground .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pan am 103 memorial in arlington cemetary it took three years of painstaking investigation , but finally in 1999 , officials indicted two libyans , al-amin khalifa fhimah and abdelbaset ali mohmed al-megrahi , on 270 counts of murder .
by then the two men were home and libyan leader moammar gadhafi refused to hand them over .
thus began years of international pressure on libya .
in 1992 the un security council imposed sanctions on libya over its refusal to hand over the men .
it was not until six years later , in 1998 , that gadhafi finally said that the trial could take place , but only in a neutral country .
the us and britain proposed using scottish law in the netherlands and gadhafi agreed .
after nelson mandela visited gadhafi in 1999 , the men were finally extradited and the trial began at camp zeist in the netherlands .
justice takes time the trial began in 2000 , and from the start both of the accused denied any involvement in the lockerbie bombing .
the proceedings lasted a year and in the end , al-megrahi was sentenced to life in prison while al-amin khalifa fhimah , was found not guilty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al-amin khalifa fhimah was found not guilty al-megrahi immediately launched an appeal and fhimah went home .
in 2002 , a panel of five scottish judges began hearing his appeal which was denied three months later .
the next several years saw more legal wrangling between al-megrahi and the scottish legal system .
in 2007 , the scottish criminal cases review commission recommended that he should be granted a second appeal .
power politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libya 's moammar gadhafi paid compensation in the background of all the legal proceedings was a combination of money , oil and politics .
oil makes up a big part of the libyan economy .
according to the cia factbook , the libyan economy depends almost entirely on revenues from the oil sector , which contribute about 95 percent of export earnings , about one quarter of the gross domestic product , and roughly 60 percent of public sector wages .
in other words , un sanctions hit libya very hard .
libya clearly felt the strain and within the last few years the libyans have renounced nuclear arms and agreed to pay compensation to the families of the lockerbie victims .
former british prime minister tony blair was among the first politicians to become involved in helping british petroleum -lrb- bp -rrb- and shell win exploration acreage in libya .
the release of al-megrahi could ease tensions between britain and libya and open further business opportunities .
in fact some of the relatives of the victims of the lockerbie bombings have intimated that a deal has been struck. av / reuters / afp / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" megrahi now faces a sentence imposed by a higher power , " said scottish justice minister kenny macaskill at a news conference on thursday .
" it is terminal , final and irrevocable .
he is going to die . "
shortly afterwards megrahi boarded a libyan jet that had been sent from tripoli to collect him .
relatives of the victims and the united states government were opposed to his release .
on tuesday us secretary of state hillary clinton said that it would be " absolutely wrong " to free al-megrahi , who was responsible for a " horrendous crime . "
his guilt has always been in question .
some are convinced that he was responsible , while others have consistently labeled his conviction a miscarriage of justice .
either way , megrahi is the only one ever to be tried and convicted .
circumstantial evidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : megrahi is on his way back to libya megrahi , a father of five , was born in tripoli , libya in 1952 .
he has a good command of the english language , a skill he picked up when he studied in the us .
he had also visited britain several times .
he ran an international relations think tank in libya called the center for strategic studies , a job that the fbi has claimed provided him with the perfect cover to work as an operative for the libyan intelligence services -lrb- jso -rrb- .
for a time , he was also based in malta as director of security for libyan arab airways -lrb- laa -rrb- , a job that prosecutors said gave him knowledge and access to secure airlines .
the key piece of evidence in his trial was that pieces of clothing that megrahi had bought in malta were found wrapped around the bomb .
a fateful flight on december 22 , 1988 , pan am flight 103 took off from london 's heathrow airport , headed for new york .
on board were 259 passengers .
approximately 38 minutes into the flight , the plane exploded at 31,000 feet over lockerbie , scotland , killing all the passengers as well as 11 people on the ground .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pan am 103 memorial in arlington cemetary it took three years of painstaking investigation , but finally in 1999 , officials indicted two libyans , al-amin khalifa fhimah and abdelbaset ali mohmed al-megrahi , on 270 counts of murder .
by then the two men were home and libyan leader moammar gadhafi refused to hand them over .
thus began years of international pressure on libya .
in 1992 the un security council imposed sanctions on libya over its refusal to hand over the men .
it was not until six years later , in 1998 , that gadhafi finally said that the trial could take place , but only in a neutral country .
the us and britain proposed using scottish law in the netherlands and gadhafi agreed .
after nelson mandela visited gadhafi in 1999 , the men were finally extradited and the trial began at camp zeist in the netherlands .
justice takes time the trial began in 2000 , and from the start both of the accused denied any involvement in the lockerbie bombing .
the proceedings lasted a year and in the end , al-megrahi was sentenced to life in prison while al-amin khalifa fhimah , was found not guilty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al-amin khalifa fhimah was found not guilty al-megrahi immediately launched an appeal and fhimah went home .
in 2002 , a panel of five scottish judges began hearing his appeal which was denied three months later .
the next several years saw more legal wrangling between al-megrahi and the scottish legal system .
in 2007 , the scottish criminal cases review commission recommended that he should be granted a second appeal .

some are convinced that he was responsible , while others have consistently labeled his conviction a miscarriage of justice .
either way , megrahi is the only one ever to be tried and convicted .
circumstantial evidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : megrahi is on his way back to libya megrahi , a father of five , was born in tripoli , libya in 1952 .
he has a good command of the english language , a skill he picked up when he studied in the us .
he had also visited britain several times .
he ran an international relations think tank in libya called the center for strategic studies , a job that the fbi has claimed provided him with the perfect cover to work as an operative for the libyan intelligence services -lrb- jso -rrb- .
for a time , he was also based in malta as director of security for libyan arab airways -lrb- laa -rrb- , a job that prosecutors said gave him knowledge and access to secure airlines .
the key piece of evidence in his trial was that pieces of clothing that megrahi had bought in malta were found wrapped around the bomb .
a fateful flight on december 22 , 1988 , pan am flight 103 took off from london 's heathrow airport , headed for new york .
on board were 259 passengers .
approximately 38 minutes into the flight , the plane exploded at 31,000 feet over lockerbie , scotland , killing all the passengers as well as 11 people on the ground .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pan am 103 memorial in arlington cemetary it took three years of painstaking investigation , but finally in 1999 , officials indicted two libyans , al-amin khalifa fhimah and abdelbaset ali mohmed al-megrahi , on 270 counts of murder .
by then the two men were home and libyan leader moammar gadhafi refused to hand them over .
thus began years of international pressure on libya .
in 1992 the un security council imposed sanctions on libya over its refusal to hand over the men .
it was not until six years later , in 1998 , that gadhafi finally said that the trial could take place , but only in a neutral country .
the us and britain proposed using scottish law in the netherlands and gadhafi agreed .
after nelson mandela visited gadhafi in 1999 , the men were finally extradited and the trial began at camp zeist in the netherlands .
justice takes time the trial began in 2000 , and from the start both of the accused denied any involvement in the lockerbie bombing .
the proceedings lasted a year and in the end , al-megrahi was sentenced to life in prison while al-amin khalifa fhimah , was found not guilty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al-amin khalifa fhimah was found not guilty al-megrahi immediately launched an appeal and fhimah went home .
in 2002 , a panel of five scottish judges began hearing his appeal which was denied three months later .
the next several years saw more legal wrangling between al-megrahi and the scottish legal system .
in 2007 , the scottish criminal cases review commission recommended that he should be granted a second appeal .
power politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libya 's moammar gadhafi paid compensation in the background of all the legal proceedings was a combination of money , oil and politics .
oil makes up a big part of the libyan economy .
according to the cia factbook , the libyan economy depends almost entirely on revenues from the oil sector , which contribute about 95 percent of export earnings , about one quarter of the gross domestic product , and roughly 60 percent of public sector wages .
in other words , un sanctions hit libya very hard .
libya clearly felt the strain and within the last few years the libyans have renounced nuclear arms and agreed to pay compensation to the families of the lockerbie victims .
former british prime minister tony blair was among the first politicians to become involved in helping british petroleum -lrb- bp -rrb- and shell win exploration acreage in libya .
the release of al-megrahi could ease tensions between britain and libya and open further business opportunities .
in fact some of the relatives of the victims of the lockerbie bombings have intimated that a deal has been struck. av / reuters / afp / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the day saw relatively little violence although concerns remain over a possible low turnout due to threats of taliban attacks . " our assessment is that , in general , these elections went much better than we anticipated , " ettore sequi , the european union 's special representative to afghanistan , told afp .
the roughly 6,200 election centers which were able to accept voters was " an achievement considering the concerns before the election , " he added .
despite dozens of taliban missiles and bombs and the deaths of more than 20 people , many international leaders agreed with sequi 's statement .
german chancellor angela merkel called the election " an important chapter in the democratic development of the country . "
nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen said the election was " a testimony to the determination of the afghan people to build democracy . "
he congratulated the voters for their courage in the face of taliban threats .
" seen from a security point of view , the election has been a success , " he said .
" the most important thing is that the election will be considered credible in the eyes of the afghan people . "
while no official voter turnout figures have been released , there is concern that if a low percentage of the 15 million registered voters showed up to cast their ballots , it would diminish the legitimacy of the election .
taliban attacks close some polls , delay voting as voting continued across the country during the day , taliban militants stormed a town in northern afghanistan , launching a multi-pronged assault that left at least eight of them dead and kept polling stations from opening , officials said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban attacks disrupted voting in some areas " terrorists attacked from several directions .
fighting has been going on since morning , " provincial police chief mohammad kabir andarabi told reporters in baghlan .
" now , as we speak , the enemy has been pushed back .
we have killed 22 terrorists .
most of their bodies are left on the ground , " he added .
abdul majeed azimi , head of the provincial intelligence agency , confirmed the incident but said the corpses of only eight rebels were found .
the local district police chief and one of his guards were also killed .
a 12-year-old boy was wounded in the clashes , he added .
azimi said polling stations did not open in the small town on the highway between pul-i-khumri , the capital of baghlan province , and kunduz province .
" no elections there .
i do n't think there will be because fighting is ongoing , " he said .
residents confirmed to local media that no polling stations were open .
eu calls on afghans to resist taliban pressure the eu had called on the afghan people to defy the taliban and cast their ballots , as a team of about 100 eu observers kept a watchful eye on the voting process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu and nato commended afghans on their election " we encourage the afghan people to go out and vote on this very important day , which sets the path towards democracy for the afghan nation and its people , " european commission spokesman john clancy said in brussels . clancy said no eu monitors had been injured in any attacks . the eu has the largest international observer mission in afghanistan . european election mission to monitor results headed by philippe morillon , a former french general and now a member of the european parliament , the mission has been monitoring the election campaign and is now focusing on polling , counting and tallying the results . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : morillon 's team will begin monitoring the election results it plans to condemn any serious breach of electoral rules and procedures , with a preliminary statement from morillon expected on saturday . so far , its biggest worry has been with proxy voting . concerns have been fuelled by a suspiciously high rate of registration for female voters in traditionally conservative parts of the country .
despite being escorted by afghan and nato forces , the monitors have not been deployed throughout the country owing to the precarious security situation . the eu is a major donor to afghanistan .
the bloc 's brussels-based executive arm , the european commission , has provided the country with 1.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 2 billion -rrb- in aid since 2002 .

the 25-year-old vlasic , meanwhile , claimed gold with a jump of 2.04 meters .
friedrich and vlasic have been engaged in a tussle at the peak of world high jumping for the past 12 months , with the german coming out on top in three of the four competitions in which they have faced each other this year in the lead up to the current meet in berlin .
at a golden league event in berlin earlier this year , friedrich leaped to a german record of 2.06 meters - also the highest jump of the year - to take first place .
she was bettered only a few weeks later in monaco , however , when the croat consigned her to her first second-place finish of the year .
but in qualifying for thursday 's final , friedrich sent a clear message to her rival by clearing the 1.95-meter qualifying height on her first jump .
vlasic needed a few extra jumps to clear the same height .
coming into the championships friedrich was considered one of the german athletes most likely to bag a medal .
she is also one of the most recognizable athletes on the track .
her pink knee-high socks , large sunglasses and bleach-blond hair are unmistakable .

guest commentator joerg faust argues that only a small number of elites benefit . observers point regularly to the economic successes posted by some autocratic regimes .
that is despite the proven fact that democracy entails a welfare dividend : governments that hope to be re-elected in democracies with inclusive competition and a system of checks and balances need to bear in mind the economic well-being of broad segments of their population . autocratic governments , however , rely more heavily than democratic governments on the support of a small number of powerful interest groups .
that leaves a large majority of the population finding itself wholly deprived of political influence and political and other rights . china prospers despite government at present , it is mainly china that comes in for praise .
in the 1980s south korea and taiwan - to cite two examples - were often referred to as authoritarian " economic miracle countries , " and just a few years earlier the same was said of mexico and , to a lesser extent , brazil . the conclusion drawn , again and again , was that economically " attractive " autocracies of this kind offer , at least during a given phase of their development process , an alternative path to prosperity .
but what is it that enables a small number of autocracies to prosper more than might be expected ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese philosopher confucius promoted harmonious relations within family and state the culture card is often played by way of explanation .
it is , we are told , -lrb- eastern -rrb- asian societies , with their deeply ingrained confucian values , that are particularly receptive for the notion of the economically " attractive " autocracy . this line of argument full of inconsistencies .
if we are to assume that what is at work here are deeply ingrained cultural patterns , why is it that the partitioning of korea gave rise so rapidly to fundamental development disparities ? why is it that today , despite their allegedly autocracy-oriented cultures , taiwan and south korea are counted among the most successful democratization processes observed in the course of recent decades ?
another open question is , finally , why it is that autocracies in other cultural contexts - mexico , for example - have generated positive economic growth rates for decades on end . elites benefit in non-democratic regimes in looking for the key factors behind this phenomenon , it would be equally mistaken to point to resource wealth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : natural resources like diamonds and ore often only benefit a small elite the discussions surrounding african " blood diamonds " or the " resource curse " weighing on oil-producing countries indicate quite clearly that resource-rich autocracies provide strong incentives for elites to seize or to give an especially repressive and exclusive shape to access of resources and the state 's traditional monopoly on the use of force . another reason why such autocracies can hardly be called " attractive " is that they hold out no prospects for emulation on the part of resource-poor developing countries . " attractive " autocracies are , therefore , most likely to emerge from a rare combination of two factors .
first , economically successful authoritarian regimes tend to be linked relatively closely to groups in society that play a major role in economic development , although , in the end , these close links do not serve the groups in question as a means to co-opt state structures , a development that would lead to the emergence of a rent economy . the nexus between these groups and other strategic groups in society is either created directly , via the state bureaucracy , as in the case of south korea , or by dominant political parties that are closely intertwined with the state that have roots extending far into society , as in the cases of mexico -lrb- in the past -rrb- or today 's china . fragile systems of checks and balances it is this combination of a regime which is at once autonomous and embedded in social structures that enables even an authoritarian government to respond by relatively flexible and adaptable means to the population 's interests and needs .
however , this combination is , in itself , not sufficient . indeed , autocracies that have proven economically successful for a longer period of time tend to have a fragile system of informal checks and balances in place between the various factions constituting the ruling regime . to cite two examples , the rulers of the autocracies found in today 's china and mexico in the past have served as strict moderators between different factions of national elites .
regimes of this kind tend not to be totalitarian systems in which one party serves to transmit to society , virtually mechanically , the arbitrary decisions taken by a despot .
what we find instead is a limited plurality of interests that encourages an autocratic regime to adopt a relatively open and flexible economic policy . human rights abuses keep elites in power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. joerg faust of the german development institute but the fixed elements of even allegedly " attractive " autocracies of this stamp include repression of any open opposition to the ruling regime , censorship of the media , and violations of human rights , with a relatively small regime elite enjoying disproportionate economic benefits and the large majority of the population deprived of their basis rights . the system of checks and balances in place will , for the most part , tend to be fragile and to function exclusively in the interest of regime elites .
in the long run authoritarian systems of this kind will therefore display marked signs of political sclerosis and corruption . another factor that tends to limit the " attractiveness " of regimes of this kind is that they show a far higher level of resistance to transplantation in other countries - this is in stark contrast to the openness of democratic political processes , which are more adaptable to specific country contexts . all this we need to keep in mind when we hear , as we sometimes will , the " attractiveness " of autocratic rule being rashly extolled for countries in the process of development . author : dr. joerg faust -lrb- ara -rrb- editor : sean sinico dr. joerg faust heads the department " governance , statehood , security " at the german development institute / deutsches institut für entwicklungspolitik -lrb- die -rrb- . based in bonn , the german development institute draws together the knowledge of development research available worldwide , dedicating its work to key issues facing the future of development policy .

another open question is , finally , why it is that autocracies in other cultural contexts - mexico , for example - have generated positive economic growth rates for decades on end . elites benefit in non-democratic regimes in looking for the key factors behind this phenomenon , it would be equally mistaken to point to resource wealth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : natural resources like diamonds and ore often only benefit a small elite the discussions surrounding african " blood diamonds " or the " resource curse " weighing on oil-producing countries indicate quite clearly that resource-rich autocracies provide strong incentives for elites to seize or to give an especially repressive and exclusive shape to access of resources and the state 's traditional monopoly on the use of force . another reason why such autocracies can hardly be called " attractive " is that they hold out no prospects for emulation on the part of resource-poor developing countries . " attractive " autocracies are , therefore , most likely to emerge from a rare combination of two factors .
first , economically successful authoritarian regimes tend to be linked relatively closely to groups in society that play a major role in economic development , although , in the end , these close links do not serve the groups in question as a means to co-opt state structures , a development that would lead to the emergence of a rent economy . the nexus between these groups and other strategic groups in society is either created directly , via the state bureaucracy , as in the case of south korea , or by dominant political parties that are closely intertwined with the state that have roots extending far into society , as in the cases of mexico -lrb- in the past -rrb- or today 's china . fragile systems of checks and balances it is this combination of a regime which is at once autonomous and embedded in social structures that enables even an authoritarian government to respond by relatively flexible and adaptable means to the population 's interests and needs .
however , this combination is , in itself , not sufficient . indeed , autocracies that have proven economically successful for a longer period of time tend to have a fragile system of informal checks and balances in place between the various factions constituting the ruling regime . to cite two examples , the rulers of the autocracies found in today 's china and mexico in the past have served as strict moderators between different factions of national elites .
regimes of this kind tend not to be totalitarian systems in which one party serves to transmit to society , virtually mechanically , the arbitrary decisions taken by a despot .
what we find instead is a limited plurality of interests that encourages an autocratic regime to adopt a relatively open and flexible economic policy . human rights abuses keep elites in power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. joerg faust of the german development institute but the fixed elements of even allegedly " attractive " autocracies of this stamp include repression of any open opposition to the ruling regime , censorship of the media , and violations of human rights , with a relatively small regime elite enjoying disproportionate economic benefits and the large majority of the population deprived of their basis rights . the system of checks and balances in place will , for the most part , tend to be fragile and to function exclusively in the interest of regime elites .
in the long run authoritarian systems of this kind will therefore display marked signs of political sclerosis and corruption . another factor that tends to limit the " attractiveness " of regimes of this kind is that they show a far higher level of resistance to transplantation in other countries - this is in stark contrast to the openness of democratic political processes , which are more adaptable to specific country contexts . all this we need to keep in mind when we hear , as we sometimes will , the " attractiveness " of autocratic rule being rashly extolled for countries in the process of development . author : dr. joerg faust -lrb- ara -rrb- editor : sean sinico dr. joerg faust heads the department " governance , statehood , security " at the german development institute / deutsches institut für entwicklungspolitik -lrb- die -rrb- . based in bonn , the german development institute draws together the knowledge of development research available worldwide , dedicating its work to key issues facing the future of development policy .

the attacks were the worst since the beginning of the us withdrawal , writes rainer sollich , head of dw 's arabic service . statistics frequently say little about actual circumstances , such as whether or not the most recent terror attacks in iraq are a result of the us troop draw down .
the number of victims in the weeks before american troops began leaving iraqi city centers had actually increased .
after their withdrawal , the violence decreased at first , only to re-emerge in the form of a bloodbath in the middle of baghdad .
if there are any conclusions to be drawn from this , then only that with or without us troops , iraq remains in the clutches of violence and terror .
security , of course , has markedly improved in the last couple of years , but the official iraqi and american claims that the situation is under control display a rather peculiar interpretation of calm .
iraq is still gripped by the constant threat of violence .
attacks continue unabated attacks are reported on almost a daily basis , although the general public is not aware of many of them .
it is a sad but logical consequence of the never-ending media coverage that the topic of " terror in iraq " has worn thin and now garners little international interest .
an attack with " just " four or five dead no longer warrants a headline , but then , when the number of victims jumps dramatically , the customary response mechanisms shift into gear .
the un security council , the white house and the european union all condemn the violence in unison , and media outlets provide the public with the gory details of death and destruction as well as displays of dismay , anger and sympathy .
people around the world see the images on television and ask themselves : where does all this hate come from and how can people be capable of subjecting others to such senseless pain and suffering ? # b # the answer is as simple as it is cynical .
it is done expressly for that purpose .
the perpetrators intended to strike the innocent and spread fear .
they do not want iraq to be peaceful ; they enjoy the international condemnation .
and they want to see their deeds on television .
every form of media attention lends weight to their acts of terror .
however , no revamping of media ethics – no matter how sophisticated – can help .
what is needed , first and foremost , is drastically improved security .
fertile ground for terrorists the latest wave of violence in baghdad illustrates the deficits within the iraqi government to guarantee security and promote national reconciliation .
the government has announced plans to close the existing gaps in security , and that is an important first step .
but it can not be the only one .
terrorists will always find fertile ground and support from segments of the iraqi population , or from abroad , as long as the conflict between ethnic and religious groups and their leaders is unresolved .
the lack of mutual respect and the thirst for revenge will not disappear overnight – and neither will the thirst for power and the country 's oil reserves .
it may seem bold , even risky , that the united states is sticking to its plan to withdraw from iraq completely by the end of 2011 .
however , this may be the appropriate leverage to force the government in baghdad to undertake greater efforts to solve its domestic conflicts and pursue a path of national reconciliation .

meanwhile , caster semenya 's win struck some observers as a bit too resounding . spectators at berlin 's olympic stadium got a treat wednesday evening , cheering on a local athlete to victory in the discus .
robert harting , on his last throw of the competition , bested poland 's piotr malachowski by 28 centimeters , casting his disc 69.43 meters .
the mark was a personal best for the berlin resident , and he said the home crowd had driven him to it .
" that last meter in my final throw was thanks to this crowd , " harting told reporters .
" the fans were unbelievable , and they screamed their hearts out .
the crowd helped me in this final throw . "
it was harting 's first world championship gold medal after a silver in 2007 , and germany 's second of the competition .
reigning olympic champion and 2007 winner gerd kanter of estonia came third with a throw of 66.88 meters .
taboo breaker harting 's win , which he celebrated in style by ripping his shirt off for the camera and picking up the games ' mascot , marked a happy end to a turbulent couple of weeks for the athlete .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harting tore off his shirt after winning in an interview less than two weeks before the world championships he had said that he thought the anti-doping movement was misguided .
“ where there 's money , there will be doping , ” said harting .
“ sometimes i ask myself whether it might be better to allow doping in some form … at least that would stop people from getting so worked up about it . ”
germany 's athletic federation came out strongly against harting 's statements , and he tried to mollify them on his website in the days that followed .
still , once the meet began , harting could n't resist one more shot at the anti-doping crusaders .
as part of a campaign on behalf of former east german athletes who had been doped in the communist era , a group had given out cardboard eyeglasses frames to spectators , so that they might show their support for taking an even closer look into doping in sports .
harting , when asked what he thought of the glasses , quipped that he hoped his discus might spring up and take out a pair on the bounce .
the comment landed harting in hot water with the sport 's power brokers again , but judging from the crowd 's reaction , it did n't hurt his popularity among fans .
difficult question for south africa 's caster semenya , meanwhile , the controversy is just beginning .
she blew away the rest of the field in the women 's 800 meters , clocking in at 1:55.45 , more than two seconds and 15 meters ahead of the next best runner , janeth jepkosgei of kenya .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : semenya 's gender is to be tested but semenya 's powerful build , deep voice and rapid improvement in recent months has led some , including world athletics body iaaf , to seek to find out whether she belongs in the women 's competition at all .
the 18-year-old now faces a series of tests to confirm her gender , which officials say could take months to complete .
" at the moment there is no proof .
the benefit of the doubt has to be with the athlete , " said iaaf general secretary pierre weiss .
" but if at the end it is proven -lsb- that she is not a woman -rsb- then the medal will be withdrawn . "

meanwhile , caster semenya 's win struck some observers as a bit too resounding . spectators at berlin 's olympic stadium got a treat wednesday evening , cheering on a local athlete to victory in the discus .
robert harting , on his last throw of the competition , bested poland 's piotr malachowski by 28 centimeters , casting his disc 69.43 meters .
the mark was a personal best for the berlin resident , and he said the home crowd had driven him to it .
" that last meter in my final throw was thanks to this crowd , " harting told reporters .
" the fans were unbelievable , and they screamed their hearts out .
the crowd helped me in this final throw . "
it was harting 's first world championship gold medal after a silver in 2007 , and germany 's second of the competition .
reigning olympic champion and 2007 winner gerd kanter of estonia came third with a throw of 66.88 meters .
taboo breaker harting 's win , which he celebrated in style by ripping his shirt off for the camera and picking up the games ' mascot , marked a happy end to a turbulent couple of weeks for the athlete .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harting tore off his shirt after winning in an interview less than two weeks before the world championships he had said that he thought the anti-doping movement was misguided .
“ where there 's money , there will be doping , ” said harting .
“ sometimes i ask myself whether it might be better to allow doping in some form … at least that would stop people from getting so worked up about it . ”
germany 's athletic federation came out strongly against harting 's statements , and he tried to mollify them on his website in the days that followed .
still , once the meet began , harting could n't resist one more shot at the anti-doping crusaders .
as part of a campaign on behalf of former east german athletes who had been doped in the communist era , a group had given out cardboard eyeglasses frames to spectators , so that they might show their support for taking an even closer look into doping in sports .
harting , when asked what he thought of the glasses , quipped that he hoped his discus might spring up and take out a pair on the bounce .
the comment landed harting in hot water with the sport 's power brokers again , but judging from the crowd 's reaction , it did n't hurt his popularity among fans .
difficult question for south africa 's caster semenya , meanwhile , the controversy is just beginning .
she blew away the rest of the field in the women 's 800 meters , clocking in at 1:55.45 , more than two seconds and 15 meters ahead of the next best runner , janeth jepkosgei of kenya .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : semenya 's gender is to be tested but semenya 's powerful build , deep voice and rapid improvement in recent months has led some , including world athletics body iaaf , to seek to find out whether she belongs in the women 's competition at all .
the 18-year-old now faces a series of tests to confirm her gender , which officials say could take months to complete .
" at the moment there is no proof .
the benefit of the doubt has to be with the athlete , " said iaaf general secretary pierre weiss .
" but if at the end it is proven -lsb- that she is not a woman -rsb- then the medal will be withdrawn . "
the 18-year-old was shielded from the media , while jepkosgei and britain 's third place finisher jenny meadows did not want to comment on the controversy .

the attacks were the worst since the beginning of the us withdrawal , writes rainer sollich , head of dw 's arabic service . statistics frequently say little about actual circumstances , such as whether or not the most recent terror attacks in iraq are a result of the us troop draw down .
the number of victims in the weeks before american troops began leaving iraqi city centers had actually increased .
after their withdrawal , the violence decreased at first , only to re-emerge in the form of a bloodbath in the middle of baghdad .
if there are any conclusions to be drawn from this , then only that with or without us troops , iraq remains in the clutches of violence and terror .
security , of course , has markedly improved in the last couple of years , but the official iraqi and american claims that the situation is under control display a rather peculiar interpretation of calm .
iraq is still gripped by the constant threat of violence .
attacks continue unabated attacks are reported on almost a daily basis , although the general public is not aware of many of them .
it is a sad but logical consequence of the never-ending media coverage that the topic of " terror in iraq " has worn thin and now garners little international interest .
an attack with " just " four or five dead no longer warrants a headline , but then , when the number of victims jumps dramatically , the customary response mechanisms shift into gear .
the un security council , the white house and the european union all condemn the violence in unison , and media outlets provide the public with the gory details of death and destruction as well as displays of dismay , anger and sympathy .
people around the world see the images on television and ask themselves : where does all this hate come from and how can people be capable of subjecting others to such senseless pain and suffering ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainer sollich , head of dw 's arabic service the answer is as simple as it is cynical .
it is done expressly for that purpose .
the perpetrators intended to strike the innocent and spread fear .
they do not want iraq to be peaceful ; they enjoy the international condemnation .
and they want to see their deeds on television .
every form of media attention lends weight to their acts of terror .
however , no revamping of media ethics – no matter how sophisticated – can help .
what is needed , first and foremost , is drastically improved security .
fertile ground for terrorists the latest wave of violence in baghdad illustrates the deficits within the iraqi government to guarantee security and promote national reconciliation .
the government has announced plans to close the existing gaps in security , and that is an important first step .
but it can not be the only one .
terrorists will always find fertile ground and support from segments of the iraqi population , or from abroad , as long as the conflict between ethnic and religious groups and their leaders is unresolved .
the lack of mutual respect and the thirst for revenge will not disappear overnight – and neither will the thirst for power and the country 's oil reserves .
it may seem bold , even risky , that the united states is sticking to its plan to withdraw from iraq completely by the end of 2011 .
however , this may be the appropriate leverage to force the government in baghdad to undertake greater efforts to solve its domestic conflicts and pursue a path of national reconciliation .

the attacks were the worst since the beginning of the us withdrawal , writes rainer sollich , head of dw 's arabic service . statistics frequently say little about actual circumstances , such as whether or not the most recent terror attacks in iraq are a result of the us troop draw down .
the number of victims in the weeks before american troops began leaving iraqi city centers had actually increased .
after their withdrawal , the violence decreased at first , only to re-emerge in the form of a bloodbath in the middle of baghdad .
if there are any conclusions to be drawn from this , then only that with or without us troops , iraq remains in the clutches of violence and terror .
security , of course , has markedly improved in the last couple of years , but the official iraqi and american claims that the situation is under control display a rather peculiar interpretation of calm .
iraq is still gripped by the constant threat of violence .
attacks continue unabated attacks are reported on almost a daily basis , although the general public is not aware of many of them .
it is a sad but logical consequence of the never-ending media coverage that the topic of " terror in iraq " has worn thin and now garners little international interest .
an attack with " just " four or five dead no longer warrants a headline , but then , when the number of victims jumps dramatically , the customary response mechanisms shift into gear .
the un security council , the white house and the european union all condemn the violence in unison , and media outlets provide the public with the gory details of death and destruction as well as displays of dismay , anger and sympathy .
people around the world see the images on television and ask themselves : where does all this hate come from and how can people be capable of subjecting others to such senseless pain and suffering ?

however , no revamping of media ethics – no matter how sophisticated – can help .
what is needed , first and foremost , is drastically improved security .
fertile ground for terrorists the latest wave of violence in baghdad illustrates the deficits within the iraqi government to guarantee security and promote national reconciliation .
the government has announced plans to close the existing gaps in security , and that is an important first step .
but it can not be the only one .
terrorists will always find fertile ground and support from segments of the iraqi population , or from abroad , as long as the conflict between ethnic and religious groups and their leaders is unresolved .
the lack of mutual respect and the thirst for revenge will not disappear overnight – and neither will the thirst for power and the country 's oil reserves .
it may seem bold , even risky , that the united states is sticking to its plan to withdraw from iraq completely by the end of 2011 .
however , this may be the appropriate leverage to force the government in baghdad to undertake greater efforts to solve its domestic conflicts and pursue a path of national reconciliation .

in addition , four eu countries have privately told the administration that they are committed to resettling detainees , and five other eu nations are considering taking some , according to officials in us president barack obama 's administration , who spoke to the newspaper on the condition of anonymity .
there are still 229 prisoners at the camp , which was opened in january 2002 by then president george w. bush to hold " enemy combatants " in the us " war on terror . "
obama has ordered the camp to be closed by january 22 , 2010 .
to meet that goal , the administration has appointed daniel fried , a longtime diplomat with deep ties to eastern europe and parts of the former soviet union , to lead negotiations with other countries .
some 80 prisoners are ready for release .
the post said that if resettling agreements could be made , a reduced detainee population would likely ease the politically charged debate on moving remaining prisoners to a facility on us soil .
of the detainees cleared for release so far , eleven have been transferred home or to third countries , including bermuda , which accepted four chinese uighurs .
the pacific island of palau has agreed to resettle the 13 remaining uighur detainees , and more than half of them are willing to go or are seriously considering the offer .
us looking towards eastern europe in addition , the administration has held positive talks with australia and georgia , and it has formally approached or is planning to hold talks with countries in south america , the persian gulf , the balkans and the former soviet union , the post wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama has pledged to close the camp by 2010 congress has blocked the white house from resettling any detainees in the united states , a move that us and some european officials feared would lead other countries , particularly in the eu , to refuse to help close the military prison .
but the issue has proved relatively unproblematic , officials said .
" obama has a lot of political capital .
countries want to do something for him , and that allows us to say , ' this is it , this is what we want you to do , " ' said a senior administration official quoted in the report .
" this is going a lot better than we might have thought . "
one senior administration official said negotiations in eastern europe will intensify once detainees arrive in larger eu countries , such as italy and spain .
the post also reported that us and european officials believe stalled negotiations with berlin can be rekindled after germany holds national parliamentary elections next month .
and there is some expectation that france , which has taken one detainee , may accept more. nda / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche welle 's peter philipp looks at who stands to profit from the destabilization of afghanistan . in afghanistan 's eventful history , it was largely the interests of large foreign powers that prevented peace in the country at the foothills of the hindukush mountains . the foreign powers included the british , who pursued their own interests there , the russians and finally the americans - together with allies pakistan and saudi arabia . caught between powerful foreign interests the issues at stake were securing british supply lanes to india , ensuring russian access to the indian ocean , and finally repelling and beating back the soviet union with the help of the three-way alliance of washington , islamabad and riyadh . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche welle 's peter philipp those interests never focused on bolstering a strong afghan state , rather they were about installing an accommodating central government in kabul and maintaining a system of loyal regional chieftains in the country .
it was a system that had worked for centuries in afghanistan .
or sometimes it did n't . an afghan proverb speaks of a " a king under every tree . "
the king - and that included the presidents of the country - were merely seen as mayors of the capital kabul .
and their power was only recognized in the provinces if they sealed " deals " with the local rulers and gave them a free hand to run their own affairs . drugs trade flourishing that 's exactly what current president hamid karzai is doing .
once celebrated as the savior of afghanistan by the us and europe , karzai has long left the path of democracy and the rule of law . he has allied himself with regional " warlords " who are meant to ensure karzai power and influence in the provinces and who in return can thwart any attempt at normalization .
corruption is a daily occurrence but what 's worse is that the growing of poppy has reached record volumes in recent years , making afghanistan a notorious leading world exporter of drugs . ordinary farmers do n't earn a lot with their poppy fields but it 's still much more than what they would make with alternative crops such as wheat .
the " warlords " have long-turned into powerful " drug bosses " who rake in huge profits to finance their weapons and who are thus difficult to pressurize . these druglords are flexible and ready to hammer out an alliance with just about anybody .
the main thing is that their powerful positions are untouched . they also work together with the taliban , who are against the opium trade on religious and ideological grounds , but have long used this lucrative economic and agricultural sector for their own purposes . stabilizing afghanistan foreign nations - from afghanistan 's neighbors to europe and the us - are today more interested in calming the situation and stabilizing afghanistan . those interested in the opposite are primarily the regional rulers and the drug bosses who do n't want to give up their power and influence .
to curb their power , more pressure needs to be exerted on the central government and the president , the taliban needs to be defeated and ordinary afghans need to be given new opportunities to earn money . but none of that has happened so far .
still , about 50 drug dealers are included in the 367 names on an exhaustive wanted-persons list compiled by the us in afghanistan .

deutsche welle 's peter philipp looks at who stands to profit from the destabilization of afghanistan . in afghanistan 's eventful history , it was largely the interests of large foreign powers that prevented peace in the country at the foothills of the hindukush mountains . the foreign powers included the british , who pursued their own interests there , the russians and finally the americans - together with allies pakistan and saudi arabia . caught between powerful foreign interests the issues at stake were securing british supply lanes to india , ensuring russian access to the indian ocean , and finally repelling and beating back the soviet union with the help of the three-way alliance of washington , islamabad and riyadh . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche welle 's peter philipp those interests never focused on bolstering a strong afghan state , rather they were about installing an accommodating central government in kabul and maintaining a system of loyal regional chieftains in the country .
it was a system that had worked for centuries in afghanistan .
or sometimes it did n't . an afghan proverb speaks of a " a king under every tree . "
the king - and that included the presidents of the country - were merely seen as mayors of the capital kabul .
and their power was only recognized in the provinces if they sealed " deals " with the local rulers and gave them a free hand to run their own affairs . drugs trade flourishing that 's exactly what current president hamid karzai is doing .
once celebrated as the savior of afghanistan by the us and europe , karzai has long left the path of democracy and the rule of law . he has allied himself with regional " warlords " who are meant to ensure karzai power and influence in the provinces and who in return can thwart any attempt at normalization .
corruption is a daily occurrence but what 's worse is that the growing of poppy has reached record volumes in recent years , making afghanistan a notorious leading world exporter of drugs . ordinary farmers do n't earn a lot with their poppy fields but it 's still much more than what they would make with alternative crops such as wheat .
the " warlords " have long-turned into powerful " drug bosses " who rake in huge profits to finance their weapons and who are thus difficult to pressurize . these druglords are flexible and ready to hammer out an alliance with just about anybody .
the main thing is that their powerful positions are untouched . they also work together with the taliban , who are against the opium trade on religious and ideological grounds , but have long used this lucrative economic and agricultural sector for their own purposes . stabilizing afghanistan foreign nations - from afghanistan 's neighbors to europe and the us - are today more interested in calming the situation and stabilizing afghanistan . those interested in the opposite are primarily the regional rulers and the drug bosses who do n't want to give up their power and influence .
to curb their power , more pressure needs to be exerted on the central government and the president , the taliban needs to be defeated and ordinary afghans need to be given new opportunities to earn money . but none of that has happened so far .
still , about 50 drug dealers are included in the 367 names on an exhaustive wanted-persons list compiled by the us in afghanistan .
they are accused of cooperating with the taliban . but those who work together with the central government in kabul are n't included in any list .
this despite the fact that they pose a similar obstacle to normalization in afghanistan . peter philipp is deutsche welle 's an expert on the middle east . -lrb- sp -rrb- editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 20.08.2009 ryanair sues german online travel comparison sites großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ryanair says that sites operated by unister hit customers with hidden charges irish low-cost airline ryanair is suing a german company for allegedly reselling airline tickets without authorization .
this marks an acceleration of the airline ’ s war against what it regards as online touts . ryanair lodged proceedings against leipzig-based internet firm unister at the high court in dublin this week .
the airline claims websites operated by unister use " screen-scraping " software to gather information from ryanair 's website without permission and then sell tickets to customers at inflated prices .
screen scraping is the process by which one computer program collects specific data from another .
in this case , unister 's software is constantly extracting information from other airline companies ' websites – rates , travel times , availability – and then neatly packaging and displaying that information on its own website for potential customers to search and compare .
while ryanair says it has no problem cooperating with authorized price comparison websites , it is unhappy that sites operated by unister hit customers with " hidden charges " . when a customer buys a return flight from duesseldorf to london on ryanair 's own website , for example , the final price including payment handling fees might be 93.25 euros .
if a customer buys the same ryanair flight using one of unister 's websites , additional fees push the final price up to 111.86 euros .
" ryanair is determined to continue its pro-consumer campaign against screen-scraper ticket-tout websites until the last screen scraper stops overcharging unsuspecting consumers , " ryanair spokesman stephen mcnamara said in a statement .
" our strategy of defending consumer rights in irish courts is proving successful and the number of active screen scrapers is rapidly decreasing , ” mcnamara said , adding : “ sadly , unister chose to continue overcharging consumers in breach of ryanair 's rights and left us no alternative but to refer them to the dublin high court . "
battle brewing unister spokesman konstantin korosides told deutsche welle that while management had not yet received official notification of the lawsuit , they were preparing for a legal battle .
“ we think that a german court is responsible , not an irish one , because we are a german online company .
that means jurisdiction has to be here , ” korosides said .
unister argues that screen-scraper software is not illegal and that its websites simply offer customers a service that helps them make a more informed decision when booking a flight .
“ we are an online travel agency , ” korosides said .
“ we charge a small fee for providing our service .
there 's nothing illegal with going to a travel agency , is there ? ”
“ we have 1.6 million visitors coming to one of our travel websites every month .
surely they would stop coming if they felt we were cheating them , ” he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german football star michael ballack is the face of one of unister 's online ad campaigns violation of terms of service ryanair , however , maintains that by reproducing information from its website without permission , unister and other screen scrapers are violating the ryanair website 's terms of service , which prohibit third parties from using its platform for commercial purposes .
the irish airline has intensified its legal campaign against german screen-scraping websites over the past 12 months , with mixed results .
in may , a hamburg court confirmed a 2008 injunction that banned german screen scraper vtours from reselling ryanair tickets because it was doing so in its own name .
in march , however , a frankfurt court blocked ryanair 's attempt to cancel bookings made through unauthorized screen scrapers , ruling that the german price comparison website cheaptickets.de did not break any laws when accessing ryanair 's database , and that the tickets purchased through the site were therefore valid .
since then ryanair has been pursuing screen scrapers through irish courts .
earlier this month , four german screen scrapers bowed to pressure from the airline 's lawyers and signed a binding agreement stating they would stop accessing the airline 's website and reselling its tickets .
legal grey zone ?
e-commerce experts say that depending on the exact application , screen scrapers often operate in a legal grey zone .
“ the law has n't caught up with this technology yet , ” said jason bellows , an it consultant at screen-scraper.com , a us-based company that sells the kind of software unister uses to harvest information from ryanair .
while many companies in the travel and financial sectors are happy about the extra business aggregator websites attract , bellows said he has often complied with large companies requesting that his firm decline assistance to third parties planning unauthorized access to their databases on several occasions .
common reasons for such requests include perceived harm to their brand 's reputation for value , a loss of potential online advertising revenue , and – for smaller firms – the technical strain screen scrapers place on low-capacity computer servers .
many complaints are based on alleged breaches of a website 's terms of use , but bellows said the strongest argument , in the us at least , was the threat of an intellectual property lawsuit .
“ people put the information on the internet to be used . our software just helps people find that information and use it better , ” bellows told deutsche welle . “ what we are always worried about , though , is copyright laws .
we never want our users to violate copyright laws . ”

" ryanair is determined to continue its pro-consumer campaign against screen-scraper ticket-tout websites until the last screen scraper stops overcharging unsuspecting consumers , " ryanair spokesman stephen mcnamara said in a statement .
" our strategy of defending consumer rights in irish courts is proving successful and the number of active screen scrapers is rapidly decreasing , ” mcnamara said , adding : “ sadly , unister chose to continue overcharging consumers in breach of ryanair 's rights and left us no alternative but to refer them to the dublin high court . "
battle brewing unister spokesman konstantin korosides told deutsche welle that while management had not yet received official notification of the lawsuit , they were preparing for a legal battle .
“ we think that a german court is responsible , not an irish one , because we are a german online company .
that means jurisdiction has to be here , ” korosides said .
unister argues that screen-scraper software is not illegal and that its websites simply offer customers a service that helps them make a more informed decision when booking a flight .
“ we are an online travel agency , ” korosides said .
“ we charge a small fee for providing our service .
there 's nothing illegal with going to a travel agency , is there ? ”
“ we have 1.6 million visitors coming to one of our travel websites every month .
surely they would stop coming if they felt we were cheating them , ” he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german football star michael ballack is the face of one of unister 's online ad campaigns violation of terms of service ryanair , however , maintains that by reproducing information from its website without permission , unister and other screen scrapers are violating the ryanair website 's terms of service , which prohibit third parties from using its platform for commercial purposes .
the irish airline has intensified its legal campaign against german screen-scraping websites over the past 12 months , with mixed results .
in may , a hamburg court confirmed a 2008 injunction that banned german screen scraper vtours from reselling ryanair tickets because it was doing so in its own name .
in march , however , a frankfurt court blocked ryanair 's attempt to cancel bookings made through unauthorized screen scrapers , ruling that the german price comparison website cheaptickets.de did not break any laws when accessing ryanair 's database , and that the tickets purchased through the site were therefore valid .
since then ryanair has been pursuing screen scrapers through irish courts .
earlier this month , four german screen scrapers bowed to pressure from the airline 's lawyers and signed a binding agreement stating they would stop accessing the airline 's website and reselling its tickets .
legal grey zone ?
e-commerce experts say that depending on the exact application , screen scrapers often operate in a legal grey zone .
“ the law has n't caught up with this technology yet , ” said jason bellows , an it consultant at screen-scraper.com , a us-based company that sells the kind of software unister uses to harvest information from ryanair .
while many companies in the travel and financial sectors are happy about the extra business aggregator websites attract , bellows said he has often complied with large companies requesting that his firm decline assistance to third parties planning unauthorized access to their databases on several occasions .
common reasons for such requests include perceived harm to their brand 's reputation for value , a loss of potential online advertising revenue , and – for smaller firms – the technical strain screen scrapers place on low-capacity computer servers .
many complaints are based on alleged breaches of a website 's terms of use , but bellows said the strongest argument , in the us at least , was the threat of an intellectual property lawsuit .
“ people put the information on the internet to be used . our software just helps people find that information and use it better , ” bellows told deutsche welle . “ what we are always worried about , though , is copyright laws .
we never want our users to violate copyright laws . ”

this marks an acceleration of the airline ’ s war against what it regards as online touts . ryanair lodged proceedings against leipzig-based internet firm unister at the high court in dublin this week .
the airline claims websites operated by unister use " screen-scraping " software to gather information from ryanair 's website without permission and then sell tickets to customers at inflated prices .
screen scraping is the process by which one computer program collects specific data from another .
in this case , unister 's software is constantly extracting information from other airline companies ' websites – rates , travel times , availability – and then neatly packaging and displaying that information on its own website for potential customers to search and compare .
while ryanair says it has no problem cooperating with authorized price comparison websites , it is unhappy that sites operated by unister hit customers with " hidden charges " . when a customer buys a return flight from duesseldorf to london on ryanair 's own website , for example , the final price including payment handling fees might be 93.25 euros .

officials say turnout has been healthy , despite sporadic violence by taliban militants determined to sabotage the ballot . a massive afghan and multinational force of 300,000 was put on full alert thursday to safeguard voting and prevent the taliban from unleashing a threatened onslaught .
two taliban insurgents were killed in a gun battle in kabul as sporadic violence across the country threatened to unsettle voters .
the attack , coming after the taliban said 20 of their fighters had infiltrated the capital , was the worst of several on polling stations and voters .
the taliban have struck repeatedly inside the capital in a bloody countdown to elections that are aimed at putting the country more firmly on the path to democracy eight years after the us-led invasion ousted the militia 's regime .
however , despite the violence in places like kandahar in the south and in the northern provinces of baghlan and takhar , the united nations said there were encouraging signs of high turnout .
" the vast majority of polling stations have been able to open and have received voting materials , " said aleem siddique , spokesman for the un mission in kabul .
" we are seeing queues forming at polling stations in the north , also in the capital , as well as , encouragingly , in the east . "
scores of people queued up at polling stations in the capital and major cities under government control , and some 95 percent of 6,500 polling stations opened on schedule , the independent election commission said .
" the turnout is very good , but we do n't have exact figures , " said deputy chief electoral officer zekria barakzai , predicting that it could reach around 50 percent overall .
seventeen million afghans have registered to elect a president and 420 councilors in 34 provinces across the largely rural , impoverished country .
it is a difficult process in a nation where more than 70 percent of people are illiterate and bound by fierce tribal and religious allegiances .

" i request my dear countrymen to come out and cast their vote to decide their future , " karzai said as he voted in a kabul boys ' school near his heavily fortified palace , dismissing fears of unrest .
however , one opinion poll carried out by a us organization predicted karzai would be forced into a run-off , winning 44 percent of the vote , and his rival abdullah abdullah , who has a northern powerbase and draws on ethnic tajik support , would take 26 percent .
there are around 30 other candidates .
abdullah hailed " a day of change " as he voted alongside his wife and young son amid a throng of journalists and phalanx of security men .
an energetic campaign by the ex-foreign minister has boosted the chance of a run-off , which would take place in around six weeks ' time .
the election is also a test for us president barack obama , who has ordered a massive troop build-up this year as part of a strategy to reverse taliban gains .
obama 's envoy for the region , richard holbrooke , toured polling stations in kabul and said what he 'd seen was " open and honest , " adding : " so far every prediction of disaster turned out to be wrong . "

" of course the real test is election day , " the british general added .
the biggest threats facing troops were suicide bombers , rockets and maybe ambushes , he said .
" the mission , as for all coalition forces , is to be the least visible to show that this is an election organized by the afghans themselves , " said lieutenant colonel stephane chenel , another nato commander .
" if there is a threat , all forces will be able to intervene .
everyone will be deployed and , in an immediate threat , go anywhere at any moment , " the french officer said .
isaf officials said that despite rising taliban violence , less than one percent of polling stations were at risk of attack .
but isaf spokesman brigadier general eric tremblay acknowledged : " despite the best plans in place , there will always be some residual risk . "

officials say turnout has been healthy , despite sporadic violence by taliban militants determined to sabotage the ballot . a massive afghan and multinational force of 300,000 was put on full alert thursday to safeguard voting and prevent the taliban from unleashing a threatened onslaught .
two taliban insurgents were killed in a gun battle in kabul as sporadic violence across the country threatened to unsettle voters .
the attack , coming after the taliban said 20 of their fighters had infiltrated the capital , was the worst of several on polling stations and voters .
the taliban have struck repeatedly inside the capital in a bloody countdown to elections that are aimed at putting the country more firmly on the path to democracy eight years after the us-led invasion ousted the militia 's regime .
however , despite the violence in places like kandahar in the south and in the northern provinces of baghlan and takhar , the united nations said there were encouraging signs of high turnout .

the day saw relatively little violence although concerns remain over a possible low turnout due to threats of taliban attacks . " our assessment is that , in general , these elections went much better than we anticipated , " ettore sequi , the european union 's special representative to afghanistan , told afp .
the roughly 6,200 election centers which were able to accept voters was " an achievement considering the concerns before the election , " he added .
despite dozens of taliban missiles and bombs and the deaths of more than 20 people , many international leaders agreed with sequi 's statement .
german chancellor angela merkel called the election " an important chapter in the democratic development of the country . "
nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen said the election was " a testimony to the determination of the afghan people to build democracy . "
he congratulated the voters for their courage in the face of taliban threats .
" seen from a security point of view , the election has been a success , " he said .
" the most important thing is that the election will be considered credible in the eyes of the afghan people . "
while no official voter turnout figures have been released , there is concern that if a low percentage of the 15 million registered voters showed up to cast their ballots , it would diminish the legitimacy of the election .
taliban attacks close some polls , delay voting as voting continued across the country during the day , taliban militants stormed a town in northern afghanistan , launching a multi-pronged assault that left at least eight of them dead and kept polling stations from opening , officials said .

the day saw relatively little violence although concerns remain over a possible low turnout due to threats of taliban attacks . " our assessment is that , in general , these elections went much better than we anticipated , " ettore sequi , the european union 's special representative to afghanistan , told afp .
the roughly 6,200 election centers which were able to accept voters was " an achievement considering the concerns before the election , " he added .
despite dozens of taliban missiles and bombs and the deaths of more than 20 people , many international leaders agreed with sequi 's statement .
german chancellor angela merkel called the election " an important chapter in the democratic development of the country . "
nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen said the election was " a testimony to the determination of the afghan people to build democracy . "
he congratulated the voters for their courage in the face of taliban threats .
" seen from a security point of view , the election has been a success , " he said .
" the most important thing is that the election will be considered credible in the eyes of the afghan people . "
while no official voter turnout figures have been released , there is concern that if a low percentage of the 15 million registered voters showed up to cast their ballots , it would diminish the legitimacy of the election .
taliban attacks close some polls , delay voting as voting continued across the country during the day , taliban militants stormed a town in northern afghanistan , launching a multi-pronged assault that left at least eight of them dead and kept polling stations from opening , officials said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban attacks disrupted voting in some areas " terrorists attacked from several directions .
fighting has been going on since morning , " provincial police chief mohammad kabir andarabi told reporters in baghlan .
" now , as we speak , the enemy has been pushed back .
we have killed 22 terrorists .
most of their bodies are left on the ground , " he added .
abdul majeed azimi , head of the provincial intelligence agency , confirmed the incident but said the corpses of only eight rebels were found .
the local district police chief and one of his guards were also killed .
a 12-year-old boy was wounded in the clashes , he added .
azimi said polling stations did not open in the small town on the highway between pul-i-khumri , the capital of baghlan province , and kunduz province .
" no elections there .
i do n't think there will be because fighting is ongoing , " he said .

" the recent tragic events at the sayano-shushenskaya hydroelectric plant showed with all clarity how much more we should do to increase reliability of technical constructions on the whole and hydrotechnical ones in particular , " he said .
" technological discipline is very low . "
the official death toll from the catastrophic flood that engulfed russia 's largest hydroelectric station in the country 's khakassia region rose to 17 on thursday after search teams found another three bodies .
russian officials said there was still some hope that some of the 58 people still missing after the aug .
17 accident could be found in air pockets amid the flooded wreckage .
some 100 workers were in the main turbine room early on monday when a massive wave of water flooded in .
officials from the company that owns the hydroelectric dam , rushydro , said many workers would have either drowned or been crushed .
the authorities have yet to give a clear explanation of how the accident occurred , with explanations ranging from a sudden pressure surge to a fault in one of the turbines .
rushydro said a faulty turbine at the plant , commissioned 30 years ago , was the likely cause of the accident .
slim hopes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plant 's second hydroelectric generating unit was destroyed emergencies minister sergei shoigu said around 2,000 rescue workers were working around the clock to clear rubble and drain water in an effort to locate potential survivors .

meanwhile , russian president dmitry medvedev has said steps needed to be taken to shore up power supply to industries affected by monday 's accident .

" the recent tragic events at the sayano-shushenskaya hydroelectric plant showed with all clarity how much more we should do to increase reliability of technical constructions on the whole and hydrotechnical ones in particular , " he said .
" technological discipline is very low . "
the official death toll from the catastrophic flood that engulfed russia 's largest hydroelectric station in the country 's khakassia region rose to 17 on thursday after search teams found another three bodies .
russian officials said there was still some hope that some of the 58 people still missing after the aug .
17 accident could be found in air pockets amid the flooded wreckage .
some 100 workers were in the main turbine room early on monday when a massive wave of water flooded in .
officials from the company that owns the hydroelectric dam , rushydro , said many workers would have either drowned or been crushed .
the authorities have yet to give a clear explanation of how the accident occurred , with explanations ranging from a sudden pressure surge to a fault in one of the turbines .
rushydro said a faulty turbine at the plant , commissioned 30 years ago , was the likely cause of the accident .
slim hopes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plant 's second hydroelectric generating unit was destroyed emergencies minister sergei shoigu said around 2,000 rescue workers were working around the clock to clear rubble and drain water in an effort to locate potential survivors .

" megrahi now faces a sentence imposed by a higher power , " said scottish justice minister kenny macaskill at a news conference on thursday .
" it is terminal , final and irrevocable .
he is going to die . "
shortly afterwards megrahi boarded a libyan jet that had been sent from tripoli to collect him .
relatives of the victims and the united states government were opposed to his release .
on tuesday us secretary of state hillary clinton said that it would be " absolutely wrong " to free al-megrahi , who was responsible for a " horrendous crime . "
his guilt has always been in question .
some are convinced that he was responsible , while others have consistently labeled his conviction a miscarriage of justice .
either way , megrahi is the only one ever to be tried and convicted .
circumstantial evidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : megrahi is on his way back to libya megrahi , a father of five , was born in tripoli , libya in 1952 .
he has a good command of the english language , a skill he picked up when he studied in the us .
he had also visited britain several times .
he ran an international relations think tank in libya called the center for strategic studies , a job that the fbi has claimed provided him with the perfect cover to work as an operative for the libyan intelligence services -lrb- jso -rrb- .
for a time , he was also based in malta as director of security for libyan arab airways -lrb- laa -rrb- , a job that prosecutors said gave him knowledge and access to secure airlines .
the key piece of evidence in his trial was that pieces of clothing that megrahi had bought in malta were found wrapped around the bomb .
a fateful flight on december 22 , 1988 , pan am flight 103 took off from london 's heathrow airport , headed for new york .
on board were 259 passengers .
approximately 38 minutes into the flight , the plane exploded at 31,000 feet over lockerbie , scotland , killing all the passengers as well as 11 people on the ground .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pan am 103 memorial in arlington cemetary it took three years of painstaking investigation , but finally in 1999 , officials indicted two libyans , al-amin khalifa fhimah and abdelbaset ali mohmed al-megrahi , on 270 counts of murder .
by then the two men were home and libyan leader moammar gadhafi refused to hand them over .
thus began years of international pressure on libya .
in 1992 the un security council imposed sanctions on libya over its refusal to hand over the men .
it was not until six years later , in 1998 , that gadhafi finally said that the trial could take place , but only in a neutral country .
the us and britain proposed using scottish law in the netherlands and gadhafi agreed .
after nelson mandela visited gadhafi in 1999 , the men were finally extradited and the trial began at camp zeist in the netherlands .
justice takes time the trial began in 2000 , and from the start both of the accused denied any involvement in the lockerbie bombing .
the proceedings lasted a year and in the end , al-megrahi was sentenced to life in prison while al-amin khalifa fhimah , was found not guilty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al-amin khalifa fhimah was found not guilty al-megrahi immediately launched an appeal and fhimah went home .
in 2002 , a panel of five scottish judges began hearing his appeal which was denied three months later .
the next several years saw more legal wrangling between al-megrahi and the scottish legal system .
in 2007 , the scottish criminal cases review commission recommended that he should be granted a second appeal .
power politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libya 's moammar gadhafi paid compensation in the background of all the legal proceedings was a combination of money , oil and politics .
oil makes up a big part of the libyan economy .
according to the cia factbook , the libyan economy depends almost entirely on revenues from the oil sector , which contribute about 95 percent of export earnings , about one quarter of the gross domestic product , and roughly 60 percent of public sector wages .
in other words , un sanctions hit libya very hard .
libya clearly felt the strain and within the last few years the libyans have renounced nuclear arms and agreed to pay compensation to the families of the lockerbie victims .
former british prime minister tony blair was among the first politicians to become involved in helping british petroleum -lrb- bp -rrb- and shell win exploration acreage in libya .
the release of al-megrahi could ease tensions between britain and libya and open further business opportunities .

" megrahi now faces a sentence imposed by a higher power , " said scottish justice minister kenny macaskill at a news conference on thursday .
" it is terminal , final and irrevocable .
he is going to die . "
shortly afterwards megrahi boarded a libyan jet that had been sent from tripoli to collect him .
relatives of the victims and the united states government were opposed to his release .
on tuesday us secretary of state hillary clinton said that it would be " absolutely wrong " to free al-megrahi , who was responsible for a " horrendous crime . "
his guilt has always been in question .
some are convinced that he was responsible , while others have consistently labeled his conviction a miscarriage of justice .
either way , megrahi is the only one ever to be tried and convicted .
circumstantial evidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : megrahi is on his way back to libya megrahi , a father of five , was born in tripoli , libya in 1952 .
he has a good command of the english language , a skill he picked up when he studied in the us .
he had also visited britain several times .
he ran an international relations think tank in libya called the center for strategic studies , a job that the fbi has claimed provided him with the perfect cover to work as an operative for the libyan intelligence services -lrb- jso -rrb- .
for a time , he was also based in malta as director of security for libyan arab airways -lrb- laa -rrb- , a job that prosecutors said gave him knowledge and access to secure airlines .
the key piece of evidence in his trial was that pieces of clothing that megrahi had bought in malta were found wrapped around the bomb .
a fateful flight on december 22 , 1988 , pan am flight 103 took off from london 's heathrow airport , headed for new york .
on board were 259 passengers .
approximately 38 minutes into the flight , the plane exploded at 31,000 feet over lockerbie , scotland , killing all the passengers as well as 11 people on the ground .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pan am 103 memorial in arlington cemetary it took three years of painstaking investigation , but finally in 1999 , officials indicted two libyans , al-amin khalifa fhimah and abdelbaset ali mohmed al-megrahi , on 270 counts of murder .
by then the two men were home and libyan leader moammar gadhafi refused to hand them over .
thus began years of international pressure on libya .
in 1992 the un security council imposed sanctions on libya over its refusal to hand over the men .
it was not until six years later , in 1998 , that gadhafi finally said that the trial could take place , but only in a neutral country .
the us and britain proposed using scottish law in the netherlands and gadhafi agreed .
after nelson mandela visited gadhafi in 1999 , the men were finally extradited and the trial began at camp zeist in the netherlands .
justice takes time the trial began in 2000 , and from the start both of the accused denied any involvement in the lockerbie bombing .
the proceedings lasted a year and in the end , al-megrahi was sentenced to life in prison while al-amin khalifa fhimah , was found not guilty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al-amin khalifa fhimah was found not guilty al-megrahi immediately launched an appeal and fhimah went home .
in 2002 , a panel of five scottish judges began hearing his appeal which was denied three months later .
the next several years saw more legal wrangling between al-megrahi and the scottish legal system .
in 2007 , the scottish criminal cases review commission recommended that he should be granted a second appeal .
power politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libya 's moammar gadhafi paid compensation in the background of all the legal proceedings was a combination of money , oil and politics .
oil makes up a big part of the libyan economy .
according to the cia factbook , the libyan economy depends almost entirely on revenues from the oil sector , which contribute about 95 percent of export earnings , about one quarter of the gross domestic product , and roughly 60 percent of public sector wages .
in other words , un sanctions hit libya very hard .
libya clearly felt the strain and within the last few years the libyans have renounced nuclear arms and agreed to pay compensation to the families of the lockerbie victims .
former british prime minister tony blair was among the first politicians to become involved in helping british petroleum -lrb- bp -rrb- and shell win exploration acreage in libya .
the release of al-megrahi could ease tensions between britain and libya and open further business opportunities .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european ties -pipe- 20.08.2009 film project looks to open up the german-polish cultural border großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an old east german trailer has been converted to provide a unique cinematic experience the last border controls between germany and poland disappeared in 2007 , but germans and poles still do not know much about each other .
a nomadic film project wants to change that – in the tradition of travelling cinema . a big old bus bumps over the cobblestones of a village road in eastern germany , close to the polish border .
it is pulling the kinomobilny - a blue and white trailer transformed into a cinema-popcorn-bar .
the driver , 30-year-old janosch from berlin , is proud of the kinomobilny .
" this is an ' intercamp 2000 , ' a trailer from the gdr .
back then they had small trailers costing 8,000 east german marks , but we got the version they sold for 40,000 , " janosch said .
" this was the export version , made for the western market .
but they only produced 50 because nobody in the west was really interested in premium trailers from the gdr . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crew of " kinomobilny " are taking their show to several towns along the border janosch is one of the 20-strong cinema crew touring along the german-polish border region this summer .
financed partly by the eu , the crew are zigzagging their way along the border in order to screen short films on both sides of the oder and neisse , the rivers separating germany and poland .
tomek from the kulturalny kolletyw team at the university of gdansk organized the polish side of the tour .
he hopes the kinomobilny will bring people on both sides of the border closer together .
" although the border is open , people stick to their own country .
they do not speak a different language than their own and they do not even go to the other side .
this is really strange to me .
i mean , it is so easy to get to the other side of the border , but people are not really interested , " said tomek .
cycling through terra incognita the project 's equipment travels with some of the crew by bus and trailer .
as there are only four seats available , the rest of the german-polish crew are left to make their way using pedal power .
every day they cycle up to 35 miles -lrb- 56 kilometers -rrb- , passing through nature reserves and sleepy villages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : every day the organizers cycle up to 35 miles none of the team members has been to the border region before .
for 30-year-old miriam from berlin it 's a chance to explore some terra incognita .
" it is so beautiful and peaceful here .
the bike path runs along the oder and neisse rivers and the landscape is really amazing , " said miriam .
" it is interesting to think that there is so much political meaning to such an idyllic area . "
no rest for the cycling cinema crew as soon as they arrive at the village of boxberg in eastern germany , the crew sets up their open-air cinema .
this involves hanging light bulbs , putting up recliners and checking the projector for the evening 's screening .
some of the crew head into the village to hand out flyers to the local inhabitants .
after sunset the first villagers show up .
they seem surprised that an intercultural project like kinomobilny has stopped in their village .
most of the villagers feel the german-polish relationship is best left to politicians and not something to be tackled in their own backyards - even if poland is only a stone 's throw away .
the program consists of seven german and polish short films that focus on cliches and stereotypes .
but they also show a new , refreshing perspective on polish-german relations .
for example , there 's a rabbit looking for the love of his life at the berlin wall , polish hooligans and the perceived madness of german red tape .
each film is screened in its original language with subtitles in german or polish .
bringing poles and germans closer even though only 20 villagers turned up for the screening , the german-polish cinema initiative went down very well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the open-air cinema shows films in their original language " for sure this film program brings us closer to the poles , there are a lot of people especially in eastern germany that do n't have a clue about what is happening in poland , " said one of the visitors , judith .
" i hope a lot of people get to see these films , " added judith 's boyfriend tobias .
thanks to the kinomobilny team , tobias ' wish will be fulfilled .
after boxberg the travelling cinema-come-trailer has eight more stops planned all along the polish-german border .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 20.08.2009 putin criticizes russian " technological discipline " after hydro accident großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the toll from the accident is expected to rise in the wake of an accident at a russian hydroelectric plant that has left at least 17 people dead , prime minister vladimir putin says there is a need for " serious inspections " of all major infrastructure in the country . speaking at a government meeting in moscow on thursday , putin said all " strategic and vitally important " installations in russia needed greater supervision .
" the recent tragic events at the sayano-shushenskaya hydroelectric plant showed with all clarity how much more we should do to increase reliability of technical constructions on the whole and hydrotechnical ones in particular , " he said .
" technological discipline is very low . "
the official death toll from the catastrophic flood that engulfed russia 's largest hydroelectric station in the country 's khakassia region rose to 17 on thursday after search teams found another three bodies .
russian officials said there was still some hope that some of the 58 people still missing after the aug .
17 accident could be found in air pockets amid the flooded wreckage .
some 100 workers were in the main turbine room early on monday when a massive wave of water flooded in .
officials from the company that owns the hydroelectric dam , rushydro , said many workers would have either drowned or been crushed .
the authorities have yet to give a clear explanation of how the accident occurred , with explanations ranging from a sudden pressure surge to a fault in one of the turbines .
rushydro said a faulty turbine at the plant , commissioned 30 years ago , was the likely cause of the accident .
slim hopes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plant 's second hydroelectric generating unit was destroyed emergencies minister sergei shoigu said around 2,000 rescue workers were working around the clock to clear rubble and drain water in an effort to locate potential survivors .
" my job is not to lose hope , " shoigu told government newspaper rossiiskaya gazeta , adding that the final toll would only be clear after two or three more days of searching .
" do n't ask about possible causes .
some people have rushed to express their own opinions .
completely pointless , " shoigu said .
" the -lrb- investigative -rrb- commission has to work everything out .

his poll ratings are the envy of many real-life politicians . what snorts like a warthog rooting for grubs , has hair like a vintage rabbit pelt , and sports an overbite rarely seen outside of the animal kingdom ?
just germany 's latest political sensation : a comedian in the guise of a scruffy small-time journalist named horst schlaemmer , whose fake bid for the german chancellorship has injected some real humor into a boring campaign season .
the undeniably unappealing alter ego of popular german funnyman hape kerkeling is the star of his own feature film , which debuted to throngs of fans in berlin on thursday .
the movie , " isch kandidiere " -lrb- " i 'm running for chancellor ! " -rrb- follows the faux candidate as he looks for support among the common people and german stars like rapper bushido and ex-racing champion michael schumacher .
bushido also contributed schlaemmer 's campaign song .
" first of all , i 'd like to point out that the horst schlaemmer party stands for justice , and of course it stands for freedom , and yes , women 's emancipation - but i 've forgotten the rest of your question , " schlaemmer told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people were taken in by hape kerkeling 's 1991 impersonation of queen beatrix of the netherlands riffing off of the slogan that won barack obama the american presidency , schlaemmer 's campaign catchphrase is " yes weekend . " his trademark look includes an ill-fitting trench coat , glasses that cover what little of his face is n't hidden behind his bushy mustache , and a dirty grey wig .
schlaemmer has gained the kind of media exposure and enthusiasm that more legitimate contenders for the chancellor 's seat can only dream of .
but perhaps that 's to be expected when your campaign promises include state-subsidized tanning and cradle-to-grave income .
two major german television channels aired live coverage of schlaemmer 's first press conference for nearly two hours .
in contrast , those same networks cut away from real-life candidate frank-walter steinmeier as he was explaining how he 'd fulfill a campaign promise of creating 4 million jobs by 2020 .
eighteen percent of the people surveyed by german polling institute forsa said they could imagine voting for schlaemmer 's party if it did in fact exist in real life .
that 's not so much less than the latest poll numbers for the social democratic party , currently in opposition , which garnered just 22 percent of registered voters ' support , according to forsa .
" schlaemmer is an alternative to your usual grey-suited politician in germany , " political scientist gero neugebauer of berlin 's free university told afp .
" i can imagine people are fed up with politics and politicians ... the boring campaign makes schlaemmer more interesting . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 20.08.2009 german finance minister defends hypo real estate bailout großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck went into the hearing with guns blazing the german finance minister has told a bundestag probe that the string of state bailouts worth an excess of 100 billion euros for lender hypo real estate was " appropriate and correct . " the government rescue of the struggling hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- mortgage lender prevented a " global financial meltdown , " according to finance minister peer steinbrueck .
the social democrat , answering questions from a parliamentary enquiry investigating the bailout of hre , described the german government 's actions as " appropriate and correct . "
" we made the right decisions , " steinbrueck said .
" it was n't us politicians who caused this financial crisis , but we were the ones who mastered it . "
hypo real estate needed a series of state bailouts to keep it from going under .
the loans and credit guarantees offered to hre total 102 billion euros -lrb- $ 145 billion -rrb- , with 87 billion coming from the government in berlin and the remainder from other german banks .
" we had to make decisions in real time , contending with enormous time pressures .
and we did n't always have all the relevant information at our disposal . "
steinbrueck also dismissed criticism that his right hand man at the time , state finance secretary joerg asmussen , was unprepared during the negotiations and allowed the banks to pull the wool over his eyes .
" that is absurd and has been disproven , " he said .
" therefore , i 'm not going to even discuss it . "
steinbrueck said that asmussen had n't negotiated poorly , but rather he 'd fought " tooth and nail - right up to the pain barrier . "
triggered by lehman collapse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors , who were later escorted out of the hearing , disagree with steinbrueck when asked about the tipping point for hypo real estate , steinbrueck pointed to the collapse of us lender lehman brothers in september 2008 , dismissing the political opposition 's claims that the bank was already headed for trouble much earlier in the year .
he said that the lehmann brothers bankruptcy put a dramatic stop to inter-bank lending , thus crippling hypo real estate .
hre and its irish subsidiary depfa had been relying on loans from other lenders in order to keep supplying mortgages for months before lehmann brothers went under .
" between september 15 and october 5 the financial world stood millimeters away from the cliff edge , " steinbrueck said .
the german finance minister also questioned the us decision to let lehmann brothers fall , describing it as a test with disastrous consequences .
after the bankruptcy , leading industrial nations committed not to let similar large financial institutions go bankrupt .
the german government decided that hre - with a value of around 400 billion euros - qualified as an irreplaceable money lender. msh / ap / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the top ten list features japanese cars in the first six places .
" as a member of the green party i want people to buy modern cars with the lowest co2 emissions , " she said , suggesting that the vcd list was a good reference point for these cars .
she expressed regret that the highest-placed german car came in at number seven – the two-seater smart car – and added that german manufacturers " should act as quickly as possible to provide different cars and to secure jobs . "
kuenast found herself in similar trouble two years ago when she called on people to buy the toyota prius hybrid car for its low environmental impact in comparison to other cars .
her statement was seen as a vote of no-confidence in the german car industry .
she also said that she was annoyed with the executive committees at german auto manufacturers which continued to fight at a european level to keep co2 emissions for cars at the highest level possible .
" if the germans are too stupid to build modern cars , then one must recommend that people should buy a toyota prius , " she said. nda / dpa / ap editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the day saw relatively little violence although concerns remain over a possible low turnout due to threats of taliban attacks . " our assessment is that , in general , these elections went much better than we anticipated , " ettore sequi , the european union 's special representative to afghanistan , told afp .
the roughly 6,200 election centers which were able to accept voters was " an achievement considering the concerns before the election , " he added .
despite dozens of taliban missiles and bombs and the deaths of more than 20 people , many international leaders agreed with sequi 's statement .
german chancellor angela merkel called the election " an important chapter in the democratic development of the country . "
nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen said the election was " a testimony to the determination of the afghan people to build democracy . "
he congratulated the voters for their courage in the face of taliban threats .
" seen from a security point of view , the election has been a success , " he said .
" the most important thing is that the election will be considered credible in the eyes of the afghan people . "
while no official voter turnout figures have been released , there is concern that if a low percentage of the 15 million registered voters showed up to cast their ballots , it would diminish the legitimacy of the election .
taliban attacks close some polls , delay voting as voting continued across the country during the day , taliban militants stormed a town in northern afghanistan , launching a multi-pronged assault that left at least eight of them dead and kept polling stations from opening , officials said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban attacks disrupted voting in some areas " terrorists attacked from several directions .
fighting has been going on since morning , " provincial police chief mohammad kabir andarabi told reporters in baghlan .
" now , as we speak , the enemy has been pushed back .
we have killed 22 terrorists .
most of their bodies are left on the ground , " he added .
abdul majeed azimi , head of the provincial intelligence agency , confirmed the incident but said the corpses of only eight rebels were found .
the local district police chief and one of his guards were also killed .
a 12-year-old boy was wounded in the clashes , he added .
azimi said polling stations did not open in the small town on the highway between pul-i-khumri , the capital of baghlan province , and kunduz province .
" no elections there .
i do n't think there will be because fighting is ongoing , " he said .
residents confirmed to local media that no polling stations were open .
eu calls on afghans to resist taliban pressure the eu had called on the afghan people to defy the taliban and cast their ballots , as a team of about 100 eu observers kept a watchful eye on the voting process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu and nato commended afghans on their election " we encourage the afghan people to go out and vote on this very important day , which sets the path towards democracy for the afghan nation and its people , " european commission spokesman john clancy said in brussels . clancy said no eu monitors had been injured in any attacks . the eu has the largest international observer mission in afghanistan . european election mission to monitor results headed by philippe morillon , a former french general and now a member of the european parliament , the mission has been monitoring the election campaign and is now focusing on polling , counting and tallying the results . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : morillon 's team will begin monitoring the election results it plans to condemn any serious breach of electoral rules and procedures , with a preliminary statement from morillon expected on saturday . so far , its biggest worry has been with proxy voting . concerns have been fuelled by a suspiciously high rate of registration for female voters in traditionally conservative parts of the country .
despite being escorted by afghan and nato forces , the monitors have not been deployed throughout the country owing to the precarious security situation . the eu is a major donor to afghanistan .
the bloc 's brussels-based executive arm , the european commission , has provided the country with 1.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 2 billion -rrb- in aid since 2002 .

in addition , four eu countries have privately told the administration that they are committed to resettling detainees , and five other eu nations are considering taking some , according to officials in us president barack obama 's administration , who spoke to the newspaper on the condition of anonymity .
there are still 229 prisoners at the camp , which was opened in january 2002 by then president george w. bush to hold " enemy combatants " in the us " war on terror . "
obama has ordered the camp to be closed by january 22 , 2010 .
to meet that goal , the administration has appointed daniel fried , a longtime diplomat with deep ties to eastern europe and parts of the former soviet union , to lead negotiations with other countries .
some 80 prisoners are ready for release .
the post said that if resettling agreements could be made , a reduced detainee population would likely ease the politically charged debate on moving remaining prisoners to a facility on us soil .
of the detainees cleared for release so far , eleven have been transferred home or to third countries , including bermuda , which accepted four chinese uighurs .
the pacific island of palau has agreed to resettle the 13 remaining uighur detainees , and more than half of them are willing to go or are seriously considering the offer .
us looking towards eastern europe in addition , the administration has held positive talks with australia and georgia , and it has formally approached or is planning to hold talks with countries in south america , the persian gulf , the balkans and the former soviet union , the post wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama has pledged to close the camp by 2010 congress has blocked the white house from resettling any detainees in the united states , a move that us and some european officials feared would lead other countries , particularly in the eu , to refuse to help close the military prison .
but the issue has proved relatively unproblematic , officials said .
" obama has a lot of political capital .
countries want to do something for him , and that allows us to say , ' this is it , this is what we want you to do , " ' said a senior administration official quoted in the report .
" this is going a lot better than we might have thought . "
one senior administration official said negotiations in eastern europe will intensify once detainees arrive in larger eu countries , such as italy and spain .
the post also reported that us and european officials believe stalled negotiations with berlin can be rekindled after germany holds national parliamentary elections next month .
and there is some expectation that france , which has taken one detainee , may accept more. nda / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

former foreign minister abdullah abdullah , former finance minister ashraf ghani and former planning minister ramazan bashardost are the main challengers to karzai .
in the past , all three have served in his government .
voters are also electing 420 provincial council members spread out over the country 's 34 provinces .
death threats taliban militants vowed to disrupt the vote and have threatened to slit the throats and chop off fingers of anyone who votes on thursday .
afghan and nato military officials offered assurances that more than 100,000 international troops and around 200,000 afghan forces were on high alert and were prepared to neutralize any attack that might be mounted by the taliban .
in kabul , shops and business were closed and round-the-clock squads of extra police checked the few cars on the roads .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai hopes to stay on in office president hamid karzai called on afghans to defy taliban threats and vote in the election , which could prove the toughest test yet of his own mandate and his nation 's fragile democracy .
" enemies will do their best , but it wo n't help , " he told reporters late on wednesday .
global support more than 270,000 election observers , including 2,000 from abroad , are overseeing the balloting at more than 6,500 polling centres , while the commission said it was unable to open voting stations in nine districts that remain outside government control .
polling stations opened at 9:30 am local time -lrb- 0500 utc -rrb- and voting is to continue until 4 pm -lrb- 1130 gmt -rrb- .
results are not expected until about 48 hours after the polls are closed , according to the independent election commission .
while karzai leads in recent opinion polls , he is not expected to receive more than 50 percent to win the elections outright .
if no candidate posts a first-round majority , a run-off would be held around first week of october. mrh / dpa / afp editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche welle 's peter philipp looks at who stands to profit from the destabilization of afghanistan . in afghanistan 's eventful history , it was largely the interests of large foreign powers that prevented peace in the country at the foothills of the hindukush mountains . the foreign powers included the british , who pursued their own interests there , the russians and finally the americans - together with allies pakistan and saudi arabia . caught between powerful foreign interests the issues at stake were securing british supply lanes to india , ensuring russian access to the indian ocean , and finally repelling and beating back the soviet union with the help of the three-way alliance of washington , islamabad and riyadh . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche welle 's peter philipp those interests never focused on bolstering a strong afghan state , rather they were about installing an accommodating central government in kabul and maintaining a system of loyal regional chieftains in the country .
it was a system that had worked for centuries in afghanistan .
or sometimes it did n't . an afghan proverb speaks of a " a king under every tree . "
the king - and that included the presidents of the country - were merely seen as mayors of the capital kabul .
and their power was only recognized in the provinces if they sealed " deals " with the local rulers and gave them a free hand to run their own affairs . drugs trade flourishing that 's exactly what current president hamid karzai is doing .
once celebrated as the savior of afghanistan by the us and europe , karzai has long left the path of democracy and the rule of law . he has allied himself with regional " warlords " who are meant to ensure karzai power and influence in the provinces and who in return can thwart any attempt at normalization .
corruption is a daily occurrence but what 's worse is that the growing of poppy has reached record volumes in recent years , making afghanistan a notorious leading world exporter of drugs . ordinary farmers do n't earn a lot with their poppy fields but it 's still much more than what they would make with alternative crops such as wheat .
the " warlords " have long-turned into powerful " drug bosses " who rake in huge profits to finance their weapons and who are thus difficult to pressurize . these druglords are flexible and ready to hammer out an alliance with just about anybody .
the main thing is that their powerful positions are untouched . they also work together with the taliban , who are against the opium trade on religious and ideological grounds , but have long used this lucrative economic and agricultural sector for their own purposes . stabilizing afghanistan foreign nations - from afghanistan 's neighbors to europe and the us - are today more interested in calming the situation and stabilizing afghanistan . those interested in the opposite are primarily the regional rulers and the drug bosses who do n't want to give up their power and influence .
to curb their power , more pressure needs to be exerted on the central government and the president , the taliban needs to be defeated and ordinary afghans need to be given new opportunities to earn money . but none of that has happened so far .
still , about 50 drug dealers are included in the 367 names on an exhaustive wanted-persons list compiled by the us in afghanistan .
they are accused of cooperating with the taliban . but those who work together with the central government in kabul are n't included in any list .
this despite the fact that they pose a similar obstacle to normalization in afghanistan . peter philipp is deutsche welle 's an expert on the middle east . -lrb- sp -rrb- editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

advertisement rebecca turner and shanti andrews hearing the verdict in court two british law graduates who admitted an attempted insurance fraud in brazil have been sentenced to community service and fined .
rebecca turner , of berks , and shanti andrews , of sussex , told a court they were robbed but exaggerated the theft .
they told police that goods worth £ 1,000 were stolen from them during a bus journey in brazil .
the women , both 23 , may have to stay in brazil for at least eight months , unless an appeal succeeds .
i think the appeal will have a great chance of success britons ' defence lawyer the bbc 's gary duffy in rio de janeiro said the two women listened anxiously as the sentence was read to them via a translator , explaining that a 14-month jail term had been converted to community service and a fine reported to total $ 6,400 -lrb- £ 3,900 -rrb- .
our correspondent said they showed " a mixture of relief and dismay - relief that they would n't go to prison , but dismay that they will have to stay and probably launch an appeal " .
the women 's lawyer told bbc news : " i prepared them for a prison sentence , i prepared them for the worst , so i think they are relieved . "
a jail term could have been from one to five years .
the judge said he had treated the women no differently from brazilian defendants and that the sentence would serve as a warning to others considering the same insurance scam .
our correspondent said the women had already spent several days in an overcrowded jail in rio de janeiro - an experience they would be very relieved not to have to repeat .
' completely wrong ' their lawyer said an appeal - to convert the sentence to a larger fine or allow them to serve the punishment in the uk - was likely to start as soon as next week .
" i think the sentence is completely wrong .
so i think the appeal will have a great chance of success and the sentence will be modified , " he said .
he added that he may try to apply to the judge for the women to return to england before their appeal is decided .
miss turner , from woolton hill near newbury , and miss andrews of frant near tunbridge wells , were due to return to england after a nine-month trip around the world .
however they were arrested after officers from a specialist tourist support unit apparently became suspicious that they had waited several days before reporting the theft .
police allegedly uncovered some of the items reported stolen in their rio hostel room .
miss andrews and miss turner were on bail until their trial .

advertisement rebecca turner and shanti andrews hearing the verdict in court two british law graduates who admitted an attempted insurance fraud in brazil have been sentenced to community service and fined .
rebecca turner , of berks , and shanti andrews , of sussex , told a court they were robbed but exaggerated the theft .
they told police that goods worth £ 1,000 were stolen from them during a bus journey in brazil .
the women , both 23 , may have to stay in brazil for at least eight months , unless an appeal succeeds .
i think the appeal will have a great chance of success britons ' defence lawyer the bbc 's gary duffy in rio de janeiro said the two women listened anxiously as the sentence was read to them via a translator , explaining that a 14-month jail term had been converted to community service and a fine reported to total $ 6,400 -lrb- £ 3,900 -rrb- .
our correspondent said they showed " a mixture of relief and dismay - relief that they would n't go to prison , but dismay that they will have to stay and probably launch an appeal " .
the women 's lawyer told bbc news : " i prepared them for a prison sentence , i prepared them for the worst , so i think they are relieved . "
a jail term could have been from one to five years .
the judge said he had treated the women no differently from brazilian defendants and that the sentence would serve as a warning to others considering the same insurance scam .
our correspondent said the women had already spent several days in an overcrowded jail in rio de janeiro - an experience they would be very relieved not to have to repeat .
' completely wrong ' their lawyer said an appeal - to convert the sentence to a larger fine or allow them to serve the punishment in the uk - was likely to start as soon as next week .
" i think the sentence is completely wrong .
so i think the appeal will have a great chance of success and the sentence will be modified , " he said .
he added that he may try to apply to the judge for the women to return to england before their appeal is decided .
miss turner , from woolton hill near newbury , and miss andrews of frant near tunbridge wells , were due to return to england after a nine-month trip around the world .
however they were arrested after officers from a specialist tourist support unit apparently became suspicious that they had waited several days before reporting the theft .
police allegedly uncovered some of the items reported stolen in their rio hostel room .
miss andrews and miss turner were on bail until their trial .

since becoming the scottish government 's justice secretary , following the scottish national party 's 2007 election victory , the edinburgh-born solicitor has never had his work to seek .
dealing with crowded jails , prisoners on the run and police recruitment is one thing - but mr macaskill has now been catapulted onto the world stage as the man charged with the decision over the future of the only man ever convicted of the lockerbie bombing - the uk 's worst terrorist atrocity .
throughout his political career , he has been a forceful , sometimes controversial , speaker .
his headline-grabbing speeches as an opposition politician , on issues from airport landing charges to gun control , continued into his tenure as scotland 's justice secretary .
this made mr macaskill 's decision to retreat virtually into private to decide whether abdelbaset ali mohmed al megrahi should die in prison or return home to his native libya on compassionate early release all the more uncharacteristic .
born in 1958 , mr macaskill served as a lothian list msp until 2007 , when he won the labour-held edinburgh east and musselburgh seat .
legal threat his love for the scottish football team saw him held in custody for the duration of a scotland v england match at wembley in 1999 , which he dismissed as a " simple misunderstanding " after being neither cautioned nor charged .
traditionally considered a fundamentalist on the left of the snp , which criticised alex salmond 's " gradualist " approach to independence , he took care to avoid being tagged a dissident by supporting the leader at critical moments .
most notably , he stood in as the party 's interim treasurer after post-holder ian blackford was suspended in 2000 .
when the international banker threatened to sue mr salmond after he successfully moved a " no confidence " motion , it was mr macaskill who helped to defuse the situation by writing to party members .
two years later , veteran margo macdonald - then still a nationalist msp - accused mr macaskill and his supporters of plotting to have her ousted from parliament after he took her former ranking on the lothian list while she dropped to fifth , cutting her chances of re-election .
as snp transport spokesman , mr macaskill , a former deputy leadership contender , flew headlong into the issue of airport landing charges .
he attacked inverness airport - operated by the state-owned body hial - claiming it had the highest landing charges in europe .
he also backed ryanair , which had criticised management inflexibility at inverness over discounts on the fees .
this was during a failed attempt by the budget airline to operate from the highland capital . "
mr macaskill was branded ' anti-english ' after he backed germany 's bid to host the 2006 football world cup , ahead of england " on becoming justice spokesman , mr macaskill lobbied hard for holyrood to be handed powers on firearms in the wake of the death of two-year-old andrew morton , shot in glasgow by airgun-wielding criminal mark bonini .
he called for shops in scotland selling the weapons to be licensed but his argument that scotland 's distinct air weapon problem had to be addressed separately was dismissed by the labour-led holyrood government .
taking the issue on as justice secretary , he came up against a further brick wall when uk home secretary jacqui smith snubbed an invitation to co-host a firearms summit with him - leading mr macaskill to brand her " complacent " .
in 2004 , he focussed his footballing passion on the crisis surrounding the spl .
with livingston , motherwell and dundee teams in administration , he said major reforms were needed to help the sport while supporting first minister jack mcconnell 's reluctance to bail out troubled clubs with taxpayers ' money .
that same sporting passion led labour to brand mr macaskill " anti-english " , after he backed germany 's bid to host the 2006 football world cup , ahead of england .
the justice secretary had form in this area - long before becoming an msp , mr macaskill once referred to the england football team as " the great satan " during an snp conference .
following the 2007 election mr macaskill took charge of justice , immediately finding the conservatives , with their hard-line policies in the area , a thorn in his side .
tory msp bill aitken , convener of holyrood 's justice committee , oversaw a critical report on police recruitment - which the new government agreed to boost in a budget concession .
mr aitken 's committee also challenged plans to extend electronic tagging , to cope with scotland 's record prison population .
despite announcing a new north east super-prison to replace aberdeen and peterhead , mr macaskill embarked on a strategy to drive down re-offending rates through the use of community sentences as an alternative to short jail terms .
the minister was later criticised after describing life in scotland 's jails as " a bit of a skoosh " .
in his drive to tackle scotland 's record of alcohol-fuelled violence , he decided to raise licensing fees and laid out plans to outlaw cut-price and free alcohol offers in shops .
final decision the tactics went down badly with traders - but mr macaskill stood firm , saying it was time to " put communities before profit margins " .
elsewhere , mr macaskill announced his intention to overturn a house of lords ruling preventing workers suing employers over the asbestos-related condition pleural plaques .
and , in one of scotland 's most notorious cases in recent years , he apologised to a schoolgirl raped by robert foye , who was on the run from castle huntly open prison near dundee , while taking steps to ensure such an incident never happened again .
but , whatever mr macaskill has said and done in the past , his role as a key figure in the lockerbie case promoted him to take a different approach .
the minister 's decision to visit megrahi in prison on 5 august - criticised by some - seemed to have demonstrated a bit of the old macaskill flair .
the justice secretary later said he was duty-bound to meet megrahi as the prisoner made his case .
at the same time , mr macaskill chose to work away on his final decision - taking soundings from all sides .
this included british and american relatives and the libyan government as well as us secretary of state hillary clinton - who told him directly of america 's concern at the prospect of megrahi returning to libya .

mr macaskill was branded ' anti-english ' after he backed germany 's bid to host the 2006 football world cup , ahead of england on becoming justice spokesman , mr macaskill lobbied hard for holyrood to be handed powers on firearms in the wake of the death of two-year-old andrew morton , shot in glasgow by airgun-wielding criminal mark bonini .
he called for shops in scotland selling the weapons to be licensed but his argument that scotland 's distinct air weapon problem had to be addressed separately was dismissed by the labour-led holyrood government .
taking the issue on as justice secretary , he came up against a further brick wall when uk home secretary jacqui smith snubbed an invitation to co-host a firearms summit with him - leading mr macaskill to brand her " complacent " .
in 2004 , he focussed his footballing passion on the crisis surrounding the spl .
with livingston , motherwell and dundee teams in administration , he said major reforms were needed to help the sport while supporting first minister jack mcconnell 's reluctance to bail out troubled clubs with taxpayers ' money .
that same sporting passion led labour to brand mr macaskill " anti-english " , after he backed germany 's bid to host the 2006 football world cup , ahead of england .
the justice secretary had form in this area - long before becoming an msp , mr macaskill once referred to the england football team as " the great satan " during an snp conference .
following the 2007 election mr macaskill took charge of justice , immediately finding the conservatives , with their hard-line policies in the area , a thorn in his side .
mr macaskill has backed the use of non-custodial sentences tory msp bill aitken , convener of holyrood 's justice committee , oversaw a critical report on police recruitment - which the new government agreed to boost in a budget concession .
mr aitken 's committee also challenged plans to extend electronic tagging , to cope with scotland 's record prison population .
despite announcing a new north east super-prison to replace aberdeen and peterhead , mr macaskill embarked on a strategy to drive down re-offending rates through the use of community sentences as an alternative to short jail terms .
the minister was later criticised after describing life in scotland 's jails as " a bit of a skoosh " .
in his drive to tackle scotland 's record of alcohol-fuelled violence , he decided to raise licensing fees and laid out plans to outlaw cut-price and free alcohol offers in shops .
final decision the tactics went down badly with traders - but mr macaskill stood firm , saying it was time to " put communities before profit margins " .
elsewhere , mr macaskill announced his intention to overturn a house of lords ruling preventing workers suing employers over the asbestos-related condition pleural plaques .
and , in one of scotland 's most notorious cases in recent years , he apologised to a schoolgirl raped by robert foye , who was on the run from castle huntly open prison near dundee , while taking steps to ensure such an incident never happened again .
but , whatever mr macaskill has said and done in the past , his role as a key figure in the lockerbie case promoted him to take a different approach .
the minister 's decision to visit megrahi in prison on 5 august - criticised by some - seemed to have demonstrated a bit of the old macaskill flair .
the justice secretary later said he was duty-bound to meet megrahi as the prisoner made his case .
at the same time , mr macaskill chose to work away on his final decision - taking soundings from all sides .
this included british and american relatives and the libyan government as well as us secretary of state hillary clinton - who told him directly of america 's concern at the prospect of megrahi returning to libya .

the manchester sound shot to prominence , eurodance infiltrated the country 's charts , and huge rave parties prompted shock headlines .
then and now : big fun 's phil creswick enlarge image music producing trio stock , aitken and waterman had captured the teen market with their brand of perky pop tunes and fresh-faced acts including kylie minogue and rick astley .
their landmark year was 1989 , with seven chart-topping singles and jason donovan 's ten good reasons becoming the best-selling album .
one of the stable 's acts , big fun , was a three-piece boy group preceding the likes of take that , who had hits including a cover of the jackson five 's blame it on the boogie .
as part of a series on 1989 's musical memories , former band member phil creswick recalls what it was like to be a teen idol .
we were previously in a band called seventh avenue and clinched a record deal with another label and had to change our name to big fun .
as seventh avenue , for three years we 'd toured every awful working men 's club in england , doing gigs for £ 50 a night and just trying to make ends meet .
we were an absolute overnight sensation , it was incredible .
suddenly we were doing top of the pops with liza minnelli and the pet shop boys and black box .
we also did the pwl tour -lsb- stock , aitken and waterman 's record label -rsb- .

big fun were known for their dance routines and co-ordinated outfits my mum ran our fan club , which was getting 1,000 letters a day and could n't cope with it !
there was a pwl pecking order , but there was never any bitchiness on the tour and we had so much fun doing it .
the scariest moment for me was when we did a show in leicester square .
when we came outside the car was surrounded by 2,000 girls and they were rocking the car and we could n't move .
the second time was in spain where we had three top 10 singles at once .
we were at a radio station and thousands of female fans turned up - we needed a police escort to get out .
it made me think ' this is crazy , we 're just normal guys and suddenly we 're big pop stars ! '
i do n't think there was anything unusual about what happened in 1989 .
stock , aitken and waterman simply got it right .
but the songs had the same intro and we often thought we were hearing our own song for the first time and it turned out to be kylie 's !
for a long time afterwards i was really embarrassed because we were voted the world 's worst band in one poll , but i 've achieved so much and am really proud of that .
what happened next big fun achieved another trio of uk hit singles after 1989 before they were dropped from their record label .
creswick and bandmate mark gillespie returned as a duo in 1994 - big fun ii - scoring a us dance chart success with a track called stomp .

the manchester sound shot to prominence , eurodance infiltrated the country 's charts , and huge rave parties prompted shock headlines .
then and now : big fun 's phil creswick enlarge image music producing trio stock , aitken and waterman had captured the teen market with their brand of perky pop tunes and fresh-faced acts including kylie minogue and rick astley .
their landmark year was 1989 , with seven chart-topping singles and jason donovan 's ten good reasons becoming the best-selling album .
one of the stable 's acts , big fun , was a three-piece boy group preceding the likes of take that , who had hits including a cover of the jackson five 's blame it on the boogie .
as part of a series on 1989 's musical memories , former band member phil creswick recalls what it was like to be a teen idol .
we were previously in a band called seventh avenue and clinched a record deal with another label and had to change our name to big fun .
as seventh avenue , for three years we 'd toured every awful working men 's club in england , doing gigs for £ 50 a night and just trying to make ends meet .
we were an absolute overnight sensation , it was incredible .
suddenly we were doing top of the pops with liza minnelli and the pet shop boys and black box .
we also did the pwl tour -lsb- stock , aitken and waterman 's record label -rsb- .
there was us , sinitta , sonia , kylie and jason donovan .
at the very first gig in nottingham we were put on second , and because the female fans went so crazy , they put us on second to last at the next concert , before jason .
big fun were known for their dance routines and co-ordinated outfits my mum ran our fan club , which was getting 1,000 letters a day and could n't cope with it !
there was a pwl pecking order , but there was never any bitchiness on the tour and we had so much fun doing it .
the scariest moment for me was when we did a show in leicester square .
when we came outside the car was surrounded by 2,000 girls and they were rocking the car and we could n't move .
the second time was in spain where we had three top 10 singles at once .
we were at a radio station and thousands of female fans turned up - we needed a police escort to get out .
it made me think ' this is crazy , we 're just normal guys and suddenly we 're big pop stars ! '
i do n't think there was anything unusual about what happened in 1989 .
stock , aitken and waterman simply got it right .
but the songs had the same intro and we often thought we were hearing our own song for the first time and it turned out to be kylie 's !
for a long time afterwards i was really embarrassed because we were voted the world 's worst band in one poll , but i 've achieved so much and am really proud of that .
what happened next big fun achieved another trio of uk hit singles after 1989 before they were dropped from their record label .
creswick and bandmate mark gillespie returned as a duo in 1994 - big fun ii - scoring a us dance chart success with a track called stomp .
phil creswick -lrb- top right -rrb- went from big fun to family fantastic creswick has been writing and producing with vince clarke from erasure and yazoo for retro disco act family fantastic .
they are about to embark on their third album and will be performing at manchester pride later this month .
creswick also runs an interior design business .
former big fun bandmate gillespie renovates listed properties , while jason john works in music management and has looked after geri halliwell and blue .
stock , aitken and waterman 's rich vein of success began to dwindle after 1989 , with only one more kylie chart-topper - tears on my pillow - the following year .
the threesome 's partnership ended in 1993 .
