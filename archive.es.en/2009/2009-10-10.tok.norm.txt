but even as international dignitaries gathered to observe the signing , the armenian representatives unexpectedly demanded a review of the closing statement 's wording .
us secretary of state hillary clinton finally managed to bring the parties together by arranging a compromise that led to no statement being read at the end of the signing ceremony .
so , in the end , both davutoglu and nalbandian signed the accord and shook hands to applause from onlookers . the european union quickly welcomed the agreement .
" the european commission warmly welcomes the signature by the armenian and turkish foreign ministers ... of the protocols on establishing diplomatic relations and developing bilateral relations , including the opening of the common border , " said a statement from the eu commission .
the statement further congratulated both parties on their efforts .
" the commission considers it a courageous and far-sighted step forward towards peace and stability in the south caucasus region and a truly historic decision showing readiness to compromise on both sides . "
the signing of the protocols comes after a year of negotiations mediated by the swiss , and although it is a welcome step forward , it must now be ratified by both the turkish and armenian parliaments to take effect .
there is considerable resistance to the protocols in both parliaments , however , so it remains unclear when final ratification will occur .
agreement not popular bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many armenians oppose the accords because of ottoman crimes in wwi one day before the protocols were signed , 10,000 people demonstrated in the armenian capital , yerevan , to protest the historic event .
protests were not limited to armenia .
in beirut , thousands of lebanese-armenians marched against the plans to establish diplomatic ties between ankara and yerevan at a gathering outside the turkish embassy , as well as the armenian patriarchate near beirut .
one of the most difficult issues remaining unresolved between turks and armenians is the matter of armenian assertions that turkey carried out genocide in the early 20th century .
in 1915 , armenians claim that ottoman turks systematically killed nearly 1.5 million armenians .
yerevan has campaigned for years to have the deaths recognized internationally as genocide .
turkey has rejected the claims .
now , as part of the new protocols , turkey and armenia have agreed to form an historical commission to look into the events that occurred during world war i. there is also serious contention between the two nations over the issue of nagorno-karabakh , which broke away from armenia in 1993 .
when armenia then invaded the breakaway azerbaijiani territory , turkey shut its borders with armenia , causing extreme economic hardship for the landlocked country. av / dpa / reuters / afp editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

mesut oezil made a brilliant pass which drew russian goalkeeper igor akenfeyev off his line leaving an empty net which klose capitalized on .
the win means germany have qualified for the 2010 world cup in south africa .
the team now has 25 points , four ahead of russia , with one match remaining to be played in group four .
after the match , germany coach joachim loew was satisfied with his team 's performance .
" i was convinced the whole week we would be very concentrated .
i felt everyone had the will to win here and not to play for a draw , " said loew , and added , " of course i have to say , too , that we also had a bit of luck in some situations . "
the game started slowly with each side sizing up the other .
loew had put together a defensive-minded line-up by giving a first cap to hamburg defender jerome boateng , lining up five midfielders and leaving klose on his own up front .
klose scores the winning goal andrei arshavin gave russia the best chance it had in the first half when he slipped away from boateng in midfield , maneuvered around simon rolfes and then found vladimir bystrov , who failed to score when his weak kick was saved by germany goalkeeper rene adler .
only five minutes later , klose scored .
bildunterschrift : germany 's players celebrate after scoring against russia during their world cup group 4 qualifying soccer match in moscow russia stepped up the pressure within three minutes when arshavin had two fierce shots on goal , but both were saved by adler .
bystrov also got close to scoring with an amazing overhead kick .
not to be outdone , germany came back right away with a long-range kick from oezil which bounced off the top bar .
now , russia started to threaten with every attack and wasted another great opportunity when yuriy zhirkov broke into the goal area but found no one to pass to him .
when russia led another attack down the left , boateng brought bystrov down in the 69th minute which led to a second yellow card from swiss referee massimo busacca .
the german squad had to spend the last 20 minutes playing one man short .
german goalkeeper adler was the man of the evening it was a busy night for german keeper adler who then again saved a goal on a shot by pavlyuchenko by parrying it wide of the near post after arshavin sent the tottenham striker clear on the right .
an appeal for a late penalty was turned down when arne friedrich , in as a substitute , brought down bystrov .
with the win over russia , germany is guaranteed a spot in the 2010 world cup in south africa and thus the last group match against finland in hamburg on october 14 is now academic .
russia plays azerbaijan in baku , next .
the biggest question of the night was how germany would perform on the artificial turf of luzhniki stadium .
no german national team had ever played on artificial turf before .
that question has now been answered. av / dpa / reuters editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 10.10.2009 czech president demands more changes to lisbon treaty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech republic is now the only country that has n't ratified the lisbon treaty czech president vaclav klaus has thrown another wrench into the lisbon treaty ratification process , this time seeking an exemption to prevent germans expelled during world war ii from using it to reclaim property . klaus wants the czech republic to be exempt from the charter of fundamental rights , which he believes would expose the country to restitution claims from ethnic germans expelled from what was then czechoslovakia in the aftermath of the war . he argues that the charter would let claimants circumvent national courts and take their case to the european court of justice .
this is klaus ' latest objection , but not his first .
a staunch euroskeptic , he opposes the treaty as a matter of principle , believing it yields too much sovereignty to the international bloc .
earlier in the week , he had said he could not sign the treaty until the czech courts reviewed its constitutionality .
poland and britain have secured exemptions and the czech republic would not be the first eu country to seek such an exemption .
poland , whose president lech kaczynski signed the treaty on saturday , negotiated an opt-out for such property claims and secured guarantees that the charter would not force them to allow gay marriage .
britain was assured that the treaty would not supercede their national judicial system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 3 million ethnic germans were forced to leave the former czechoslovakia after the war " before ratification , the czech republic must , additionally at least , negotiate a similar exemption , " said klaus .
" i believe that this exemption can be resolved quickly . "
but because all the other eu countries have ratified the treaty , winning such an exemption for the czech republic would theoretically require its renegotiation .
that duty would fall on the shoulders of the czech government , led by prime minister jan fischer .
fischer said previous reviews of the treaty judged that claims like those feared by klaus would be unlikely .
but he said his interim cabinet would nonetheless discuss the issue monday and that he still hoped the treaty could be ratified before the year 's end .
renegotiation could be avoided if eu leaders pass an official declaration that would not be part of the treaty .
french foreign minister bernard kouchner has outright rejected the idea of a change to the treaty itself .
intentional delays ?
some are worried that klaus ' objections are merely stalling tactics , meant to allow british conservative leader david cameron to hold a promised referendum if his party wins an expected general election next year .
" if i were the eu member states , i would n't really be minded to give klaus what he wants .
he has expressed nothing but hostility towards this thing and he suddenly says he 'll do it ' if , " ' center for european policy studies researcher hugo brady told reuters. svs / reuters / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

us secretary of state hillary clinton finally managed to bring the parties together by arranging a compromise that led to no statement being read at the end of the signing ceremony .
so , in the end , both davutoglu and nalbandian signed the accord and shook hands to applause from onlookers . the european union quickly welcomed the agreement .
" the european commission warmly welcomes the signature by the armenian and turkish foreign ministers ... of the protocols on establishing diplomatic relations and developing bilateral relations , including the opening of the common border , " said a statement from the eu commission .
the statement further congratulated both parties on their efforts .
" the commission considers it a courageous and far-sighted step forward towards peace and stability in the south caucasus region and a truly historic decision showing readiness to compromise on both sides . "
the signing of the protocols comes after a year of negotiations mediated by the swiss , and although it is a welcome step forward , it must now be ratified by both the turkish and armenian parliaments to take effect .
there is considerable resistance to the protocols in both parliaments , however , so it remains unclear when final ratification will occur .
agreement not popular bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many armenians oppose the accords because of ottoman crimes in wwi one day before the protocols were signed , 10,000 people demonstrated in the armenian capital , yerevan , to protest the historic event .
protests were not limited to armenia .
in beirut , thousands of lebanese-armenians marched against the plans to establish diplomatic ties between ankara and yerevan at a gathering outside the turkish embassy , as well as the armenian patriarchate near beirut .
one of the most difficult issues remaining unresolved between turks and armenians is the matter of armenian assertions that turkey carried out genocide in the early 20th century .
in 1915 , armenians claim that ottoman turks systematically killed nearly 1.5 million armenians .
yerevan has campaigned for years to have the deaths recognized internationally as genocide .
turkey has rejected the claims .
now , as part of the new protocols , turkey and armenia have agreed to form an historical commission to look into the events that occurred during world war i. there is also serious contention between the two nations over the issue of nagorno-karabakh , which broke away from armenia in 1993 .
when armenia then invaded the breakaway azerbaijiani territory , turkey shut its borders with armenia , causing extreme economic hardship for the landlocked country. av / dpa / reuters / afp editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

mesut oezil made a brilliant pass which drew russian goalkeeper igor akenfeyev off his line leaving an empty net which klose capitalized on .
the win means germany have qualified for the 2010 world cup in south africa .
the team now has 25 points , four ahead of russia , with one match remaining to be played in group four .
after the match , germany coach joachim loew was satisfied with his team 's performance .
" i was convinced the whole week we would be very concentrated .
i felt everyone had the will to win here and not to play for a draw , " said loew , and added , " of course i have to say , too , that we also had a bit of luck in some situations . "
the game started slowly with each side sizing up the other .
loew had put together a defensive-minded line-up by giving a first cap to hamburg defender jerome boateng , lining up five midfielders and leaving klose on his own up front .
klose scores the winning goal andrei arshavin gave russia the best chance it had in the first half when he slipped away from boateng in midfield , maneuvered around simon rolfes and then found vladimir bystrov , who failed to score when his weak kick was saved by germany goalkeeper rene adler .
only five minutes later , klose scored .
bildunterschrift : germany 's players celebrate after scoring against russia during their world cup group 4 qualifying soccer match in moscow russia stepped up the pressure within three minutes when arshavin had two fierce shots on goal , but both were saved by adler .
bystrov also got close to scoring with an amazing overhead kick .
not to be outdone , germany came back right away with a long-range kick from oezil which bounced off the top bar .
now , russia started to threaten with every attack and wasted another great opportunity when yuriy zhirkov broke into the goal area but found no one to pass to him .
when russia led another attack down the left , boateng brought bystrov down in the 69th minute which led to a second yellow card from swiss referee massimo busacca .
the german squad had to spend the last 20 minutes playing one man short .
german goalkeeper adler was the man of the evening it was a busy night for german keeper adler who then again saved a goal on a shot by pavlyuchenko by parrying it wide of the near post after arshavin sent the tottenham striker clear on the right .
an appeal for a late penalty was turned down when arne friedrich , in as a substitute , brought down bystrov .
with the win over russia , germany is guaranteed a spot in the 2010 world cup in south africa and thus the last group match against finland in hamburg on october 14 is now academic .
russia plays azerbaijan in baku , next .
the biggest question of the night was how germany would perform on the artificial turf of luzhniki stadium .

mesut oezil made a brilliant pass which drew russian goalkeeper igor akenfeyev off his line leaving an empty net which klose capitalized on .
the win means germany have qualified for the 2010 world cup in south africa .
the team now has 25 points , four ahead of russia , with one match remaining to be played in group four .
after the match , germany coach joachim loew was satisfied with his team 's performance .
" i was convinced the whole week we would be very concentrated .
i felt everyone had the will to win here and not to play for a draw , " said loew , and added , " of course i have to say , too , that we also had a bit of luck in some situations . "
the game started slowly with each side sizing up the other .
loew had put together a defensive-minded line-up by giving a first cap to hamburg defender jerome boateng , lining up five midfielders and leaving klose on his own up front .
klose scores the winning goal andrei arshavin gave russia the best chance it had in the first half when he slipped away from boateng in midfield , maneuvered around simon rolfes and then found vladimir bystrov , who failed to score when his weak kick was saved by germany goalkeeper rene adler .
only five minutes later , klose scored .
bildunterschrift : germany 's players celebrate after scoring against russia during their world cup group 4 qualifying soccer match in moscow russia stepped up the pressure within three minutes when arshavin had two fierce shots on goal , but both were saved by adler .
bystrov also got close to scoring with an amazing overhead kick .
not to be outdone , germany came back right away with a long-range kick from oezil which bounced off the top bar .
now , russia started to threaten with every attack and wasted another great opportunity when yuriy zhirkov broke into the goal area but found no one to pass to him .
when russia led another attack down the left , boateng brought bystrov down in the 69th minute which led to a second yellow card from swiss referee massimo busacca .
the german squad had to spend the last 20 minutes playing one man short .
german goalkeeper adler was the man of the evening it was a busy night for german keeper adler who then again saved a goal on a shot by pavlyuchenko by parrying it wide of the near post after arshavin sent the tottenham striker clear on the right .
an appeal for a late penalty was turned down when arne friedrich , in as a substitute , brought down bystrov .
with the win over russia , germany is guaranteed a spot in the 2010 world cup in south africa and thus the last group match against finland in hamburg on october 14 is now academic .
russia plays azerbaijan in baku , next .
the biggest question of the night was how germany would perform on the artificial turf of luzhniki stadium .

but even as international dignitaries gathered to observe the signing , the armenian representatives unexpectedly demanded a review of the closing statement 's wording .
us secretary of state hillary clinton finally managed to bring the parties together by arranging a compromise that led to no statement being read at the end of the signing ceremony .
so , in the end , both davutoglu and nalbandian signed the accord and shook hands to applause from onlookers . the european union quickly welcomed the agreement .
" the european commission warmly welcomes the signature by the armenian and turkish foreign ministers ... of the protocols on establishing diplomatic relations and developing bilateral relations , including the opening of the common border , " said a statement from the eu commission .
the statement further congratulated both parties on their efforts .
" the commission considers it a courageous and far-sighted step forward towards peace and stability in the south caucasus region and a truly historic decision showing readiness to compromise on both sides . "
the signing of the protocols comes after a year of negotiations mediated by the swiss , and although it is a welcome step forward , it must now be ratified by both the turkish and armenian parliaments to take effect .
there is considerable resistance to the protocols in both parliaments , however , so it remains unclear when final ratification will occur .
agreement not popular bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many armenians oppose the accords because of ottoman crimes in wwi one day before the protocols were signed , 10,000 people demonstrated in the armenian capital , yerevan , to protest the historic event .
protests were not limited to armenia .
in beirut , thousands of lebanese-armenians marched against the plans to establish diplomatic ties between ankara and yerevan at a gathering outside the turkish embassy , as well as the armenian patriarchate near beirut .
one of the most difficult issues remaining unresolved between turks and armenians is the matter of armenian assertions that turkey carried out genocide in the early 20th century .
in 1915 , armenians claim that ottoman turks systematically killed nearly 1.5 million armenians .
yerevan has campaigned for years to have the deaths recognized internationally as genocide .
turkey has rejected the claims .
now , as part of the new protocols , turkey and armenia have agreed to form an historical commission to look into the events that occurred during world war i. there is also serious contention between the two nations over the issue of nagorno-karabakh , which broke away from armenia in 1993 .
when armenia then invaded the breakaway azerbaijiani territory , turkey shut its borders with armenia , causing extreme economic hardship for the landlocked country. av / dpa / reuters / afp editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 10.10.2009 czech president demands more changes to lisbon treaty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech republic is now the only country that has n't ratified the lisbon treaty czech president vaclav klaus has thrown another wrench into the lisbon treaty ratification process , this time seeking an exemption to prevent germans expelled during world war ii from using it to reclaim property . klaus wants the czech republic to be exempt from the charter of fundamental rights , which he believes would expose the country to restitution claims from ethnic germans expelled from what was then czechoslovakia in the aftermath of the war . he argues that the charter would let claimants circumvent national courts and take their case to the european court of justice .
this is klaus ' latest objection , but not his first .
a staunch euroskeptic , he opposes the treaty as a matter of principle , believing it yields too much sovereignty to the international bloc .
earlier in the week , he had said he could not sign the treaty until the czech courts reviewed its constitutionality .
poland and britain have secured exemptions and the czech republic would not be the first eu country to seek such an exemption .
poland , whose president lech kaczynski signed the treaty on saturday , negotiated an opt-out for such property claims and secured guarantees that the charter would not force them to allow gay marriage .
britain was assured that the treaty would not supercede their national judicial system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 3 million ethnic germans were forced to leave the former czechoslovakia after the war " before ratification , the czech republic must , additionally at least , negotiate a similar exemption , " said klaus .
" i believe that this exemption can be resolved quickly . "
but because all the other eu countries have ratified the treaty , winning such an exemption for the czech republic would theoretically require its renegotiation .
that duty would fall on the shoulders of the czech government , led by prime minister jan fischer .
fischer said previous reviews of the treaty judged that claims like those feared by klaus would be unlikely .
but he said his interim cabinet would nonetheless discuss the issue monday and that he still hoped the treaty could be ratified before the year 's end .
renegotiation could be avoided if eu leaders pass an official declaration that would not be part of the treaty .
french foreign minister bernard kouchner has outright rejected the idea of a change to the treaty itself .
intentional delays ?
some are worried that klaus ' objections are merely stalling tactics , meant to allow british conservative leader david cameron to hold a promised referendum if his party wins an expected general election next year .
" if i were the eu member states , i would n't really be minded to give klaus what he wants .
he has expressed nothing but hostility towards this thing and he suddenly says he 'll do it ' if , " ' center for european policy studies researcher hugo brady told reuters. svs / reuters / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but even as international dignitaries gathered to observe the signing , the armenian representatives unexpectedly demanded a review of the closing statement 's wording .
us secretary of state hillary clinton finally managed to bring the parties together by arranging a compromise that led to no statement being read at the end of the signing ceremony .
so , in the end , both davutoglu and nalbandian signed the accord and shook hands to applause from onlookers . the european union quickly welcomed the agreement .
" the european commission warmly welcomes the signature by the armenian and turkish foreign ministers ... of the protocols on establishing diplomatic relations and developing bilateral relations , including the opening of the common border , " said a statement from the eu commission .
the statement further congratulated both parties on their efforts .
" the commission considers it a courageous and far-sighted step forward towards peace and stability in the south caucasus region and a truly historic decision showing readiness to compromise on both sides . "
the signing of the protocols comes after a year of negotiations mediated by the swiss , and although it is a welcome step forward , it must now be ratified by both the turkish and armenian parliaments to take effect .
there is considerable resistance to the protocols in both parliaments , however , so it remains unclear when final ratification will occur .
agreement not popular bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many armenians oppose the accords because of ottoman crimes in wwi one day before the protocols were signed , 10,000 people demonstrated in the armenian capital , yerevan , to protest the historic event .
protests were not limited to armenia .
in beirut , thousands of lebanese-armenians marched against the plans to establish diplomatic ties between ankara and yerevan at a gathering outside the turkish embassy , as well as the armenian patriarchate near beirut .
one of the most difficult issues remaining unresolved between turks and armenians is the matter of armenian assertions that turkey carried out genocide in the early 20th century .
in 1915 , armenians claim that ottoman turks systematically killed nearly 1.5 million armenians .
yerevan has campaigned for years to have the deaths recognized internationally as genocide .
turkey has rejected the claims .
now , as part of the new protocols , turkey and armenia have agreed to form an historical commission to look into the events that occurred during world war i. there is also serious contention between the two nations over the issue of nagorno-karabakh , which broke away from armenia in 1993 .

in 1915 , armenians claim that ottoman turks systematically killed nearly 1.5 million armenians .
yerevan has campaigned for years to have the deaths recognized internationally as genocide .
turkey has rejected the claims .
now , as part of the new protocols , turkey and armenia have agreed to form an historical commission to look into the events that occurred during world war i. there is also serious contention between the two nations over the issue of nagorno-karabakh , which broke away from armenia in 1993 .

but even as international dignitaries gathered to observe the signing , the armenian representatives unexpectedly demanded a review of the closing statement 's wording .
us secretary of state hillary clinton finally managed to bring the parties together by arranging a compromise that led to no statement being read at the end of the signing ceremony .
so , in the end , both davutoglu and nalbandian signed the accord and shook hands to applause from onlookers . the european union quickly welcomed the agreement .
" the european commission warmly welcomes the signature by the armenian and turkish foreign ministers ... of the protocols on establishing diplomatic relations and developing bilateral relations , including the opening of the common border , " said a statement from the eu commission .
the statement further congratulated both parties on their efforts .
" the commission considers it a courageous and far-sighted step forward towards peace and stability in the south caucasus region and a truly historic decision showing readiness to compromise on both sides . "
the signing of the protocols comes after a year of negotiations mediated by the swiss , and although it is a welcome step forward , it must now be ratified by both the turkish and armenian parliaments to take effect .
there is considerable resistance to the protocols in both parliaments , however , so it remains unclear when final ratification will occur .
agreement not popular bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many armenians oppose the accords because of ottoman crimes in wwi one day before the protocols were signed , 10,000 people demonstrated in the armenian capital , yerevan , to protest the historic event .
protests were not limited to armenia .
in beirut , thousands of lebanese-armenians marched against the plans to establish diplomatic ties between ankara and yerevan at a gathering outside the turkish embassy , as well as the armenian patriarchate near beirut .

a german car expert has told dw there 's no time left to arrange a new deal before opel goes bust . spain 's industry minister miguel sebastian , on a visit to berlin to discuss the future of opel , has made it clear that his country will not commit to helping the magna buyout under the current terms . " we are not in the right place , to discuss the exact share of state aid that the spanish government might offer , " sebastian said , after opting out of a special meeting in berlin designed to address the rescue plan . spain is calling for magna to guarantee the future of the opel factory in figueruelas , near zaragoza before it commits to helping the canadian car parts maker and its russian backers take command of opel from former parent company general motors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain fears that its factories and workforce are set to lose out so far , magna has only made such promises to german opel factories , and has announced plans to cull around 10,000 jobs across europe in a bid to restore opel 's profitability .
countries like belgium , great britain , and spain are worried that their opel factories - and their economies , by extension - will suffer the job cuts , and are therefore unwilling to help berlin push through the opel deal . the uk government is watching ongoing negotiations between magna and british trade unions about the future of vauxhall -lrb- the british badge for opel -rrb- factories , saying that these are yet to produce " satisfactory results . "
british secretary of state for business , peter mandelson , called for changes to magna 's business plan in an interview with the daily telegraph newspaper , so as to avoid what he described as " negative consequences " for opel 's vauxhall arm . speed of the essence ? german auto industry expert ferdinand dudenhoeffer believes that there is no time to re-evaluate the magna buyout of opel , saying the bid is opel 's only possible solution . " it makes absolutely no sense to continue with general motors , because the employees do n't want that and it was unsuccessful over the last 15 to 20 years , " dudenhoeffer says .
" if they go out and search for a new investor now , they will need at least 12 months to broker a new deal .
and in that time , opel will fall into bankruptcy . " magna needs 4.5 billion euros in state aid to complete its buyout , and wants to finalize the takeover deal with current opel owners general motors in the coming week .
however , with european governments still wrangling over who should pay what , and the deal under european union scrutiny to see if it is anti-competitive , this target is looking increasingly optimistic .
bildunterschrift : opel hopes its new astra will help it turn a profit before it 's too late dudenhoeffer says that german industry experts are baffled by the stance that spain and the uk are now taking with regard to the opel takeover . " they had all this time in the last four months to initiate discussion on the opel deal , " he says .
" they rejected , they did n't provide any money , and now they want to stop the deal and put the opel factories - and the brand itself - in jeopardy . " more meetings magna bosses will have another chance to woo the spanish government on tuesday at a meeting in madrid . " we expect clear progress to come out of this meeting , " industry minister miguel sebastian said in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors in antwerp may need to take to the streets again , the city 's opel factory is still in danger spain is concerned that magna plans to move the production of the opel corsa from the figueruelas factory to eisenach in germany .
sebastian met with his german counterpart karl-theodor zu guttenberg in berlin on friday , rather than attending the magna discussions . representatives from germany , great britain , belgium , austria , hungary , poland and the european commission were present at the official meeting . the future of opel was a major issue during germany 's election campaign , and the social democrats have already seen the opportunity to capitalize , should the deal now fail . the spd state premier for rheinland palatinate , kurt beck , has already bemoaned the " alarming signals coming out of berlin " on the future of opel . " thousands of jobs are at stake - within opel , and at opel 's suppliers .

this is klaus ' latest objection , but not his first .
a staunch euroskeptic , he opposes the treaty as a matter of principle , believing it yields too much sovereignty to the international bloc .
earlier in the week , he had said he could not sign the treaty until the czech courts reviewed its constitutionality .
poland and britain have secured exemptions and the czech republic would not be the first eu country to seek such an exemption .
poland , whose president lech kaczynski signed the treaty on saturday , negotiated an opt-out for such property claims and secured guarantees that the charter would not force them to allow gay marriage .
britain was assured that the treaty would not supercede their national judicial system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 3 million ethnic germans were forced to leave the former czechoslovakia after the war " before ratification , the czech republic must , additionally at least , negotiate a similar exemption , " said klaus .
" i believe that this exemption can be resolved quickly . "
but because all the other eu countries have ratified the treaty , winning such an exemption for the czech republic would theoretically require its renegotiation .
that duty would fall on the shoulders of the czech government , led by prime minister jan fischer .
fischer said previous reviews of the treaty judged that claims like those feared by klaus would be unlikely .
but he said his interim cabinet would nonetheless discuss the issue monday and that he still hoped the treaty could be ratified before the year 's end .

but even as international dignitaries gathered to observe the signing , the armenian representatives unexpectedly demanded a review of the closing statement 's wording .
us secretary of state hillary clinton finally managed to bring the parties together by arranging a compromise that led to no statement being read at the end of the signing ceremony .
so , in the end , both davutoglu and nalbandian signed the accord and shook hands to applause from onlookers . the european union quickly welcomed the agreement .
" the european commission warmly welcomes the signature by the armenian and turkish foreign ministers ... of the protocols on establishing diplomatic relations and developing bilateral relations , including the opening of the common border , " said a statement from the eu commission .
the statement further congratulated both parties on their efforts .
" the commission considers it a courageous and far-sighted step forward towards peace and stability in the south caucasus region and a truly historic decision showing readiness to compromise on both sides . "
the signing of the protocols comes after a year of negotiations mediated by the swiss , and although it is a welcome step forward , it must now be ratified by both the turkish and armenian parliaments to take effect .
there is considerable resistance to the protocols in both parliaments , however , so it remains unclear when final ratification will occur .
agreement not popular bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many armenians oppose the accords because of ottoman crimes in wwi one day before the protocols were signed , 10,000 people demonstrated in the armenian capital , yerevan , to protest the historic event .
protests were not limited to armenia .
in beirut , thousands of lebanese-armenians marched against the plans to establish diplomatic ties between ankara and yerevan at a gathering outside the turkish embassy , as well as the armenian patriarchate near beirut .
one of the most difficult issues remaining unresolved between turks and armenians is the matter of armenian assertions that turkey carried out genocide in the early 20th century .
in 1915 , armenians claim that ottoman turks systematically killed nearly 1.5 million armenians .
yerevan has campaigned for years to have the deaths recognized internationally as genocide .
turkey has rejected the claims .
now , as part of the new protocols , turkey and armenia have agreed to form an historical commission to look into the events that occurred during world war i. there is also serious contention between the two nations over the issue of nagorno-karabakh , which broke away from armenia in 1993 .
when armenia then invaded the breakaway azerbaijiani territory , turkey shut its borders with armenia , causing extreme economic hardship for the landlocked country. av / dpa / reuters / afp editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

mesut oezil made a brilliant pass which drew russian goalkeeper igor akenfeyev off his line leaving an empty net which klose capitalized on .
the win means germany have qualified for the 2010 world cup in south africa .
the team now has 25 points , four ahead of russia , with one match remaining to be played in group four .
after the match , germany coach joachim loew was satisfied with his team 's performance .
" i was convinced the whole week we would be very concentrated .
i felt everyone had the will to win here and not to play for a draw , " said loew , and added , " of course i have to say , too , that we also had a bit of luck in some situations . "
the game started slowly with each side sizing up the other .
loew had put together a defensive-minded line-up by giving a first cap to hamburg defender jerome boateng , lining up five midfielders and leaving klose on his own up front .
klose scores the winning goal andrei arshavin gave russia the best chance it had in the first half when he slipped away from boateng in midfield , maneuvered around simon rolfes and then found vladimir bystrov , who failed to score when his weak kick was saved by germany goalkeeper rene adler .
only five minutes later , klose scored .
bildunterschrift : germany 's players celebrate after scoring against russia during their world cup group 4 qualifying soccer match in moscow russia stepped up the pressure within three minutes when arshavin had two fierce shots on goal , but both were saved by adler .
bystrov also got close to scoring with an amazing overhead kick .
not to be outdone , germany came back right away with a long-range kick from oezil which bounced off the top bar .
now , russia started to threaten with every attack and wasted another great opportunity when yuriy zhirkov broke into the goal area but found no one to pass to him .
when russia led another attack down the left , boateng brought bystrov down in the 69th minute which led to a second yellow card from swiss referee massimo busacca .
the german squad had to spend the last 20 minutes playing one man short .
german goalkeeper adler was the man of the evening it was a busy night for german keeper adler who then again saved a goal on a shot by pavlyuchenko by parrying it wide of the near post after arshavin sent the tottenham striker clear on the right .
an appeal for a late penalty was turned down when arne friedrich , in as a substitute , brought down bystrov .
with the win over russia , germany is guaranteed a spot in the 2010 world cup in south africa and thus the last group match against finland in hamburg on october 14 is now academic .
russia plays azerbaijan in baku , next .
the biggest question of the night was how germany would perform on the artificial turf of luzhniki stadium .

a german car expert has told dw there 's no time left to arrange a new deal before opel goes bust . spain 's industry minister miguel sebastian , on a visit to berlin to discuss the future of opel , has made it clear that his country will not commit to helping the magna buyout under the current terms . " we are not in the right place , to discuss the exact share of state aid that the spanish government might offer , " sebastian said , after opting out of a special meeting in berlin designed to address the rescue plan . spain is calling for magna to guarantee the future of the opel factory in figueruelas , near zaragoza before it commits to helping the canadian car parts maker and its russian backers take command of opel from former parent company general motors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain fears that its factories and workforce are set to lose out so far , magna has only made such promises to german opel factories , and has announced plans to cull around 10,000 jobs across europe in a bid to restore opel 's profitability .
countries like belgium , great britain , and spain are worried that their opel factories - and their economies , by extension - will suffer the job cuts , and are therefore unwilling to help berlin push through the opel deal . the uk government is watching ongoing negotiations between magna and british trade unions about the future of vauxhall -lrb- the british badge for opel -rrb- factories , saying that these are yet to produce " satisfactory results . "
british secretary of state for business , peter mandelson , called for changes to magna 's business plan in an interview with the daily telegraph newspaper , so as to avoid what he described as " negative consequences " for opel 's vauxhall arm . speed of the essence ? german auto industry expert ferdinand dudenhoeffer believes that there is no time to re-evaluate the magna buyout of opel , saying the bid is opel 's only possible solution . " it makes absolutely no sense to continue with general motors , because the employees do n't want that and it was unsuccessful over the last 15 to 20 years , " dudenhoeffer says .
" if they go out and search for a new investor now , they will need at least 12 months to broker a new deal .
and in that time , opel will fall into bankruptcy . " magna needs 4.5 billion euros in state aid to complete its buyout , and wants to finalize the takeover deal with current opel owners general motors in the coming week .
however , with european governments still wrangling over who should pay what , and the deal under european union scrutiny to see if it is anti-competitive , this target is looking increasingly optimistic .
bildunterschrift : opel hopes its new astra will help it turn a profit before it 's too late dudenhoeffer says that german industry experts are baffled by the stance that spain and the uk are now taking with regard to the opel takeover . " they had all this time in the last four months to initiate discussion on the opel deal , " he says .
" they rejected , they did n't provide any money , and now they want to stop the deal and put the opel factories - and the brand itself - in jeopardy . " more meetings magna bosses will have another chance to woo the spanish government on tuesday at a meeting in madrid .

a german car expert has told dw there 's no time left to arrange a new deal before opel goes bust . spain 's industry minister miguel sebastian , on a visit to berlin to discuss the future of opel , has made it clear that his country will not commit to helping the magna buyout under the current terms . " we are not in the right place , to discuss the exact share of state aid that the spanish government might offer , " sebastian said , after opting out of a special meeting in berlin designed to address the rescue plan . spain is calling for magna to guarantee the future of the opel factory in figueruelas , near zaragoza before it commits to helping the canadian car parts maker and its russian backers take command of opel from former parent company general motors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain fears that its factories and workforce are set to lose out so far , magna has only made such promises to german opel factories , and has announced plans to cull around 10,000 jobs across europe in a bid to restore opel 's profitability .
countries like belgium , great britain , and spain are worried that their opel factories - and their economies , by extension - will suffer the job cuts , and are therefore unwilling to help berlin push through the opel deal . the uk government is watching ongoing negotiations between magna and british trade unions about the future of vauxhall -lrb- the british badge for opel -rrb- factories , saying that these are yet to produce " satisfactory results . "
british secretary of state for business , peter mandelson , called for changes to magna 's business plan in an interview with the daily telegraph newspaper , so as to avoid what he described as " negative consequences " for opel 's vauxhall arm . speed of the essence ? german auto industry expert ferdinand dudenhoeffer believes that there is no time to re-evaluate the magna buyout of opel , saying the bid is opel 's only possible solution . " it makes absolutely no sense to continue with general motors , because the employees do n't want that and it was unsuccessful over the last 15 to 20 years , " dudenhoeffer says .
" if they go out and search for a new investor now , they will need at least 12 months to broker a new deal .
and in that time , opel will fall into bankruptcy . " magna needs 4.5 billion euros in state aid to complete its buyout , and wants to finalize the takeover deal with current opel owners general motors in the coming week .
however , with european governments still wrangling over who should pay what , and the deal under european union scrutiny to see if it is anti-competitive , this target is looking increasingly optimistic .
bildunterschrift : opel hopes its new astra will help it turn a profit before it 's too late dudenhoeffer says that german industry experts are baffled by the stance that spain and the uk are now taking with regard to the opel takeover . " they had all this time in the last four months to initiate discussion on the opel deal , " he says .
" they rejected , they did n't provide any money , and now they want to stop the deal and put the opel factories - and the brand itself - in jeopardy . " more meetings magna bosses will have another chance to woo the spanish government on tuesday at a meeting in madrid .

mesut oezil made a brilliant pass which drew russian goalkeeper igor akenfeyev off his line leaving an empty net which klose capitalized on .
the win means germany have qualified for the 2010 world cup in south africa .
the team now has 25 points , four ahead of russia , with one match remaining to be played in group four .
after the match , germany coach joachim loew was satisfied with his team 's performance .
" i was convinced the whole week we would be very concentrated .
i felt everyone had the will to win here and not to play for a draw , " said loew , and added , " of course i have to say , too , that we also had a bit of luck in some situations . "
the game started slowly with each side sizing up the other .
loew had put together a defensive-minded line-up by giving a first cap to hamburg defender jerome boateng , lining up five midfielders and leaving klose on his own up front .
klose scores the winning goal andrei arshavin gave russia the best chance it had in the first half when he slipped away from boateng in midfield , maneuvered around simon rolfes and then found vladimir bystrov , who failed to score when his weak kick was saved by germany goalkeeper rene adler .
only five minutes later , klose scored .
bildunterschrift : germany 's players celebrate after scoring against russia during their world cup group 4 qualifying soccer match in moscow russia stepped up the pressure within three minutes when arshavin had two fierce shots on goal , but both were saved by adler .
bystrov also got close to scoring with an amazing overhead kick .
not to be outdone , germany came back right away with a long-range kick from oezil which bounced off the top bar .
now , russia started to threaten with every attack and wasted another great opportunity when yuriy zhirkov broke into the goal area but found no one to pass to him .
when russia led another attack down the left , boateng brought bystrov down in the 69th minute which led to a second yellow card from swiss referee massimo busacca .
the german squad had to spend the last 20 minutes playing one man short .
german goalkeeper adler was the man of the evening it was a busy night for german keeper adler who then again saved a goal on a shot by pavlyuchenko by parrying it wide of the near post after arshavin sent the tottenham striker clear on the right .
an appeal for a late penalty was turned down when arne friedrich , in as a substitute , brought down bystrov .
with the win over russia , germany is guaranteed a spot in the 2010 world cup in south africa and thus the last group match against finland in hamburg on october 14 is now academic .
russia plays azerbaijan in baku , next .
the biggest question of the night was how germany would perform on the artificial turf of luzhniki stadium .

a german car expert has told dw there 's no time left to arrange a new deal before opel goes bust . spain 's industry minister miguel sebastian , on a visit to berlin to discuss the future of opel , has made it clear that his country will not commit to helping the magna buyout under the current terms . " we are not in the right place , to discuss the exact share of state aid that the spanish government might offer , " sebastian said , after opting out of a special meeting in berlin designed to address the rescue plan . spain is calling for magna to guarantee the future of the opel factory in figueruelas , near zaragoza before it commits to helping the canadian car parts maker and its russian backers take command of opel from former parent company general motors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain fears that its factories and workforce are set to lose out so far , magna has only made such promises to german opel factories , and has announced plans to cull around 10,000 jobs across europe in a bid to restore opel 's profitability .
countries like belgium , great britain , and spain are worried that their opel factories - and their economies , by extension - will suffer the job cuts , and are therefore unwilling to help berlin push through the opel deal . the uk government is watching ongoing negotiations between magna and british trade unions about the future of vauxhall -lrb- the british badge for opel -rrb- factories , saying that these are yet to produce " satisfactory results . "
british secretary of state for business , peter mandelson , called for changes to magna 's business plan in an interview with the daily telegraph newspaper , so as to avoid what he described as " negative consequences " for opel 's vauxhall arm . speed of the essence ? german auto industry expert ferdinand dudenhoeffer believes that there is no time to re-evaluate the magna buyout of opel , saying the bid is opel 's only possible solution . " it makes absolutely no sense to continue with general motors , because the employees do n't want that and it was unsuccessful over the last 15 to 20 years , " dudenhoeffer says .
" if they go out and search for a new investor now , they will need at least 12 months to broker a new deal .
and in that time , opel will fall into bankruptcy . " magna needs 4.5 billion euros in state aid to complete its buyout , and wants to finalize the takeover deal with current opel owners general motors in the coming week .
however , with european governments still wrangling over who should pay what , and the deal under european union scrutiny to see if it is anti-competitive , this target is looking increasingly optimistic .
bildunterschrift : opel hopes its new astra will help it turn a profit before it 's too late dudenhoeffer says that german industry experts are baffled by the stance that spain and the uk are now taking with regard to the opel takeover . " they had all this time in the last four months to initiate discussion on the opel deal , " he says .
" they rejected , they did n't provide any money , and now they want to stop the deal and put the opel factories - and the brand itself - in jeopardy . " more meetings magna bosses will have another chance to woo the spanish government on tuesday at a meeting in madrid . " we expect clear progress to come out of this meeting , " industry minister miguel sebastian said in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors in antwerp may need to take to the streets again , the city 's opel factory is still in danger spain is concerned that magna plans to move the production of the opel corsa from the figueruelas factory to eisenach in germany .
sebastian met with his german counterpart karl-theodor zu guttenberg in berlin on friday , rather than attending the magna discussions . representatives from germany , great britain , belgium , austria , hungary , poland and the european commission were present at the official meeting . the future of opel was a major issue during germany 's election campaign , and the social democrats have already seen the opportunity to capitalize , should the deal now fail . the spd state premier for rheinland palatinate , kurt beck , has already bemoaned the " alarming signals coming out of berlin " on the future of opel . " thousands of jobs are at stake - within opel , and at opel 's suppliers .

mesut oezil made a brilliant pass which drew russian goalkeeper igor akenfeyev off his line leaving an empty net which klose capitalized on .
the win means germany have qualified for the 2010 world cup in south africa .
the team now has 25 points , four ahead of russia , with one match remaining to be played in group four .
after the match , germany coach joachim loew was satisfied with his team 's performance .
" i was convinced the whole week we would be very concentrated .
i felt everyone had the will to win here and not to play for a draw , " said loew , and added , " of course i have to say , too , that we also had a bit of luck in some situations . "
the game started slowly with each side sizing up the other .
loew had put together a defensive-minded line-up by giving a first cap to hamburg defender jerome boateng , lining up five midfielders and leaving klose on his own up front .
klose scores the winning goal andrei arshavin gave russia the best chance it had in the first half when he slipped away from boateng in midfield , maneuvered around simon rolfes and then found vladimir bystrov , who failed to score when his weak kick was saved by germany goalkeeper rene adler .
only five minutes later , klose scored .
bildunterschrift : germany 's players celebrate after scoring against russia during their world cup group 4 qualifying soccer match in moscow russia stepped up the pressure within three minutes when arshavin had two fierce shots on goal , but both were saved by adler .
bystrov also got close to scoring with an amazing overhead kick .
not to be outdone , germany came back right away with a long-range kick from oezil which bounced off the top bar .
now , russia started to threaten with every attack and wasted another great opportunity when yuriy zhirkov broke into the goal area but found no one to pass to him .
when russia led another attack down the left , boateng brought bystrov down in the 69th minute which led to a second yellow card from swiss referee massimo busacca .
the german squad had to spend the last 20 minutes playing one man short .
german goalkeeper adler was the man of the evening it was a busy night for german keeper adler who then again saved a goal on a shot by pavlyuchenko by parrying it wide of the near post after arshavin sent the tottenham striker clear on the right .
an appeal for a late penalty was turned down when arne friedrich , in as a substitute , brought down bystrov .
with the win over russia , germany is guaranteed a spot in the 2010 world cup in south africa and thus the last group match against finland in hamburg on october 14 is now academic .
russia plays azerbaijan in baku , next .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 10.10.2009 turkey and armenia sign accords to normalize diplomatic relations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an historic agreement is signed in zurich armenia and turkey have signed protocols to normalize relations and open the turkish-armenian border , but the historic signing agreement almost foundered at the last minute . as foreign ministers from russia , france , the united states and the european union looked on , turkish foreign minister ahmet davutoglu and his armenian counterpart , edouard nalbandian , signed two protocols at the university of zurich on saturday evening , re-establishing diplomatic ties and opening the border between the two nations .
but even as international dignitaries gathered to observe the signing , the armenian representatives unexpectedly demanded a review of the closing statement 's wording .
us secretary of state hillary clinton finally managed to bring the parties together by arranging a compromise that led to no statement being read at the end of the signing ceremony .
so , in the end , both davutoglu and nalbandian signed the accord and shook hands to applause from onlookers . the european union quickly welcomed the agreement .
" the european commission warmly welcomes the signature by the armenian and turkish foreign ministers ... of the protocols on establishing diplomatic relations and developing bilateral relations , including the opening of the common border , " said a statement from the eu commission .
the statement further congratulated both parties on their efforts .
" the commission considers it a courageous and far-sighted step forward towards peace and stability in the south caucasus region and a truly historic decision showing readiness to compromise on both sides . "
the signing of the protocols comes after a year of negotiations mediated by the swiss , and although it is a welcome step forward , it must now be ratified by both the turkish and armenian parliaments to take effect .
there is considerable resistance to the protocols in both parliaments , however , so it remains unclear when final ratification will occur .
agreement not popular bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many armenians oppose the accords because of ottoman crimes in wwi one day before the protocols were signed , 10,000 people demonstrated in the armenian capital , yerevan , to protest the historic event .
protests were not limited to armenia .
in beirut , thousands of lebanese-armenians marched against the plans to establish diplomatic ties between ankara and yerevan at a gathering outside the turkish embassy , as well as the armenian patriarchate near beirut .
one of the most difficult issues remaining unresolved between turks and armenians is the matter of armenian assertions that turkey carried out genocide in the early 20th century .
in 1915 , armenians claim that ottoman turks systematically killed nearly 1.5 million armenians .
yerevan has campaigned for years to have the deaths recognized internationally as genocide .
turkey has rejected the claims .
now , as part of the new protocols , turkey and armenia have agreed to form an historical commission to look into the events that occurred during world war i. there is also serious contention between the two nations over the issue of nagorno-karabakh , which broke away from armenia in 1993 .
when armenia then invaded the breakaway azerbaijiani territory , turkey shut its borders with armenia , causing extreme economic hardship for the landlocked country. av / dpa / reuters / afp editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

mesut oezil made a brilliant pass which drew russian goalkeeper igor akenfeyev off his line leaving an empty net which klose capitalized on .
the win means germany have qualified for the 2010 world cup in south africa .
the team now has 25 points , four ahead of russia , with one match remaining to be played in group four .
after the match , germany coach joachim loew was satisfied with his team 's performance .
" i was convinced the whole week we would be very concentrated .
i felt everyone had the will to win here and not to play for a draw , " said loew , and added , " of course i have to say , too , that we also had a bit of luck in some situations . "
the game started slowly with each side sizing up the other .
loew had put together a defensive-minded line-up by giving a first cap to hamburg defender jerome boateng , lining up five midfielders and leaving klose on his own up front .
klose scores the winning goal andrei arshavin gave russia the best chance it had in the first half when he slipped away from boateng in midfield , maneuvered around simon rolfes and then found vladimir bystrov , who failed to score when his weak kick was saved by germany goalkeeper rene adler .
only five minutes later , klose scored .
bildunterschrift : germany 's players celebrate after scoring against russia during their world cup group 4 qualifying soccer match in moscow russia stepped up the pressure within three minutes when arshavin had two fierce shots on goal , but both were saved by adler .
bystrov also got close to scoring with an amazing overhead kick .
not to be outdone , germany came back right away with a long-range kick from oezil which bounced off the top bar .
now , russia started to threaten with every attack and wasted another great opportunity when yuriy zhirkov broke into the goal area but found no one to pass to him .
when russia led another attack down the left , boateng brought bystrov down in the 69th minute which led to a second yellow card from swiss referee massimo busacca .
the german squad had to spend the last 20 minutes playing one man short .
german goalkeeper adler was the man of the evening it was a busy night for german keeper adler who then again saved a goal on a shot by pavlyuchenko by parrying it wide of the near post after arshavin sent the tottenham striker clear on the right .
an appeal for a late penalty was turned down when arne friedrich , in as a substitute , brought down bystrov .
with the win over russia , germany is guaranteed a spot in the 2010 world cup in south africa and thus the last group match against finland in hamburg on october 14 is now academic .
russia plays azerbaijan in baku , next .

but even as international dignitaries gathered to observe the signing , the armenian representatives unexpectedly demanded a review of the closing statement 's wording .
us secretary of state hillary clinton finally managed to bring the parties together by arranging a compromise that led to no statement being read at the end of the signing ceremony .
so , in the end , both davutoglu and nalbandian signed the accord and shook hands to applause from onlookers . the european union quickly welcomed the agreement .
" the european commission warmly welcomes the signature by the armenian and turkish foreign ministers ... of the protocols on establishing diplomatic relations and developing bilateral relations , including the opening of the common border , " said a statement from the eu commission .
the statement further congratulated both parties on their efforts .
" the commission considers it a courageous and far-sighted step forward towards peace and stability in the south caucasus region and a truly historic decision showing readiness to compromise on both sides . "
the signing of the protocols comes after a year of negotiations mediated by the swiss , and although it is a welcome step forward , it must now be ratified by both the turkish and armenian parliaments to take effect .
there is considerable resistance to the protocols in both parliaments , however , so it remains unclear when final ratification will occur .

protests were not limited to armenia .
in beirut , thousands of lebanese-armenians marched against the plans to establish diplomatic ties between ankara and yerevan at a gathering outside the turkish embassy , as well as the armenian patriarchate near beirut .
one of the most difficult issues remaining unresolved between turks and armenians is the matter of armenian assertions that turkey carried out genocide in the early 20th century .
in 1915 , armenians claim that ottoman turks systematically killed nearly 1.5 million armenians .
yerevan has campaigned for years to have the deaths recognized internationally as genocide .
turkey has rejected the claims .
now , as part of the new protocols , turkey and armenia have agreed to form an historical commission to look into the events that occurred during world war i. there is also serious contention between the two nations over the issue of nagorno-karabakh , which broke away from armenia in 1993 .

but even as international dignitaries gathered to observe the signing , the armenian representatives unexpectedly demanded a review of the closing statement 's wording .
us secretary of state hillary clinton finally managed to bring the parties together by arranging a compromise that led to no statement being read at the end of the signing ceremony .
so , in the end , both davutoglu and nalbandian signed the accord and shook hands to applause from onlookers . the european union quickly welcomed the agreement .
" the european commission warmly welcomes the signature by the armenian and turkish foreign ministers ... of the protocols on establishing diplomatic relations and developing bilateral relations , including the opening of the common border , " said a statement from the eu commission .
the statement further congratulated both parties on their efforts .
" the commission considers it a courageous and far-sighted step forward towards peace and stability in the south caucasus region and a truly historic decision showing readiness to compromise on both sides . "
the signing of the protocols comes after a year of negotiations mediated by the swiss , and although it is a welcome step forward , it must now be ratified by both the turkish and armenian parliaments to take effect .
there is considerable resistance to the protocols in both parliaments , however , so it remains unclear when final ratification will occur .
agreement not popular bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many armenians oppose the accords because of ottoman crimes in wwi one day before the protocols were signed , 10,000 people demonstrated in the armenian capital , yerevan , to protest the historic event .
protests were not limited to armenia .
in beirut , thousands of lebanese-armenians marched against the plans to establish diplomatic ties between ankara and yerevan at a gathering outside the turkish embassy , as well as the armenian patriarchate near beirut .
one of the most difficult issues remaining unresolved between turks and armenians is the matter of armenian assertions that turkey carried out genocide in the early 20th century .
in 1915 , armenians claim that ottoman turks systematically killed nearly 1.5 million armenians .
yerevan has campaigned for years to have the deaths recognized internationally as genocide .
turkey has rejected the claims .
now , as part of the new protocols , turkey and armenia have agreed to form an historical commission to look into the events that occurred during world war i. there is also serious contention between the two nations over the issue of nagorno-karabakh , which broke away from armenia in 1993 .
when armenia then invaded the breakaway azerbaijiani territory , turkey shut its borders with armenia , causing extreme economic hardship for the landlocked country. av / dpa / reuters / afp editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a german car expert has told dw there 's no time left to arrange a new deal before opel goes bust . spain 's industry minister miguel sebastian , on a visit to berlin to discuss the future of opel , has made it clear that his country will not commit to helping the magna buyout under the current terms .

" it makes absolutely no sense to continue with general motors , because the employees do n't want that and it was unsuccessful over the last 15 to 20 years , " dudenhoeffer says .
" if they go out and search for a new investor now , they will need at least 12 months to broker a new deal .

this is klaus ' latest objection , but not his first .
a staunch euroskeptic , he opposes the treaty as a matter of principle , believing it yields too much sovereignty to the international bloc .
earlier in the week , he had said he could not sign the treaty until the czech courts reviewed its constitutionality .
poland and britain have secured exemptions and the czech republic would not be the first eu country to seek such an exemption .
poland , whose president lech kaczynski signed the treaty on saturday , negotiated an opt-out for such property claims and secured guarantees that the charter would not force them to allow gay marriage .

" i believe that this exemption can be resolved quickly . "
but because all the other eu countries have ratified the treaty , winning such an exemption for the czech republic would theoretically require its renegotiation .
that duty would fall on the shoulders of the czech government , led by prime minister jan fischer .
fischer said previous reviews of the treaty judged that claims like those feared by klaus would be unlikely .
but he said his interim cabinet would nonetheless discuss the issue monday and that he still hoped the treaty could be ratified before the year 's end .
renegotiation could be avoided if eu leaders pass an official declaration that would not be part of the treaty .
french foreign minister bernard kouchner has outright rejected the idea of a change to the treaty itself .

this is klaus ' latest objection , but not his first .
a staunch euroskeptic , he opposes the treaty as a matter of principle , believing it yields too much sovereignty to the international bloc .
earlier in the week , he had said he could not sign the treaty until the czech courts reviewed its constitutionality .
poland and britain have secured exemptions and the czech republic would not be the first eu country to seek such an exemption .
poland , whose president lech kaczynski signed the treaty on saturday , negotiated an opt-out for such property claims and secured guarantees that the charter would not force them to allow gay marriage .
britain was assured that the treaty would not supercede their national judicial system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 3 million ethnic germans were forced to leave the former czechoslovakia after the war " before ratification , the czech republic must , additionally at least , negotiate a similar exemption , " said klaus .
" i believe that this exemption can be resolved quickly . "
but because all the other eu countries have ratified the treaty , winning such an exemption for the czech republic would theoretically require its renegotiation .
that duty would fall on the shoulders of the czech government , led by prime minister jan fischer .
fischer said previous reviews of the treaty judged that claims like those feared by klaus would be unlikely .
but he said his interim cabinet would nonetheless discuss the issue monday and that he still hoped the treaty could be ratified before the year 's end .
renegotiation could be avoided if eu leaders pass an official declaration that would not be part of the treaty .
french foreign minister bernard kouchner has outright rejected the idea of a change to the treaty itself .
intentional delays ?
some are worried that klaus ' objections are merely stalling tactics , meant to allow british conservative leader david cameron to hold a promised referendum if his party wins an expected general election next year .
" if i were the eu member states , i would n't really be minded to give klaus what he wants .
he has expressed nothing but hostility towards this thing and he suddenly says he 'll do it ' if , " ' center for european policy studies researcher hugo brady told reuters. svs / reuters / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a german car expert has told dw there 's no time left to arrange a new deal before opel goes bust . spain 's industry minister miguel sebastian , on a visit to berlin to discuss the future of opel , has made it clear that his country will not commit to helping the magna buyout under the current terms . " we are not in the right place , to discuss the exact share of state aid that the spanish government might offer , " sebastian said , after opting out of a special meeting in berlin designed to address the rescue plan . spain is calling for magna to guarantee the future of the opel factory in figueruelas , near zaragoza before it commits to helping the canadian car parts maker and its russian backers take command of opel from former parent company general motors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain fears that its factories and workforce are set to lose out so far , magna has only made such promises to german opel factories , and has announced plans to cull around 10,000 jobs across europe in a bid to restore opel 's profitability .
countries like belgium , great britain , and spain are worried that their opel factories - and their economies , by extension - will suffer the job cuts , and are therefore unwilling to help berlin push through the opel deal . the uk government is watching ongoing negotiations between magna and british trade unions about the future of vauxhall -lrb- the british badge for opel -rrb- factories , saying that these are yet to produce " satisfactory results . "
british secretary of state for business , peter mandelson , called for changes to magna 's business plan in an interview with the daily telegraph newspaper , so as to avoid what he described as " negative consequences " for opel 's vauxhall arm . speed of the essence ? german auto industry expert ferdinand dudenhoeffer believes that there is no time to re-evaluate the magna buyout of opel , saying the bid is opel 's only possible solution . " it makes absolutely no sense to continue with general motors , because the employees do n't want that and it was unsuccessful over the last 15 to 20 years , " dudenhoeffer says .
" if they go out and search for a new investor now , they will need at least 12 months to broker a new deal .
and in that time , opel will fall into bankruptcy . " magna needs 4.5 billion euros in state aid to complete its buyout , and wants to finalize the takeover deal with current opel owners general motors in the coming week .
however , with european governments still wrangling over who should pay what , and the deal under european union scrutiny to see if it is anti-competitive , this target is looking increasingly optimistic .
bildunterschrift : opel hopes its new astra will help it turn a profit before it 's too late dudenhoeffer says that german industry experts are baffled by the stance that spain and the uk are now taking with regard to the opel takeover . " they had all this time in the last four months to initiate discussion on the opel deal , " he says .
" they rejected , they did n't provide any money , and now they want to stop the deal and put the opel factories - and the brand itself - in jeopardy . " more meetings magna bosses will have another chance to woo the spanish government on tuesday at a meeting in madrid . " we expect clear progress to come out of this meeting , " industry minister miguel sebastian said in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors in antwerp may need to take to the streets again , the city 's opel factory is still in danger spain is concerned that magna plans to move the production of the opel corsa from the figueruelas factory to eisenach in germany .
sebastian met with his german counterpart karl-theodor zu guttenberg in berlin on friday , rather than attending the magna discussions . representatives from germany , great britain , belgium , austria , hungary , poland and the european commission were present at the official meeting . the future of opel was a major issue during germany 's election campaign , and the social democrats have already seen the opportunity to capitalize , should the deal now fail . the spd state premier for rheinland palatinate , kurt beck , has already bemoaned the " alarming signals coming out of berlin " on the future of opel . " thousands of jobs are at stake - within opel , and at opel 's suppliers .

on saturday , turkey and armenia are set to sign an agreement to re-establish diplomatic ties . the swiss-brokered diplomatic deal between turkey and armenia is due to be signed in zurich on saturday . attended by the foreign ministers of russia , france and the us secretary of state hillary clinton , many have high hopes for improving relations between these neighboring nations .
ana , a nanny for a turkish family in istanbul , is one of thousands of armenians forced to look for work abroad because of turkey 's trade embargo against armenia .
she says life in istanbul is hard , because of the closed frontier between the two nations .
" we are illegal and earn very little money , and you always have to avoid the police as you could be arrested at any time and deported , " she said .
ana was overjoyed at the news that turkey was prepared to re-establish ties with armenia .
in 1993 , turkey severed ties and closed its border after armenia fought a war with turkish ally azerbaijan over the disputed nagorno karabakh enclave .
" i ca n't wait for the embargo to be lifted , " she said .
" it will change everything , for both our countries .
we just want peace and normalcy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has said the agreement will normalize bilateral relations between turkey and armenia .
but some experts caution that , while it 's an important gesture , it 's only the first step .
" it 's pretty significant , but then the protocols will be sent to the respective parliaments for ratification and that 's when the deal gets a bit more complicated , as there is strong opposition both in armenia and turkey , " said soli ozel , an expert on international relations at istanbul 's bilgi university .
critics say deal betrays azerbaijan turkey 's main opposition parties have condemned the announcement , accusing the government of betraying its ally azerbaijan .
armenian forces also continue to occupy a large part of azeri territory .
the government has been quick to dispel accusations of betrayal , saying it remains committed to azerbaijan .
erdogan said on friday that turkey " would never take part in a process which puts azerbaijan in a difficult situation " .
suat kiniklioglu , spokesman of the turkish parliament 's foreign affairs committee , insisted earlier this month that resolving azeri grievances remains key to restoring armenian-turkish relations .
" without movement on the karabahk issue , the normalization process would be difficult to sustain .
all the stars really do have to be aligned , " kiniklioglu said .
ozel says the alignment is right , however , because for the first time since the conflict , major powers have a common interest in bringing stability to the region .
" my understanding is that there is almost near agreement on a framework between azerbaijan and armenia , " ozel said .
" the americans are behind these developments , but russia 's role is more important because the russians can block it anytime they want .
but i think it serves their purpose too , because russian and american relations seem to be on a better track now .
the russians may wish to be on the right side of things . "
russian support is key such a diplomatic breakthrough in resolving the seemingly intractable dispute between armenia and azerbaijan will be crucial if the government is to sell the opening of the armenian border to its people .

on saturday , turkey and armenia are set to sign an agreement to re-establish diplomatic ties . the swiss-brokered diplomatic deal between turkey and armenia is due to be signed in zurich on saturday . attended by the foreign ministers of russia , france and the us secretary of state hillary clinton , many have high hopes for improving relations between these neighboring nations .
ana , a nanny for a turkish family in istanbul , is one of thousands of armenians forced to look for work abroad because of turkey 's trade embargo against armenia .
she says life in istanbul is hard , because of the closed frontier between the two nations .
" we are illegal and earn very little money , and you always have to avoid the police as you could be arrested at any time and deported , " she said .
ana was overjoyed at the news that turkey was prepared to re-establish ties with armenia .
in 1993 , turkey severed ties and closed its border after armenia fought a war with turkish ally azerbaijan over the disputed nagorno karabakh enclave .
" i ca n't wait for the embargo to be lifted , " she said .
" it will change everything , for both our countries .
we just want peace and normalcy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has said the agreement will normalize bilateral relations between turkey and armenia .
but some experts caution that , while it 's an important gesture , it 's only the first step .
" it 's pretty significant , but then the protocols will be sent to the respective parliaments for ratification and that 's when the deal gets a bit more complicated , as there is strong opposition both in armenia and turkey , " said soli ozel , an expert on international relations at istanbul 's bilgi university .
critics say deal betrays azerbaijan turkey 's main opposition parties have condemned the announcement , accusing the government of betraying its ally azerbaijan .
armenian forces also continue to occupy a large part of azeri territory .
the government has been quick to dispel accusations of betrayal , saying it remains committed to azerbaijan .
erdogan said on friday that turkey " would never take part in a process which puts azerbaijan in a difficult situation " .
suat kiniklioglu , spokesman of the turkish parliament 's foreign affairs committee , insisted earlier this month that resolving azeri grievances remains key to restoring armenian-turkish relations .
" without movement on the karabahk issue , the normalization process would be difficult to sustain .
all the stars really do have to be aligned , " kiniklioglu said .
ozel says the alignment is right , however , because for the first time since the conflict , major powers have a common interest in bringing stability to the region .
" my understanding is that there is almost near agreement on a framework between azerbaijan and armenia , " ozel said .
" the americans are behind these developments , but russia 's role is more important because the russians can block it anytime they want .
but i think it serves their purpose too , because russian and american relations seem to be on a better track now .
the russians may wish to be on the right side of things . "
russian support is key such a diplomatic breakthrough in resolving the seemingly intractable dispute between armenia and azerbaijan will be crucial if the government is to sell the opening of the armenian border to its people .

many in the international community accuse turkey 's then-ottoman rulers of committing genocide against its armenian minority between 1915 and 1923 .
ankara strongly denies the charge .
the controversy continues to sour relations and add to the deep suspicion within the country over the rapprochement .
" this discourse about genocide is being imposed on us by great western powers ; that 's why the debate about opening the border is not a simple question , for anybody , " said political scientist and newspaper columnist , nuray mert .
" the political opposition , knowing that it is a very sensitive issue , is using it against the government so that the issue is becoming even more complicated . "

mesut oezil made a brilliant pass which drew russian goalkeeper igor akenfeyev off his line leaving an empty net which klose capitalized on .
the win means germany have qualified for the 2010 world cup in south africa .
the team now has 25 points , four ahead of russia , with one match remaining to be played in group four .
after the match , germany coach joachim loew was satisfied with his team 's performance .
" i was convinced the whole week we would be very concentrated .
i felt everyone had the will to win here and not to play for a draw , " said loew , and added , " of course i have to say , too , that we also had a bit of luck in some situations . "
the game started slowly with each side sizing up the other .
loew had put together a defensive-minded line-up by giving a first cap to hamburg defender jerome boateng , lining up five midfielders and leaving klose on his own up front .
klose scores the winning goal andrei arshavin gave russia the best chance it had in the first half when he slipped away from boateng in midfield , maneuvered around simon rolfes and then found vladimir bystrov , who failed to score when his weak kick was saved by germany goalkeeper rene adler .
only five minutes later , klose scored .
bildunterschrift : germany 's players celebrate after scoring against russia during their world cup group 4 qualifying soccer match in moscow russia stepped up the pressure within three minutes when arshavin had two fierce shots on goal , but both were saved by adler .
bystrov also got close to scoring with an amazing overhead kick .
not to be outdone , germany came back right away with a long-range kick from oezil which bounced off the top bar .
now , russia started to threaten with every attack and wasted another great opportunity when yuriy zhirkov broke into the goal area but found no one to pass to him .
when russia led another attack down the left , boateng brought bystrov down in the 69th minute which led to a second yellow card from swiss referee massimo busacca .
the german squad had to spend the last 20 minutes playing one man short .
german goalkeeper adler was the man of the evening it was a busy night for german keeper adler who then again saved a goal on a shot by pavlyuchenko by parrying it wide of the near post after arshavin sent the tottenham striker clear on the right .
an appeal for a late penalty was turned down when arne friedrich , in as a substitute , brought down bystrov .
with the win over russia , germany is guaranteed a spot in the 2010 world cup in south africa and thus the last group match against finland in hamburg on october 14 is now academic .
russia plays azerbaijan in baku , next .
the biggest question of the night was how germany would perform on the artificial turf of luzhniki stadium .
no german national team had ever played on artificial turf before .
that question has now been answered. av / dpa / reuters editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this is klaus ' latest objection , but not his first .
a staunch euroskeptic , he opposes the treaty as a matter of principle , believing it yields too much sovereignty to the international bloc .
earlier in the week , he had said he could not sign the treaty until the czech courts reviewed its constitutionality .
poland and britain have secured exemptions and the czech republic would not be the first eu country to seek such an exemption .
poland , whose president lech kaczynski signed the treaty on saturday , negotiated an opt-out for such property claims and secured guarantees that the charter would not force them to allow gay marriage .
britain was assured that the treaty would not supercede their national judicial system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 3 million ethnic germans were forced to leave the former czechoslovakia after the war " before ratification , the czech republic must , additionally at least , negotiate a similar exemption , " said klaus .
" i believe that this exemption can be resolved quickly . "
but because all the other eu countries have ratified the treaty , winning such an exemption for the czech republic would theoretically require its renegotiation .
that duty would fall on the shoulders of the czech government , led by prime minister jan fischer .
fischer said previous reviews of the treaty judged that claims like those feared by klaus would be unlikely .
but he said his interim cabinet would nonetheless discuss the issue monday and that he still hoped the treaty could be ratified before the year 's end .
renegotiation could be avoided if eu leaders pass an official declaration that would not be part of the treaty .
french foreign minister bernard kouchner has outright rejected the idea of a change to the treaty itself .
intentional delays ?
some are worried that klaus ' objections are merely stalling tactics , meant to allow british conservative leader david cameron to hold a promised referendum if his party wins an expected general election next year .
" if i were the eu member states , i would n't really be minded to give klaus what he wants .
he has expressed nothing but hostility towards this thing and he suddenly says he 'll do it ' if , " ' center for european policy studies researcher hugo brady told reuters. svs / reuters / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on saturday , turkey and armenia are set to sign an agreement to re-establish diplomatic ties . the swiss-brokered diplomatic deal between turkey and armenia is due to be signed in zurich on saturday . attended by the foreign ministers of russia , france and the us secretary of state hillary clinton , many have high hopes for improving relations between these neighboring nations .
ana , a nanny for a turkish family in istanbul , is one of thousands of armenians forced to look for work abroad because of turkey 's trade embargo against armenia .
she says life in istanbul is hard , because of the closed frontier between the two nations .
" we are illegal and earn very little money , and you always have to avoid the police as you could be arrested at any time and deported , " she said .
ana was overjoyed at the news that turkey was prepared to re-establish ties with armenia .
in 1993 , turkey severed ties and closed its border after armenia fought a war with turkish ally azerbaijan over the disputed nagorno karabakh enclave .
" i ca n't wait for the embargo to be lifted , " she said .
" it will change everything , for both our countries .
we just want peace and normalcy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has said the agreement will normalize bilateral relations between turkey and armenia .
but some experts caution that , while it 's an important gesture , it 's only the first step .
" it 's pretty significant , but then the protocols will be sent to the respective parliaments for ratification and that 's when the deal gets a bit more complicated , as there is strong opposition both in armenia and turkey , " said soli ozel , an expert on international relations at istanbul 's bilgi university .
critics say deal betrays azerbaijan turkey 's main opposition parties have condemned the announcement , accusing the government of betraying its ally azerbaijan .
armenian forces also continue to occupy a large part of azeri territory .
the government has been quick to dispel accusations of betrayal , saying it remains committed to azerbaijan .
erdogan said on friday that turkey " would never take part in a process which puts azerbaijan in a difficult situation " .
suat kiniklioglu , spokesman of the turkish parliament 's foreign affairs committee , insisted earlier this month that resolving azeri grievances remains key to restoring armenian-turkish relations .
" without movement on the karabahk issue , the normalization process would be difficult to sustain .
all the stars really do have to be aligned , " kiniklioglu said .
ozel says the alignment is right , however , because for the first time since the conflict , major powers have a common interest in bringing stability to the region .
" my understanding is that there is almost near agreement on a framework between azerbaijan and armenia , " ozel said .
" the americans are behind these developments , but russia 's role is more important because the russians can block it anytime they want .
but i think it serves their purpose too , because russian and american relations seem to be on a better track now .
the russians may wish to be on the right side of things . "
russian support is key such a diplomatic breakthrough in resolving the seemingly intractable dispute between armenia and azerbaijan will be crucial if the government is to sell the opening of the armenian border to its people .
on the streets of istanbul , for example , there remains suspicion of armenia and widespread support for azerbaijan , even among supporters of restoring diplomatic relations with armenia .
bildunterschrift : armenians say the ottoman turks carried out a campaign of genocide between 1915 and 1923 a historical controversy between armenia and turkey could yet undermine attempts to re-establish ties .
many in the international community accuse turkey 's then-ottoman rulers of committing genocide against its armenian minority between 1915 and 1923 .
ankara strongly denies the charge .
the controversy continues to sour relations and add to the deep suspicion within the country over the rapprochement .
" this discourse about genocide is being imposed on us by great western powers ; that 's why the debate about opening the border is not a simple question , for anybody , " said political scientist and newspaper columnist , nuray mert .
" the political opposition , knowing that it is a very sensitive issue , is using it against the government so that the issue is becoming even more complicated . "
the message to ankara from both washington and brussels is : forget about the opposition and open the border .

the controversy continues to sour relations and add to the deep suspicion within the country over the rapprochement .

on saturday , turkey and armenia are set to sign an agreement to re-establish diplomatic ties . the swiss-brokered diplomatic deal between turkey and armenia is due to be signed in zurich on saturday . attended by the foreign ministers of russia , france and the us secretary of state hillary clinton , many have high hopes for improving relations between these neighboring nations .
ana , a nanny for a turkish family in istanbul , is one of thousands of armenians forced to look for work abroad because of turkey 's trade embargo against armenia .
she says life in istanbul is hard , because of the closed frontier between the two nations .
" we are illegal and earn very little money , and you always have to avoid the police as you could be arrested at any time and deported , " she said .
ana was overjoyed at the news that turkey was prepared to re-establish ties with armenia .
in 1993 , turkey severed ties and closed its border after armenia fought a war with turkish ally azerbaijan over the disputed nagorno karabakh enclave .
" i ca n't wait for the embargo to be lifted , " she said .
" it will change everything , for both our countries .
we just want peace and normalcy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has said the agreement will normalize bilateral relations between turkey and armenia .
but some experts caution that , while it 's an important gesture , it 's only the first step .
" it 's pretty significant , but then the protocols will be sent to the respective parliaments for ratification and that 's when the deal gets a bit more complicated , as there is strong opposition both in armenia and turkey , " said soli ozel , an expert on international relations at istanbul 's bilgi university .
critics say deal betrays azerbaijan turkey 's main opposition parties have condemned the announcement , accusing the government of betraying its ally azerbaijan .
armenian forces also continue to occupy a large part of azeri territory .
the government has been quick to dispel accusations of betrayal , saying it remains committed to azerbaijan .
erdogan said on friday that turkey " would never take part in a process which puts azerbaijan in a difficult situation " .
suat kiniklioglu , spokesman of the turkish parliament 's foreign affairs committee , insisted earlier this month that resolving azeri grievances remains key to restoring armenian-turkish relations .
" without movement on the karabahk issue , the normalization process would be difficult to sustain .
all the stars really do have to be aligned , " kiniklioglu said .
ozel says the alignment is right , however , because for the first time since the conflict , major powers have a common interest in bringing stability to the region .
" my understanding is that there is almost near agreement on a framework between azerbaijan and armenia , " ozel said .

a german car expert has told dw there 's no time left to arrange a new deal before opel goes bust . spain 's industry minister miguel sebastian , on a visit to berlin to discuss the future of opel , has made it clear that his country will not commit to helping the magna buyout under the current terms . " we are not in the right place , to discuss the exact share of state aid that the spanish government might offer , " sebastian said , after opting out of a special meeting in berlin designed to address the rescue plan . spain is calling for magna to guarantee the future of the opel factory in figueruelas , near zaragoza before it commits to helping the canadian car parts maker and its russian backers take command of opel from former parent company general motors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain fears that its factories and workforce are set to lose out so far , magna has only made such promises to german opel factories , and has announced plans to cull around 10,000 jobs across europe in a bid to restore opel 's profitability .

british secretary of state for business , peter mandelson , called for changes to magna 's business plan in an interview with the daily telegraph newspaper , so as to avoid what he described as " negative consequences " for opel 's vauxhall arm . speed of the essence ? german auto industry expert ferdinand dudenhoeffer believes that there is no time to re-evaluate the magna buyout of opel , saying the bid is opel 's only possible solution . " it makes absolutely no sense to continue with general motors , because the employees do n't want that and it was unsuccessful over the last 15 to 20 years , " dudenhoeffer says .
" if they go out and search for a new investor now , they will need at least 12 months to broker a new deal .
and in that time , opel will fall into bankruptcy . " magna needs 4.5 billion euros in state aid to complete its buyout , and wants to finalize the takeover deal with current opel owners general motors in the coming week .
however , with european governments still wrangling over who should pay what , and the deal under european union scrutiny to see if it is anti-competitive , this target is looking increasingly optimistic .

" they had all this time in the last four months to initiate discussion on the opel deal , " he says .
" they rejected , they did n't provide any money , and now they want to stop the deal and put the opel factories - and the brand itself - in jeopardy .

mesut oezil made a brilliant pass which drew russian goalkeeper igor akenfeyev off his line leaving an empty net which klose capitalized on .
the win means germany have qualified for the 2010 world cup in south africa .
the team now has 25 points , four ahead of russia , with one match remaining to be played in group four .
after the match , germany coach joachim loew was satisfied with his team 's performance .
" i was convinced the whole week we would be very concentrated .
i felt everyone had the will to win here and not to play for a draw , " said loew , and added , " of course i have to say , too , that we also had a bit of luck in some situations . "
the game started slowly with each side sizing up the other .
loew had put together a defensive-minded line-up by giving a first cap to hamburg defender jerome boateng , lining up five midfielders and leaving klose on his own up front .
klose scores the winning goal andrei arshavin gave russia the best chance it had in the first half when he slipped away from boateng in midfield , maneuvered around simon rolfes and then found vladimir bystrov , who failed to score when his weak kick was saved by germany goalkeeper rene adler .

bystrov also got close to scoring with an amazing overhead kick .
not to be outdone , germany came back right away with a long-range kick from oezil which bounced off the top bar .
now , russia started to threaten with every attack and wasted another great opportunity when yuriy zhirkov broke into the goal area but found no one to pass to him .
when russia led another attack down the left , boateng brought bystrov down in the 69th minute which led to a second yellow card from swiss referee massimo busacca .
the german squad had to spend the last 20 minutes playing one man short .
german goalkeeper adler was the man of the evening it was a busy night for german keeper adler who then again saved a goal on a shot by pavlyuchenko by parrying it wide of the near post after arshavin sent the tottenham striker clear on the right .
an appeal for a late penalty was turned down when arne friedrich , in as a substitute , brought down bystrov .
with the win over russia , germany is guaranteed a spot in the 2010 world cup in south africa and thus the last group match against finland in hamburg on october 14 is now academic .
russia plays azerbaijan in baku , next .

but even as international dignitaries gathered to observe the signing , the armenian representatives unexpectedly demanded a review of the closing statement 's wording .
us secretary of state hillary clinton finally managed to bring the parties together by arranging a compromise that led to no statement being read at the end of the signing ceremony .
so , in the end , both davutoglu and nalbandian signed the accord and shook hands to applause from onlookers . the european union quickly welcomed the agreement .
" the european commission warmly welcomes the signature by the armenian and turkish foreign ministers ... of the protocols on establishing diplomatic relations and developing bilateral relations , including the opening of the common border , " said a statement from the eu commission .
the statement further congratulated both parties on their efforts .
" the commission considers it a courageous and far-sighted step forward towards peace and stability in the south caucasus region and a truly historic decision showing readiness to compromise on both sides . "
the signing of the protocols comes after a year of negotiations mediated by the swiss , and although it is a welcome step forward , it must now be ratified by both the turkish and armenian parliaments to take effect .
there is considerable resistance to the protocols in both parliaments , however , so it remains unclear when final ratification will occur .

protests were not limited to armenia .
in beirut , thousands of lebanese-armenians marched against the plans to establish diplomatic ties between ankara and yerevan at a gathering outside the turkish embassy , as well as the armenian patriarchate near beirut .
one of the most difficult issues remaining unresolved between turks and armenians is the matter of armenian assertions that turkey carried out genocide in the early 20th century .
in 1915 , armenians claim that ottoman turks systematically killed nearly 1.5 million armenians .
yerevan has campaigned for years to have the deaths recognized internationally as genocide .
turkey has rejected the claims .
now , as part of the new protocols , turkey and armenia have agreed to form an historical commission to look into the events that occurred during world war i. there is also serious contention between the two nations over the issue of nagorno-karabakh , which broke away from armenia in 1993 .

but even as international dignitaries gathered to observe the signing , the armenian representatives unexpectedly demanded a review of the closing statement 's wording .
us secretary of state hillary clinton finally managed to bring the parties together by arranging a compromise that led to no statement being read at the end of the signing ceremony .
so , in the end , both davutoglu and nalbandian signed the accord and shook hands to applause from onlookers . the european union quickly welcomed the agreement .
" the european commission warmly welcomes the signature by the armenian and turkish foreign ministers ... of the protocols on establishing diplomatic relations and developing bilateral relations , including the opening of the common border , " said a statement from the eu commission .
the statement further congratulated both parties on their efforts .
" the commission considers it a courageous and far-sighted step forward towards peace and stability in the south caucasus region and a truly historic decision showing readiness to compromise on both sides . "
the signing of the protocols comes after a year of negotiations mediated by the swiss , and although it is a welcome step forward , it must now be ratified by both the turkish and armenian parliaments to take effect .
there is considerable resistance to the protocols in both parliaments , however , so it remains unclear when final ratification will occur .

this is klaus ' latest objection , but not his first .
a staunch euroskeptic , he opposes the treaty as a matter of principle , believing it yields too much sovereignty to the international bloc .
earlier in the week , he had said he could not sign the treaty until the czech courts reviewed its constitutionality .
poland and britain have secured exemptions and the czech republic would not be the first eu country to seek such an exemption .
poland , whose president lech kaczynski signed the treaty on saturday , negotiated an opt-out for such property claims and secured guarantees that the charter would not force them to allow gay marriage .
britain was assured that the treaty would not supercede their national judicial system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 3 million ethnic germans were forced to leave the former czechoslovakia after the war " before ratification , the czech republic must , additionally at least , negotiate a similar exemption , " said klaus .
" i believe that this exemption can be resolved quickly . "
but because all the other eu countries have ratified the treaty , winning such an exemption for the czech republic would theoretically require its renegotiation .
that duty would fall on the shoulders of the czech government , led by prime minister jan fischer .
fischer said previous reviews of the treaty judged that claims like those feared by klaus would be unlikely .
but he said his interim cabinet would nonetheless discuss the issue monday and that he still hoped the treaty could be ratified before the year 's end .
renegotiation could be avoided if eu leaders pass an official declaration that would not be part of the treaty .
french foreign minister bernard kouchner has outright rejected the idea of a change to the treaty itself .
intentional delays ?
some are worried that klaus ' objections are merely stalling tactics , meant to allow british conservative leader david cameron to hold a promised referendum if his party wins an expected general election next year .
" if i were the eu member states , i would n't really be minded to give klaus what he wants .
he has expressed nothing but hostility towards this thing and he suddenly says he 'll do it ' if , " ' center for european policy studies researcher hugo brady told reuters. svs / reuters / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on saturday , turkey and armenia are set to sign an agreement to re-establish diplomatic ties . the swiss-brokered diplomatic deal between turkey and armenia is due to be signed in zurich on saturday . attended by the foreign ministers of russia , france and the us secretary of state hillary clinton , many have high hopes for improving relations between these neighboring nations .
ana , a nanny for a turkish family in istanbul , is one of thousands of armenians forced to look for work abroad because of turkey 's trade embargo against armenia .
she says life in istanbul is hard , because of the closed frontier between the two nations .
" we are illegal and earn very little money , and you always have to avoid the police as you could be arrested at any time and deported , " she said .
ana was overjoyed at the news that turkey was prepared to re-establish ties with armenia .
in 1993 , turkey severed ties and closed its border after armenia fought a war with turkish ally azerbaijan over the disputed nagorno karabakh enclave .
" i ca n't wait for the embargo to be lifted , " she said .
" it will change everything , for both our countries .
we just want peace and normalcy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has said the agreement will normalize bilateral relations between turkey and armenia .
but some experts caution that , while it 's an important gesture , it 's only the first step .
" it 's pretty significant , but then the protocols will be sent to the respective parliaments for ratification and that 's when the deal gets a bit more complicated , as there is strong opposition both in armenia and turkey , " said soli ozel , an expert on international relations at istanbul 's bilgi university .
critics say deal betrays azerbaijan turkey 's main opposition parties have condemned the announcement , accusing the government of betraying its ally azerbaijan .
armenian forces also continue to occupy a large part of azeri territory .
the government has been quick to dispel accusations of betrayal , saying it remains committed to azerbaijan .
erdogan said on friday that turkey " would never take part in a process which puts azerbaijan in a difficult situation " .
suat kiniklioglu , spokesman of the turkish parliament 's foreign affairs committee , insisted earlier this month that resolving azeri grievances remains key to restoring armenian-turkish relations .
" without movement on the karabahk issue , the normalization process would be difficult to sustain .
all the stars really do have to be aligned , " kiniklioglu said .
ozel says the alignment is right , however , because for the first time since the conflict , major powers have a common interest in bringing stability to the region .
" my understanding is that there is almost near agreement on a framework between azerbaijan and armenia , " ozel said .
" the americans are behind these developments , but russia 's role is more important because the russians can block it anytime they want .
but i think it serves their purpose too , because russian and american relations seem to be on a better track now .

russian support is key such a diplomatic breakthrough in resolving the seemingly intractable dispute between armenia and azerbaijan will be crucial if the government is to sell the opening of the armenian border to its people .
on the streets of istanbul , for example , there remains suspicion of armenia and widespread support for azerbaijan , even among supporters of restoring diplomatic relations with armenia .
bildunterschrift : armenians say the ottoman turks carried out a campaign of genocide between 1915 and 1923 a historical controversy between armenia and turkey could yet undermine attempts to re-establish ties .
many in the international community accuse turkey 's then-ottoman rulers of committing genocide against its armenian minority between 1915 and 1923 .
ankara strongly denies the charge .
the controversy continues to sour relations and add to the deep suspicion within the country over the rapprochement .
" this discourse about genocide is being imposed on us by great western powers ; that 's why the debate about opening the border is not a simple question , for anybody , " said political scientist and newspaper columnist , nuray mert .
" the political opposition , knowing that it is a very sensitive issue , is using it against the government so that the issue is becoming even more complicated . "
the message to ankara from both washington and brussels is : forget about the opposition and open the border .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 10.10.2009 czech president demands more changes to lisbon treaty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech republic is now the only country that has n't ratified the lisbon treaty czech president vaclav klaus has thrown another wrench into the lisbon treaty ratification process , this time seeking an exemption to prevent germans expelled during world war ii from using it to reclaim property . klaus wants the czech republic to be exempt from the charter of fundamental rights , which he believes would expose the country to restitution claims from ethnic germans expelled from what was then czechoslovakia in the aftermath of the war . he argues that the charter would let claimants circumvent national courts and take their case to the european court of justice .
this is klaus ' latest objection , but not his first .
a staunch euroskeptic , he opposes the treaty as a matter of principle , believing it yields too much sovereignty to the international bloc .
earlier in the week , he had said he could not sign the treaty until the czech courts reviewed its constitutionality .
poland and britain have secured exemptions and the czech republic would not be the first eu country to seek such an exemption .
poland , whose president lech kaczynski signed the treaty on saturday , negotiated an opt-out for such property claims and secured guarantees that the charter would not force them to allow gay marriage .
britain was assured that the treaty would not supercede their national judicial system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 3 million ethnic germans were forced to leave the former czechoslovakia after the war " before ratification , the czech republic must , additionally at least , negotiate a similar exemption , " said klaus .
" i believe that this exemption can be resolved quickly . "
but because all the other eu countries have ratified the treaty , winning such an exemption for the czech republic would theoretically require its renegotiation .
that duty would fall on the shoulders of the czech government , led by prime minister jan fischer .
fischer said previous reviews of the treaty judged that claims like those feared by klaus would be unlikely .
but he said his interim cabinet would nonetheless discuss the issue monday and that he still hoped the treaty could be ratified before the year 's end .
renegotiation could be avoided if eu leaders pass an official declaration that would not be part of the treaty .
french foreign minister bernard kouchner has outright rejected the idea of a change to the treaty itself .
intentional delays ?
some are worried that klaus ' objections are merely stalling tactics , meant to allow british conservative leader david cameron to hold a promised referendum if his party wins an expected general election next year .
" if i were the eu member states , i would n't really be minded to give klaus what he wants .
he has expressed nothing but hostility towards this thing and he suddenly says he 'll do it ' if , " ' center for european policy studies researcher hugo brady told reuters. svs / reuters / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

mesut oezil made a brilliant pass which drew russian goalkeeper igor akenfeyev off his line leaving an empty net which klose capitalized on .
the win means germany have qualified for the 2010 world cup in south africa .
the team now has 25 points , four ahead of russia , with one match remaining to be played in group four .
after the match , germany coach joachim loew was satisfied with his team 's performance .
" i was convinced the whole week we would be very concentrated .
i felt everyone had the will to win here and not to play for a draw , " said loew , and added , " of course i have to say , too , that we also had a bit of luck in some situations . "
the game started slowly with each side sizing up the other .
loew had put together a defensive-minded line-up by giving a first cap to hamburg defender jerome boateng , lining up five midfielders and leaving klose on his own up front .
klose scores the winning goal andrei arshavin gave russia the best chance it had in the first half when he slipped away from boateng in midfield , maneuvered around simon rolfes and then found vladimir bystrov , who failed to score when his weak kick was saved by germany goalkeeper rene adler .
only five minutes later , klose scored .
bildunterschrift : germany 's players celebrate after scoring against russia during their world cup group 4 qualifying soccer match in moscow russia stepped up the pressure within three minutes when arshavin had two fierce shots on goal , but both were saved by adler .
bystrov also got close to scoring with an amazing overhead kick .
not to be outdone , germany came back right away with a long-range kick from oezil which bounced off the top bar .
now , russia started to threaten with every attack and wasted another great opportunity when yuriy zhirkov broke into the goal area but found no one to pass to him .
when russia led another attack down the left , boateng brought bystrov down in the 69th minute which led to a second yellow card from swiss referee massimo busacca .
the german squad had to spend the last 20 minutes playing one man short .
german goalkeeper adler was the man of the evening it was a busy night for german keeper adler who then again saved a goal on a shot by pavlyuchenko by parrying it wide of the near post after arshavin sent the tottenham striker clear on the right .
an appeal for a late penalty was turned down when arne friedrich , in as a substitute , brought down bystrov .
with the win over russia , germany is guaranteed a spot in the 2010 world cup in south africa and thus the last group match against finland in hamburg on october 14 is now academic .
russia plays azerbaijan in baku , next .
the biggest question of the night was how germany would perform on the artificial turf of luzhniki stadium .
no german national team had ever played on artificial turf before .
that question has now been answered. av / dpa / reuters editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a german car expert has told dw there 's no time left to arrange a new deal before opel goes bust . spain 's industry minister miguel sebastian , on a visit to berlin to discuss the future of opel , has made it clear that his country will not commit to helping the magna buyout under the current terms . " we are not in the right place , to discuss the exact share of state aid that the spanish government might offer , " sebastian said , after opting out of a special meeting in berlin designed to address the rescue plan . spain is calling for magna to guarantee the future of the opel factory in figueruelas , near zaragoza before it commits to helping the canadian car parts maker and its russian backers take command of opel from former parent company general motors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain fears that its factories and workforce are set to lose out so far , magna has only made such promises to german opel factories , and has announced plans to cull around 10,000 jobs across europe in a bid to restore opel 's profitability .
countries like belgium , great britain , and spain are worried that their opel factories - and their economies , by extension - will suffer the job cuts , and are therefore unwilling to help berlin push through the opel deal . the uk government is watching ongoing negotiations between magna and british trade unions about the future of vauxhall -lrb- the british badge for opel -rrb- factories , saying that these are yet to produce " satisfactory results . "
british secretary of state for business , peter mandelson , called for changes to magna 's business plan in an interview with the daily telegraph newspaper , so as to avoid what he described as " negative consequences " for opel 's vauxhall arm . speed of the essence ? german auto industry expert ferdinand dudenhoeffer believes that there is no time to re-evaluate the magna buyout of opel , saying the bid is opel 's only possible solution . " it makes absolutely no sense to continue with general motors , because the employees do n't want that and it was unsuccessful over the last 15 to 20 years , " dudenhoeffer says .
" if they go out and search for a new investor now , they will need at least 12 months to broker a new deal .
and in that time , opel will fall into bankruptcy . " magna needs 4.5 billion euros in state aid to complete its buyout , and wants to finalize the takeover deal with current opel owners general motors in the coming week .
however , with european governments still wrangling over who should pay what , and the deal under european union scrutiny to see if it is anti-competitive , this target is looking increasingly optimistic .
bildunterschrift : opel hopes its new astra will help it turn a profit before it 's too late dudenhoeffer says that german industry experts are baffled by the stance that spain and the uk are now taking with regard to the opel takeover . " they had all this time in the last four months to initiate discussion on the opel deal , " he says .
" they rejected , they did n't provide any money , and now they want to stop the deal and put the opel factories - and the brand itself - in jeopardy . " more meetings magna bosses will have another chance to woo the spanish government on tuesday at a meeting in madrid . " we expect clear progress to come out of this meeting , " industry minister miguel sebastian said in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors in antwerp may need to take to the streets again , the city 's opel factory is still in danger spain is concerned that magna plans to move the production of the opel corsa from the figueruelas factory to eisenach in germany .
sebastian met with his german counterpart karl-theodor zu guttenberg in berlin on friday , rather than attending the magna discussions . representatives from germany , great britain , belgium , austria , hungary , poland and the european commission were present at the official meeting . the future of opel was a major issue during germany 's election campaign , and the social democrats have already seen the opportunity to capitalize , should the deal now fail . the spd state premier for rheinland palatinate , kurt beck , has already bemoaned the " alarming signals coming out of berlin " on the future of opel .

mesut oezil made a brilliant pass which drew russian goalkeeper igor akenfeyev off his line leaving an empty net which klose capitalized on .
the win means germany have qualified for the 2010 world cup in south africa .
the team now has 25 points , four ahead of russia , with one match remaining to be played in group four .
after the match , germany coach joachim loew was satisfied with his team 's performance .
" i was convinced the whole week we would be very concentrated .
i felt everyone had the will to win here and not to play for a draw , " said loew , and added , " of course i have to say , too , that we also had a bit of luck in some situations . "
the game started slowly with each side sizing up the other .
loew had put together a defensive-minded line-up by giving a first cap to hamburg defender jerome boateng , lining up five midfielders and leaving klose on his own up front .
klose scores the winning goal andrei arshavin gave russia the best chance it had in the first half when he slipped away from boateng in midfield , maneuvered around simon rolfes and then found vladimir bystrov , who failed to score when his weak kick was saved by germany goalkeeper rene adler .
only five minutes later , klose scored .
bildunterschrift : germany 's players celebrate after scoring against russia during their world cup group 4 qualifying soccer match in moscow russia stepped up the pressure within three minutes when arshavin had two fierce shots on goal , but both were saved by adler .
bystrov also got close to scoring with an amazing overhead kick .
not to be outdone , germany came back right away with a long-range kick from oezil which bounced off the top bar .
now , russia started to threaten with every attack and wasted another great opportunity when yuriy zhirkov broke into the goal area but found no one to pass to him .
when russia led another attack down the left , boateng brought bystrov down in the 69th minute which led to a second yellow card from swiss referee massimo busacca .
the german squad had to spend the last 20 minutes playing one man short .
german goalkeeper adler was the man of the evening it was a busy night for german keeper adler who then again saved a goal on a shot by pavlyuchenko by parrying it wide of the near post after arshavin sent the tottenham striker clear on the right .
an appeal for a late penalty was turned down when arne friedrich , in as a substitute , brought down bystrov .
with the win over russia , germany is guaranteed a spot in the 2010 world cup in south africa and thus the last group match against finland in hamburg on october 14 is now academic .
russia plays azerbaijan in baku , next .
the biggest question of the night was how germany would perform on the artificial turf of luzhniki stadium .
no german national team had ever played on artificial turf before .
that question has now been answered. av / dpa / reuters editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this is klaus ' latest objection , but not his first .
a staunch euroskeptic , he opposes the treaty as a matter of principle , believing it yields too much sovereignty to the international bloc .
earlier in the week , he had said he could not sign the treaty until the czech courts reviewed its constitutionality .
poland and britain have secured exemptions and the czech republic would not be the first eu country to seek such an exemption .
poland , whose president lech kaczynski signed the treaty on saturday , negotiated an opt-out for such property claims and secured guarantees that the charter would not force them to allow gay marriage .
britain was assured that the treaty would not supercede their national judicial system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 3 million ethnic germans were forced to leave the former czechoslovakia after the war " before ratification , the czech republic must , additionally at least , negotiate a similar exemption , " said klaus .
" i believe that this exemption can be resolved quickly . "
but because all the other eu countries have ratified the treaty , winning such an exemption for the czech republic would theoretically require its renegotiation .
that duty would fall on the shoulders of the czech government , led by prime minister jan fischer .
fischer said previous reviews of the treaty judged that claims like those feared by klaus would be unlikely .
but he said his interim cabinet would nonetheless discuss the issue monday and that he still hoped the treaty could be ratified before the year 's end .
renegotiation could be avoided if eu leaders pass an official declaration that would not be part of the treaty .
french foreign minister bernard kouchner has outright rejected the idea of a change to the treaty itself .
intentional delays ?
some are worried that klaus ' objections are merely stalling tactics , meant to allow british conservative leader david cameron to hold a promised referendum if his party wins an expected general election next year .
" if i were the eu member states , i would n't really be minded to give klaus what he wants .
he has expressed nothing but hostility towards this thing and he suddenly says he 'll do it ' if , " ' center for european policy studies researcher hugo brady told reuters. svs / reuters / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a german car expert has told dw there 's no time left to arrange a new deal before opel goes bust . spain 's industry minister miguel sebastian , on a visit to berlin to discuss the future of opel , has made it clear that his country will not commit to helping the magna buyout under the current terms . " we are not in the right place , to discuss the exact share of state aid that the spanish government might offer , " sebastian said , after opting out of a special meeting in berlin designed to address the rescue plan . spain is calling for magna to guarantee the future of the opel factory in figueruelas , near zaragoza before it commits to helping the canadian car parts maker and its russian backers take command of opel from former parent company general motors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain fears that its factories and workforce are set to lose out so far , magna has only made such promises to german opel factories , and has announced plans to cull around 10,000 jobs across europe in a bid to restore opel 's profitability .
countries like belgium , great britain , and spain are worried that their opel factories - and their economies , by extension - will suffer the job cuts , and are therefore unwilling to help berlin push through the opel deal . the uk government is watching ongoing negotiations between magna and british trade unions about the future of vauxhall -lrb- the british badge for opel -rrb- factories , saying that these are yet to produce " satisfactory results . "
british secretary of state for business , peter mandelson , called for changes to magna 's business plan in an interview with the daily telegraph newspaper , so as to avoid what he described as " negative consequences " for opel 's vauxhall arm . speed of the essence ? german auto industry expert ferdinand dudenhoeffer believes that there is no time to re-evaluate the magna buyout of opel , saying the bid is opel 's only possible solution . " it makes absolutely no sense to continue with general motors , because the employees do n't want that and it was unsuccessful over the last 15 to 20 years , " dudenhoeffer says .
" if they go out and search for a new investor now , they will need at least 12 months to broker a new deal .
and in that time , opel will fall into bankruptcy . " magna needs 4.5 billion euros in state aid to complete its buyout , and wants to finalize the takeover deal with current opel owners general motors in the coming week .
however , with european governments still wrangling over who should pay what , and the deal under european union scrutiny to see if it is anti-competitive , this target is looking increasingly optimistic .
bildunterschrift : opel hopes its new astra will help it turn a profit before it 's too late dudenhoeffer says that german industry experts are baffled by the stance that spain and the uk are now taking with regard to the opel takeover . " they had all this time in the last four months to initiate discussion on the opel deal , " he says .
" they rejected , they did n't provide any money , and now they want to stop the deal and put the opel factories - and the brand itself - in jeopardy . " more meetings magna bosses will have another chance to woo the spanish government on tuesday at a meeting in madrid . " we expect clear progress to come out of this meeting , " industry minister miguel sebastian said in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors in antwerp may need to take to the streets again , the city 's opel factory is still in danger spain is concerned that magna plans to move the production of the opel corsa from the figueruelas factory to eisenach in germany .
sebastian met with his german counterpart karl-theodor zu guttenberg in berlin on friday , rather than attending the magna discussions . representatives from germany , great britain , belgium , austria , hungary , poland and the european commission were present at the official meeting . the future of opel was a major issue during germany 's election campaign , and the social democrats have already seen the opportunity to capitalize , should the deal now fail . the spd state premier for rheinland palatinate , kurt beck , has already bemoaned the " alarming signals coming out of berlin " on the future of opel .

british secretary of state for business , peter mandelson , called for changes to magna 's business plan in an interview with the daily telegraph newspaper , so as to avoid what he described as " negative consequences " for opel 's vauxhall arm . speed of the essence ? german auto industry expert ferdinand dudenhoeffer believes that there is no time to re-evaluate the magna buyout of opel , saying the bid is opel 's only possible solution . " it makes absolutely no sense to continue with general motors , because the employees do n't want that and it was unsuccessful over the last 15 to 20 years , " dudenhoeffer says .
" if they go out and search for a new investor now , they will need at least 12 months to broker a new deal .
and in that time , opel will fall into bankruptcy . " magna needs 4.5 billion euros in state aid to complete its buyout , and wants to finalize the takeover deal with current opel owners general motors in the coming week .
however , with european governments still wrangling over who should pay what , and the deal under european union scrutiny to see if it is anti-competitive , this target is looking increasingly optimistic .
bildunterschrift : opel hopes its new astra will help it turn a profit before it 's too late dudenhoeffer says that german industry experts are baffled by the stance that spain and the uk are now taking with regard to the opel takeover . " they had all this time in the last four months to initiate discussion on the opel deal , " he says .
" they rejected , they did n't provide any money , and now they want to stop the deal and put the opel factories - and the brand itself - in jeopardy . " more meetings magna bosses will have another chance to woo the spanish government on tuesday at a meeting in madrid . " we expect clear progress to come out of this meeting , " industry minister miguel sebastian said in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors in antwerp may need to take to the streets again , the city 's opel factory is still in danger spain is concerned that magna plans to move the production of the opel corsa from the figueruelas factory to eisenach in germany .
sebastian met with his german counterpart karl-theodor zu guttenberg in berlin on friday , rather than attending the magna discussions . representatives from germany , great britain , belgium , austria , hungary , poland and the european commission were present at the official meeting . the future of opel was a major issue during germany 's election campaign , and the social democrats have already seen the opportunity to capitalize , should the deal now fail . the spd state premier for rheinland palatinate , kurt beck , has already bemoaned the " alarming signals coming out of berlin " on the future of opel . " thousands of jobs are at stake - within opel , and at opel 's suppliers . " roughly half of general motors europe 's 54,000-plus employees are based in germany . msh / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this is klaus ' latest objection , but not his first .

earlier in the week , he had said he could not sign the treaty until the czech courts reviewed its constitutionality .

this is klaus ' latest objection , but not his first .
a staunch euroskeptic , he opposes the treaty as a matter of principle , believing it yields too much sovereignty to the international bloc .
earlier in the week , he had said he could not sign the treaty until the czech courts reviewed its constitutionality .
poland and britain have secured exemptions and the czech republic would not be the first eu country to seek such an exemption .
poland , whose president lech kaczynski signed the treaty on saturday , negotiated an opt-out for such property claims and secured guarantees that the charter would not force them to allow gay marriage .
britain was assured that the treaty would not supercede their national judicial system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 3 million ethnic germans were forced to leave the former czechoslovakia after the war " before ratification , the czech republic must , additionally at least , negotiate a similar exemption , " said klaus .
" i believe that this exemption can be resolved quickly . "
but because all the other eu countries have ratified the treaty , winning such an exemption for the czech republic would theoretically require its renegotiation .
that duty would fall on the shoulders of the czech government , led by prime minister jan fischer .
fischer said previous reviews of the treaty judged that claims like those feared by klaus would be unlikely .
but he said his interim cabinet would nonetheless discuss the issue monday and that he still hoped the treaty could be ratified before the year 's end .
renegotiation could be avoided if eu leaders pass an official declaration that would not be part of the treaty .
french foreign minister bernard kouchner has outright rejected the idea of a change to the treaty itself .

on saturday , turkey and armenia are set to sign an agreement to re-establish diplomatic ties . the swiss-brokered diplomatic deal between turkey and armenia is due to be signed in zurich on saturday . attended by the foreign ministers of russia , france and the us secretary of state hillary clinton , many have high hopes for improving relations between these neighboring nations .
ana , a nanny for a turkish family in istanbul , is one of thousands of armenians forced to look for work abroad because of turkey 's trade embargo against armenia .
she says life in istanbul is hard , because of the closed frontier between the two nations .
" we are illegal and earn very little money , and you always have to avoid the police as you could be arrested at any time and deported , " she said .
ana was overjoyed at the news that turkey was prepared to re-establish ties with armenia .
in 1993 , turkey severed ties and closed its border after armenia fought a war with turkish ally azerbaijan over the disputed nagorno karabakh enclave .
" i ca n't wait for the embargo to be lifted , " she said .
" it will change everything , for both our countries .
we just want peace and normalcy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has said the agreement will normalize bilateral relations between turkey and armenia .
but some experts caution that , while it 's an important gesture , it 's only the first step .
" it 's pretty significant , but then the protocols will be sent to the respective parliaments for ratification and that 's when the deal gets a bit more complicated , as there is strong opposition both in armenia and turkey , " said soli ozel , an expert on international relations at istanbul 's bilgi university .
critics say deal betrays azerbaijan turkey 's main opposition parties have condemned the announcement , accusing the government of betraying its ally azerbaijan .
armenian forces also continue to occupy a large part of azeri territory .
the government has been quick to dispel accusations of betrayal , saying it remains committed to azerbaijan .
erdogan said on friday that turkey " would never take part in a process which puts azerbaijan in a difficult situation " .
suat kiniklioglu , spokesman of the turkish parliament 's foreign affairs committee , insisted earlier this month that resolving azeri grievances remains key to restoring armenian-turkish relations .
" without movement on the karabahk issue , the normalization process would be difficult to sustain .
all the stars really do have to be aligned , " kiniklioglu said .
ozel says the alignment is right , however , because for the first time since the conflict , major powers have a common interest in bringing stability to the region .
" my understanding is that there is almost near agreement on a framework between azerbaijan and armenia , " ozel said .
" the americans are behind these developments , but russia 's role is more important because the russians can block it anytime they want .
but i think it serves their purpose too , because russian and american relations seem to be on a better track now .
the russians may wish to be on the right side of things . "
russian support is key such a diplomatic breakthrough in resolving the seemingly intractable dispute between armenia and azerbaijan will be crucial if the government is to sell the opening of the armenian border to its people .
on the streets of istanbul , for example , there remains suspicion of armenia and widespread support for azerbaijan , even among supporters of restoring diplomatic relations with armenia .
bildunterschrift : armenians say the ottoman turks carried out a campaign of genocide between 1915 and 1923 a historical controversy between armenia and turkey could yet undermine attempts to re-establish ties .
many in the international community accuse turkey 's then-ottoman rulers of committing genocide against its armenian minority between 1915 and 1923 .
ankara strongly denies the charge .
the controversy continues to sour relations and add to the deep suspicion within the country over the rapprochement .
" this discourse about genocide is being imposed on us by great western powers ; that 's why the debate about opening the border is not a simple question , for anybody , " said political scientist and newspaper columnist , nuray mert .
" the political opposition , knowing that it is a very sensitive issue , is using it against the government so that the issue is becoming even more complicated . "
the message to ankara from both washington and brussels is : forget about the opposition and open the border .
but with critics of the deal in all political circles increasingly voicing their opposition , that 's easier said than done , many analysts say .

ana , a nanny for a turkish family in istanbul , is one of thousands of armenians forced to look for work abroad because of turkey 's trade embargo against armenia .
she says life in istanbul is hard , because of the closed frontier between the two nations .
" we are illegal and earn very little money , and you always have to avoid the police as you could be arrested at any time and deported , " she said .
ana was overjoyed at the news that turkey was prepared to re-establish ties with armenia .
in 1993 , turkey severed ties and closed its border after armenia fought a war with turkish ally azerbaijan over the disputed nagorno karabakh enclave .
" i ca n't wait for the embargo to be lifted , " she said .
" it will change everything , for both our countries .
we just want peace and normalcy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has said the agreement will normalize bilateral relations between turkey and armenia .

critics say deal betrays azerbaijan turkey 's main opposition parties have condemned the announcement , accusing the government of betraying its ally azerbaijan .
armenian forces also continue to occupy a large part of azeri territory .
the government has been quick to dispel accusations of betrayal , saying it remains committed to azerbaijan .
erdogan said on friday that turkey " would never take part in a process which puts azerbaijan in a difficult situation " .
suat kiniklioglu , spokesman of the turkish parliament 's foreign affairs committee , insisted earlier this month that resolving azeri grievances remains key to restoring armenian-turkish relations .
" without movement on the karabahk issue , the normalization process would be difficult to sustain .
all the stars really do have to be aligned , " kiniklioglu said .
ozel says the alignment is right , however , because for the first time since the conflict , major powers have a common interest in bringing stability to the region .
" my understanding is that there is almost near agreement on a framework between azerbaijan and armenia , " ozel said .
" the americans are behind these developments , but russia 's role is more important because the russians can block it anytime they want .
but i think it serves their purpose too , because russian and american relations seem to be on a better track now .

on saturday , turkey and armenia are set to sign an agreement to re-establish diplomatic ties . the swiss-brokered diplomatic deal between turkey and armenia is due to be signed in zurich on saturday . attended by the foreign ministers of russia , france and the us secretary of state hillary clinton , many have high hopes for improving relations between these neighboring nations .
ana , a nanny for a turkish family in istanbul , is one of thousands of armenians forced to look for work abroad because of turkey 's trade embargo against armenia .
she says life in istanbul is hard , because of the closed frontier between the two nations .
" we are illegal and earn very little money , and you always have to avoid the police as you could be arrested at any time and deported , " she said .
ana was overjoyed at the news that turkey was prepared to re-establish ties with armenia .
in 1993 , turkey severed ties and closed its border after armenia fought a war with turkish ally azerbaijan over the disputed nagorno karabakh enclave .
" i ca n't wait for the embargo to be lifted , " she said .
" it will change everything , for both our countries .
we just want peace and normalcy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has said the agreement will normalize bilateral relations between turkey and armenia .
but some experts caution that , while it 's an important gesture , it 's only the first step .
" it 's pretty significant , but then the protocols will be sent to the respective parliaments for ratification and that 's when the deal gets a bit more complicated , as there is strong opposition both in armenia and turkey , " said soli ozel , an expert on international relations at istanbul 's bilgi university .
critics say deal betrays azerbaijan turkey 's main opposition parties have condemned the announcement , accusing the government of betraying its ally azerbaijan .
armenian forces also continue to occupy a large part of azeri territory .
the government has been quick to dispel accusations of betrayal , saying it remains committed to azerbaijan .
erdogan said on friday that turkey " would never take part in a process which puts azerbaijan in a difficult situation " .
suat kiniklioglu , spokesman of the turkish parliament 's foreign affairs committee , insisted earlier this month that resolving azeri grievances remains key to restoring armenian-turkish relations .
" without movement on the karabahk issue , the normalization process would be difficult to sustain .
all the stars really do have to be aligned , " kiniklioglu said .
ozel says the alignment is right , however , because for the first time since the conflict , major powers have a common interest in bringing stability to the region .
" my understanding is that there is almost near agreement on a framework between azerbaijan and armenia , " ozel said .
" the americans are behind these developments , but russia 's role is more important because the russians can block it anytime they want .
but i think it serves their purpose too , because russian and american relations seem to be on a better track now .
the russians may wish to be on the right side of things . "
russian support is key such a diplomatic breakthrough in resolving the seemingly intractable dispute between armenia and azerbaijan will be crucial if the government is to sell the opening of the armenian border to its people .
on the streets of istanbul , for example , there remains suspicion of armenia and widespread support for azerbaijan , even among supporters of restoring diplomatic relations with armenia .
bildunterschrift : armenians say the ottoman turks carried out a campaign of genocide between 1915 and 1923 a historical controversy between armenia and turkey could yet undermine attempts to re-establish ties .
many in the international community accuse turkey 's then-ottoman rulers of committing genocide against its armenian minority between 1915 and 1923 .
ankara strongly denies the charge .
the controversy continues to sour relations and add to the deep suspicion within the country over the rapprochement .
" this discourse about genocide is being imposed on us by great western powers ; that 's why the debate about opening the border is not a simple question , for anybody , " said political scientist and newspaper columnist , nuray mert .
" the political opposition , knowing that it is a very sensitive issue , is using it against the government so that the issue is becoming even more complicated . "
the message to ankara from both washington and brussels is : forget about the opposition and open the border .

mesut oezil made a brilliant pass which drew russian goalkeeper igor akenfeyev off his line leaving an empty net which klose capitalized on .
the win means germany have qualified for the 2010 world cup in south africa .
the team now has 25 points , four ahead of russia , with one match remaining to be played in group four .
after the match , germany coach joachim loew was satisfied with his team 's performance .
" i was convinced the whole week we would be very concentrated .
i felt everyone had the will to win here and not to play for a draw , " said loew , and added , " of course i have to say , too , that we also had a bit of luck in some situations . "
the game started slowly with each side sizing up the other .
loew had put together a defensive-minded line-up by giving a first cap to hamburg defender jerome boateng , lining up five midfielders and leaving klose on his own up front .
klose scores the winning goal andrei arshavin gave russia the best chance it had in the first half when he slipped away from boateng in midfield , maneuvered around simon rolfes and then found vladimir bystrov , who failed to score when his weak kick was saved by germany goalkeeper rene adler .

not to be outdone , germany came back right away with a long-range kick from oezil which bounced off the top bar .
now , russia started to threaten with every attack and wasted another great opportunity when yuriy zhirkov broke into the goal area but found no one to pass to him .
when russia led another attack down the left , boateng brought bystrov down in the 69th minute which led to a second yellow card from swiss referee massimo busacca .
the german squad had to spend the last 20 minutes playing one man short .
german goalkeeper adler was the man of the evening it was a busy night for german keeper adler who then again saved a goal on a shot by pavlyuchenko by parrying it wide of the near post after arshavin sent the tottenham striker clear on the right .
an appeal for a late penalty was turned down when arne friedrich , in as a substitute , brought down bystrov .
with the win over russia , germany is guaranteed a spot in the 2010 world cup in south africa and thus the last group match against finland in hamburg on october 14 is now academic .
russia plays azerbaijan in baku , next .

but even as international dignitaries gathered to observe the signing , the armenian representatives unexpectedly demanded a review of the closing statement 's wording .
us secretary of state hillary clinton finally managed to bring the parties together by arranging a compromise that led to no statement being read at the end of the signing ceremony .
so , in the end , both davutoglu and nalbandian signed the accord and shook hands to applause from onlookers . the european union quickly welcomed the agreement .
" the european commission warmly welcomes the signature by the armenian and turkish foreign ministers ... of the protocols on establishing diplomatic relations and developing bilateral relations , including the opening of the common border , " said a statement from the eu commission .
the statement further congratulated both parties on their efforts .
" the commission considers it a courageous and far-sighted step forward towards peace and stability in the south caucasus region and a truly historic decision showing readiness to compromise on both sides . "
the signing of the protocols comes after a year of negotiations mediated by the swiss , and although it is a welcome step forward , it must now be ratified by both the turkish and armenian parliaments to take effect .
there is considerable resistance to the protocols in both parliaments , however , so it remains unclear when final ratification will occur .
agreement not popular bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many armenians oppose the accords because of ottoman crimes in wwi one day before the protocols were signed , 10,000 people demonstrated in the armenian capital , yerevan , to protest the historic event .
protests were not limited to armenia .
in beirut , thousands of lebanese-armenians marched against the plans to establish diplomatic ties between ankara and yerevan at a gathering outside the turkish embassy , as well as the armenian patriarchate near beirut .
one of the most difficult issues remaining unresolved between turks and armenians is the matter of armenian assertions that turkey carried out genocide in the early 20th century .
in 1915 , armenians claim that ottoman turks systematically killed nearly 1.5 million armenians .
yerevan has campaigned for years to have the deaths recognized internationally as genocide .
turkey has rejected the claims .
now , as part of the new protocols , turkey and armenia have agreed to form an historical commission to look into the events that occurred during world war i. there is also serious contention between the two nations over the issue of nagorno-karabakh , which broke away from armenia in 1993 .
when armenia then invaded the breakaway azerbaijiani territory , turkey shut its borders with armenia , causing extreme economic hardship for the landlocked country. av / dpa / reuters / afp editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

mesut oezil made a brilliant pass which drew russian goalkeeper igor akenfeyev off his line leaving an empty net which klose capitalized on .
the win means germany have qualified for the 2010 world cup in south africa .
the team now has 25 points , four ahead of russia , with one match remaining to be played in group four .
after the match , germany coach joachim loew was satisfied with his team 's performance .
" i was convinced the whole week we would be very concentrated .
i felt everyone had the will to win here and not to play for a draw , " said loew , and added , " of course i have to say , too , that we also had a bit of luck in some situations . "
the game started slowly with each side sizing up the other .
loew had put together a defensive-minded line-up by giving a first cap to hamburg defender jerome boateng , lining up five midfielders and leaving klose on his own up front .
klose scores the winning goal andrei arshavin gave russia the best chance it had in the first half when he slipped away from boateng in midfield , maneuvered around simon rolfes and then found vladimir bystrov , who failed to score when his weak kick was saved by germany goalkeeper rene adler .
only five minutes later , klose scored .

not to be outdone , germany came back right away with a long-range kick from oezil which bounced off the top bar .

but even as international dignitaries gathered to observe the signing , the armenian representatives unexpectedly demanded a review of the closing statement 's wording .
us secretary of state hillary clinton finally managed to bring the parties together by arranging a compromise that led to no statement being read at the end of the signing ceremony .
so , in the end , both davutoglu and nalbandian signed the accord and shook hands to applause from onlookers . the european union quickly welcomed the agreement .
" the european commission warmly welcomes the signature by the armenian and turkish foreign ministers ... of the protocols on establishing diplomatic relations and developing bilateral relations , including the opening of the common border , " said a statement from the eu commission .
the statement further congratulated both parties on their efforts .
" the commission considers it a courageous and far-sighted step forward towards peace and stability in the south caucasus region and a truly historic decision showing readiness to compromise on both sides . "
the signing of the protocols comes after a year of negotiations mediated by the swiss , and although it is a welcome step forward , it must now be ratified by both the turkish and armenian parliaments to take effect .
there is considerable resistance to the protocols in both parliaments , however , so it remains unclear when final ratification will occur .

protests were not limited to armenia .
in beirut , thousands of lebanese-armenians marched against the plans to establish diplomatic ties between ankara and yerevan at a gathering outside the turkish embassy , as well as the armenian patriarchate near beirut .
one of the most difficult issues remaining unresolved between turks and armenians is the matter of armenian assertions that turkey carried out genocide in the early 20th century .
in 1915 , armenians claim that ottoman turks systematically killed nearly 1.5 million armenians .
yerevan has campaigned for years to have the deaths recognized internationally as genocide .
turkey has rejected the claims .
now , as part of the new protocols , turkey and armenia have agreed to form an historical commission to look into the events that occurred during world war i. there is also serious contention between the two nations over the issue of nagorno-karabakh , which broke away from armenia in 1993 .

but even as international dignitaries gathered to observe the signing , the armenian representatives unexpectedly demanded a review of the closing statement 's wording .
us secretary of state hillary clinton finally managed to bring the parties together by arranging a compromise that led to no statement being read at the end of the signing ceremony .
so , in the end , both davutoglu and nalbandian signed the accord and shook hands to applause from onlookers . the european union quickly welcomed the agreement .
" the european commission warmly welcomes the signature by the armenian and turkish foreign ministers ... of the protocols on establishing diplomatic relations and developing bilateral relations , including the opening of the common border , " said a statement from the eu commission .
the statement further congratulated both parties on their efforts .
" the commission considers it a courageous and far-sighted step forward towards peace and stability in the south caucasus region and a truly historic decision showing readiness to compromise on both sides . "
the signing of the protocols comes after a year of negotiations mediated by the swiss , and although it is a welcome step forward , it must now be ratified by both the turkish and armenian parliaments to take effect .
there is considerable resistance to the protocols in both parliaments , however , so it remains unclear when final ratification will occur .
agreement not popular bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many armenians oppose the accords because of ottoman crimes in wwi one day before the protocols were signed , 10,000 people demonstrated in the armenian capital , yerevan , to protest the historic event .
protests were not limited to armenia .
in beirut , thousands of lebanese-armenians marched against the plans to establish diplomatic ties between ankara and yerevan at a gathering outside the turkish embassy , as well as the armenian patriarchate near beirut .
one of the most difficult issues remaining unresolved between turks and armenians is the matter of armenian assertions that turkey carried out genocide in the early 20th century .
in 1915 , armenians claim that ottoman turks systematically killed nearly 1.5 million armenians .
yerevan has campaigned for years to have the deaths recognized internationally as genocide .
turkey has rejected the claims .
now , as part of the new protocols , turkey and armenia have agreed to form an historical commission to look into the events that occurred during world war i. there is also serious contention between the two nations over the issue of nagorno-karabakh , which broke away from armenia in 1993 .

mesut oezil made a brilliant pass which drew russian goalkeeper igor akenfeyev off his line leaving an empty net which klose capitalized on .
the win means germany have qualified for the 2010 world cup in south africa .
the team now has 25 points , four ahead of russia , with one match remaining to be played in group four .
after the match , germany coach joachim loew was satisfied with his team 's performance .
" i was convinced the whole week we would be very concentrated .
i felt everyone had the will to win here and not to play for a draw , " said loew , and added , " of course i have to say , too , that we also had a bit of luck in some situations . "
the game started slowly with each side sizing up the other .
loew had put together a defensive-minded line-up by giving a first cap to hamburg defender jerome boateng , lining up five midfielders and leaving klose on his own up front .
klose scores the winning goal andrei arshavin gave russia the best chance it had in the first half when he slipped away from boateng in midfield , maneuvered around simon rolfes and then found vladimir bystrov , who failed to score when his weak kick was saved by germany goalkeeper rene adler .
only five minutes later , klose scored .
bildunterschrift : germany 's players celebrate after scoring against russia during their world cup group 4 qualifying soccer match in moscow russia stepped up the pressure within three minutes when arshavin had two fierce shots on goal , but both were saved by adler .
bystrov also got close to scoring with an amazing overhead kick .
not to be outdone , germany came back right away with a long-range kick from oezil which bounced off the top bar .
now , russia started to threaten with every attack and wasted another great opportunity when yuriy zhirkov broke into the goal area but found no one to pass to him .
when russia led another attack down the left , boateng brought bystrov down in the 69th minute which led to a second yellow card from swiss referee massimo busacca .
the german squad had to spend the last 20 minutes playing one man short .
german goalkeeper adler was the man of the evening it was a busy night for german keeper adler who then again saved a goal on a shot by pavlyuchenko by parrying it wide of the near post after arshavin sent the tottenham striker clear on the right .
an appeal for a late penalty was turned down when arne friedrich , in as a substitute , brought down bystrov .
with the win over russia , germany is guaranteed a spot in the 2010 world cup in south africa and thus the last group match against finland in hamburg on october 14 is now academic .
russia plays azerbaijan in baku , next .
the biggest question of the night was how germany would perform on the artificial turf of luzhniki stadium .
no german national team had ever played on artificial turf before .
that question has now been answered. av / dpa / reuters editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a german car expert has told dw there 's no time left to arrange a new deal before opel goes bust . spain 's industry minister miguel sebastian , on a visit to berlin to discuss the future of opel , has made it clear that his country will not commit to helping the magna buyout under the current terms . " we are not in the right place , to discuss the exact share of state aid that the spanish government might offer , " sebastian said , after opting out of a special meeting in berlin designed to address the rescue plan . spain is calling for magna to guarantee the future of the opel factory in figueruelas , near zaragoza before it commits to helping the canadian car parts maker and its russian backers take command of opel from former parent company general motors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain fears that its factories and workforce are set to lose out so far , magna has only made such promises to german opel factories , and has announced plans to cull around 10,000 jobs across europe in a bid to restore opel 's profitability .
countries like belgium , great britain , and spain are worried that their opel factories - and their economies , by extension - will suffer the job cuts , and are therefore unwilling to help berlin push through the opel deal . the uk government is watching ongoing negotiations between magna and british trade unions about the future of vauxhall -lrb- the british badge for opel -rrb- factories , saying that these are yet to produce " satisfactory results . "
british secretary of state for business , peter mandelson , called for changes to magna 's business plan in an interview with the daily telegraph newspaper , so as to avoid what he described as " negative consequences " for opel 's vauxhall arm . speed of the essence ? german auto industry expert ferdinand dudenhoeffer believes that there is no time to re-evaluate the magna buyout of opel , saying the bid is opel 's only possible solution . " it makes absolutely no sense to continue with general motors , because the employees do n't want that and it was unsuccessful over the last 15 to 20 years , " dudenhoeffer says .
" if they go out and search for a new investor now , they will need at least 12 months to broker a new deal .
and in that time , opel will fall into bankruptcy . " magna needs 4.5 billion euros in state aid to complete its buyout , and wants to finalize the takeover deal with current opel owners general motors in the coming week .
however , with european governments still wrangling over who should pay what , and the deal under european union scrutiny to see if it is anti-competitive , this target is looking increasingly optimistic .
bildunterschrift : opel hopes its new astra will help it turn a profit before it 's too late dudenhoeffer says that german industry experts are baffled by the stance that spain and the uk are now taking with regard to the opel takeover . " they had all this time in the last four months to initiate discussion on the opel deal , " he says .
" they rejected , they did n't provide any money , and now they want to stop the deal and put the opel factories - and the brand itself - in jeopardy . " more meetings magna bosses will have another chance to woo the spanish government on tuesday at a meeting in madrid .

sebastian met with his german counterpart karl-theodor zu guttenberg in berlin on friday , rather than attending the magna discussions . representatives from germany , great britain , belgium , austria , hungary , poland and the european commission were present at the official meeting . the future of opel was a major issue during germany 's election campaign , and the social democrats have already seen the opportunity to capitalize , should the deal now fail . the spd state premier for rheinland palatinate , kurt beck , has already bemoaned the " alarming signals coming out of berlin " on the future of opel .

" we are not in the right place , to discuss the exact share of state aid that the spanish government might offer , " sebastian said , after opting out of a special meeting in berlin designed to address the rescue plan . spain is calling for magna to guarantee the future of the opel factory in figueruelas , near zaragoza before it commits to helping the canadian car parts maker and its russian backers take command of opel from former parent company general motors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain fears that its factories and workforce are set to lose out so far , magna has only made such promises to german opel factories , and has announced plans to cull around 10,000 jobs across europe in a bid to restore opel 's profitability .
countries like belgium , great britain , and spain are worried that their opel factories - and their economies , by extension - will suffer the job cuts , and are therefore unwilling to help berlin push through the opel deal . the uk government is watching ongoing negotiations between magna and british trade unions about the future of vauxhall -lrb- the british badge for opel -rrb- factories , saying that these are yet to produce " satisfactory results .

british secretary of state for business , peter mandelson , called for changes to magna 's business plan in an interview with the daily telegraph newspaper , so as to avoid what he described as " negative consequences " for opel 's vauxhall arm . speed of the essence ? german auto industry expert ferdinand dudenhoeffer believes that there is no time to re-evaluate the magna buyout of opel , saying the bid is opel 's only possible solution . " it makes absolutely no sense to continue with general motors , because the employees do n't want that and it was unsuccessful over the last 15 to 20 years , " dudenhoeffer says .
" if they go out and search for a new investor now , they will need at least 12 months to broker a new deal .
and in that time , opel will fall into bankruptcy . " magna needs 4.5 billion euros in state aid to complete its buyout , and wants to finalize the takeover deal with current opel owners general motors in the coming week .
however , with european governments still wrangling over who should pay what , and the deal under european union scrutiny to see if it is anti-competitive , this target is looking increasingly optimistic .

" they had all this time in the last four months to initiate discussion on the opel deal , " he says .
" they rejected , they did n't provide any money , and now they want to stop the deal and put the opel factories - and the brand itself - in jeopardy .

this is klaus ' latest objection , but not his first .
a staunch euroskeptic , he opposes the treaty as a matter of principle , believing it yields too much sovereignty to the international bloc .
earlier in the week , he had said he could not sign the treaty until the czech courts reviewed its constitutionality .
poland and britain have secured exemptions and the czech republic would not be the first eu country to seek such an exemption .
poland , whose president lech kaczynski signed the treaty on saturday , negotiated an opt-out for such property claims and secured guarantees that the charter would not force them to allow gay marriage .
britain was assured that the treaty would not supercede their national judicial system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 3 million ethnic germans were forced to leave the former czechoslovakia after the war " before ratification , the czech republic must , additionally at least , negotiate a similar exemption , " said klaus .
" i believe that this exemption can be resolved quickly . "
but because all the other eu countries have ratified the treaty , winning such an exemption for the czech republic would theoretically require its renegotiation .
that duty would fall on the shoulders of the czech government , led by prime minister jan fischer .
fischer said previous reviews of the treaty judged that claims like those feared by klaus would be unlikely .
but he said his interim cabinet would nonetheless discuss the issue monday and that he still hoped the treaty could be ratified before the year 's end .
renegotiation could be avoided if eu leaders pass an official declaration that would not be part of the treaty .
french foreign minister bernard kouchner has outright rejected the idea of a change to the treaty itself .
intentional delays ?
some are worried that klaus ' objections are merely stalling tactics , meant to allow british conservative leader david cameron to hold a promised referendum if his party wins an expected general election next year .
" if i were the eu member states , i would n't really be minded to give klaus what he wants .

this is klaus ' latest objection , but not his first .
a staunch euroskeptic , he opposes the treaty as a matter of principle , believing it yields too much sovereignty to the international bloc .
earlier in the week , he had said he could not sign the treaty until the czech courts reviewed its constitutionality .
poland and britain have secured exemptions and the czech republic would not be the first eu country to seek such an exemption .
poland , whose president lech kaczynski signed the treaty on saturday , negotiated an opt-out for such property claims and secured guarantees that the charter would not force them to allow gay marriage .
britain was assured that the treaty would not supercede their national judicial system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 3 million ethnic germans were forced to leave the former czechoslovakia after the war " before ratification , the czech republic must , additionally at least , negotiate a similar exemption , " said klaus .
" i believe that this exemption can be resolved quickly . "
but because all the other eu countries have ratified the treaty , winning such an exemption for the czech republic would theoretically require its renegotiation .
that duty would fall on the shoulders of the czech government , led by prime minister jan fischer .
fischer said previous reviews of the treaty judged that claims like those feared by klaus would be unlikely .
but he said his interim cabinet would nonetheless discuss the issue monday and that he still hoped the treaty could be ratified before the year 's end .
renegotiation could be avoided if eu leaders pass an official declaration that would not be part of the treaty .
french foreign minister bernard kouchner has outright rejected the idea of a change to the treaty itself .

mesut oezil made a brilliant pass which drew russian goalkeeper igor akenfeyev off his line leaving an empty net which klose capitalized on .
the win means germany have qualified for the 2010 world cup in south africa .
the team now has 25 points , four ahead of russia , with one match remaining to be played in group four .
after the match , germany coach joachim loew was satisfied with his team 's performance .
" i was convinced the whole week we would be very concentrated .
i felt everyone had the will to win here and not to play for a draw , " said loew , and added , " of course i have to say , too , that we also had a bit of luck in some situations . "
the game started slowly with each side sizing up the other .
loew had put together a defensive-minded line-up by giving a first cap to hamburg defender jerome boateng , lining up five midfielders and leaving klose on his own up front .
klose scores the winning goal andrei arshavin gave russia the best chance it had in the first half when he slipped away from boateng in midfield , maneuvered around simon rolfes and then found vladimir bystrov , who failed to score when his weak kick was saved by germany goalkeeper rene adler .
only five minutes later , klose scored .
bildunterschrift : germany 's players celebrate after scoring against russia during their world cup group 4 qualifying soccer match in moscow russia stepped up the pressure within three minutes when arshavin had two fierce shots on goal , but both were saved by adler .
bystrov also got close to scoring with an amazing overhead kick .
not to be outdone , germany came back right away with a long-range kick from oezil which bounced off the top bar .
now , russia started to threaten with every attack and wasted another great opportunity when yuriy zhirkov broke into the goal area but found no one to pass to him .
when russia led another attack down the left , boateng brought bystrov down in the 69th minute which led to a second yellow card from swiss referee massimo busacca .
the german squad had to spend the last 20 minutes playing one man short .
german goalkeeper adler was the man of the evening it was a busy night for german keeper adler who then again saved a goal on a shot by pavlyuchenko by parrying it wide of the near post after arshavin sent the tottenham striker clear on the right .
an appeal for a late penalty was turned down when arne friedrich , in as a substitute , brought down bystrov .
with the win over russia , germany is guaranteed a spot in the 2010 world cup in south africa and thus the last group match against finland in hamburg on october 14 is now academic .
russia plays azerbaijan in baku , next .
the biggest question of the night was how germany would perform on the artificial turf of luzhniki stadium .
no german national team had ever played on artificial turf before .

mesut oezil made a brilliant pass which drew russian goalkeeper igor akenfeyev off his line leaving an empty net which klose capitalized on .
the win means germany have qualified for the 2010 world cup in south africa .
the team now has 25 points , four ahead of russia , with one match remaining to be played in group four .
after the match , germany coach joachim loew was satisfied with his team 's performance .
" i was convinced the whole week we would be very concentrated .
i felt everyone had the will to win here and not to play for a draw , " said loew , and added , " of course i have to say , too , that we also had a bit of luck in some situations . "
the game started slowly with each side sizing up the other .
loew had put together a defensive-minded line-up by giving a first cap to hamburg defender jerome boateng , lining up five midfielders and leaving klose on his own up front .
klose scores the winning goal andrei arshavin gave russia the best chance it had in the first half when he slipped away from boateng in midfield , maneuvered around simon rolfes and then found vladimir bystrov , who failed to score when his weak kick was saved by germany goalkeeper rene adler .
only five minutes later , klose scored .
bildunterschrift : germany 's players celebrate after scoring against russia during their world cup group 4 qualifying soccer match in moscow russia stepped up the pressure within three minutes when arshavin had two fierce shots on goal , but both were saved by adler .
bystrov also got close to scoring with an amazing overhead kick .
not to be outdone , germany came back right away with a long-range kick from oezil which bounced off the top bar .
now , russia started to threaten with every attack and wasted another great opportunity when yuriy zhirkov broke into the goal area but found no one to pass to him .
when russia led another attack down the left , boateng brought bystrov down in the 69th minute which led to a second yellow card from swiss referee massimo busacca .
the german squad had to spend the last 20 minutes playing one man short .
german goalkeeper adler was the man of the evening it was a busy night for german keeper adler who then again saved a goal on a shot by pavlyuchenko by parrying it wide of the near post after arshavin sent the tottenham striker clear on the right .
an appeal for a late penalty was turned down when arne friedrich , in as a substitute , brought down bystrov .
with the win over russia , germany is guaranteed a spot in the 2010 world cup in south africa and thus the last group match against finland in hamburg on october 14 is now academic .
russia plays azerbaijan in baku , next .
the biggest question of the night was how germany would perform on the artificial turf of luzhniki stadium .
no german national team had ever played on artificial turf before .
that question has now been answered. av / dpa / reuters editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on saturday , turkey and armenia are set to sign an agreement to re-establish diplomatic ties . the swiss-brokered diplomatic deal between turkey and armenia is due to be signed in zurich on saturday . attended by the foreign ministers of russia , france and the us secretary of state hillary clinton , many have high hopes for improving relations between these neighboring nations .
ana , a nanny for a turkish family in istanbul , is one of thousands of armenians forced to look for work abroad because of turkey 's trade embargo against armenia .
she says life in istanbul is hard , because of the closed frontier between the two nations .
" we are illegal and earn very little money , and you always have to avoid the police as you could be arrested at any time and deported , " she said .
ana was overjoyed at the news that turkey was prepared to re-establish ties with armenia .
in 1993 , turkey severed ties and closed its border after armenia fought a war with turkish ally azerbaijan over the disputed nagorno karabakh enclave .
" i ca n't wait for the embargo to be lifted , " she said .
" it will change everything , for both our countries .
we just want peace and normalcy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has said the agreement will normalize bilateral relations between turkey and armenia .
but some experts caution that , while it 's an important gesture , it 's only the first step .
" it 's pretty significant , but then the protocols will be sent to the respective parliaments for ratification and that 's when the deal gets a bit more complicated , as there is strong opposition both in armenia and turkey , " said soli ozel , an expert on international relations at istanbul 's bilgi university .
critics say deal betrays azerbaijan turkey 's main opposition parties have condemned the announcement , accusing the government of betraying its ally azerbaijan .
armenian forces also continue to occupy a large part of azeri territory .
the government has been quick to dispel accusations of betrayal , saying it remains committed to azerbaijan .
erdogan said on friday that turkey " would never take part in a process which puts azerbaijan in a difficult situation " .
suat kiniklioglu , spokesman of the turkish parliament 's foreign affairs committee , insisted earlier this month that resolving azeri grievances remains key to restoring armenian-turkish relations .
" without movement on the karabahk issue , the normalization process would be difficult to sustain .
all the stars really do have to be aligned , " kiniklioglu said .
ozel says the alignment is right , however , because for the first time since the conflict , major powers have a common interest in bringing stability to the region .
" my understanding is that there is almost near agreement on a framework between azerbaijan and armenia , " ozel said .
" the americans are behind these developments , but russia 's role is more important because the russians can block it anytime they want .
but i think it serves their purpose too , because russian and american relations seem to be on a better track now .
the russians may wish to be on the right side of things . "
russian support is key such a diplomatic breakthrough in resolving the seemingly intractable dispute between armenia and azerbaijan will be crucial if the government is to sell the opening of the armenian border to its people .
on the streets of istanbul , for example , there remains suspicion of armenia and widespread support for azerbaijan , even among supporters of restoring diplomatic relations with armenia .
bildunterschrift : armenians say the ottoman turks carried out a campaign of genocide between 1915 and 1923 a historical controversy between armenia and turkey could yet undermine attempts to re-establish ties .
many in the international community accuse turkey 's then-ottoman rulers of committing genocide against its armenian minority between 1915 and 1923 .
ankara strongly denies the charge .
the controversy continues to sour relations and add to the deep suspicion within the country over the rapprochement .
" this discourse about genocide is being imposed on us by great western powers ; that 's why the debate about opening the border is not a simple question , for anybody , " said political scientist and newspaper columnist , nuray mert .
" the political opposition , knowing that it is a very sensitive issue , is using it against the government so that the issue is becoming even more complicated . "
the message to ankara from both washington and brussels is : forget about the opposition and open the border .
but with critics of the deal in all political circles increasingly voicing their opposition , that 's easier said than done , many analysts say .

but even as international dignitaries gathered to observe the signing , the armenian representatives unexpectedly demanded a review of the closing statement 's wording .
us secretary of state hillary clinton finally managed to bring the parties together by arranging a compromise that led to no statement being read at the end of the signing ceremony .
so , in the end , both davutoglu and nalbandian signed the accord and shook hands to applause from onlookers . the european union quickly welcomed the agreement .
" the european commission warmly welcomes the signature by the armenian and turkish foreign ministers ... of the protocols on establishing diplomatic relations and developing bilateral relations , including the opening of the common border , " said a statement from the eu commission .
the statement further congratulated both parties on their efforts .
" the commission considers it a courageous and far-sighted step forward towards peace and stability in the south caucasus region and a truly historic decision showing readiness to compromise on both sides . "
the signing of the protocols comes after a year of negotiations mediated by the swiss , and although it is a welcome step forward , it must now be ratified by both the turkish and armenian parliaments to take effect .
there is considerable resistance to the protocols in both parliaments , however , so it remains unclear when final ratification will occur .
agreement not popular bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many armenians oppose the accords because of ottoman crimes in wwi one day before the protocols were signed , 10,000 people demonstrated in the armenian capital , yerevan , to protest the historic event .
protests were not limited to armenia .
in beirut , thousands of lebanese-armenians marched against the plans to establish diplomatic ties between ankara and yerevan at a gathering outside the turkish embassy , as well as the armenian patriarchate near beirut .
one of the most difficult issues remaining unresolved between turks and armenians is the matter of armenian assertions that turkey carried out genocide in the early 20th century .
in 1915 , armenians claim that ottoman turks systematically killed nearly 1.5 million armenians .
yerevan has campaigned for years to have the deaths recognized internationally as genocide .
turkey has rejected the claims .
now , as part of the new protocols , turkey and armenia have agreed to form an historical commission to look into the events that occurred during world war i. there is also serious contention between the two nations over the issue of nagorno-karabakh , which broke away from armenia in 1993 .
when armenia then invaded the breakaway azerbaijiani territory , turkey shut its borders with armenia , causing extreme economic hardship for the landlocked country. av / dpa / reuters / afp editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 10.10.2009 armenia and turkey set to re-establish ties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a soccer match in 2008 was a big step forward for relations it 's one of europe 's longest-running disputes , but the icy relations between turkey and armenia could be thawing out .
on saturday , turkey and armenia are set to sign an agreement to re-establish diplomatic ties . the swiss-brokered diplomatic deal between turkey and armenia is due to be signed in zurich on saturday . attended by the foreign ministers of russia , france and the us secretary of state hillary clinton , many have high hopes for improving relations between these neighboring nations .
ana , a nanny for a turkish family in istanbul , is one of thousands of armenians forced to look for work abroad because of turkey 's trade embargo against armenia .
she says life in istanbul is hard , because of the closed frontier between the two nations .
" we are illegal and earn very little money , and you always have to avoid the police as you could be arrested at any time and deported , " she said .
ana was overjoyed at the news that turkey was prepared to re-establish ties with armenia .
in 1993 , turkey severed ties and closed its border after armenia fought a war with turkish ally azerbaijan over the disputed nagorno karabakh enclave .
" i ca n't wait for the embargo to be lifted , " she said .
" it will change everything , for both our countries .
we just want peace and normalcy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has said the agreement will normalize bilateral relations between turkey and armenia .
but some experts caution that , while it 's an important gesture , it 's only the first step .
" it 's pretty significant , but then the protocols will be sent to the respective parliaments for ratification and that 's when the deal gets a bit more complicated , as there is strong opposition both in armenia and turkey , " said soli ozel , an expert on international relations at istanbul 's bilgi university .
critics say deal betrays azerbaijan turkey 's main opposition parties have condemned the announcement , accusing the government of betraying its ally azerbaijan .
armenian forces also continue to occupy a large part of azeri territory .
the government has been quick to dispel accusations of betrayal , saying it remains committed to azerbaijan .
erdogan said on friday that turkey " would never take part in a process which puts azerbaijan in a difficult situation " .
suat kiniklioglu , spokesman of the turkish parliament 's foreign affairs committee , insisted earlier this month that resolving azeri grievances remains key to restoring armenian-turkish relations .
" without movement on the karabahk issue , the normalization process would be difficult to sustain .
all the stars really do have to be aligned , " kiniklioglu said .
ozel says the alignment is right , however , because for the first time since the conflict , major powers have a common interest in bringing stability to the region .
" my understanding is that there is almost near agreement on a framework between azerbaijan and armenia , " ozel said .
" the americans are behind these developments , but russia 's role is more important because the russians can block it anytime they want .
but i think it serves their purpose too , because russian and american relations seem to be on a better track now .
the russians may wish to be on the right side of things . "
russian support is key such a diplomatic breakthrough in resolving the seemingly intractable dispute between armenia and azerbaijan will be crucial if the government is to sell the opening of the armenian border to its people .
on the streets of istanbul , for example , there remains suspicion of armenia and widespread support for azerbaijan , even among supporters of restoring diplomatic relations with armenia .
bildunterschrift : armenians say the ottoman turks carried out a campaign of genocide between 1915 and 1923 a historical controversy between armenia and turkey could yet undermine attempts to re-establish ties .
many in the international community accuse turkey 's then-ottoman rulers of committing genocide against its armenian minority between 1915 and 1923 .
ankara strongly denies the charge .
the controversy continues to sour relations and add to the deep suspicion within the country over the rapprochement .
" this discourse about genocide is being imposed on us by great western powers ; that 's why the debate about opening the border is not a simple question , for anybody , " said political scientist and newspaper columnist , nuray mert .
" the political opposition , knowing that it is a very sensitive issue , is using it against the government so that the issue is becoming even more complicated . "
the message to ankara from both washington and brussels is : forget about the opposition and open the border .
but with critics of the deal in all political circles increasingly voicing their opposition , that 's easier said than done , many analysts say .
erdogan will have to brace himself for a tough fight if he is to convince turks that they are betraying neither a key ally , or themselves . author : dorian jones -lrb- dc -rrb- editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

mesut oezil made a brilliant pass which drew russian goalkeeper igor akenfeyev off his line leaving an empty net which klose capitalized on .
the win means germany have qualified for the 2010 world cup in south africa .
the team now has 25 points , four ahead of russia , with one match remaining to be played in group four .
after the match , germany coach joachim loew was satisfied with his team 's performance .
" i was convinced the whole week we would be very concentrated .
i felt everyone had the will to win here and not to play for a draw , " said loew , and added , " of course i have to say , too , that we also had a bit of luck in some situations . "
the game started slowly with each side sizing up the other .
loew had put together a defensive-minded line-up by giving a first cap to hamburg defender jerome boateng , lining up five midfielders and leaving klose on his own up front .
klose scores the winning goal andrei arshavin gave russia the best chance it had in the first half when he slipped away from boateng in midfield , maneuvered around simon rolfes and then found vladimir bystrov , who failed to score when his weak kick was saved by germany goalkeeper rene adler .
only five minutes later , klose scored .
bildunterschrift : germany 's players celebrate after scoring against russia during their world cup group 4 qualifying soccer match in moscow russia stepped up the pressure within three minutes when arshavin had two fierce shots on goal , but both were saved by adler .
bystrov also got close to scoring with an amazing overhead kick .
not to be outdone , germany came back right away with a long-range kick from oezil which bounced off the top bar .
now , russia started to threaten with every attack and wasted another great opportunity when yuriy zhirkov broke into the goal area but found no one to pass to him .
when russia led another attack down the left , boateng brought bystrov down in the 69th minute which led to a second yellow card from swiss referee massimo busacca .
the german squad had to spend the last 20 minutes playing one man short .
german goalkeeper adler was the man of the evening it was a busy night for german keeper adler who then again saved a goal on a shot by pavlyuchenko by parrying it wide of the near post after arshavin sent the tottenham striker clear on the right .
an appeal for a late penalty was turned down when arne friedrich , in as a substitute , brought down bystrov .
with the win over russia , germany is guaranteed a spot in the 2010 world cup in south africa and thus the last group match against finland in hamburg on october 14 is now academic .
russia plays azerbaijan in baku , next .
the biggest question of the night was how germany would perform on the artificial turf of luzhniki stadium .

but even as international dignitaries gathered to observe the signing , the armenian representatives unexpectedly demanded a review of the closing statement 's wording .
us secretary of state hillary clinton finally managed to bring the parties together by arranging a compromise that led to no statement being read at the end of the signing ceremony .
so , in the end , both davutoglu and nalbandian signed the accord and shook hands to applause from onlookers . the european union quickly welcomed the agreement .
" the european commission warmly welcomes the signature by the armenian and turkish foreign ministers ... of the protocols on establishing diplomatic relations and developing bilateral relations , including the opening of the common border , " said a statement from the eu commission .
the statement further congratulated both parties on their efforts .
" the commission considers it a courageous and far-sighted step forward towards peace and stability in the south caucasus region and a truly historic decision showing readiness to compromise on both sides . "
the signing of the protocols comes after a year of negotiations mediated by the swiss , and although it is a welcome step forward , it must now be ratified by both the turkish and armenian parliaments to take effect .
there is considerable resistance to the protocols in both parliaments , however , so it remains unclear when final ratification will occur .
agreement not popular bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many armenians oppose the accords because of ottoman crimes in wwi one day before the protocols were signed , 10,000 people demonstrated in the armenian capital , yerevan , to protest the historic event .
protests were not limited to armenia .
in beirut , thousands of lebanese-armenians marched against the plans to establish diplomatic ties between ankara and yerevan at a gathering outside the turkish embassy , as well as the armenian patriarchate near beirut .
one of the most difficult issues remaining unresolved between turks and armenians is the matter of armenian assertions that turkey carried out genocide in the early 20th century .
in 1915 , armenians claim that ottoman turks systematically killed nearly 1.5 million armenians .
yerevan has campaigned for years to have the deaths recognized internationally as genocide .
turkey has rejected the claims .
now , as part of the new protocols , turkey and armenia have agreed to form an historical commission to look into the events that occurred during world war i. there is also serious contention between the two nations over the issue of nagorno-karabakh , which broke away from armenia in 1993 .

mesut oezil made a brilliant pass which drew russian goalkeeper igor akenfeyev off his line leaving an empty net which klose capitalized on .
the win means germany have qualified for the 2010 world cup in south africa .
the team now has 25 points , four ahead of russia , with one match remaining to be played in group four .
after the match , germany coach joachim loew was satisfied with his team 's performance .
" i was convinced the whole week we would be very concentrated .
i felt everyone had the will to win here and not to play for a draw , " said loew , and added , " of course i have to say , too , that we also had a bit of luck in some situations . "
the game started slowly with each side sizing up the other .
loew had put together a defensive-minded line-up by giving a first cap to hamburg defender jerome boateng , lining up five midfielders and leaving klose on his own up front .
klose scores the winning goal andrei arshavin gave russia the best chance it had in the first half when he slipped away from boateng in midfield , maneuvered around simon rolfes and then found vladimir bystrov , who failed to score when his weak kick was saved by germany goalkeeper rene adler .
only five minutes later , klose scored .
bildunterschrift : germany 's players celebrate after scoring against russia during their world cup group 4 qualifying soccer match in moscow russia stepped up the pressure within three minutes when arshavin had two fierce shots on goal , but both were saved by adler .
bystrov also got close to scoring with an amazing overhead kick .
not to be outdone , germany came back right away with a long-range kick from oezil which bounced off the top bar .
now , russia started to threaten with every attack and wasted another great opportunity when yuriy zhirkov broke into the goal area but found no one to pass to him .
when russia led another attack down the left , boateng brought bystrov down in the 69th minute which led to a second yellow card from swiss referee massimo busacca .
the german squad had to spend the last 20 minutes playing one man short .
german goalkeeper adler was the man of the evening it was a busy night for german keeper adler who then again saved a goal on a shot by pavlyuchenko by parrying it wide of the near post after arshavin sent the tottenham striker clear on the right .
an appeal for a late penalty was turned down when arne friedrich , in as a substitute , brought down bystrov .
with the win over russia , germany is guaranteed a spot in the 2010 world cup in south africa and thus the last group match against finland in hamburg on october 14 is now academic .
russia plays azerbaijan in baku , next .
the biggest question of the night was how germany would perform on the artificial turf of luzhniki stadium .

but even as international dignitaries gathered to observe the signing , the armenian representatives unexpectedly demanded a review of the closing statement 's wording .
us secretary of state hillary clinton finally managed to bring the parties together by arranging a compromise that led to no statement being read at the end of the signing ceremony .
so , in the end , both davutoglu and nalbandian signed the accord and shook hands to applause from onlookers . the european union quickly welcomed the agreement .
" the european commission warmly welcomes the signature by the armenian and turkish foreign ministers ... of the protocols on establishing diplomatic relations and developing bilateral relations , including the opening of the common border , " said a statement from the eu commission .
the statement further congratulated both parties on their efforts .
" the commission considers it a courageous and far-sighted step forward towards peace and stability in the south caucasus region and a truly historic decision showing readiness to compromise on both sides . "
the signing of the protocols comes after a year of negotiations mediated by the swiss , and although it is a welcome step forward , it must now be ratified by both the turkish and armenian parliaments to take effect .
there is considerable resistance to the protocols in both parliaments , however , so it remains unclear when final ratification will occur .
agreement not popular bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many armenians oppose the accords because of ottoman crimes in wwi one day before the protocols were signed , 10,000 people demonstrated in the armenian capital , yerevan , to protest the historic event .
protests were not limited to armenia .
in beirut , thousands of lebanese-armenians marched against the plans to establish diplomatic ties between ankara and yerevan at a gathering outside the turkish embassy , as well as the armenian patriarchate near beirut .
one of the most difficult issues remaining unresolved between turks and armenians is the matter of armenian assertions that turkey carried out genocide in the early 20th century .
in 1915 , armenians claim that ottoman turks systematically killed nearly 1.5 million armenians .
yerevan has campaigned for years to have the deaths recognized internationally as genocide .
turkey has rejected the claims .
now , as part of the new protocols , turkey and armenia have agreed to form an historical commission to look into the events that occurred during world war i. there is also serious contention between the two nations over the issue of nagorno-karabakh , which broke away from armenia in 1993 .
when armenia then invaded the breakaway azerbaijiani territory , turkey shut its borders with armenia , causing extreme economic hardship for the landlocked country. av / dpa / reuters / afp editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but even as international dignitaries gathered to observe the signing , the armenian representatives unexpectedly demanded a review of the closing statement 's wording .
us secretary of state hillary clinton finally managed to bring the parties together by arranging a compromise that led to no statement being read at the end of the signing ceremony .
so , in the end , both davutoglu and nalbandian signed the accord and shook hands to applause from onlookers . the european union quickly welcomed the agreement .
" the european commission warmly welcomes the signature by the armenian and turkish foreign ministers ... of the protocols on establishing diplomatic relations and developing bilateral relations , including the opening of the common border , " said a statement from the eu commission .
the statement further congratulated both parties on their efforts .
" the commission considers it a courageous and far-sighted step forward towards peace and stability in the south caucasus region and a truly historic decision showing readiness to compromise on both sides . "
the signing of the protocols comes after a year of negotiations mediated by the swiss , and although it is a welcome step forward , it must now be ratified by both the turkish and armenian parliaments to take effect .
there is considerable resistance to the protocols in both parliaments , however , so it remains unclear when final ratification will occur .

protests were not limited to armenia .
in beirut , thousands of lebanese-armenians marched against the plans to establish diplomatic ties between ankara and yerevan at a gathering outside the turkish embassy , as well as the armenian patriarchate near beirut .
one of the most difficult issues remaining unresolved between turks and armenians is the matter of armenian assertions that turkey carried out genocide in the early 20th century .
in 1915 , armenians claim that ottoman turks systematically killed nearly 1.5 million armenians .
yerevan has campaigned for years to have the deaths recognized internationally as genocide .
turkey has rejected the claims .
now , as part of the new protocols , turkey and armenia have agreed to form an historical commission to look into the events that occurred during world war i. there is also serious contention between the two nations over the issue of nagorno-karabakh , which broke away from armenia in 1993 .

on saturday , turkey and armenia are set to sign an agreement to re-establish diplomatic ties . the swiss-brokered diplomatic deal between turkey and armenia is due to be signed in zurich on saturday . attended by the foreign ministers of russia , france and the us secretary of state hillary clinton , many have high hopes for improving relations between these neighboring nations .
ana , a nanny for a turkish family in istanbul , is one of thousands of armenians forced to look for work abroad because of turkey 's trade embargo against armenia .
she says life in istanbul is hard , because of the closed frontier between the two nations .
" we are illegal and earn very little money , and you always have to avoid the police as you could be arrested at any time and deported , " she said .
ana was overjoyed at the news that turkey was prepared to re-establish ties with armenia .
in 1993 , turkey severed ties and closed its border after armenia fought a war with turkish ally azerbaijan over the disputed nagorno karabakh enclave .
" i ca n't wait for the embargo to be lifted , " she said .
" it will change everything , for both our countries .
we just want peace and normalcy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has said the agreement will normalize bilateral relations between turkey and armenia .
but some experts caution that , while it 's an important gesture , it 's only the first step .
" it 's pretty significant , but then the protocols will be sent to the respective parliaments for ratification and that 's when the deal gets a bit more complicated , as there is strong opposition both in armenia and turkey , " said soli ozel , an expert on international relations at istanbul 's bilgi university .
critics say deal betrays azerbaijan turkey 's main opposition parties have condemned the announcement , accusing the government of betraying its ally azerbaijan .
armenian forces also continue to occupy a large part of azeri territory .
the government has been quick to dispel accusations of betrayal , saying it remains committed to azerbaijan .
erdogan said on friday that turkey " would never take part in a process which puts azerbaijan in a difficult situation " .
suat kiniklioglu , spokesman of the turkish parliament 's foreign affairs committee , insisted earlier this month that resolving azeri grievances remains key to restoring armenian-turkish relations .
" without movement on the karabahk issue , the normalization process would be difficult to sustain .
all the stars really do have to be aligned , " kiniklioglu said .
ozel says the alignment is right , however , because for the first time since the conflict , major powers have a common interest in bringing stability to the region .
" my understanding is that there is almost near agreement on a framework between azerbaijan and armenia , " ozel said .
" the americans are behind these developments , but russia 's role is more important because the russians can block it anytime they want .
but i think it serves their purpose too , because russian and american relations seem to be on a better track now .
the russians may wish to be on the right side of things . "
russian support is key such a diplomatic breakthrough in resolving the seemingly intractable dispute between armenia and azerbaijan will be crucial if the government is to sell the opening of the armenian border to its people .
on the streets of istanbul , for example , there remains suspicion of armenia and widespread support for azerbaijan , even among supporters of restoring diplomatic relations with armenia .
bildunterschrift : armenians say the ottoman turks carried out a campaign of genocide between 1915 and 1923 a historical controversy between armenia and turkey could yet undermine attempts to re-establish ties .
many in the international community accuse turkey 's then-ottoman rulers of committing genocide against its armenian minority between 1915 and 1923 .
ankara strongly denies the charge .
the controversy continues to sour relations and add to the deep suspicion within the country over the rapprochement .
" this discourse about genocide is being imposed on us by great western powers ; that 's why the debate about opening the border is not a simple question , for anybody , " said political scientist and newspaper columnist , nuray mert .
" the political opposition , knowing that it is a very sensitive issue , is using it against the government so that the issue is becoming even more complicated . "
the message to ankara from both washington and brussels is : forget about the opposition and open the border .
but with critics of the deal in all political circles increasingly voicing their opposition , that 's easier said than done , many analysts say .
erdogan will have to brace himself for a tough fight if he is to convince turks that they are betraying neither a key ally , or themselves . author : dorian jones -lrb- dc -rrb- editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

mesut oezil made a brilliant pass which drew russian goalkeeper igor akenfeyev off his line leaving an empty net which klose capitalized on .
the win means germany have qualified for the 2010 world cup in south africa .
the team now has 25 points , four ahead of russia , with one match remaining to be played in group four .
after the match , germany coach joachim loew was satisfied with his team 's performance .
" i was convinced the whole week we would be very concentrated .
i felt everyone had the will to win here and not to play for a draw , " said loew , and added , " of course i have to say , too , that we also had a bit of luck in some situations . "
the game started slowly with each side sizing up the other .
loew had put together a defensive-minded line-up by giving a first cap to hamburg defender jerome boateng , lining up five midfielders and leaving klose on his own up front .
klose scores the winning goal andrei arshavin gave russia the best chance it had in the first half when he slipped away from boateng in midfield , maneuvered around simon rolfes and then found vladimir bystrov , who failed to score when his weak kick was saved by germany goalkeeper rene adler .
only five minutes later , klose scored .
bildunterschrift : germany 's players celebrate after scoring against russia during their world cup group 4 qualifying soccer match in moscow russia stepped up the pressure within three minutes when arshavin had two fierce shots on goal , but both were saved by adler .
bystrov also got close to scoring with an amazing overhead kick .
not to be outdone , germany came back right away with a long-range kick from oezil which bounced off the top bar .
now , russia started to threaten with every attack and wasted another great opportunity when yuriy zhirkov broke into the goal area but found no one to pass to him .
when russia led another attack down the left , boateng brought bystrov down in the 69th minute which led to a second yellow card from swiss referee massimo busacca .
the german squad had to spend the last 20 minutes playing one man short .
german goalkeeper adler was the man of the evening it was a busy night for german keeper adler who then again saved a goal on a shot by pavlyuchenko by parrying it wide of the near post after arshavin sent the tottenham striker clear on the right .
an appeal for a late penalty was turned down when arne friedrich , in as a substitute , brought down bystrov .
with the win over russia , germany is guaranteed a spot in the 2010 world cup in south africa and thus the last group match against finland in hamburg on october 14 is now academic .
russia plays azerbaijan in baku , next .
the biggest question of the night was how germany would perform on the artificial turf of luzhniki stadium .
no german national team had ever played on artificial turf before .
that question has now been answered. av / dpa / reuters editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this is klaus ' latest objection , but not his first .
a staunch euroskeptic , he opposes the treaty as a matter of principle , believing it yields too much sovereignty to the international bloc .
earlier in the week , he had said he could not sign the treaty until the czech courts reviewed its constitutionality .
poland and britain have secured exemptions and the czech republic would not be the first eu country to seek such an exemption .
poland , whose president lech kaczynski signed the treaty on saturday , negotiated an opt-out for such property claims and secured guarantees that the charter would not force them to allow gay marriage .
britain was assured that the treaty would not supercede their national judicial system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 3 million ethnic germans were forced to leave the former czechoslovakia after the war " before ratification , the czech republic must , additionally at least , negotiate a similar exemption , " said klaus .
" i believe that this exemption can be resolved quickly . "
but because all the other eu countries have ratified the treaty , winning such an exemption for the czech republic would theoretically require its renegotiation .
that duty would fall on the shoulders of the czech government , led by prime minister jan fischer .
fischer said previous reviews of the treaty judged that claims like those feared by klaus would be unlikely .
but he said his interim cabinet would nonetheless discuss the issue monday and that he still hoped the treaty could be ratified before the year 's end .
renegotiation could be avoided if eu leaders pass an official declaration that would not be part of the treaty .
french foreign minister bernard kouchner has outright rejected the idea of a change to the treaty itself .
intentional delays ?
some are worried that klaus ' objections are merely stalling tactics , meant to allow british conservative leader david cameron to hold a promised referendum if his party wins an expected general election next year .
" if i were the eu member states , i would n't really be minded to give klaus what he wants .
he has expressed nothing but hostility towards this thing and he suddenly says he 'll do it ' if , " ' center for european policy studies researcher hugo brady told reuters. svs / reuters / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a german car expert has told dw there 's no time left to arrange a new deal before opel goes bust . spain 's industry minister miguel sebastian , on a visit to berlin to discuss the future of opel , has made it clear that his country will not commit to helping the magna buyout under the current terms . " we are not in the right place , to discuss the exact share of state aid that the spanish government might offer , " sebastian said , after opting out of a special meeting in berlin designed to address the rescue plan . spain is calling for magna to guarantee the future of the opel factory in figueruelas , near zaragoza before it commits to helping the canadian car parts maker and its russian backers take command of opel from former parent company general motors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain fears that its factories and workforce are set to lose out so far , magna has only made such promises to german opel factories , and has announced plans to cull around 10,000 jobs across europe in a bid to restore opel 's profitability .
countries like belgium , great britain , and spain are worried that their opel factories - and their economies , by extension - will suffer the job cuts , and are therefore unwilling to help berlin push through the opel deal . the uk government is watching ongoing negotiations between magna and british trade unions about the future of vauxhall -lrb- the british badge for opel -rrb- factories , saying that these are yet to produce " satisfactory results . "
british secretary of state for business , peter mandelson , called for changes to magna 's business plan in an interview with the daily telegraph newspaper , so as to avoid what he described as " negative consequences " for opel 's vauxhall arm . speed of the essence ? german auto industry expert ferdinand dudenhoeffer believes that there is no time to re-evaluate the magna buyout of opel , saying the bid is opel 's only possible solution . " it makes absolutely no sense to continue with general motors , because the employees do n't want that and it was unsuccessful over the last 15 to 20 years , " dudenhoeffer says .
" if they go out and search for a new investor now , they will need at least 12 months to broker a new deal .
and in that time , opel will fall into bankruptcy . " magna needs 4.5 billion euros in state aid to complete its buyout , and wants to finalize the takeover deal with current opel owners general motors in the coming week .
however , with european governments still wrangling over who should pay what , and the deal under european union scrutiny to see if it is anti-competitive , this target is looking increasingly optimistic .
bildunterschrift : opel hopes its new astra will help it turn a profit before it 's too late dudenhoeffer says that german industry experts are baffled by the stance that spain and the uk are now taking with regard to the opel takeover . " they had all this time in the last four months to initiate discussion on the opel deal , " he says .
" they rejected , they did n't provide any money , and now they want to stop the deal and put the opel factories - and the brand itself - in jeopardy . " more meetings magna bosses will have another chance to woo the spanish government on tuesday at a meeting in madrid . " we expect clear progress to come out of this meeting , " industry minister miguel sebastian said in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors in antwerp may need to take to the streets again , the city 's opel factory is still in danger spain is concerned that magna plans to move the production of the opel corsa from the figueruelas factory to eisenach in germany .
sebastian met with his german counterpart karl-theodor zu guttenberg in berlin on friday , rather than attending the magna discussions . representatives from germany , great britain , belgium , austria , hungary , poland and the european commission were present at the official meeting . the future of opel was a major issue during germany 's election campaign , and the social democrats have already seen the opportunity to capitalize , should the deal now fail . the spd state premier for rheinland palatinate , kurt beck , has already bemoaned the " alarming signals coming out of berlin " on the future of opel . " thousands of jobs are at stake - within opel , and at opel 's suppliers . " roughly half of general motors europe 's 54,000-plus employees are based in germany . msh / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

mr laliberte introduced artists and speakers from 14 countries in a two-hour show aimed at drawing attention to global water shortages .
al gore , bono and salma hayek were among those involved .
mr laliberte , founder of the cirque du soleil theatre company , is near the end of a 10-day tourist visit to the iss .
the show , called moving stars and earth for water , was described by its organisers as a poetic social mission .
it began at midnight gmt , with a welcome from mr laliberte onboard the iss .
he then introduced former us vice president and environmental campaigner mr gore , who said that " to solve the climate crisis and safeguard our planet and its beauty will require global effort " .
global stars over the next two hours , the show visited actors , artists , politicians , and activists in 14 countries including south africa , morocco , india , japan and australia .
mr laliberte said earth appeared fragile when seen from space each artist read a section of a poem by man-booker prize-winning author yann martel - emphasising the need for all the world 's population to have access to clean water - followed by a musical or artistic performance .
in south africa , nobel peace prize winner wangari maathai read a passage about the link between water and education , followed by a seafront performance by musical group ladysmith black mambazo .
in london , musician and activist peter gabriel spoke about water as a human right before british singer joss stone performed .
and in mumbai , a reading by indian environmentalist vandana shiva was followed by a video recording of a performance by academy award-winning composer ar rahman .
other performances included inuk singer elisapie isaac in canada , australian opera singer tiffany speich in sydney , moroccan rap group fnaire in marrakech and acrobatic dances by members from mr laliberte 's cirque du soleil .
in new york , a group of dancers staged a " flash-mobbing " in times square .
among the speakers were us actors hayek and matthew mcconaughey , award-winning scientist and environmentalist dr david suzuki , canadian astronaut julie payette and bindi irwin , the young daughter of the late australian wildlife expert , steve irwin .
' so fragile ' the event was broadcast live on the website of one drop , the water charity founded by mr laliberte .
mr laliberte is spending 10 days on board the iss viewers around the world were invited to sign a pledge to cut down on the amount of water they use .
irish singer and activist bono spoke to mr laliberte from a concert of his band , u2 , in tampa , florida .
bono asked mr laliberte , who he called " the first clown in space " , for his perspective of earth from the iss .
" i see stars , i see darkness and emptiness .
but planet earth looks so great , and also so fragile , " said mr laliberte .
" we should not forget that we have a great privilege to live on planet earth . "
mr laliberte blasted into space from the baikonur cosmodrome in kazakhstan on 30 september , accompanied by russian cosmonaut maksim surayev and us astronaut jeffrey williams .
he is the seventh private individual to make the trip and reportedly paid $ 35m for his ticket .
before his departure , he told the bbc he wanted to use his visit to the iss to produce " something that is originally creative " .
" hopefully we will have the result of sensitising people toward the situation of water in the world , " he said .

judges have voiced concerns about plans to build prefabricated courtrooms next to a court that hears high profile terrorism and organised crime trials .
bbc news has learned that the portable units will be assembled in a car park at london 's woolwich crown court .

woolwich crown court is currently one of the main centres for hearing high-security cases that require armed protection .
terror plots bbc home affairs correspondent , danny shaw said the court service was spending £ 6.8m on five modular courtrooms .
in the past five years , the caseload in crown courts across england and wales has risen by more than 11 % , and by 23 % in london .
the new prefabricated courtrooms will be built in a factory before being assembled in the grounds of the court .
they are due to be ready by next september and are designed to last for between five and 10 years .
recently woolwich crown court has dealt with cases such as a £ 53m raid on a securitas depot in kent , the plot to kill thousands of people by blowing up planes with liquid bombs , and a plot to set off car bombs in london and glasgow airport .
last week the uk supreme court opened at middlesex guildhall , which was refurbished and refitted for nearly £ 59m .
the president of the court , lord phillips , said he hoped it would last for at least 100 years .
