bucharest has already asked the european commission to save it from a possible financing crisis .
hungary and latvia have grabbed at lifelines from the imf . thomas mirow , the head of the european bank for reconstruction and development , explained the situation in various eastern european countries and how they can move forward . deutsche welle : romania has joined hungary and latvia in requesting emergency loans from the european union .
how serious is the economic situation in central and eastern europe ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : each country needs to determine its own ideal way through the crisis , mirow said thomas mirow : the situation is certainly difficult .
talks have not yet been concluded , but romania has long been seen as a country that has been at particular risk because of very high debts in foreign currencies .
its own currency has been under pressure for a long time , which makes the decision to look for help from the imf a logical step that will contribute to stabilizing the country . are you afraid of the problem spreading to other countries via the domino effect ? no , i am not .
the situation in other countries is completely different .
i am , however , of the opinion that it makes sense to get in touch with the imf in a timely manner .
international investors usually know to respect that .
when such contact is necessary , it makes more sense to do it early than to wait and , for example , have to accept longer phases of devaluation of one 's own currency . how can the situation be diffused ?
what 's the best way forward ? that 's not easy to say because the causes of the problems are different .
in some countries it 's just the financial sector that is suffering from a weak framework , vulnerable and susceptible to sudden crises .
other countries have a relatively robust financial sector , such as poland , and are affected more by developments in the real economy , like the development in western european auto industry . should the eu emergency funds be built up in the manner some politicians are calling for ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there appears to still be enough eu money to aid countries looking for help the european council of finance ministers debated that issue on tuesday .
first of all , i think it is important that the funds are available to the countries that want to make use of them .
should they be exhausted , then it would certainly be a good idea to have additional resources .
but there are apparently still enough resources available . do you think the current support for eastern europe is sufficient ? no , i think more could and should be done - each within its own area .
most of all , i think it is important that heads of state and government of the eu , possibly when they meet in a little over a week , as well as at the g20 meeting in london in april , make it absolutely clear they are determined to represent the countries of central and eastern europe . it sounds as though you expect action in addition to politicians ' words .
what action ? the resources of the eu that have been mentioned are one element .
a second element is that the imf , the world bank and we , as a bank that has been and continues to be active in eastern europe , give our encouragement and support to help these countries .
additional steps by the european central bank could also be a topic of discussion . is it a good idea to accelerate the adoption of the euro to provide added security ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro zone ca n't afford to weaken its entry criteria yes and no .
yes in the sense that the perspective of membership in the euro zone is a positive signal .
no in the sense that i do not believe the criteria for entry should be weakened , that would hurt confidence in the stability of the euro as a whole .
i think one would be well-advised to think about whether , for example , certain terms of time could be shortened .
but the hard criteria should remain . you have been talking about stability .
how big is the danger of a state in the region going bankrupt ? based on current evidence , this is not a danger . how did eastern europe get into this situation ?
many of the states reformed their financial systems according to the theories set out by western financial experts . eastern europe is , in terms of markets , every highly integrated .
it has , for example , opened its borders to western european banks , but it has not advanced as far in term of politics and its opening to the euro zone .
political integration is lagging behind market integration .
the second reason is that central and eastern europe , in real economic terms , are very dependent on certain key industries , such as the western european automobile industry .
since in addition to the financial crisis and the overall economic crisis we are also dealing with a structural crisis in the global auto industry , countries like hungary , the czech republic and slovakia are hard hit because they live from exports in general and especially from the auto industry . is there a feeling among eastern europeans that they are being neglected by their western neighbors ? i do not think that 's the case , at the moment .
but in western europe , i believe , we have a reason to watch the situation and not allow such development to occur .
it is a symbolic year that we are living in .
twenty years ago the berlin wall fell , and we all remember the contribution hungary made to that event .
we can not allow the impression you mentioned to arise . interview : andreas noll -lrb- sms -rrb- editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

both favor tighter regulation of financial markets instead of increased spending measures . the heads of france and germany came out against a call from the united states that they increase spending to counteract the global economic crisis .
instead they said more regulation of financial markets needed to be the focus of a g20 meeting next month . " we consider that in europe we have already invested a lot for the recovery , and that the problem is not about spending more , but putting in place a system of regulation so that the economic and financial catastrophe that the world is seeing does not reproduce itself , " sarkozy told reporters in berlin on thursday , march 12 . when g20 leaders meet april 2 in london , merkel said they should look to pledges made by european union members last month in the german capital to regulate all financial markets , crack down on tax havens and increase funding for the international monetary fund . merkel said economic rescue packages " can under no circumstances replace the necessary regulation " of the financial markets . us treasury secretary timothy geithner said wednesday that he wanted the g20 to make a " substantial , sustained commitment to stimulus " as a way of stemming the global economic downturn . britain veering from eu position ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is brown going to side with washington at the g20 meeting ?
his british counterpart , alistair darling , said he agreed with washington 's spending policy , setting the stage for an inter-european feud . merkel went above darling 's head on thursday saying that british prime minister gordon brown agreed with his european partners during meetings on the berlin plan .
she added that she was " very optimistic that the european position is unchanged . " merkel is scheduled to meet with brown in britain for talks on friday that are likely to address the issue of additional stimulus measures . meanwhile , to keep deficit spending in the eu in check , french and german finance ministers on thursday reiterated their support for the bloc 's stability and growth pact , which restricts public deficits to 3 percent of annual output . ministers from the two countries issued a joint statement saying they would pursue policies to strengthen public finances . eu must fight protectionism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel are back to seeing eye-to-eye merkel and sarkozy also used their meeting to launch joint industrial projects in the energy and automobile sectors .
the plans cover innovations in the renewable energy sector and research into new methods of propulsion for motor vehicles . the joint projects come after the two countries were at odds over sarkozy 's decision to provide financial support to the french car industry .
both leaders , however , agreed thursday that all eu members should eschew any protectionist measures while coming to the aid of national industries . in addition , sarkozy offered his condolences to the victims of a school shooting which left 16 dead in southern germany wednesday . " france was overwhelmed , " by the attack , the french president said , adding that it could have happened " anywhere in the world .

the vatican said it was not aware of williamson 's views on the holocaust , but critics have pointed out that internet-based material written by williamson on the matter has existed for some time .
the vatican said the letter would be published thursday with copies available in english , italian , french , german , portuguese and spanish .
world anger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british-born cleric richard williamson has stirred anger worldwide williamson 's comments stirred anger in jewish communities throughout the world , as well as in catholic circles .
several european leaders , including german chancellor angela merkel , called on the germany-born pope to explain the vatican 's decision to waive the excommunications .
it is extremely rare in church history for a pope to explain his actions to his bishops after the fact and to acknowledge any error on his behalf .
the pope said that in the future the vatican body charged with negotiating with the sspx - the pontifical commission ecclesia dei - would work more closely with the congregation for the doctrine of the faith , the church 's watchdog on orthodoxy and disciplinary matters .
the views espoused by the sspx are controversial in catholic circles .
the group rejects modernization of the church through a set of reforms created under the second vatican council in the 1960s .
benedict , who took part in the council , said in his letter that sspx clerics would remain suspended from holding any official positions in the church until they fully subscribed to the reforms . dfm / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

first , let me extend my deepest sympathy to all the families of those killed .
i thought germany already had very strict gun laws , stricter than the us .
why did this young man 's father have a gun in the first place ?
all countries need stricter gun laws .
but , will this really stop tragedies like this from happening .
unfortunately , man-made laws do not change a persons heart and therefore , can not stop this completely from happening . - elizabeth hughes , us in reference to such incidents as recent school shootings in germany this question itself completely misses the mark .
it wrongly implies that -lrb- legal -rrb- weapon sales are to be questioned as a " cause " of this behavior .
germany presently has some of the strictest gun control laws in the world with respect to sales and ownership , yet such incidents still occur .
ironically , this may , at least partially , be a legitimate cause .
we also see in the us these shootings most often happening in so-called " gun free zones . "
strict gun control is a double-edged sword .
the only gun use it ever succeeds in reducing is legal legitimate non-threatening gun use by the law abiding while simultaneously raising the black market for illegal guns and also raising the status of these illegal guns in the eyes of the embittered and disenfranchised who sometimes lash out in an environment where they know their tirade will have maximum effect , in a totally unarmed group of people . - gerald morris , canada bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the total death toll rose to 16 it seems to me this mass murder was a " copy cat " of the american high schools that have had similar catastrophes .
in the american killing they found out the use of marijuana in the killers was an important issue , and possible cause .
there are now many new articles associating the use of marijuana -lrb- and hashish -rrb- to becoming psychotic .
many new publications have been appearing .
it would be interesting to have data on the autopsy of this killer and find out if there are marijuana chemicals in his brain -lrb- they stay for several months -rrb- . - jose carranza , us there is shocking news coming from germany today .
i hope that it will push german regulators towards more strict rules concerning possession of weapons for private use . - wojtek , poland i hope that gun laws in germany are not as bad as in finland and the united states of america .
the last major shooting incident in australia that occurred in tasmania back in 1996 made the australian federal government tighten gun laws - surprisingly by former prime minister john howard .
i believe this fellow in germany -lrb- the gunman in question -rrb- committed suicide after what he had done .
he must have had a guilt complex .

first , let me extend my deepest sympathy to all the families of those killed .
i thought germany already had very strict gun laws , stricter than the us .
why did this young man 's father have a gun in the first place ?
all countries need stricter gun laws .
but , will this really stop tragedies like this from happening .
unfortunately , man-made laws do not change a persons heart and therefore , can not stop this completely from happening . - elizabeth hughes , us in reference to such incidents as recent school shootings in germany this question itself completely misses the mark .
it wrongly implies that -lrb- legal -rrb- weapon sales are to be questioned as a " cause " of this behavior .
germany presently has some of the strictest gun control laws in the world with respect to sales and ownership , yet such incidents still occur .
ironically , this may , at least partially , be a legitimate cause .
we also see in the us these shootings most often happening in so-called " gun free zones . "
strict gun control is a double-edged sword .
the only gun use it ever succeeds in reducing is legal legitimate non-threatening gun use by the law abiding while simultaneously raising the black market for illegal guns and also raising the status of these illegal guns in the eyes of the embittered and disenfranchised who sometimes lash out in an environment where they know their tirade will have maximum effect , in a totally unarmed group of people . - gerald morris , canada bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the total death toll rose to 16 it seems to me this mass murder was a " copy cat " of the american high schools that have had similar catastrophes .
in the american killing they found out the use of marijuana in the killers was an important issue , and possible cause .
there are now many new articles associating the use of marijuana -lrb- and hashish -rrb- to becoming psychotic .
many new publications have been appearing .
it would be interesting to have data on the autopsy of this killer and find out if there are marijuana chemicals in his brain -lrb- they stay for several months -rrb- . - jose carranza , us there is shocking news coming from germany today .
i hope that it will push german regulators towards more strict rules concerning possession of weapons for private use . - wojtek , poland i hope that gun laws in germany are not as bad as in finland and the united states of america .
the last major shooting incident in australia that occurred in tasmania back in 1996 made the australian federal government tighten gun laws - surprisingly by former prime minister john howard .
i believe this fellow in germany -lrb- the gunman in question -rrb- committed suicide after what he had done .
he must have had a guilt complex .
my advice is to tighten gun law like what happened in australia last time in 1996 . - stuart john pearson , australia your entire article on the school shootings does not include one reference about the parents , except that the gun may have come from the father 's collection .
you state what everyone else thinks society should do .
have you totally absolved the parents from responsibility ?
perhaps his problem was at home not at the school .
give a little more balance to your reporting . - barbara dreher , us just check the baggage of all german students ! - kathe herberg , brazil i was shocked to read of the terrible news of the albertville school shooting in winnenden , germany .
please accept my deepest condolences to all the families affected by this horrendous tragedy .

but others called for measures to protect children to be put in place . a day after a deadly school shooting , german politicians said they would refrain from making any rash decisions on gun control or school safety .
the first thing to do was collect facts about the shooting which left 16 dead , including the teenaged gunman , politicians said .
the scene in front of the school in winnenden was pure emotion on thursday , march 12 .
students had tears streaming down their faces as they held each other , trying to come to terms with the horrible killings .
" i do n't know if i can stay at this school .
every time you enter , the memories come back , " student christin pluengel told reuters .
the 17-year-old gunman , identified as tim k. , fired 112 rounds , 60 in the school , and had 109 unused rounds with him when his body was found by police .
many of the victims were shot at close range with a 9 millimeter beretta pistol .
as police closed in , he eventually killed himself .

" whoever points denounces addiction to computer games or an infatuation with weapons as the cause for these kinds of terrible acts hinders the search for the complex problems and reasons that precede such crimes , " he said in berlin on thursday . laws ca n't prevent violence german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble said lawmakers are not able to completely protect against every possible threat . " absolute security does not exist , " he said in berlin , adding that germany needed to look at " what is going on in our society . " schaeuble , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union , said the country needed to concentrate on strengthening the role of the family and teaching moral values to children rather than calling for tighter restrictions on gun ownership . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blaming computer games is too easy an answer , von der leyen said " i ca n't see how a change in weapons rules would contribute anything to solving the problem , " schaeuble told reuters . calls for stricter gun control laws were issued after police said they suspected the gunman got the pistol he used in wednesday 's massacre from his parents ' bedroom . father could face charges his father , reportedly a member of a local shooting club , is said to own over a dozen guns , all locked away except the nine-millimeter beretta that caused the carnage .
german authorities said they are considering whether to press charges against his father . " everything here points to negligence on the part of the father as far as the storage of this weapon is concerned , " said police spokesman ralf michelfelder . germany tightened its gun control laws twice since a 2002 school shooting in the city of erfurt , but politicians said the restrictions could not have prevented wednesday 's events or a 2006 school shooting . preventative measures needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police said the teenager 's father could face charges sebastian edathy , an interior affairs expert for the social democratic party , agreed with schaeuble on the impossibility of absolute safety .
instead , he said , germany should consider preventative ways to deal with violence in schools . " here in germany we have significantly fewer school psychologists for students than in other european countries , " he told german television channel phoenix , adding that schools should consider adding trained mental-health workers to their staffs . leaders of the greens said wednesday 's tragic events should be analyzed by experts in order to uncover " hidden signals from students with problems . " " we need a culture that pay attention and recognizes problems , " party heads claudia roth and cem ozdemir said . german family minister ursula von der leyen made a similar statement , saying that most acts of violence are preceded by warnings .

" everything here points to negligence on the part of the father as far as the storage of this weapon is concerned , " said police spokesman ralf michelfelder . germany tightened its gun control laws twice since a 2002 school shooting in the city of erfurt , but politicians said the restrictions could not have prevented wednesday 's events or a 2006 school shooting . preventative measures needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police said the teenager 's father could face charges sebastian edathy , an interior affairs expert for the social democratic party , agreed with schaeuble on the impossibility of absolute safety .
instead , he said , germany should consider preventative ways to deal with violence in schools . " here in germany we have significantly fewer school psychologists for students than in other european countries , " he told german television channel phoenix , adding that schools should consider adding trained mental-health workers to their staffs . leaders of the greens said wednesday 's tragic events should be analyzed by experts in order to uncover " hidden signals from students with problems . " " we need a culture that pay attention and recognizes problems , " party heads claudia roth and cem ozdemir said . german family minister ursula von der leyen made a similar statement , saying that most acts of violence are preceded by warnings .

but a new charm offensive launched by the berlin senate hopes to spread an aura of friendliness about the capital . grumpy , sarcastic , and none too shy about piping up with a flippant comeback - that 's the attitude known as the berlin " schnauze " or " snout " to use its literal english translation .
the berlin senate is hoping to counteract its residents ' innate churlishness by appointing 4,000 civil servants , including police officers , public transport workers , waiters and trade fair hostesses to be " good-mood ambassadors . "
they 'll receive red buttons singling them out as friendly sources of information for newcomers and visitors to the capital .
the goal is " to make the city a little more friendly , " said rene gurka of berlin partner , the company behind the campaign , which kicked off this week in conjunction with the start of the annual itb tourism trade fair . " a few years ago , we did a study that showed that non-germans considered berlin a place full of grumpy people , " senate spokesman richard meng told news agency afp .
" we need to show the world that this is n't true . "
confronting stereotypes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's police officers are being encouraged to lighten up a little as part of the campaign , which is expected to cost 200,000 euros -lrb- $ 255,000 -rrb- , civil servants will also hand out postcards printed with prime examples of berliners ' unique brand of sarcasm - and written in the local dialect , of course .
the phrases are meant to be a light-hearted poke in the ribs of the stereotypical berliner , while also showing that it is possible to do service with a smile .
" these cards are fantastic , they show we do n't always take ourselves too seriously and that we can laugh at ourselves , too , " said meng .
berlin is visited by more than eight million tourists annually , and is expecting an increase in tourism this year as it celebrates the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall .
it 's not the first time officials have been after locals to put a shine on the city 's image .
when germany hosted the soccer world cup in 2006 , berlin taxi drivers were offered extra training in english and courteous service as part of a national friendliness campaign .
and a multi-million-euro campaign launched last year under the motto " be berlin " encouraged locals to project a more positive image to foreigners and tourists .
as yet , there are no statistics to attest to whether or not such campaigns bring about lasting , real change .
but organizers such as gurka say there 's not really much changing to do : beneath their rough exterior , most berliners already are " service-oriented , hospitable and cosmopolitan people .

an autopsy will be conducted to identify the remains . while announcing the discovery of a second corpse on thursday , march 12 , a cologne fire department spokesperson could not confirm whether the body found was that of a 24-year-old who reportedly lived in a building near the archive and has been missing since the archive suddenly collapsed on march 3 . the remains , which were found nine meters -lrb- 29.5 feet -rrb- beneath ground level , had not yet been removed from the rubble and it was impossible to tell thursday evening if they were from a man or woman , the spokesman added . autopsy needed police officials said they would not comment on find until an autopsy confirming the deceased 's identity could be conducted . the collapse 's only other known victim , a 17-year-old boy , was found over the weekend . the collapse appeared to be linked to tunneling work for a new underground train line that undermined the archive , which was crammed with manuscripts detailing europe 's medieval heritage and the works of great authors and musicians . the disaster is one of germany 's worst heritage losses since world war ii . the archives , which had six levels above ground and two below , were described as the richest municipal record collection in northern continental europe , including decrees by emperors , lists of medieval residents and centuries of merchants ' records . sms / th / dpa / afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but a new charm offensive launched by the berlin senate hopes to spread an aura of friendliness about the capital . grumpy , sarcastic , and none too shy about piping up with a flippant comeback - that 's the attitude known as the berlin " schnauze " or " snout " to use its literal english translation .
the berlin senate is hoping to counteract its residents ' innate churlishness by appointing 4,000 civil servants , including police officers , public transport workers , waiters and trade fair hostesses to be " good-mood ambassadors . "
they 'll receive red buttons singling them out as friendly sources of information for newcomers and visitors to the capital .
the goal is " to make the city a little more friendly , " said rene gurka of berlin partner , the company behind the campaign , which kicked off this week in conjunction with the start of the annual itb tourism trade fair . " a few years ago , we did a study that showed that non-germans considered berlin a place full of grumpy people , " senate spokesman richard meng told news agency afp .
" we need to show the world that this is n't true . "

the phrases are meant to be a light-hearted poke in the ribs of the stereotypical berliner , while also showing that it is possible to do service with a smile .
" these cards are fantastic , they show we do n't always take ourselves too seriously and that we can laugh at ourselves , too , " said meng .
berlin is visited by more than eight million tourists annually , and is expecting an increase in tourism this year as it celebrates the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall .
it 's not the first time officials have been after locals to put a shine on the city 's image .
when germany hosted the soccer world cup in 2006 , berlin taxi drivers were offered extra training in english and courteous service as part of a national friendliness campaign .
and a multi-million-euro campaign launched last year under the motto " be berlin " encouraged locals to project a more positive image to foreigners and tourists .
as yet , there are no statistics to attest to whether or not such campaigns bring about lasting , real change .

the first thing to do was collect facts about the shooting which left 16 dead , including the teenaged gunman , politicians said .

the 17-year-old gunman , identified as tim k. , fired 112 rounds , 60 in the school , and had 109 unused rounds with him when his body was found by police .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 12.03.2009 experts warn against oversimplifying causes of school shooting großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany mourned for the shooting 's victims german politicians of all parties said the country needed to avoid making knee-jerk reactions to the school shooting that shocked germany .
but others called for measures to protect children to be put in place . a day after a deadly school shooting , german politicians said they would refrain from making any rash decisions on gun control or school safety .
the first thing to do was collect facts about the shooting which left 16 dead , including the teenaged gunman , politicians said .
the scene in front of the school in winnenden was pure emotion on thursday , march 12 .
students had tears streaming down their faces as they held each other , trying to come to terms with the horrible killings .
" i do n't know if i can stay at this school .
every time you enter , the memories come back , " student christin pluengel told reuters .
the 17-year-old gunman , identified as tim k. , fired 112 rounds , 60 in the school , and had 109 unused rounds with him when his body was found by police .
many of the victims were shot at close range with a 9 millimeter beretta pistol .
as police closed in , he eventually killed himself .
oversimplifying problem wo n't help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians will debate whether to tighten gun laws while there were general warnings against knee-jerk reactions , some politicians did call for measures to be taken to prevent such a shooting in the future . individual politicians and police groups pointed to metal detectors in school doorways , a ban on violent video games and stricter gun laws as potential ways to keep kids from falling victim to future violence . but such steps oversimplify a complex problem , according to joachim von gottberg , vice president of the children 's charity of germany . " whoever points denounces addiction to computer games or an infatuation with weapons as the cause for these kinds of terrible acts hinders the search for the complex problems and reasons that precede such crimes , " he said in berlin on thursday . laws ca n't prevent violence german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble said lawmakers are not able to completely protect against every possible threat . " absolute security does not exist , " he said in berlin , adding that germany needed to look at " what is going on in our society . " schaeuble , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union , said the country needed to concentrate on strengthening the role of the family and teaching moral values to children rather than calling for tighter restrictions on gun ownership . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blaming computer games is too easy an answer , von der leyen said " i ca n't see how a change in weapons rules would contribute anything to solving the problem , " schaeuble told reuters . calls for stricter gun control laws were issued after police said they suspected the gunman got the pistol he used in wednesday 's massacre from his parents ' bedroom . father could face charges his father , reportedly a member of a local shooting club , is said to own over a dozen guns , all locked away except the nine-millimeter beretta that caused the carnage .
german authorities said they are considering whether to press charges against his father . " everything here points to negligence on the part of the father as far as the storage of this weapon is concerned , " said police spokesman ralf michelfelder . germany tightened its gun control laws twice since a 2002 school shooting in the city of erfurt , but politicians said the restrictions could not have prevented wednesday 's events or a 2006 school shooting . preventative measures needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police said the teenager 's father could face charges sebastian edathy , an interior affairs expert for the social democratic party , agreed with schaeuble on the impossibility of absolute safety .
instead , he said , germany should consider preventative ways to deal with violence in schools . " here in germany we have significantly fewer school psychologists for students than in other european countries , " he told german television channel phoenix , adding that schools should consider adding trained mental-health workers to their staffs . leaders of the greens said wednesday 's tragic events should be analyzed by experts in order to uncover " hidden signals from students with problems . " " we need a culture that pay attention and recognizes problems , " party heads claudia roth and cem ozdemir said . german family minister ursula von der leyen made a similar statement , saying that most acts of violence are preceded by warnings . " we have to learn what the typical warning signs are , " she told the neue presse newspaper on thursday . sms / th / ap / dpa / afp / retuers send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the first thing to do was collect facts about the shooting which left 16 dead , including the teenaged gunman , politicians said .

students had tears streaming down their faces as they held each other , trying to come to terms with the horrible killings .

the 17-year-old gunman , identified as tim k. , fired 112 rounds , 60 in the school , and had 109 unused rounds with him when his body was found by police .

both favor tighter regulation of financial markets instead of increased spending measures . the heads of france and germany came out against a call from the united states that they increase spending to counteract the global economic crisis .
instead they said more regulation of financial markets needed to be the focus of a g20 meeting next month . " we consider that in europe we have already invested a lot for the recovery , and that the problem is not about spending more , but putting in place a system of regulation so that the economic and financial catastrophe that the world is seeing does not reproduce itself , " sarkozy told reporters in berlin on thursday , march 12 . when g20 leaders meet april 2 in london , merkel said they should look to pledges made by european union members last month in the german capital to regulate all financial markets , crack down on tax havens and increase funding for the international monetary fund . merkel said economic rescue packages " can under no circumstances replace the necessary regulation " of the financial markets . us treasury secretary timothy geithner said wednesday that he wanted the g20 to make a " substantial , sustained commitment to stimulus " as a way of stemming the global economic downturn . britain veering from eu position ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is brown going to side with washington at the g20 meeting ?
his british counterpart , alistair darling , said he agreed with washington 's spending policy , setting the stage for an inter-european feud . merkel went above darling 's head on thursday saying that british prime minister gordon brown agreed with his european partners during meetings on the berlin plan .
she added that she was " very optimistic that the european position is unchanged . " merkel is scheduled to meet with brown in britain for talks on friday that are likely to address the issue of additional stimulus measures . meanwhile , to keep deficit spending in the eu in check , french and german finance ministers on thursday reiterated their support for the bloc 's stability and growth pact , which restricts public deficits to 3 percent of annual output . ministers from the two countries issued a joint statement saying they would pursue policies to strengthen public finances . eu must fight protectionism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel are back to seeing eye-to-eye merkel and sarkozy also used their meeting to launch joint industrial projects in the energy and automobile sectors .
the plans cover innovations in the renewable energy sector and research into new methods of propulsion for motor vehicles . the joint projects come after the two countries were at odds over sarkozy 's decision to provide financial support to the french car industry .
both leaders , however , agreed thursday that all eu members should eschew any protectionist measures while coming to the aid of national industries . in addition , sarkozy offered his condolences to the victims of a school shooting which left 16 dead in southern germany wednesday . " france was overwhelmed , " by the attack , the french president said , adding that it could have happened " anywhere in the world .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de reader response -pipe- 12.03.2009 readers debate gun control laws after school shooting großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the massacre has stunned the residents of winnenden in the wake of a school shooting in southern germany , which left 16 people dead including the young gunmen , readers express their condolences and weigh in on the effectiveness of gun control laws . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
first , let me extend my deepest sympathy to all the families of those killed .
i thought germany already had very strict gun laws , stricter than the us .
why did this young man 's father have a gun in the first place ?
all countries need stricter gun laws .
but , will this really stop tragedies like this from happening .
unfortunately , man-made laws do not change a persons heart and therefore , can not stop this completely from happening . - elizabeth hughes , us in reference to such incidents as recent school shootings in germany this question itself completely misses the mark .
it wrongly implies that -lrb- legal -rrb- weapon sales are to be questioned as a " cause " of this behavior .
germany presently has some of the strictest gun control laws in the world with respect to sales and ownership , yet such incidents still occur .
ironically , this may , at least partially , be a legitimate cause .
we also see in the us these shootings most often happening in so-called " gun free zones . "
strict gun control is a double-edged sword .
the only gun use it ever succeeds in reducing is legal legitimate non-threatening gun use by the law abiding while simultaneously raising the black market for illegal guns and also raising the status of these illegal guns in the eyes of the embittered and disenfranchised who sometimes lash out in an environment where they know their tirade will have maximum effect , in a totally unarmed group of people . - gerald morris , canada bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the total death toll rose to 16 it seems to me this mass murder was a " copy cat " of the american high schools that have had similar catastrophes .
in the american killing they found out the use of marijuana in the killers was an important issue , and possible cause .
there are now many new articles associating the use of marijuana -lrb- and hashish -rrb- to becoming psychotic .
many new publications have been appearing .
it would be interesting to have data on the autopsy of this killer and find out if there are marijuana chemicals in his brain -lrb- they stay for several months -rrb- . - jose carranza , us there is shocking news coming from germany today .
i hope that it will push german regulators towards more strict rules concerning possession of weapons for private use . - wojtek , poland i hope that gun laws in germany are not as bad as in finland and the united states of america .
the last major shooting incident in australia that occurred in tasmania back in 1996 made the australian federal government tighten gun laws - surprisingly by former prime minister john howard .
i believe this fellow in germany -lrb- the gunman in question -rrb- committed suicide after what he had done .
he must have had a guilt complex .
my advice is to tighten gun law like what happened in australia last time in 1996 . - stuart john pearson , australia your entire article on the school shootings does not include one reference about the parents , except that the gun may have come from the father 's collection .
you state what everyone else thinks society should do .
have you totally absolved the parents from responsibility ?
perhaps his problem was at home not at the school .
give a little more balance to your reporting . - barbara dreher , us just check the baggage of all german students ! - kathe herberg , brazil i was shocked to read of the terrible news of the albertville school shooting in winnenden , germany .
please accept my deepest condolences to all the families affected by this horrendous tragedy .
my thoughts and prayers go with you in your time of need .
may the lord bring you some much needed comfort .
please take care and god bless you all ! - carol ann stewart , canada compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de german teenage gunman warned of plans in chatroom germany was a nation in mourning thursday as people struggled to come to terms with wednesday 's school shooting in the state of baden-wuerttemberg that left 16 people dead , including the teenage gunman .
-lrb- 12.03.2009 -rrb- observers say germany must be better prepared for school shootings germany reeled with shock after a 17-year-old gunned down students at a school in a rampage that left 15 dead before he took his own life .
but now some are also saying the country needs to learn from this latest tragedy .
-lrb- 11.03.2009 -rrb- a recent history of deadly school shooting sprees the shooting spree at a school in the south of germany on wednesday added to the growing list of killings by students at schools and universities .
-lrb- 11.03.2009 -rrb- feedback would stricter gun laws help prevent school shootings ?

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
first , let me extend my deepest sympathy to all the families of those killed .
i thought germany already had very strict gun laws , stricter than the us .
why did this young man 's father have a gun in the first place ?
all countries need stricter gun laws .
but , will this really stop tragedies like this from happening .
unfortunately , man-made laws do not change a persons heart and therefore , can not stop this completely from happening . - elizabeth hughes , us in reference to such incidents as recent school shootings in germany this question itself completely misses the mark .
it wrongly implies that -lrb- legal -rrb- weapon sales are to be questioned as a " cause " of this behavior .
germany presently has some of the strictest gun control laws in the world with respect to sales and ownership , yet such incidents still occur .
ironically , this may , at least partially , be a legitimate cause .
we also see in the us these shootings most often happening in so-called " gun free zones . "
strict gun control is a double-edged sword .
the only gun use it ever succeeds in reducing is legal legitimate non-threatening gun use by the law abiding while simultaneously raising the black market for illegal guns and also raising the status of these illegal guns in the eyes of the embittered and disenfranchised who sometimes lash out in an environment where they know their tirade will have maximum effect , in a totally unarmed group of people . - gerald morris , canada bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the total death toll rose to 16 it seems to me this mass murder was a " copy cat " of the american high schools that have had similar catastrophes .
in the american killing they found out the use of marijuana in the killers was an important issue , and possible cause .
there are now many new articles associating the use of marijuana -lrb- and hashish -rrb- to becoming psychotic .
many new publications have been appearing .
it would be interesting to have data on the autopsy of this killer and find out if there are marijuana chemicals in his brain -lrb- they stay for several months -rrb- . - jose carranza , us there is shocking news coming from germany today .
i hope that it will push german regulators towards more strict rules concerning possession of weapons for private use . - wojtek , poland i hope that gun laws in germany are not as bad as in finland and the united states of america .
the last major shooting incident in australia that occurred in tasmania back in 1996 made the australian federal government tighten gun laws - surprisingly by former prime minister john howard .
i believe this fellow in germany -lrb- the gunman in question -rrb- committed suicide after what he had done .
he must have had a guilt complex .
my advice is to tighten gun law like what happened in australia last time in 1996 . - stuart john pearson , australia your entire article on the school shootings does not include one reference about the parents , except that the gun may have come from the father 's collection .
you state what everyone else thinks society should do .
have you totally absolved the parents from responsibility ?
perhaps his problem was at home not at the school .
give a little more balance to your reporting . - barbara dreher , us just check the baggage of all german students ! - kathe herberg , brazil i was shocked to read of the terrible news of the albertville school shooting in winnenden , germany .
please accept my deepest condolences to all the families affected by this horrendous tragedy .
my thoughts and prayers go with you in your time of need .
may the lord bring you some much needed comfort .
please take care and god bless you all ! - carol ann stewart , canada compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bucharest has already asked the european commission to save it from a possible financing crisis .
hungary and latvia have grabbed at lifelines from the imf . thomas mirow , the head of the european bank for reconstruction and development , explained the situation in various eastern european countries and how they can move forward . deutsche welle : romania has joined hungary and latvia in requesting emergency loans from the european union .
how serious is the economic situation in central and eastern europe ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : each country needs to determine its own ideal way through the crisis , mirow said thomas mirow : the situation is certainly difficult .
talks have not yet been concluded , but romania has long been seen as a country that has been at particular risk because of very high debts in foreign currencies .
its own currency has been under pressure for a long time , which makes the decision to look for help from the imf a logical step that will contribute to stabilizing the country . are you afraid of the problem spreading to other countries via the domino effect ? no , i am not .
the situation in other countries is completely different .
i am , however , of the opinion that it makes sense to get in touch with the imf in a timely manner .
international investors usually know to respect that .
when such contact is necessary , it makes more sense to do it early than to wait and , for example , have to accept longer phases of devaluation of one 's own currency . how can the situation be diffused ?
what 's the best way forward ? that 's not easy to say because the causes of the problems are different .
in some countries it 's just the financial sector that is suffering from a weak framework , vulnerable and susceptible to sudden crises .
other countries have a relatively robust financial sector , such as poland , and are affected more by developments in the real economy , like the development in western european auto industry . should the eu emergency funds be built up in the manner some politicians are calling for ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there appears to still be enough eu money to aid countries looking for help the european council of finance ministers debated that issue on tuesday .
first of all , i think it is important that the funds are available to the countries that want to make use of them .
should they be exhausted , then it would certainly be a good idea to have additional resources .
but there are apparently still enough resources available . do you think the current support for eastern europe is sufficient ? no , i think more could and should be done - each within its own area .
most of all , i think it is important that heads of state and government of the eu , possibly when they meet in a little over a week , as well as at the g20 meeting in london in april , make it absolutely clear they are determined to represent the countries of central and eastern europe . it sounds as though you expect action in addition to politicians ' words .
what action ? the resources of the eu that have been mentioned are one element .
a second element is that the imf , the world bank and we , as a bank that has been and continues to be active in eastern europe , give our encouragement and support to help these countries .
additional steps by the european central bank could also be a topic of discussion . is it a good idea to accelerate the adoption of the euro to provide added security ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro zone ca n't afford to weaken its entry criteria yes and no .
yes in the sense that the perspective of membership in the euro zone is a positive signal .
no in the sense that i do not believe the criteria for entry should be weakened , that would hurt confidence in the stability of the euro as a whole .
i think one would be well-advised to think about whether , for example , certain terms of time could be shortened .
but the hard criteria should remain . you have been talking about stability .
how big is the danger of a state in the region going bankrupt ? based on current evidence , this is not a danger . how did eastern europe get into this situation ?
many of the states reformed their financial systems according to the theories set out by western financial experts . eastern europe is , in terms of markets , every highly integrated .
it has , for example , opened its borders to western european banks , but it has not advanced as far in term of politics and its opening to the euro zone .
political integration is lagging behind market integration .
the second reason is that central and eastern europe , in real economic terms , are very dependent on certain key industries , such as the western european automobile industry .
since in addition to the financial crisis and the overall economic crisis we are also dealing with a structural crisis in the global auto industry , countries like hungary , the czech republic and slovakia are hard hit because they live from exports in general and especially from the auto industry . is there a feeling among eastern europeans that they are being neglected by their western neighbors ? i do not think that 's the case , at the moment .
but in western europe , i believe , we have a reason to watch the situation and not allow such development to occur .
it is a symbolic year that we are living in .
twenty years ago the berlin wall fell , and we all remember the contribution hungary made to that event .
we can not allow the impression you mentioned to arise . interview : andreas noll -lrb- sms -rrb- editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de eu leaders signal possible fast-tracks in euro membership the leaders of several euro zone member states have given tacit signals that applications to join the single-currency bloc could be expedited as the financial crisis rolls on .
-lrb- 02.03.2009 -rrb- eastern european banks receive multi-billion-euro bailout package several western economic institutions said on friday they would provide 24.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 31.1 billion -rrb- in aid to struggling banks and businesses in central and eastern europe .
-lrb- 27.02.2009 -rrb- germany prepared to lend financial help to eastern europe german chancellor angela merkel said her country was ready to help eastern european countries experiencing economic difficulty .
aid would come mainly via the imf and likely go to nations outside the euro zone .

" i 'm serious … i have weapons here and tomorrow morning i am going to go to my old school and really fry them .

three bystanders were also killed as the gunman attempted to flee police . tim k. was pursued by hundreds of armed police officers and snipers , assisted by helicopters and dogs .
less than three hours after his rampage began , he turned his weapon on himself after being injured in an exchange of fire with police . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police commandos leave the albertville school on wednesday german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble ordered flags across the country to be flown at half mast on thursday . a first memorial service was held on wednesday evening in a church in the town of 27,000 people .

the berlin senate is hoping to counteract its residents ' innate churlishness by appointing 4,000 civil servants , including police officers , public transport workers , waiters and trade fair hostesses to be " good-mood ambassadors . "

" i 'm serious … i have weapons here and tomorrow morning i am going to go to my old school and really fry them .
keep the name winnenden in mind , " the teenager wrote . the teenager went on a rampage in his former secondary school in the small town of winnenden in the state of baden-wuerttemberg in southwestern germany on wednesday morning , shooting nine students between the ages of 15 and 16 , as well as three teachers .
three bystanders were also killed as the gunman attempted to flee police . tim k. was pursued by hundreds of armed police officers and snipers , assisted by helicopters and dogs .
less than three hours after his rampage began , he turned his weapon on himself after being injured in an exchange of fire with police . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police commandos leave the albertville school on wednesday german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble ordered flags across the country to be flown at half mast on thursday . a first memorial service was held on wednesday evening in a church in the town of 27,000 people .
mourners lit candles at the altar , and created a makeshift memorial of candles and flowers outside the albertville school , where the shooting spree occurred .
psychologists advise long-term care the albertville secondary school has been closed until further notice , and at least one psychologist has advised that it should remain closed permanently , as students would otherwise be forced to relive the trauma .
a team of psychologists and spiritual advisors are in winnenden to care for the victims ' family members , the students and their teachers .
according to spiritual advisor ralf radix , the community will need long-term care if they are to come to terms with wednesday 's tragic events .
" each person affected needs something different , " he told germany 's protestant church press service , epd .
" one person might need some peace and quiet , which we then have to create in the midst of all this hectic activity , and someone else might need a partner to talk to . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel offered her sympathy to the family members of the victims in her initial comments on the shooting , a visibly shaken chancellor angela merkel on wednesday described the crime as " incomprehensible . "
" it is a day of mourning for the whole of germany , " she said .
" our thoughts go out to the families and the friends .
we are thinking of you and we are praying for you . "
politicians call for action in the meantime , politicians have begun to voice their opinions on ways to better protect germany 's students and prevent such massacres from happening in the future .
the head of the parliamentary interior committee , sebastian edathy -lrb- spd -rrb- said he thought the case could be made to install metal detectors at select schools .
while such measures have become commonplace at schools in the united states in the wake of the columbine school shooting in 1999 , germany has so far resisted tougher security systems in its schools .

all but one of the nine students , aged between 14 and 16 , were girls , and the three teachers gunned down were all women . heribert rech , interior minister of the german state of baden-wuerttemberg , where the crime was committed , said he did n't want to draw conclusions , telling journalists that could have been based on how the classes were drawn up . however , rech did admit that the fact that most of the victims were killed with a shot to the head indicated that they were not random targets . portrait of a killer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police are examining the gunman 's computer looking for answers the perpetrator , identified only as tim k. , was described by school officials as being an unremarkable student . he had achieved average marks on his school leaving certificate and had then enrolled in a course to become a salesman .
tim k. also regularly worked out at the gym and belonged to a sports club . however , a 19-year-old neighbor , who identified himself as michael and said he used to play table tennis with the gunman , told the reuters news agency that tim k. was a loner who had a big collection of horror films . germany has strict gun control laws .
yet police say the gunman had used a nine millimeter pistol registered to his father , a member of a gun club who has a collection of 15 guns at home . emergency plans in place after a school shooting in germany in 2002 , many schools have implemented plans laying out what to do in the event that a gunman should attack the school . authorities are reporting that once the gunman entered the school , the principal announced a coded message on the public address system , saying , " frau koma is coming . " one student , identified only as kim s. , told zdf television that their teacher shut the door and told them to close the windows and sit on the floor . focus on prevention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say students are often best able to identify potential attackers in addition to finding the motive of the killer , many in germany are wondering how these types of attacks can be prevented in the future . wilhelm heitmeyer , a sociologist who specializes in school violence , told deutsche welle that the best people to identify a potential attacker are fellow students . " we see that a lot of the perpetrators are very isolated and they speak out about violent acts , " he says , " and it 's the peers , and not the teachers , who are going to notice this the most . " heitmeyer warns , however , that what actually triggers these people to finally act out is a mystery .

but a new charm offensive launched by the berlin senate hopes to spread an aura of friendliness about the capital . grumpy , sarcastic , and none too shy about piping up with a flippant comeback - that 's the attitude known as the berlin " schnauze " or " snout " to use its literal english translation .
the berlin senate is hoping to counteract its residents ' innate churlishness by appointing 4,000 civil servants , including police officers , public transport workers , waiters and trade fair hostesses to be " good-mood ambassadors . "
they 'll receive red buttons singling them out as friendly sources of information for newcomers and visitors to the capital .
the goal is " to make the city a little more friendly , " said rene gurka of berlin partner , the company behind the campaign , which kicked off this week in conjunction with the start of the annual itb tourism trade fair . " a few years ago , we did a study that showed that non-germans considered berlin a place full of grumpy people , " senate spokesman richard meng told news agency afp .
" we need to show the world that this is n't true . "
confronting stereotypes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's police officers are being encouraged to lighten up a little as part of the campaign , which is expected to cost 200,000 euros -lrb- $ 255,000 -rrb- , civil servants will also hand out postcards printed with prime examples of berliners ' unique brand of sarcasm - and written in the local dialect , of course .
the phrases are meant to be a light-hearted poke in the ribs of the stereotypical berliner , while also showing that it is possible to do service with a smile .
" these cards are fantastic , they show we do n't always take ourselves too seriously and that we can laugh at ourselves , too , " said meng .
berlin is visited by more than eight million tourists annually , and is expecting an increase in tourism this year as it celebrates the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall .
it 's not the first time officials have been after locals to put a shine on the city 's image .
when germany hosted the soccer world cup in 2006 , berlin taxi drivers were offered extra training in english and courteous service as part of a national friendliness campaign .
and a multi-million-euro campaign launched last year under the motto " be berlin " encouraged locals to project a more positive image to foreigners and tourists .
as yet , there are no statistics to attest to whether or not such campaigns bring about lasting , real change .
but organizers such as gurka say there 's not really much changing to do : beneath their rough exterior , most berliners already are " service-oriented , hospitable and cosmopolitan people .

but a new charm offensive launched by the berlin senate hopes to spread an aura of friendliness about the capital . grumpy , sarcastic , and none too shy about piping up with a flippant comeback - that 's the attitude known as the berlin " schnauze " or " snout " to use its literal english translation .
the berlin senate is hoping to counteract its residents ' innate churlishness by appointing 4,000 civil servants , including police officers , public transport workers , waiters and trade fair hostesses to be " good-mood ambassadors . "
they 'll receive red buttons singling them out as friendly sources of information for newcomers and visitors to the capital .
the goal is " to make the city a little more friendly , " said rene gurka of berlin partner , the company behind the campaign , which kicked off this week in conjunction with the start of the annual itb tourism trade fair . " a few years ago , we did a study that showed that non-germans considered berlin a place full of grumpy people , " senate spokesman richard meng told news agency afp .
" we need to show the world that this is n't true . "
confronting stereotypes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's police officers are being encouraged to lighten up a little as part of the campaign , which is expected to cost 200,000 euros -lrb- $ 255,000 -rrb- , civil servants will also hand out postcards printed with prime examples of berliners ' unique brand of sarcasm - and written in the local dialect , of course .
the phrases are meant to be a light-hearted poke in the ribs of the stereotypical berliner , while also showing that it is possible to do service with a smile .
" these cards are fantastic , they show we do n't always take ourselves too seriously and that we can laugh at ourselves , too , " said meng .
berlin is visited by more than eight million tourists annually , and is expecting an increase in tourism this year as it celebrates the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall .
it 's not the first time officials have been after locals to put a shine on the city 's image .
when germany hosted the soccer world cup in 2006 , berlin taxi drivers were offered extra training in english and courteous service as part of a national friendliness campaign .
and a multi-million-euro campaign launched last year under the motto " be berlin " encouraged locals to project a more positive image to foreigners and tourists .
as yet , there are no statistics to attest to whether or not such campaigns bring about lasting , real change .
but organizers such as gurka say there 's not really much changing to do : beneath their rough exterior , most berliners already are " service-oriented , hospitable and cosmopolitan people .

how serious is the economic situation in central and eastern europe ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : each country needs to determine its own ideal way through the crisis , mirow said thomas mirow : the situation is certainly difficult .
talks have not yet been concluded , but romania has long been seen as a country that has been at particular risk because of very high debts in foreign currencies .
its own currency has been under pressure for a long time , which makes the decision to look for help from the imf a logical step that will contribute to stabilizing the country . are you afraid of the problem spreading to other countries via the domino effect ? no , i am not .
the situation in other countries is completely different .
i am , however , of the opinion that it makes sense to get in touch with the imf in a timely manner .
international investors usually know to respect that .
when such contact is necessary , it makes more sense to do it early than to wait and , for example , have to accept longer phases of devaluation of one 's own currency . how can the situation be diffused ?
what 's the best way forward ? that 's not easy to say because the causes of the problems are different .
in some countries it 's just the financial sector that is suffering from a weak framework , vulnerable and susceptible to sudden crises .
other countries have a relatively robust financial sector , such as poland , and are affected more by developments in the real economy , like the development in western european auto industry . should the eu emergency funds be built up in the manner some politicians are calling for ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there appears to still be enough eu money to aid countries looking for help the european council of finance ministers debated that issue on tuesday .
first of all , i think it is important that the funds are available to the countries that want to make use of them .
should they be exhausted , then it would certainly be a good idea to have additional resources .
but there are apparently still enough resources available . do you think the current support for eastern europe is sufficient ? no , i think more could and should be done - each within its own area .
most of all , i think it is important that heads of state and government of the eu , possibly when they meet in a little over a week , as well as at the g20 meeting in london in april , make it absolutely clear they are determined to represent the countries of central and eastern europe . it sounds as though you expect action in addition to politicians ' words .
what action ? the resources of the eu that have been mentioned are one element .
a second element is that the imf , the world bank and we , as a bank that has been and continues to be active in eastern europe , give our encouragement and support to help these countries .
additional steps by the european central bank could also be a topic of discussion . is it a good idea to accelerate the adoption of the euro to provide added security ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro zone ca n't afford to weaken its entry criteria yes and no .
yes in the sense that the perspective of membership in the euro zone is a positive signal .
no in the sense that i do not believe the criteria for entry should be weakened , that would hurt confidence in the stability of the euro as a whole .
i think one would be well-advised to think about whether , for example , certain terms of time could be shortened .
but the hard criteria should remain . you have been talking about stability .
how big is the danger of a state in the region going bankrupt ? based on current evidence , this is not a danger . how did eastern europe get into this situation ?
many of the states reformed their financial systems according to the theories set out by western financial experts . eastern europe is , in terms of markets , every highly integrated .
it has , for example , opened its borders to western european banks , but it has not advanced as far in term of politics and its opening to the euro zone .
political integration is lagging behind market integration .
the second reason is that central and eastern europe , in real economic terms , are very dependent on certain key industries , such as the western european automobile industry .
since in addition to the financial crisis and the overall economic crisis we are also dealing with a structural crisis in the global auto industry , countries like hungary , the czech republic and slovakia are hard hit because they live from exports in general and especially from the auto industry . is there a feeling among eastern europeans that they are being neglected by their western neighbors ? i do not think that 's the case , at the moment .

leaders said they would begin negotiations on information exchanges wtih germany tomorrow , and with britain next month .
" liechtenstein commits to and will implement the global standards of transparency and exchange of information as developed by the oecd , " read the statement , referring to the organization for economic cooperation and development .
lichtenstein would also " go beyond these standards in order to better meet the concerns and tax claims of other jurisdictions . "
it would however maintain its " modern and solid " banking secrecy laws .
the principality said it would be ready to negotiate with the eu and others on anti-fraud agreements and taxation deals .
such agreements would be modeled on a landmark deal reached with the united states in december , and which will come into force at the start of 2010 .
brushing up its image " with the new agreements , the partner state concerned will receive more efficient tax application with respect to foreign assts ; the clients of the liechtenstein financial center will receive a sustainable legal framework for meeting their tax obligations , " said prime-minister elect klaus tschuetscher .
the announcement represents a major step by the tiny principality to improve its image after it was among three countries put on an oecd blacklist of " non-cooperative " tax havens .
the others were andorra and monaco .

lgt bank claimed that german tax inspectors were basing their investigation on a stolen list with the names of 1,400 clients - 600 of whom were german nationals .
caving to international pressure international pressure to clamp down on tax havens has been growing in recent weeks with a summit of the g20 group of economic powers in london on april 2 due to discuss the blacklist .
liechtenstein 's de facto head of state , prince alois , said there is a " fundamental and rapid change at the global level in the direction of stronger cross-border cooperation and international regulation . "
" with today 's declaration , the liechtenstein government is sending a signal that it is participating actively in the regulatory dialogue of financial centers without giving up liechtenstein 's identity or the advantages of a reliable and well-regulated small state , " he said . dc / sp / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

i am , however , of the opinion that it makes sense to get in touch with the imf in a timely manner .
international investors usually know to respect that .
when such contact is necessary , it makes more sense to do it early than to wait and , for example , have to accept longer phases of devaluation of one 's own currency . how can the situation be diffused ?
what 's the best way forward ? that 's not easy to say because the causes of the problems are different .
in some countries it 's just the financial sector that is suffering from a weak framework , vulnerable and susceptible to sudden crises .
other countries have a relatively robust financial sector , such as poland , and are affected more by developments in the real economy , like the development in western european auto industry . should the eu emergency funds be built up in the manner some politicians are calling for ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there appears to still be enough eu money to aid countries looking for help the european council of finance ministers debated that issue on tuesday .
first of all , i think it is important that the funds are available to the countries that want to make use of them .
should they be exhausted , then it would certainly be a good idea to have additional resources .
but there are apparently still enough resources available . do you think the current support for eastern europe is sufficient ? no , i think more could and should be done - each within its own area .
most of all , i think it is important that heads of state and government of the eu , possibly when they meet in a little over a week , as well as at the g20 meeting in london in april , make it absolutely clear they are determined to represent the countries of central and eastern europe . it sounds as though you expect action in addition to politicians ' words .
what action ? the resources of the eu that have been mentioned are one element .
a second element is that the imf , the world bank and we , as a bank that has been and continues to be active in eastern europe , give our encouragement and support to help these countries .
additional steps by the european central bank could also be a topic of discussion . is it a good idea to accelerate the adoption of the euro to provide added security ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro zone ca n't afford to weaken its entry criteria yes and no .
yes in the sense that the perspective of membership in the euro zone is a positive signal .
no in the sense that i do not believe the criteria for entry should be weakened , that would hurt confidence in the stability of the euro as a whole .
i think one would be well-advised to think about whether , for example , certain terms of time could be shortened .
but the hard criteria should remain . you have been talking about stability .
how big is the danger of a state in the region going bankrupt ? based on current evidence , this is not a danger . how did eastern europe get into this situation ?
many of the states reformed their financial systems according to the theories set out by western financial experts . eastern europe is , in terms of markets , every highly integrated .
it has , for example , opened its borders to western european banks , but it has not advanced as far in term of politics and its opening to the euro zone .
political integration is lagging behind market integration .
the second reason is that central and eastern europe , in real economic terms , are very dependent on certain key industries , such as the western european automobile industry .
since in addition to the financial crisis and the overall economic crisis we are also dealing with a structural crisis in the global auto industry , countries like hungary , the czech republic and slovakia are hard hit because they live from exports in general and especially from the auto industry . is there a feeling among eastern europeans that they are being neglected by their western neighbors ? i do not think that 's the case , at the moment .
but in western europe , i believe , we have a reason to watch the situation and not allow such development to occur .
it is a symbolic year that we are living in .
twenty years ago the berlin wall fell , and we all remember the contribution hungary made to that event .
we can not allow the impression you mentioned to arise . interview : andreas noll -lrb- sms -rrb- editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

all but one of the nine students , aged between 14 and 16 , were girls , and the three teachers gunned down were all women . heribert rech , interior minister of the german state of baden-wuerttemberg , where the crime was committed , said he did n't want to draw conclusions , telling journalists that could have been based on how the classes were drawn up . however , rech did admit that the fact that most of the victims were killed with a shot to the head indicated that they were not random targets . portrait of a killer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police are examining the gunman 's computer looking for answers the perpetrator , identified only as tim k. , was described by school officials as being an unremarkable student . he had achieved average marks on his school leaving certificate and had then enrolled in a course to become a salesman .
tim k. also regularly worked out at the gym and belonged to a sports club . however , a 19-year-old neighbor , who identified himself as michael and said he used to play table tennis with the gunman , told the reuters news agency that tim k. was a loner who had a big collection of horror films . germany has strict gun control laws .
yet police say the gunman had used a nine millimeter pistol registered to his father , a member of a gun club who has a collection of 15 guns at home . emergency plans in place after a school shooting in germany in 2002 , many schools have implemented plans laying out what to do in the event that a gunman should attack the school . authorities are reporting that once the gunman entered the school , the principal announced a coded message on the public address system , saying , " frau koma is coming . " one student , identified only as kim s. , told zdf television that their teacher shut the door and told them to close the windows and sit on the floor . focus on prevention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say students are often best able to identify potential attackers in addition to finding the motive of the killer , many in germany are wondering how these types of attacks can be prevented in the future . wilhelm heitmeyer , a sociologist who specializes in school violence , told deutsche welle that the best people to identify a potential attacker are fellow students . " we see that a lot of the perpetrators are very isolated and they speak out about violent acts , " he says , " and it 's the peers , and not the teachers , who are going to notice this the most . " heitmeyer warns , however , that what actually triggers these people to finally act out is a mystery .

all but one of the nine students , aged between 14 and 16 , were girls , and the three teachers gunned down were all women . heribert rech , interior minister of the german state of baden-wuerttemberg , where the crime was committed , said he did n't want to draw conclusions , telling journalists that could have been based on how the classes were drawn up . however , rech did admit that the fact that most of the victims were killed with a shot to the head indicated that they were not random targets . portrait of a killer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police are examining the gunman 's computer looking for answers the perpetrator , identified only as tim k. , was described by school officials as being an unremarkable student . he had achieved average marks on his school leaving certificate and had then enrolled in a course to become a salesman .
tim k. also regularly worked out at the gym and belonged to a sports club . however , a 19-year-old neighbor , who identified himself as michael and said he used to play table tennis with the gunman , told the reuters news agency that tim k. was a loner who had a big collection of horror films . germany has strict gun control laws .
yet police say the gunman had used a nine millimeter pistol registered to his father , a member of a gun club who has a collection of 15 guns at home . emergency plans in place after a school shooting in germany in 2002 , many schools have implemented plans laying out what to do in the event that a gunman should attack the school . authorities are reporting that once the gunman entered the school , the principal announced a coded message on the public address system , saying , " frau koma is coming . " one student , identified only as kim s. , told zdf television that their teacher shut the door and told them to close the windows and sit on the floor . focus on prevention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say students are often best able to identify potential attackers in addition to finding the motive of the killer , many in germany are wondering how these types of attacks can be prevented in the future . wilhelm heitmeyer , a sociologist who specializes in school violence , told deutsche welle that the best people to identify a potential attacker are fellow students . " we see that a lot of the perpetrators are very isolated and they speak out about violent acts , " he says , " and it 's the peers , and not the teachers , who are going to notice this the most . " heitmeyer warns , however , that what actually triggers these people to finally act out is a mystery .

bucharest has already asked the european commission to save it from a possible financing crisis .
hungary and latvia have grabbed at lifelines from the imf . thomas mirow , the head of the european bank for reconstruction and development , explained the situation in various eastern european countries and how they can move forward . deutsche welle : romania has joined hungary and latvia in requesting emergency loans from the european union .
how serious is the economic situation in central and eastern europe ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : each country needs to determine its own ideal way through the crisis , mirow said thomas mirow : the situation is certainly difficult .
talks have not yet been concluded , but romania has long been seen as a country that has been at particular risk because of very high debts in foreign currencies .
its own currency has been under pressure for a long time , which makes the decision to look for help from the imf a logical step that will contribute to stabilizing the country . are you afraid of the problem spreading to other countries via the domino effect ? no , i am not .
the situation in other countries is completely different .
i am , however , of the opinion that it makes sense to get in touch with the imf in a timely manner .
international investors usually know to respect that .
when such contact is necessary , it makes more sense to do it early than to wait and , for example , have to accept longer phases of devaluation of one 's own currency . how can the situation be diffused ?
what 's the best way forward ? that 's not easy to say because the causes of the problems are different .
in some countries it 's just the financial sector that is suffering from a weak framework , vulnerable and susceptible to sudden crises .
other countries have a relatively robust financial sector , such as poland , and are affected more by developments in the real economy , like the development in western european auto industry . should the eu emergency funds be built up in the manner some politicians are calling for ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there appears to still be enough eu money to aid countries looking for help the european council of finance ministers debated that issue on tuesday .
first of all , i think it is important that the funds are available to the countries that want to make use of them .
should they be exhausted , then it would certainly be a good idea to have additional resources .
but there are apparently still enough resources available . do you think the current support for eastern europe is sufficient ? no , i think more could and should be done - each within its own area .
most of all , i think it is important that heads of state and government of the eu , possibly when they meet in a little over a week , as well as at the g20 meeting in london in april , make it absolutely clear they are determined to represent the countries of central and eastern europe . it sounds as though you expect action in addition to politicians ' words .
what action ? the resources of the eu that have been mentioned are one element .
a second element is that the imf , the world bank and we , as a bank that has been and continues to be active in eastern europe , give our encouragement and support to help these countries .
additional steps by the european central bank could also be a topic of discussion . is it a good idea to accelerate the adoption of the euro to provide added security ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro zone ca n't afford to weaken its entry criteria yes and no .
yes in the sense that the perspective of membership in the euro zone is a positive signal .
no in the sense that i do not believe the criteria for entry should be weakened , that would hurt confidence in the stability of the euro as a whole .
i think one would be well-advised to think about whether , for example , certain terms of time could be shortened .
but the hard criteria should remain . you have been talking about stability .
how big is the danger of a state in the region going bankrupt ? based on current evidence , this is not a danger . how did eastern europe get into this situation ?
many of the states reformed their financial systems according to the theories set out by western financial experts . eastern europe is , in terms of markets , every highly integrated .
it has , for example , opened its borders to western european banks , but it has not advanced as far in term of politics and its opening to the euro zone .
political integration is lagging behind market integration .
the second reason is that central and eastern europe , in real economic terms , are very dependent on certain key industries , such as the western european automobile industry .
since in addition to the financial crisis and the overall economic crisis we are also dealing with a structural crisis in the global auto industry , countries like hungary , the czech republic and slovakia are hard hit because they live from exports in general and especially from the auto industry . is there a feeling among eastern europeans that they are being neglected by their western neighbors ? i do not think that 's the case , at the moment .
but in western europe , i believe , we have a reason to watch the situation and not allow such development to occur .
it is a symbolic year that we are living in .
twenty years ago the berlin wall fell , and we all remember the contribution hungary made to that event .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
first , let me extend my deepest sympathy to all the families of those killed .
i thought germany already had very strict gun laws , stricter than the us .
why did this young man 's father have a gun in the first place ?
all countries need stricter gun laws .
but , will this really stop tragedies like this from happening .
unfortunately , man-made laws do not change a persons heart and therefore , can not stop this completely from happening . - elizabeth hughes , us in reference to such incidents as recent school shootings in germany this question itself completely misses the mark .
it wrongly implies that -lrb- legal -rrb- weapon sales are to be questioned as a " cause " of this behavior .
germany presently has some of the strictest gun control laws in the world with respect to sales and ownership , yet such incidents still occur .
ironically , this may , at least partially , be a legitimate cause .
we also see in the us these shootings most often happening in so-called " gun free zones . "
strict gun control is a double-edged sword .
the only gun use it ever succeeds in reducing is legal legitimate non-threatening gun use by the law abiding while simultaneously raising the black market for illegal guns and also raising the status of these illegal guns in the eyes of the embittered and disenfranchised who sometimes lash out in an environment where they know their tirade will have maximum effect , in a totally unarmed group of people . - gerald morris , canada bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the total death toll rose to 16 it seems to me this mass murder was a " copy cat " of the american high schools that have had similar catastrophes .
in the american killing they found out the use of marijuana in the killers was an important issue , and possible cause .
there are now many new articles associating the use of marijuana -lrb- and hashish -rrb- to becoming psychotic .
many new publications have been appearing .
it would be interesting to have data on the autopsy of this killer and find out if there are marijuana chemicals in his brain -lrb- they stay for several months -rrb- . - jose carranza , us there is shocking news coming from germany today .
i hope that it will push german regulators towards more strict rules concerning possession of weapons for private use . - wojtek , poland i hope that gun laws in germany are not as bad as in finland and the united states of america .
the last major shooting incident in australia that occurred in tasmania back in 1996 made the australian federal government tighten gun laws - surprisingly by former prime minister john howard .
i believe this fellow in germany -lrb- the gunman in question -rrb- committed suicide after what he had done .
he must have had a guilt complex .
my advice is to tighten gun law like what happened in australia last time in 1996 . - stuart john pearson , australia your entire article on the school shootings does not include one reference about the parents , except that the gun may have come from the father 's collection .
you state what everyone else thinks society should do .
have you totally absolved the parents from responsibility ?
perhaps his problem was at home not at the school .
give a little more balance to your reporting . - barbara dreher , us just check the baggage of all german students ! - kathe herberg , brazil i was shocked to read of the terrible news of the albertville school shooting in winnenden , germany .
please accept my deepest condolences to all the families affected by this horrendous tragedy .
my thoughts and prayers go with you in your time of need .
may the lord bring you some much needed comfort .
please take care and god bless you all ! - carol ann stewart , canada compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bucharest has already asked the european commission to save it from a possible financing crisis .
hungary and latvia have grabbed at lifelines from the imf . thomas mirow , the head of the european bank for reconstruction and development , explained the situation in various eastern european countries and how they can move forward . deutsche welle : romania has joined hungary and latvia in requesting emergency loans from the european union .
how serious is the economic situation in central and eastern europe ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : each country needs to determine its own ideal way through the crisis , mirow said thomas mirow : the situation is certainly difficult .
talks have not yet been concluded , but romania has long been seen as a country that has been at particular risk because of very high debts in foreign currencies .
its own currency has been under pressure for a long time , which makes the decision to look for help from the imf a logical step that will contribute to stabilizing the country . are you afraid of the problem spreading to other countries via the domino effect ? no , i am not .
the situation in other countries is completely different .
i am , however , of the opinion that it makes sense to get in touch with the imf in a timely manner .
international investors usually know to respect that .
when such contact is necessary , it makes more sense to do it early than to wait and , for example , have to accept longer phases of devaluation of one 's own currency . how can the situation be diffused ?
what 's the best way forward ? that 's not easy to say because the causes of the problems are different .
in some countries it 's just the financial sector that is suffering from a weak framework , vulnerable and susceptible to sudden crises .
other countries have a relatively robust financial sector , such as poland , and are affected more by developments in the real economy , like the development in western european auto industry . should the eu emergency funds be built up in the manner some politicians are calling for ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there appears to still be enough eu money to aid countries looking for help the european council of finance ministers debated that issue on tuesday .
first of all , i think it is important that the funds are available to the countries that want to make use of them .
should they be exhausted , then it would certainly be a good idea to have additional resources .
but there are apparently still enough resources available . do you think the current support for eastern europe is sufficient ? no , i think more could and should be done - each within its own area .
most of all , i think it is important that heads of state and government of the eu , possibly when they meet in a little over a week , as well as at the g20 meeting in london in april , make it absolutely clear they are determined to represent the countries of central and eastern europe . it sounds as though you expect action in addition to politicians ' words .
what action ? the resources of the eu that have been mentioned are one element .
a second element is that the imf , the world bank and we , as a bank that has been and continues to be active in eastern europe , give our encouragement and support to help these countries .
additional steps by the european central bank could also be a topic of discussion . is it a good idea to accelerate the adoption of the euro to provide added security ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro zone ca n't afford to weaken its entry criteria yes and no .
yes in the sense that the perspective of membership in the euro zone is a positive signal .
no in the sense that i do not believe the criteria for entry should be weakened , that would hurt confidence in the stability of the euro as a whole .
i think one would be well-advised to think about whether , for example , certain terms of time could be shortened .
but the hard criteria should remain . you have been talking about stability .
how big is the danger of a state in the region going bankrupt ? based on current evidence , this is not a danger . how did eastern europe get into this situation ?
many of the states reformed their financial systems according to the theories set out by western financial experts . eastern europe is , in terms of markets , every highly integrated .
it has , for example , opened its borders to western european banks , but it has not advanced as far in term of politics and its opening to the euro zone .
political integration is lagging behind market integration .
the second reason is that central and eastern europe , in real economic terms , are very dependent on certain key industries , such as the western european automobile industry .
since in addition to the financial crisis and the overall economic crisis we are also dealing with a structural crisis in the global auto industry , countries like hungary , the czech republic and slovakia are hard hit because they live from exports in general and especially from the auto industry . is there a feeling among eastern europeans that they are being neglected by their western neighbors ? i do not think that 's the case , at the moment .
but in western europe , i believe , we have a reason to watch the situation and not allow such development to occur .
it is a symbolic year that we are living in .
twenty years ago the berlin wall fell , and we all remember the contribution hungary made to that event .
we can not allow the impression you mentioned to arise . interview : andreas noll -lrb- sms -rrb- editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

first , let me extend my deepest sympathy to all the families of those killed .
i thought germany already had very strict gun laws , stricter than the us .
why did this young man 's father have a gun in the first place ?
all countries need stricter gun laws .
but , will this really stop tragedies like this from happening .
unfortunately , man-made laws do not change a persons heart and therefore , can not stop this completely from happening . - elizabeth hughes , us in reference to such incidents as recent school shootings in germany this question itself completely misses the mark .
it wrongly implies that -lrb- legal -rrb- weapon sales are to be questioned as a " cause " of this behavior .
germany presently has some of the strictest gun control laws in the world with respect to sales and ownership , yet such incidents still occur .
ironically , this may , at least partially , be a legitimate cause .
we also see in the us these shootings most often happening in so-called " gun free zones . "
strict gun control is a double-edged sword .
the only gun use it ever succeeds in reducing is legal legitimate non-threatening gun use by the law abiding while simultaneously raising the black market for illegal guns and also raising the status of these illegal guns in the eyes of the embittered and disenfranchised who sometimes lash out in an environment where they know their tirade will have maximum effect , in a totally unarmed group of people . - gerald morris , canada bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the total death toll rose to 16 it seems to me this mass murder was a " copy cat " of the american high schools that have had similar catastrophes .
in the american killing they found out the use of marijuana in the killers was an important issue , and possible cause .
there are now many new articles associating the use of marijuana -lrb- and hashish -rrb- to becoming psychotic .
many new publications have been appearing .
it would be interesting to have data on the autopsy of this killer and find out if there are marijuana chemicals in his brain -lrb- they stay for several months -rrb- . - jose carranza , us there is shocking news coming from germany today .
i hope that it will push german regulators towards more strict rules concerning possession of weapons for private use . - wojtek , poland i hope that gun laws in germany are not as bad as in finland and the united states of america .
the last major shooting incident in australia that occurred in tasmania back in 1996 made the australian federal government tighten gun laws - surprisingly by former prime minister john howard .
i believe this fellow in germany -lrb- the gunman in question -rrb- committed suicide after what he had done .
he must have had a guilt complex .
my advice is to tighten gun law like what happened in australia last time in 1996 . - stuart john pearson , australia your entire article on the school shootings does not include one reference about the parents , except that the gun may have come from the father 's collection .
you state what everyone else thinks society should do .
have you totally absolved the parents from responsibility ?
perhaps his problem was at home not at the school .
give a little more balance to your reporting . - barbara dreher , us just check the baggage of all german students ! - kathe herberg , brazil i was shocked to read of the terrible news of the albertville school shooting in winnenden , germany .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
first , let me extend my deepest sympathy to all the families of those killed .
i thought germany already had very strict gun laws , stricter than the us .
why did this young man 's father have a gun in the first place ?
all countries need stricter gun laws .
but , will this really stop tragedies like this from happening .
unfortunately , man-made laws do not change a persons heart and therefore , can not stop this completely from happening . - elizabeth hughes , us in reference to such incidents as recent school shootings in germany this question itself completely misses the mark .
it wrongly implies that -lrb- legal -rrb- weapon sales are to be questioned as a " cause " of this behavior .
germany presently has some of the strictest gun control laws in the world with respect to sales and ownership , yet such incidents still occur .
ironically , this may , at least partially , be a legitimate cause .
we also see in the us these shootings most often happening in so-called " gun free zones . "
strict gun control is a double-edged sword .
the only gun use it ever succeeds in reducing is legal legitimate non-threatening gun use by the law abiding while simultaneously raising the black market for illegal guns and also raising the status of these illegal guns in the eyes of the embittered and disenfranchised who sometimes lash out in an environment where they know their tirade will have maximum effect , in a totally unarmed group of people . - gerald morris , canada bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the total death toll rose to 16 it seems to me this mass murder was a " copy cat " of the american high schools that have had similar catastrophes .
in the american killing they found out the use of marijuana in the killers was an important issue , and possible cause .
there are now many new articles associating the use of marijuana -lrb- and hashish -rrb- to becoming psychotic .
many new publications have been appearing .
it would be interesting to have data on the autopsy of this killer and find out if there are marijuana chemicals in his brain -lrb- they stay for several months -rrb- . - jose carranza , us there is shocking news coming from germany today .
i hope that it will push german regulators towards more strict rules concerning possession of weapons for private use . - wojtek , poland i hope that gun laws in germany are not as bad as in finland and the united states of america .
the last major shooting incident in australia that occurred in tasmania back in 1996 made the australian federal government tighten gun laws - surprisingly by former prime minister john howard .
i believe this fellow in germany -lrb- the gunman in question -rrb- committed suicide after what he had done .
he must have had a guilt complex .
my advice is to tighten gun law like what happened in australia last time in 1996 . - stuart john pearson , australia your entire article on the school shootings does not include one reference about the parents , except that the gun may have come from the father 's collection .
you state what everyone else thinks society should do .
have you totally absolved the parents from responsibility ?
perhaps his problem was at home not at the school .
give a little more balance to your reporting . - barbara dreher , us just check the baggage of all german students ! - kathe herberg , brazil i was shocked to read of the terrible news of the albertville school shooting in winnenden , germany .
please accept my deepest condolences to all the families affected by this horrendous tragedy .
my thoughts and prayers go with you in your time of need .
may the lord bring you some much needed comfort .
please take care and god bless you all ! - carol ann stewart , canada compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

leaders said they would begin negotiations on information exchanges wtih germany tomorrow , and with britain next month .
" liechtenstein commits to and will implement the global standards of transparency and exchange of information as developed by the oecd , " read the statement , referring to the organization for economic cooperation and development .
lichtenstein would also " go beyond these standards in order to better meet the concerns and tax claims of other jurisdictions . "
it would however maintain its " modern and solid " banking secrecy laws .
the principality said it would be ready to negotiate with the eu and others on anti-fraud agreements and taxation deals .
such agreements would be modeled on a landmark deal reached with the united states in december , and which will come into force at the start of 2010 .
brushing up its image " with the new agreements , the partner state concerned will receive more efficient tax application with respect to foreign assts ; the clients of the liechtenstein financial center will receive a sustainable legal framework for meeting their tax obligations , " said prime-minister elect klaus tschuetscher .
the announcement represents a major step by the tiny principality to improve its image after it was among three countries put on an oecd blacklist of " non-cooperative " tax havens .
the others were andorra and monaco .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lgt bank was at the heart of german tax evasion scandal last year it comes a year after a major tax evasion scandal in germany put the spotlight on its secretive banking sector .
german investigators launched a major probe into clients of the lgt banking group , which is controlled by liechtenstein 's royal family .
lgt bank claimed that german tax inspectors were basing their investigation on a stolen list with the names of 1,400 clients - 600 of whom were german nationals .
caving to international pressure international pressure to clamp down on tax havens has been growing in recent weeks with a summit of the g20 group of economic powers in london on april 2 due to discuss the blacklist .
liechtenstein 's de facto head of state , prince alois , said there is a " fundamental and rapid change at the global level in the direction of stronger cross-border cooperation and international regulation . "
" with today 's declaration , the liechtenstein government is sending a signal that it is participating actively in the regulatory dialogue of financial centers without giving up liechtenstein 's identity or the advantages of a reliable and well-regulated small state , " he said . dc / sp / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but others called for measures to protect children to be put in place . a day after a deadly school shooting , german politicians said they would refrain from making any rash decisions on gun control or school safety .
the first thing to do was collect facts about the shooting which left 16 dead , including the teenaged gunman , politicians said .
the scene in front of the school in winnenden was pure emotion on thursday , march 12 .
students had tears streaming down their faces as they held each other , trying to come to terms with the horrible killings .
" i do n't know if i can stay at this school .
every time you enter , the memories come back , " student christin pluengel told reuters .
the 17-year-old gunman , identified as tim k. , fired 112 rounds , 60 in the school , and had 109 unused rounds with him when his body was found by police .
many of the victims were shot at close range with a 9 millimeter beretta pistol .
as police closed in , he eventually killed himself .
oversimplifying problem wo n't help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians will debate whether to tighten gun laws while there were general warnings against knee-jerk reactions , some politicians did call for measures to be taken to prevent such a shooting in the future . individual politicians and police groups pointed to metal detectors in school doorways , a ban on violent video games and stricter gun laws as potential ways to keep kids from falling victim to future violence . but such steps oversimplify a complex problem , according to joachim von gottberg , vice president of the children 's charity of germany . " whoever points denounces addiction to computer games or an infatuation with weapons as the cause for these kinds of terrible acts hinders the search for the complex problems and reasons that precede such crimes , " he said in berlin on thursday . laws ca n't prevent violence german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble said lawmakers are not able to completely protect against every possible threat . " absolute security does not exist , " he said in berlin , adding that germany needed to look at " what is going on in our society . " schaeuble , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union , said the country needed to concentrate on strengthening the role of the family and teaching moral values to children rather than calling for tighter restrictions on gun ownership . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blaming computer games is too easy an answer , von der leyen said " i ca n't see how a change in weapons rules would contribute anything to solving the problem , " schaeuble told reuters . calls for stricter gun control laws were issued after police said they suspected the gunman got the pistol he used in wednesday 's massacre from his parents ' bedroom . father could face charges his father , reportedly a member of a local shooting club , is said to own over a dozen guns , all locked away except the nine-millimeter beretta that caused the carnage .
german authorities said they are considering whether to press charges against his father . " everything here points to negligence on the part of the father as far as the storage of this weapon is concerned , " said police spokesman ralf michelfelder . germany tightened its gun control laws twice since a 2002 school shooting in the city of erfurt , but politicians said the restrictions could not have prevented wednesday 's events or a 2006 school shooting . preventative measures needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police said the teenager 's father could face charges sebastian edathy , an interior affairs expert for the social democratic party , agreed with schaeuble on the impossibility of absolute safety .
instead , he said , germany should consider preventative ways to deal with violence in schools . " here in germany we have significantly fewer school psychologists for students than in other european countries , " he told german television channel phoenix , adding that schools should consider adding trained mental-health workers to their staffs . leaders of the greens said wednesday 's tragic events should be analyzed by experts in order to uncover " hidden signals from students with problems . " " we need a culture that pay attention and recognizes problems , " party heads claudia roth and cem ozdemir said . german family minister ursula von der leyen made a similar statement , saying that most acts of violence are preceded by warnings .

as police closed in , he eventually killed himself .
oversimplifying problem wo n't help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians will debate whether to tighten gun laws while there were general warnings against knee-jerk reactions , some politicians did call for measures to be taken to prevent such a shooting in the future . individual politicians and police groups pointed to metal detectors in school doorways , a ban on violent video games and stricter gun laws as potential ways to keep kids from falling victim to future violence . but such steps oversimplify a complex problem , according to joachim von gottberg , vice president of the children 's charity of germany . " whoever points denounces addiction to computer games or an infatuation with weapons as the cause for these kinds of terrible acts hinders the search for the complex problems and reasons that precede such crimes , " he said in berlin on thursday . laws ca n't prevent violence german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble said lawmakers are not able to completely protect against every possible threat . " absolute security does not exist , " he said in berlin , adding that germany needed to look at " what is going on in our society . " schaeuble , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union , said the country needed to concentrate on strengthening the role of the family and teaching moral values to children rather than calling for tighter restrictions on gun ownership . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blaming computer games is too easy an answer , von der leyen said " i ca n't see how a change in weapons rules would contribute anything to solving the problem , " schaeuble told reuters . calls for stricter gun control laws were issued after police said they suspected the gunman got the pistol he used in wednesday 's massacre from his parents ' bedroom . father could face charges his father , reportedly a member of a local shooting club , is said to own over a dozen guns , all locked away except the nine-millimeter beretta that caused the carnage .
german authorities said they are considering whether to press charges against his father . " everything here points to negligence on the part of the father as far as the storage of this weapon is concerned , " said police spokesman ralf michelfelder . germany tightened its gun control laws twice since a 2002 school shooting in the city of erfurt , but politicians said the restrictions could not have prevented wednesday 's events or a 2006 school shooting . preventative measures needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police said the teenager 's father could face charges sebastian edathy , an interior affairs expert for the social democratic party , agreed with schaeuble on the impossibility of absolute safety .
instead , he said , germany should consider preventative ways to deal with violence in schools . " here in germany we have significantly fewer school psychologists for students than in other european countries , " he told german television channel phoenix , adding that schools should consider adding trained mental-health workers to their staffs . leaders of the greens said wednesday 's tragic events should be analyzed by experts in order to uncover " hidden signals from students with problems . " " we need a culture that pay attention and recognizes problems , " party heads claudia roth and cem ozdemir said . german family minister ursula von der leyen made a similar statement , saying that most acts of violence are preceded by warnings . " we have to learn what the typical warning signs are , " she told the neue presse newspaper on thursday . sms / th / ap / dpa / afp / retuers send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

both favor tighter regulation of financial markets instead of increased spending measures . the heads of france and germany came out against a call from the united states that they increase spending to counteract the global economic crisis .
instead they said more regulation of financial markets needed to be the focus of a g20 meeting next month . " we consider that in europe we have already invested a lot for the recovery , and that the problem is not about spending more , but putting in place a system of regulation so that the economic and financial catastrophe that the world is seeing does not reproduce itself , " sarkozy told reporters in berlin on thursday , march 12 . when g20 leaders meet april 2 in london , merkel said they should look to pledges made by european union members last month in the german capital to regulate all financial markets , crack down on tax havens and increase funding for the international monetary fund . merkel said economic rescue packages " can under no circumstances replace the necessary regulation " of the financial markets . us treasury secretary timothy geithner said wednesday that he wanted the g20 to make a " substantial , sustained commitment to stimulus " as a way of stemming the global economic downturn . britain veering from eu position ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is brown going to side with washington at the g20 meeting ?

she added that she was " very optimistic that the european position is unchanged . " merkel is scheduled to meet with brown in britain for talks on friday that are likely to address the issue of additional stimulus measures . meanwhile , to keep deficit spending in the eu in check , french and german finance ministers on thursday reiterated their support for the bloc 's stability and growth pact , which restricts public deficits to 3 percent of annual output . ministers from the two countries issued a joint statement saying they would pursue policies to strengthen public finances . eu must fight protectionism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel are back to seeing eye-to-eye merkel and sarkozy also used their meeting to launch joint industrial projects in the energy and automobile sectors .
the plans cover innovations in the renewable energy sector and research into new methods of propulsion for motor vehicles . the joint projects come after the two countries were at odds over sarkozy 's decision to provide financial support to the french car industry .
both leaders , however , agreed thursday that all eu members should eschew any protectionist measures while coming to the aid of national industries . in addition , sarkozy offered his condolences to the victims of a school shooting which left 16 dead in southern germany wednesday .

bucharest has already asked the european commission to save it from a possible financing crisis .
hungary and latvia have grabbed at lifelines from the imf . thomas mirow , the head of the european bank for reconstruction and development , explained the situation in various eastern european countries and how they can move forward . deutsche welle : romania has joined hungary and latvia in requesting emergency loans from the european union .
how serious is the economic situation in central and eastern europe ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : each country needs to determine its own ideal way through the crisis , mirow said thomas mirow : the situation is certainly difficult .
talks have not yet been concluded , but romania has long been seen as a country that has been at particular risk because of very high debts in foreign currencies .
its own currency has been under pressure for a long time , which makes the decision to look for help from the imf a logical step that will contribute to stabilizing the country . are you afraid of the problem spreading to other countries via the domino effect ? no , i am not .
the situation in other countries is completely different .
i am , however , of the opinion that it makes sense to get in touch with the imf in a timely manner .
international investors usually know to respect that .
when such contact is necessary , it makes more sense to do it early than to wait and , for example , have to accept longer phases of devaluation of one 's own currency . how can the situation be diffused ?
what 's the best way forward ? that 's not easy to say because the causes of the problems are different .
in some countries it 's just the financial sector that is suffering from a weak framework , vulnerable and susceptible to sudden crises .
other countries have a relatively robust financial sector , such as poland , and are affected more by developments in the real economy , like the development in western european auto industry . should the eu emergency funds be built up in the manner some politicians are calling for ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there appears to still be enough eu money to aid countries looking for help the european council of finance ministers debated that issue on tuesday .
first of all , i think it is important that the funds are available to the countries that want to make use of them .
should they be exhausted , then it would certainly be a good idea to have additional resources .
but there are apparently still enough resources available . do you think the current support for eastern europe is sufficient ? no , i think more could and should be done - each within its own area .
most of all , i think it is important that heads of state and government of the eu , possibly when they meet in a little over a week , as well as at the g20 meeting in london in april , make it absolutely clear they are determined to represent the countries of central and eastern europe . it sounds as though you expect action in addition to politicians ' words .
what action ? the resources of the eu that have been mentioned are one element .
a second element is that the imf , the world bank and we , as a bank that has been and continues to be active in eastern europe , give our encouragement and support to help these countries .
additional steps by the european central bank could also be a topic of discussion . is it a good idea to accelerate the adoption of the euro to provide added security ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro zone ca n't afford to weaken its entry criteria yes and no .
yes in the sense that the perspective of membership in the euro zone is a positive signal .
no in the sense that i do not believe the criteria for entry should be weakened , that would hurt confidence in the stability of the euro as a whole .
i think one would be well-advised to think about whether , for example , certain terms of time could be shortened .
but the hard criteria should remain . you have been talking about stability .
how big is the danger of a state in the region going bankrupt ? based on current evidence , this is not a danger . how did eastern europe get into this situation ?
many of the states reformed their financial systems according to the theories set out by western financial experts . eastern europe is , in terms of markets , every highly integrated .
it has , for example , opened its borders to western european banks , but it has not advanced as far in term of politics and its opening to the euro zone .
political integration is lagging behind market integration .
the second reason is that central and eastern europe , in real economic terms , are very dependent on certain key industries , such as the western european automobile industry .
since in addition to the financial crisis and the overall economic crisis we are also dealing with a structural crisis in the global auto industry , countries like hungary , the czech republic and slovakia are hard hit because they live from exports in general and especially from the auto industry . is there a feeling among eastern europeans that they are being neglected by their western neighbors ? i do not think that 's the case , at the moment .
but in western europe , i believe , we have a reason to watch the situation and not allow such development to occur .
it is a symbolic year that we are living in .
twenty years ago the berlin wall fell , and we all remember the contribution hungary made to that event .
we can not allow the impression you mentioned to arise . interview : andreas noll -lrb- sms -rrb- editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

leaders said they would begin negotiations on information exchanges wtih germany tomorrow , and with britain next month .
" liechtenstein commits to and will implement the global standards of transparency and exchange of information as developed by the oecd , " read the statement , referring to the organization for economic cooperation and development .
lichtenstein would also " go beyond these standards in order to better meet the concerns and tax claims of other jurisdictions . "
it would however maintain its " modern and solid " banking secrecy laws .
the principality said it would be ready to negotiate with the eu and others on anti-fraud agreements and taxation deals .
such agreements would be modeled on a landmark deal reached with the united states in december , and which will come into force at the start of 2010 .
brushing up its image " with the new agreements , the partner state concerned will receive more efficient tax application with respect to foreign assts ; the clients of the liechtenstein financial center will receive a sustainable legal framework for meeting their tax obligations , " said prime-minister elect klaus tschuetscher .
the announcement represents a major step by the tiny principality to improve its image after it was among three countries put on an oecd blacklist of " non-cooperative " tax havens .
the others were andorra and monaco .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lgt bank was at the heart of german tax evasion scandal last year it comes a year after a major tax evasion scandal in germany put the spotlight on its secretive banking sector .
german investigators launched a major probe into clients of the lgt banking group , which is controlled by liechtenstein 's royal family .
lgt bank claimed that german tax inspectors were basing their investigation on a stolen list with the names of 1,400 clients - 600 of whom were german nationals .
caving to international pressure international pressure to clamp down on tax havens has been growing in recent weeks with a summit of the g20 group of economic powers in london on april 2 due to discuss the blacklist .
liechtenstein 's de facto head of state , prince alois , said there is a " fundamental and rapid change at the global level in the direction of stronger cross-border cooperation and international regulation . "
" with today 's declaration , the liechtenstein government is sending a signal that it is participating actively in the regulatory dialogue of financial centers without giving up liechtenstein 's identity or the advantages of a reliable and well-regulated small state , " he said . dc / sp / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

novakovic joined cologne when they were still in the second division .
his critics then said , that he does n't have the talent for more .
today he captains the side which has stabilized its position in the bundesliga . twenty-nine year old milivoje novakovic was born in lubljana .
in addition to his duties at cologne , the striker also plays up front for slovenia 's national team .
this is his first season in the top-flight .
we met up with " super-nova " to find out what makes him a great striker .
fortunately i managed to avoid injury for a very long time , and that gave me strength .
and of course , when you work a lot and work hard , then at some point you reap the rewards in life .
modesty from a 1 meter 92 athlete who can score with his head and with both feet .
with twelve goals so far this season , novakovic is one of the league 's top strikers .
you played in the lower leagues in austria and bulgaria before joining the bundesliga .
is it a dream come true for you ?
of course , it 's a dream to play in one of the world 's top five leagues .
i had a great season in bulgaria , and i joined my national team - that 's why the offers came .
i decided to come to cologne .
the bundesliga is a good challenge for me .
had you heard of cologne ?
sure - i knew about all the teams in the bundesliga .
professional players follow all the leagues , and of course i knew that it was a big club with a new stadium and a lot of fans . even if the fans used to have more to cheer about .
like the german title in 1964 , and again in 78 .
after that .. ... things quieted down .
the low point was when the club was relegated in 1998 .
since then its been a rollercoaster ride between top flight and second division .
now under coach christoph daum , cologne has some respectable mid-table results .
is there anything remarkable about christoph daum that strikes you ?
no .
everyone knows he 's a great trainer whose had great success .
there 's not much to say .
sot christoph daum , coach 1 .
fc cologne " sometimes it 's enough for me to just look at someone .
i infect them with a glance , with my gestures - and it brings the desired results .
i think we only speak one language , and that 's the language of success . "
unfortunately , daum and novakovic did n't see eye-to-eye when the striker first arrived in cologne .
more than once , " nova " got sent to the stands .
at first it was a little tough .
it is n't much fun for a player to get sent to the stands .
it makes you hate the coach , but that 's normal .
he was trying to me wake up , and it worked .
i 'm behind the coach one hundred per cent , just as he and the rest of the team stand behind me .
you have to have trust .
and we have that here now .
you 've now become a team star .
in the last few years you seem to have changed considerably .
does success make you grow up ?
not at all .
i think you always have to keep your feet on the ground .
i do n't feel like a star , but i also know that i am very important to this team .
i scored twenty goals in the second division before we got promoted .
then i was made captain , which is very important to me - and you can see that people are behind me .
as a foreigner you always have to give more than others do , and fortunately i was rewarded for that work . it certainly paid off in the team 's last season in the second division , when " nova " and patrick helmes scored a total of 37 goals .
cologne 's two-pronged attack was unstoppable .
helmes moved on to leverkusen - but next season prodigal son lukas podolski returns to the city on the rhine .
you and patrick helmes were the dream team in the second division .
do you think you can find the same magic with lukas podolski ?
of course , i hope so .
but it wo n't be easy .
we would have been a great trio .
podolski and i will have to learn to work together , but i know he 'll be impressive .
and i 'm sure we 'll get along .
even so - do n't you think that the contract with podolski was a very risky move on the part of the club ?
why ?
because it wo n't leave enough money to buy in other players .
no , i do n't think so .
when he comes , more and more money will flow into the club 's coffers - for example from new sponsors .
he 'll be an icon here , and that means a good time is beginning .
you obviously feel very happy at cologne .
i read once that you said you would like to become an fc cologne legend ...
well , to be a legend in a city like this one would be a beautiful thing .
there have n't been any legends here for a while .
there was podolski and toni polster , but that was a while ago .
it would be something to be proud of , but i do n't decide it .
others do .
who 's your favorite cologne legend ?
for me personally it 's löhr .
he scored so many goals and achieved so much .
do you know how many he scored ?
no - but it was a lot … 166 goals in 381 appearances .
that 's doable , is n't it ?
sure it 's doable - how many do you have ?
around 42 , right ?
or is it more ? 42 .
42 , i was right . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bucharest has already asked the european commission to save it from a possible financing crisis .
hungary and latvia have grabbed at lifelines from the imf . thomas mirow , the head of the european bank for reconstruction and development , explained the situation in various eastern european countries and how they can move forward . deutsche welle : romania has joined hungary and latvia in requesting emergency loans from the european union .
how serious is the economic situation in central and eastern europe ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : each country needs to determine its own ideal way through the crisis , mirow said thomas mirow : the situation is certainly difficult .
talks have not yet been concluded , but romania has long been seen as a country that has been at particular risk because of very high debts in foreign currencies .
its own currency has been under pressure for a long time , which makes the decision to look for help from the imf a logical step that will contribute to stabilizing the country . are you afraid of the problem spreading to other countries via the domino effect ? no , i am not .
the situation in other countries is completely different .
i am , however , of the opinion that it makes sense to get in touch with the imf in a timely manner .
international investors usually know to respect that .
when such contact is necessary , it makes more sense to do it early than to wait and , for example , have to accept longer phases of devaluation of one 's own currency . how can the situation be diffused ?
what 's the best way forward ? that 's not easy to say because the causes of the problems are different .
in some countries it 's just the financial sector that is suffering from a weak framework , vulnerable and susceptible to sudden crises .
other countries have a relatively robust financial sector , such as poland , and are affected more by developments in the real economy , like the development in western european auto industry . should the eu emergency funds be built up in the manner some politicians are calling for ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there appears to still be enough eu money to aid countries looking for help the european council of finance ministers debated that issue on tuesday .
first of all , i think it is important that the funds are available to the countries that want to make use of them .
should they be exhausted , then it would certainly be a good idea to have additional resources .
but there are apparently still enough resources available . do you think the current support for eastern europe is sufficient ? no , i think more could and should be done - each within its own area .
most of all , i think it is important that heads of state and government of the eu , possibly when they meet in a little over a week , as well as at the g20 meeting in london in april , make it absolutely clear they are determined to represent the countries of central and eastern europe . it sounds as though you expect action in addition to politicians ' words .
what action ? the resources of the eu that have been mentioned are one element .
a second element is that the imf , the world bank and we , as a bank that has been and continues to be active in eastern europe , give our encouragement and support to help these countries .
additional steps by the european central bank could also be a topic of discussion . is it a good idea to accelerate the adoption of the euro to provide added security ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro zone ca n't afford to weaken its entry criteria yes and no .
yes in the sense that the perspective of membership in the euro zone is a positive signal .
no in the sense that i do not believe the criteria for entry should be weakened , that would hurt confidence in the stability of the euro as a whole .
i think one would be well-advised to think about whether , for example , certain terms of time could be shortened .
but the hard criteria should remain . you have been talking about stability .
how big is the danger of a state in the region going bankrupt ? based on current evidence , this is not a danger . how did eastern europe get into this situation ?
many of the states reformed their financial systems according to the theories set out by western financial experts . eastern europe is , in terms of markets , every highly integrated .
it has , for example , opened its borders to western european banks , but it has not advanced as far in term of politics and its opening to the euro zone .
political integration is lagging behind market integration .
the second reason is that central and eastern europe , in real economic terms , are very dependent on certain key industries , such as the western european automobile industry .
since in addition to the financial crisis and the overall economic crisis we are also dealing with a structural crisis in the global auto industry , countries like hungary , the czech republic and slovakia are hard hit because they live from exports in general and especially from the auto industry . is there a feeling among eastern europeans that they are being neglected by their western neighbors ? i do not think that 's the case , at the moment .
but in western europe , i believe , we have a reason to watch the situation and not allow such development to occur .
it is a symbolic year that we are living in .
twenty years ago the berlin wall fell , and we all remember the contribution hungary made to that event .
we can not allow the impression you mentioned to arise . interview : andreas noll -lrb- sms -rrb- editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

benedict said the vatican failed to be " sufficiently clear " in explaining the reasons for lifting the excommunication of four bishops .
he said he was told after the crisis exploded that better use of the internet would have revealed some of the problems .
he added that he " draws the lesson " from the matter and that in the future the vatican must " pay more attention to this source of information , " news agency reuters reported .
in january , the pope lifted the excommunication of richard williamson and three other bishops .
williamson said in an interview broadcast several days earlier that he believed there were no gas chambers and that no more than 300,000 jews perished in nazi concentration camps , rather than the 6 million accepted by most historians .
the vatican said it was not aware of williamson 's views on the holocaust , but critics have pointed out that internet-based material written by williamson on the matter has existed for some time .
the vatican said the letter would be published thursday with copies available in english , italian , french , german , portuguese and spanish .
world anger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british-born cleric richard williamson has stirred anger worldwide williamson 's comments stirred anger in jewish communities throughout the world , as well as in catholic circles .
several european leaders , including german chancellor angela merkel , called on the germany-born pope to explain the vatican 's decision to waive the excommunications .
it is extremely rare in church history for a pope to explain his actions to his bishops after the fact and to acknowledge any error on his behalf .
the pope said that in the future the vatican body charged with negotiating with the sspx - the pontifical commission ecclesia dei - would work more closely with the congregation for the doctrine of the faith , the church 's watchdog on orthodoxy and disciplinary matters .
the views espoused by the sspx are controversial in catholic circles .
the group rejects modernization of the church through a set of reforms created under the second vatican council in the 1960s .
benedict , who took part in the council , said in his letter that sspx clerics would remain suspended from holding any official positions in the church until they fully subscribed to the reforms . dfm / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

leaders said they would begin negotiations on information exchanges wtih germany tomorrow , and with britain next month .
" liechtenstein commits to and will implement the global standards of transparency and exchange of information as developed by the oecd , " read the statement , referring to the organization for economic cooperation and development .
lichtenstein would also " go beyond these standards in order to better meet the concerns and tax claims of other jurisdictions . "
it would however maintain its " modern and solid " banking secrecy laws .
the principality said it would be ready to negotiate with the eu and others on anti-fraud agreements and taxation deals .
such agreements would be modeled on a landmark deal reached with the united states in december , and which will come into force at the start of 2010 .
brushing up its image " with the new agreements , the partner state concerned will receive more efficient tax application with respect to foreign assts ; the clients of the liechtenstein financial center will receive a sustainable legal framework for meeting their tax obligations , " said prime-minister elect klaus tschuetscher .
the announcement represents a major step by the tiny principality to improve its image after it was among three countries put on an oecd blacklist of " non-cooperative " tax havens .
the others were andorra and monaco .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lgt bank was at the heart of german tax evasion scandal last year it comes a year after a major tax evasion scandal in germany put the spotlight on its secretive banking sector .
german investigators launched a major probe into clients of the lgt banking group , which is controlled by liechtenstein 's royal family .
lgt bank claimed that german tax inspectors were basing their investigation on a stolen list with the names of 1,400 clients - 600 of whom were german nationals .
caving to international pressure international pressure to clamp down on tax havens has been growing in recent weeks with a summit of the g20 group of economic powers in london on april 2 due to discuss the blacklist .
liechtenstein 's de facto head of state , prince alois , said there is a " fundamental and rapid change at the global level in the direction of stronger cross-border cooperation and international regulation . "
" with today 's declaration , the liechtenstein government is sending a signal that it is participating actively in the regulatory dialogue of financial centers without giving up liechtenstein 's identity or the advantages of a reliable and well-regulated small state , " he said . dc / sp / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

novakovic joined cologne when they were still in the second division .
his critics then said , that he does n't have the talent for more .
today he captains the side which has stabilized its position in the bundesliga . twenty-nine year old milivoje novakovic was born in lubljana .
in addition to his duties at cologne , the striker also plays up front for slovenia 's national team .
this is his first season in the top-flight .
we met up with " super-nova " to find out what makes him a great striker .
fortunately i managed to avoid injury for a very long time , and that gave me strength .
and of course , when you work a lot and work hard , then at some point you reap the rewards in life .
modesty from a 1 meter 92 athlete who can score with his head and with both feet .
with twelve goals so far this season , novakovic is one of the league 's top strikers .
you played in the lower leagues in austria and bulgaria before joining the bundesliga .
is it a dream come true for you ?
of course , it 's a dream to play in one of the world 's top five leagues .
i had a great season in bulgaria , and i joined my national team - that 's why the offers came .
i decided to come to cologne .
the bundesliga is a good challenge for me .
had you heard of cologne ?
sure - i knew about all the teams in the bundesliga .
professional players follow all the leagues , and of course i knew that it was a big club with a new stadium and a lot of fans . even if the fans used to have more to cheer about .
like the german title in 1964 , and again in 78 .
after that .. ... things quieted down .
the low point was when the club was relegated in 1998 .
since then its been a rollercoaster ride between top flight and second division .
now under coach christoph daum , cologne has some respectable mid-table results .
is there anything remarkable about christoph daum that strikes you ?
no .
everyone knows he 's a great trainer whose had great success .
there 's not much to say .
sot christoph daum , coach 1 .
fc cologne " sometimes it 's enough for me to just look at someone .
i infect them with a glance , with my gestures - and it brings the desired results .
i think we only speak one language , and that 's the language of success . "
unfortunately , daum and novakovic did n't see eye-to-eye when the striker first arrived in cologne .
more than once , " nova " got sent to the stands .
at first it was a little tough .
it is n't much fun for a player to get sent to the stands .
it makes you hate the coach , but that 's normal .
he was trying to me wake up , and it worked .
i 'm behind the coach one hundred per cent , just as he and the rest of the team stand behind me .
you have to have trust .
and we have that here now .
you 've now become a team star .
in the last few years you seem to have changed considerably .
does success make you grow up ?
not at all .
i think you always have to keep your feet on the ground .
i do n't feel like a star , but i also know that i am very important to this team .
i scored twenty goals in the second division before we got promoted .
then i was made captain , which is very important to me - and you can see that people are behind me .
as a foreigner you always have to give more than others do , and fortunately i was rewarded for that work . it certainly paid off in the team 's last season in the second division , when " nova " and patrick helmes scored a total of 37 goals .
cologne 's two-pronged attack was unstoppable .
helmes moved on to leverkusen - but next season prodigal son lukas podolski returns to the city on the rhine .
you and patrick helmes were the dream team in the second division .
do you think you can find the same magic with lukas podolski ?
of course , i hope so .
but it wo n't be easy .
we would have been a great trio .
podolski and i will have to learn to work together , but i know he 'll be impressive .
and i 'm sure we 'll get along .
even so - do n't you think that the contract with podolski was a very risky move on the part of the club ?
why ?
because it wo n't leave enough money to buy in other players .
no , i do n't think so .
when he comes , more and more money will flow into the club 's coffers - for example from new sponsors .
he 'll be an icon here , and that means a good time is beginning .
you obviously feel very happy at cologne .
i read once that you said you would like to become an fc cologne legend ...
well , to be a legend in a city like this one would be a beautiful thing .
there have n't been any legends here for a while .
there was podolski and toni polster , but that was a while ago .
it would be something to be proud of , but i do n't decide it .
others do .
who 's your favorite cologne legend ?
for me personally it 's löhr .
he scored so many goals and achieved so much .
do you know how many he scored ?
no - but it was a lot … 166 goals in 381 appearances .
that 's doable , is n't it ?
sure it 's doable - how many do you have ?
around 42 , right ?
or is it more ? 42 .

the berlin senate is hoping to counteract its residents ' innate churlishness by appointing 4,000 civil servants , including police officers , public transport workers , waiters and trade fair hostesses to be " good-mood ambassadors . "
they 'll receive red buttons singling them out as friendly sources of information for newcomers and visitors to the capital .
the goal is " to make the city a little more friendly , " said rene gurka of berlin partner , the company behind the campaign , which kicked off this week in conjunction with the start of the annual itb tourism trade fair .

the phrases are meant to be a light-hearted poke in the ribs of the stereotypical berliner , while also showing that it is possible to do service with a smile .
" these cards are fantastic , they show we do n't always take ourselves too seriously and that we can laugh at ourselves , too , " said meng .
berlin is visited by more than eight million tourists annually , and is expecting an increase in tourism this year as it celebrates the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall .

when germany hosted the soccer world cup in 2006 , berlin taxi drivers were offered extra training in english and courteous service as part of a national friendliness campaign .
and a multi-million-euro campaign launched last year under the motto " be berlin " encouraged locals to project a more positive image to foreigners and tourists .

but a new charm offensive launched by the berlin senate hopes to spread an aura of friendliness about the capital . grumpy , sarcastic , and none too shy about piping up with a flippant comeback - that 's the attitude known as the berlin " schnauze " or " snout " to use its literal english translation .
the berlin senate is hoping to counteract its residents ' innate churlishness by appointing 4,000 civil servants , including police officers , public transport workers , waiters and trade fair hostesses to be " good-mood ambassadors . "
they 'll receive red buttons singling them out as friendly sources of information for newcomers and visitors to the capital .
the goal is " to make the city a little more friendly , " said rene gurka of berlin partner , the company behind the campaign , which kicked off this week in conjunction with the start of the annual itb tourism trade fair . " a few years ago , we did a study that showed that non-germans considered berlin a place full of grumpy people , " senate spokesman richard meng told news agency afp .
" we need to show the world that this is n't true . "
confronting stereotypes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's police officers are being encouraged to lighten up a little as part of the campaign , which is expected to cost 200,000 euros -lrb- $ 255,000 -rrb- , civil servants will also hand out postcards printed with prime examples of berliners ' unique brand of sarcasm - and written in the local dialect , of course .
the phrases are meant to be a light-hearted poke in the ribs of the stereotypical berliner , while also showing that it is possible to do service with a smile .
" these cards are fantastic , they show we do n't always take ourselves too seriously and that we can laugh at ourselves , too , " said meng .
berlin is visited by more than eight million tourists annually , and is expecting an increase in tourism this year as it celebrates the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall .
it 's not the first time officials have been after locals to put a shine on the city 's image .
when germany hosted the soccer world cup in 2006 , berlin taxi drivers were offered extra training in english and courteous service as part of a national friendliness campaign .
and a multi-million-euro campaign launched last year under the motto " be berlin " encouraged locals to project a more positive image to foreigners and tourists .
as yet , there are no statistics to attest to whether or not such campaigns bring about lasting , real change .
but organizers such as gurka say there 's not really much changing to do : beneath their rough exterior , most berliners already are " service-oriented , hospitable and cosmopolitan people .

novakovic joined cologne when they were still in the second division .
his critics then said , that he does n't have the talent for more .
today he captains the side which has stabilized its position in the bundesliga . twenty-nine year old milivoje novakovic was born in lubljana .
in addition to his duties at cologne , the striker also plays up front for slovenia 's national team .
this is his first season in the top-flight .
we met up with " super-nova " to find out what makes him a great striker .
fortunately i managed to avoid injury for a very long time , and that gave me strength .
and of course , when you work a lot and work hard , then at some point you reap the rewards in life .
modesty from a 1 meter 92 athlete who can score with his head and with both feet .
with twelve goals so far this season , novakovic is one of the league 's top strikers .
you played in the lower leagues in austria and bulgaria before joining the bundesliga .
is it a dream come true for you ?
of course , it 's a dream to play in one of the world 's top five leagues .
i had a great season in bulgaria , and i joined my national team - that 's why the offers came .
i decided to come to cologne .
the bundesliga is a good challenge for me .
had you heard of cologne ?
sure - i knew about all the teams in the bundesliga .
professional players follow all the leagues , and of course i knew that it was a big club with a new stadium and a lot of fans . even if the fans used to have more to cheer about .
like the german title in 1964 , and again in 78 .
after that .. ... things quieted down .
the low point was when the club was relegated in 1998 .
since then its been a rollercoaster ride between top flight and second division .
now under coach christoph daum , cologne has some respectable mid-table results .
is there anything remarkable about christoph daum that strikes you ?
no .
everyone knows he 's a great trainer whose had great success .
there 's not much to say .
sot christoph daum , coach 1 .
fc cologne " sometimes it 's enough for me to just look at someone .
i infect them with a glance , with my gestures - and it brings the desired results .
i think we only speak one language , and that 's the language of success . "
unfortunately , daum and novakovic did n't see eye-to-eye when the striker first arrived in cologne .
more than once , " nova " got sent to the stands .
at first it was a little tough .
it is n't much fun for a player to get sent to the stands .
it makes you hate the coach , but that 's normal .
he was trying to me wake up , and it worked .
i 'm behind the coach one hundred per cent , just as he and the rest of the team stand behind me .
you have to have trust .
and we have that here now .
you 've now become a team star .
in the last few years you seem to have changed considerably .
does success make you grow up ?
not at all .
i think you always have to keep your feet on the ground .
i do n't feel like a star , but i also know that i am very important to this team .
i scored twenty goals in the second division before we got promoted .
then i was made captain , which is very important to me - and you can see that people are behind me .
as a foreigner you always have to give more than others do , and fortunately i was rewarded for that work . it certainly paid off in the team 's last season in the second division , when " nova " and patrick helmes scored a total of 37 goals .
cologne 's two-pronged attack was unstoppable .
helmes moved on to leverkusen - but next season prodigal son lukas podolski returns to the city on the rhine .
you and patrick helmes were the dream team in the second division .
do you think you can find the same magic with lukas podolski ?
of course , i hope so .
but it wo n't be easy .
we would have been a great trio .
podolski and i will have to learn to work together , but i know he 'll be impressive .
and i 'm sure we 'll get along .
even so - do n't you think that the contract with podolski was a very risky move on the part of the club ?
why ?
because it wo n't leave enough money to buy in other players .
no , i do n't think so .
when he comes , more and more money will flow into the club 's coffers - for example from new sponsors .
he 'll be an icon here , and that means a good time is beginning .
you obviously feel very happy at cologne .
i read once that you said you would like to become an fc cologne legend ...
well , to be a legend in a city like this one would be a beautiful thing .
there have n't been any legends here for a while .
there was podolski and toni polster , but that was a while ago .
it would be something to be proud of , but i do n't decide it .
others do .
who 's your favorite cologne legend ?
for me personally it 's löhr .
he scored so many goals and achieved so much .
do you know how many he scored ?
no - but it was a lot … 166 goals in 381 appearances .
that 's doable , is n't it ?
sure it 's doable - how many do you have ?
around 42 , right ?
or is it more ? 42 .
42 , i was right . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

benedict said the vatican failed to be " sufficiently clear " in explaining the reasons for lifting the excommunication of four bishops .
he said he was told after the crisis exploded that better use of the internet would have revealed some of the problems .
he added that he " draws the lesson " from the matter and that in the future the vatican must " pay more attention to this source of information , " news agency reuters reported .
in january , the pope lifted the excommunication of richard williamson and three other bishops .
williamson said in an interview broadcast several days earlier that he believed there were no gas chambers and that no more than 300,000 jews perished in nazi concentration camps , rather than the 6 million accepted by most historians .
the vatican said it was not aware of williamson 's views on the holocaust , but critics have pointed out that internet-based material written by williamson on the matter has existed for some time .
the vatican said the letter would be published thursday with copies available in english , italian , french , german , portuguese and spanish .
world anger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british-born cleric richard williamson has stirred anger worldwide williamson 's comments stirred anger in jewish communities throughout the world , as well as in catholic circles .
several european leaders , including german chancellor angela merkel , called on the germany-born pope to explain the vatican 's decision to waive the excommunications .
it is extremely rare in church history for a pope to explain his actions to his bishops after the fact and to acknowledge any error on his behalf .
the pope said that in the future the vatican body charged with negotiating with the sspx - the pontifical commission ecclesia dei - would work more closely with the congregation for the doctrine of the faith , the church 's watchdog on orthodoxy and disciplinary matters .
the views espoused by the sspx are controversial in catholic circles .
the group rejects modernization of the church through a set of reforms created under the second vatican council in the 1960s .
benedict , who took part in the council , said in his letter that sspx clerics would remain suspended from holding any official positions in the church until they fully subscribed to the reforms . dfm / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

all countries need stricter gun laws .

unfortunately , man-made laws do not change a persons heart and therefore , can not stop this completely from happening . - elizabeth hughes , us in reference to such incidents as recent school shootings in germany this question itself completely misses the mark .

germany presently has some of the strictest gun control laws in the world with respect to sales and ownership , yet such incidents still occur .
ironically , this may , at least partially , be a legitimate cause .
we also see in the us these shootings most often happening in so-called " gun free zones . "
strict gun control is a double-edged sword .
the only gun use it ever succeeds in reducing is legal legitimate non-threatening gun use by the law abiding while simultaneously raising the black market for illegal guns and also raising the status of these illegal guns in the eyes of the embittered and disenfranchised who sometimes lash out in an environment where they know their tirade will have maximum effect , in a totally unarmed group of people . - gerald morris , canada bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the total death toll rose to 16 it seems to me this mass murder was a " copy cat " of the american high schools that have had similar catastrophes .

bucharest has already asked the european commission to save it from a possible financing crisis .
hungary and latvia have grabbed at lifelines from the imf . thomas mirow , the head of the european bank for reconstruction and development , explained the situation in various eastern european countries and how they can move forward . deutsche welle : romania has joined hungary and latvia in requesting emergency loans from the european union .
how serious is the economic situation in central and eastern europe ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : each country needs to determine its own ideal way through the crisis , mirow said thomas mirow : the situation is certainly difficult .
talks have not yet been concluded , but romania has long been seen as a country that has been at particular risk because of very high debts in foreign currencies .
its own currency has been under pressure for a long time , which makes the decision to look for help from the imf a logical step that will contribute to stabilizing the country . are you afraid of the problem spreading to other countries via the domino effect ? no , i am not .
the situation in other countries is completely different .
i am , however , of the opinion that it makes sense to get in touch with the imf in a timely manner .
international investors usually know to respect that .
when such contact is necessary , it makes more sense to do it early than to wait and , for example , have to accept longer phases of devaluation of one 's own currency . how can the situation be diffused ?
what 's the best way forward ? that 's not easy to say because the causes of the problems are different .
in some countries it 's just the financial sector that is suffering from a weak framework , vulnerable and susceptible to sudden crises .
other countries have a relatively robust financial sector , such as poland , and are affected more by developments in the real economy , like the development in western european auto industry . should the eu emergency funds be built up in the manner some politicians are calling for ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there appears to still be enough eu money to aid countries looking for help the european council of finance ministers debated that issue on tuesday .
first of all , i think it is important that the funds are available to the countries that want to make use of them .
should they be exhausted , then it would certainly be a good idea to have additional resources .
but there are apparently still enough resources available . do you think the current support for eastern europe is sufficient ? no , i think more could and should be done - each within its own area .
most of all , i think it is important that heads of state and government of the eu , possibly when they meet in a little over a week , as well as at the g20 meeting in london in april , make it absolutely clear they are determined to represent the countries of central and eastern europe . it sounds as though you expect action in addition to politicians ' words .
what action ? the resources of the eu that have been mentioned are one element .
a second element is that the imf , the world bank and we , as a bank that has been and continues to be active in eastern europe , give our encouragement and support to help these countries .
additional steps by the european central bank could also be a topic of discussion . is it a good idea to accelerate the adoption of the euro to provide added security ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro zone ca n't afford to weaken its entry criteria yes and no .
yes in the sense that the perspective of membership in the euro zone is a positive signal .
no in the sense that i do not believe the criteria for entry should be weakened , that would hurt confidence in the stability of the euro as a whole .
i think one would be well-advised to think about whether , for example , certain terms of time could be shortened .
but the hard criteria should remain . you have been talking about stability .
how big is the danger of a state in the region going bankrupt ? based on current evidence , this is not a danger . how did eastern europe get into this situation ?
many of the states reformed their financial systems according to the theories set out by western financial experts . eastern europe is , in terms of markets , every highly integrated .
it has , for example , opened its borders to western european banks , but it has not advanced as far in term of politics and its opening to the euro zone .
political integration is lagging behind market integration .
the second reason is that central and eastern europe , in real economic terms , are very dependent on certain key industries , such as the western european automobile industry .
since in addition to the financial crisis and the overall economic crisis we are also dealing with a structural crisis in the global auto industry , countries like hungary , the czech republic and slovakia are hard hit because they live from exports in general and especially from the auto industry . is there a feeling among eastern europeans that they are being neglected by their western neighbors ? i do not think that 's the case , at the moment .
but in western europe , i believe , we have a reason to watch the situation and not allow such development to occur .
it is a symbolic year that we are living in .
twenty years ago the berlin wall fell , and we all remember the contribution hungary made to that event .
we can not allow the impression you mentioned to arise . interview : andreas noll -lrb- sms -rrb- editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

leaders said they would begin negotiations on information exchanges wtih germany tomorrow , and with britain next month .
" liechtenstein commits to and will implement the global standards of transparency and exchange of information as developed by the oecd , " read the statement , referring to the organization for economic cooperation and development .
lichtenstein would also " go beyond these standards in order to better meet the concerns and tax claims of other jurisdictions . "
it would however maintain its " modern and solid " banking secrecy laws .
the principality said it would be ready to negotiate with the eu and others on anti-fraud agreements and taxation deals .
such agreements would be modeled on a landmark deal reached with the united states in december , and which will come into force at the start of 2010 .
brushing up its image " with the new agreements , the partner state concerned will receive more efficient tax application with respect to foreign assts ; the clients of the liechtenstein financial center will receive a sustainable legal framework for meeting their tax obligations , " said prime-minister elect klaus tschuetscher .
the announcement represents a major step by the tiny principality to improve its image after it was among three countries put on an oecd blacklist of " non-cooperative " tax havens .
the others were andorra and monaco .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lgt bank was at the heart of german tax evasion scandal last year it comes a year after a major tax evasion scandal in germany put the spotlight on its secretive banking sector .

lgt bank claimed that german tax inspectors were basing their investigation on a stolen list with the names of 1,400 clients - 600 of whom were german nationals .
caving to international pressure international pressure to clamp down on tax havens has been growing in recent weeks with a summit of the g20 group of economic powers in london on april 2 due to discuss the blacklist .
liechtenstein 's de facto head of state , prince alois , said there is a " fundamental and rapid change at the global level in the direction of stronger cross-border cooperation and international regulation . "
" with today 's declaration , the liechtenstein government is sending a signal that it is participating actively in the regulatory dialogue of financial centers without giving up liechtenstein 's identity or the advantages of a reliable and well-regulated small state , " he said . dc / sp / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

all but one of the nine students , aged between 14 and 16 , were girls , and the three teachers gunned down were all women . heribert rech , interior minister of the german state of baden-wuerttemberg , where the crime was committed , said he did n't want to draw conclusions , telling journalists that could have been based on how the classes were drawn up . however , rech did admit that the fact that most of the victims were killed with a shot to the head indicated that they were not random targets . portrait of a killer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police are examining the gunman 's computer looking for answers the perpetrator , identified only as tim k. , was described by school officials as being an unremarkable student . he had achieved average marks on his school leaving certificate and had then enrolled in a course to become a salesman .
tim k. also regularly worked out at the gym and belonged to a sports club . however , a 19-year-old neighbor , who identified himself as michael and said he used to play table tennis with the gunman , told the reuters news agency that tim k. was a loner who had a big collection of horror films . germany has strict gun control laws .
yet police say the gunman had used a nine millimeter pistol registered to his father , a member of a gun club who has a collection of 15 guns at home . emergency plans in place after a school shooting in germany in 2002 , many schools have implemented plans laying out what to do in the event that a gunman should attack the school . authorities are reporting that once the gunman entered the school , the principal announced a coded message on the public address system , saying , " frau koma is coming . " one student , identified only as kim s. , told zdf television that their teacher shut the door and told them to close the windows and sit on the floor . focus on prevention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say students are often best able to identify potential attackers in addition to finding the motive of the killer , many in germany are wondering how these types of attacks can be prevented in the future . wilhelm heitmeyer , a sociologist who specializes in school violence , told deutsche welle that the best people to identify a potential attacker are fellow students . " we see that a lot of the perpetrators are very isolated and they speak out about violent acts , " he says , " and it 's the peers , and not the teachers , who are going to notice this the most . " heitmeyer warns , however , that what actually triggers these people to finally act out is a mystery .
talking about these attacks more openly with students of all ages is the best way to prevent them in the future , he says . mrm / th / ap / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bucharest has already asked the european commission to save it from a possible financing crisis .
hungary and latvia have grabbed at lifelines from the imf . thomas mirow , the head of the european bank for reconstruction and development , explained the situation in various eastern european countries and how they can move forward . deutsche welle : romania has joined hungary and latvia in requesting emergency loans from the european union .
how serious is the economic situation in central and eastern europe ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : each country needs to determine its own ideal way through the crisis , mirow said thomas mirow : the situation is certainly difficult .
talks have not yet been concluded , but romania has long been seen as a country that has been at particular risk because of very high debts in foreign currencies .
its own currency has been under pressure for a long time , which makes the decision to look for help from the imf a logical step that will contribute to stabilizing the country . are you afraid of the problem spreading to other countries via the domino effect ? no , i am not .
the situation in other countries is completely different .
i am , however , of the opinion that it makes sense to get in touch with the imf in a timely manner .
international investors usually know to respect that .
when such contact is necessary , it makes more sense to do it early than to wait and , for example , have to accept longer phases of devaluation of one 's own currency . how can the situation be diffused ?
what 's the best way forward ? that 's not easy to say because the causes of the problems are different .
in some countries it 's just the financial sector that is suffering from a weak framework , vulnerable and susceptible to sudden crises .
other countries have a relatively robust financial sector , such as poland , and are affected more by developments in the real economy , like the development in western european auto industry . should the eu emergency funds be built up in the manner some politicians are calling for ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there appears to still be enough eu money to aid countries looking for help the european council of finance ministers debated that issue on tuesday .
first of all , i think it is important that the funds are available to the countries that want to make use of them .
should they be exhausted , then it would certainly be a good idea to have additional resources .
but there are apparently still enough resources available . do you think the current support for eastern europe is sufficient ? no , i think more could and should be done - each within its own area .
most of all , i think it is important that heads of state and government of the eu , possibly when they meet in a little over a week , as well as at the g20 meeting in london in april , make it absolutely clear they are determined to represent the countries of central and eastern europe . it sounds as though you expect action in addition to politicians ' words .
what action ? the resources of the eu that have been mentioned are one element .
a second element is that the imf , the world bank and we , as a bank that has been and continues to be active in eastern europe , give our encouragement and support to help these countries .
additional steps by the european central bank could also be a topic of discussion . is it a good idea to accelerate the adoption of the euro to provide added security ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro zone ca n't afford to weaken its entry criteria yes and no .
yes in the sense that the perspective of membership in the euro zone is a positive signal .
no in the sense that i do not believe the criteria for entry should be weakened , that would hurt confidence in the stability of the euro as a whole .
i think one would be well-advised to think about whether , for example , certain terms of time could be shortened .
but the hard criteria should remain . you have been talking about stability .
how big is the danger of a state in the region going bankrupt ? based on current evidence , this is not a danger . how did eastern europe get into this situation ?
many of the states reformed their financial systems according to the theories set out by western financial experts . eastern europe is , in terms of markets , every highly integrated .
it has , for example , opened its borders to western european banks , but it has not advanced as far in term of politics and its opening to the euro zone .
political integration is lagging behind market integration .
the second reason is that central and eastern europe , in real economic terms , are very dependent on certain key industries , such as the western european automobile industry .
since in addition to the financial crisis and the overall economic crisis we are also dealing with a structural crisis in the global auto industry , countries like hungary , the czech republic and slovakia are hard hit because they live from exports in general and especially from the auto industry . is there a feeling among eastern europeans that they are being neglected by their western neighbors ? i do not think that 's the case , at the moment .
but in western europe , i believe , we have a reason to watch the situation and not allow such development to occur .
it is a symbolic year that we are living in .
twenty years ago the berlin wall fell , and we all remember the contribution hungary made to that event .
we can not allow the impression you mentioned to arise . interview : andreas noll -lrb- sms -rrb- editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but a new charm offensive launched by the berlin senate hopes to spread an aura of friendliness about the capital . grumpy , sarcastic , and none too shy about piping up with a flippant comeback - that 's the attitude known as the berlin " schnauze " or " snout " to use its literal english translation .
the berlin senate is hoping to counteract its residents ' innate churlishness by appointing 4,000 civil servants , including police officers , public transport workers , waiters and trade fair hostesses to be " good-mood ambassadors . "
they 'll receive red buttons singling them out as friendly sources of information for newcomers and visitors to the capital .
the goal is " to make the city a little more friendly , " said rene gurka of berlin partner , the company behind the campaign , which kicked off this week in conjunction with the start of the annual itb tourism trade fair . " a few years ago , we did a study that showed that non-germans considered berlin a place full of grumpy people , " senate spokesman richard meng told news agency afp .
" we need to show the world that this is n't true . "
confronting stereotypes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's police officers are being encouraged to lighten up a little as part of the campaign , which is expected to cost 200,000 euros -lrb- $ 255,000 -rrb- , civil servants will also hand out postcards printed with prime examples of berliners ' unique brand of sarcasm - and written in the local dialect , of course .
the phrases are meant to be a light-hearted poke in the ribs of the stereotypical berliner , while also showing that it is possible to do service with a smile .
" these cards are fantastic , they show we do n't always take ourselves too seriously and that we can laugh at ourselves , too , " said meng .
berlin is visited by more than eight million tourists annually , and is expecting an increase in tourism this year as it celebrates the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall .
it 's not the first time officials have been after locals to put a shine on the city 's image .
when germany hosted the soccer world cup in 2006 , berlin taxi drivers were offered extra training in english and courteous service as part of a national friendliness campaign .
and a multi-million-euro campaign launched last year under the motto " be berlin " encouraged locals to project a more positive image to foreigners and tourists .
as yet , there are no statistics to attest to whether or not such campaigns bring about lasting , real change .
but organizers such as gurka say there 's not really much changing to do : beneath their rough exterior , most berliners already are " service-oriented , hospitable and cosmopolitan people .

all but one of the nine students , aged between 14 and 16 , were girls , and the three teachers gunned down were all women . heribert rech , interior minister of the german state of baden-wuerttemberg , where the crime was committed , said he did n't want to draw conclusions , telling journalists that could have been based on how the classes were drawn up . however , rech did admit that the fact that most of the victims were killed with a shot to the head indicated that they were not random targets . portrait of a killer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police are examining the gunman 's computer looking for answers the perpetrator , identified only as tim k. , was described by school officials as being an unremarkable student . he had achieved average marks on his school leaving certificate and had then enrolled in a course to become a salesman .
tim k. also regularly worked out at the gym and belonged to a sports club . however , a 19-year-old neighbor , who identified himself as michael and said he used to play table tennis with the gunman , told the reuters news agency that tim k. was a loner who had a big collection of horror films . germany has strict gun control laws .
yet police say the gunman had used a nine millimeter pistol registered to his father , a member of a gun club who has a collection of 15 guns at home . emergency plans in place after a school shooting in germany in 2002 , many schools have implemented plans laying out what to do in the event that a gunman should attack the school . authorities are reporting that once the gunman entered the school , the principal announced a coded message on the public address system , saying , " frau koma is coming . " one student , identified only as kim s. , told zdf television that their teacher shut the door and told them to close the windows and sit on the floor . focus on prevention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say students are often best able to identify potential attackers in addition to finding the motive of the killer , many in germany are wondering how these types of attacks can be prevented in the future . wilhelm heitmeyer , a sociologist who specializes in school violence , told deutsche welle that the best people to identify a potential attacker are fellow students . " we see that a lot of the perpetrators are very isolated and they speak out about violent acts , " he says , " and it 's the peers , and not the teachers , who are going to notice this the most . " heitmeyer warns , however , that what actually triggers these people to finally act out is a mystery .
talking about these attacks more openly with students of all ages is the best way to prevent them in the future , he says . mrm / th / ap / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

both favor tighter regulation of financial markets instead of increased spending measures . the heads of france and germany came out against a call from the united states that they increase spending to counteract the global economic crisis .
instead they said more regulation of financial markets needed to be the focus of a g20 meeting next month . " we consider that in europe we have already invested a lot for the recovery , and that the problem is not about spending more , but putting in place a system of regulation so that the economic and financial catastrophe that the world is seeing does not reproduce itself , " sarkozy told reporters in berlin on thursday , march 12 . when g20 leaders meet april 2 in london , merkel said they should look to pledges made by european union members last month in the german capital to regulate all financial markets , crack down on tax havens and increase funding for the international monetary fund . merkel said economic rescue packages " can under no circumstances replace the necessary regulation " of the financial markets . us treasury secretary timothy geithner said wednesday that he wanted the g20 to make a " substantial , sustained commitment to stimulus " as a way of stemming the global economic downturn . britain veering from eu position ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is brown going to side with washington at the g20 meeting ?
his british counterpart , alistair darling , said he agreed with washington 's spending policy , setting the stage for an inter-european feud . merkel went above darling 's head on thursday saying that british prime minister gordon brown agreed with his european partners during meetings on the berlin plan .
she added that she was " very optimistic that the european position is unchanged . " merkel is scheduled to meet with brown in britain for talks on friday that are likely to address the issue of additional stimulus measures . meanwhile , to keep deficit spending in the eu in check , french and german finance ministers on thursday reiterated their support for the bloc 's stability and growth pact , which restricts public deficits to 3 percent of annual output . ministers from the two countries issued a joint statement saying they would pursue policies to strengthen public finances . eu must fight protectionism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel are back to seeing eye-to-eye merkel and sarkozy also used their meeting to launch joint industrial projects in the energy and automobile sectors .
the plans cover innovations in the renewable energy sector and research into new methods of propulsion for motor vehicles . the joint projects come after the two countries were at odds over sarkozy 's decision to provide financial support to the french car industry .
both leaders , however , agreed thursday that all eu members should eschew any protectionist measures while coming to the aid of national industries . in addition , sarkozy offered his condolences to the victims of a school shooting which left 16 dead in southern germany wednesday . " france was overwhelmed , " by the attack , the french president said , adding that it could have happened " anywhere in the world .

benedict said the vatican failed to be " sufficiently clear " in explaining the reasons for lifting the excommunication of four bishops .

he added that he " draws the lesson " from the matter and that in the future the vatican must " pay more attention to this source of information , " news agency reuters reported .
in january , the pope lifted the excommunication of richard williamson and three other bishops .
williamson said in an interview broadcast several days earlier that he believed there were no gas chambers and that no more than 300,000 jews perished in nazi concentration camps , rather than the 6 million accepted by most historians .
the vatican said it was not aware of williamson 's views on the holocaust , but critics have pointed out that internet-based material written by williamson on the matter has existed for some time .

leaders said they would begin negotiations on information exchanges wtih germany tomorrow , and with britain next month .
" liechtenstein commits to and will implement the global standards of transparency and exchange of information as developed by the oecd , " read the statement , referring to the organization for economic cooperation and development .
lichtenstein would also " go beyond these standards in order to better meet the concerns and tax claims of other jurisdictions . "
it would however maintain its " modern and solid " banking secrecy laws .
the principality said it would be ready to negotiate with the eu and others on anti-fraud agreements and taxation deals .
such agreements would be modeled on a landmark deal reached with the united states in december , and which will come into force at the start of 2010 .
brushing up its image " with the new agreements , the partner state concerned will receive more efficient tax application with respect to foreign assts ; the clients of the liechtenstein financial center will receive a sustainable legal framework for meeting their tax obligations , " said prime-minister elect klaus tschuetscher .
the announcement represents a major step by the tiny principality to improve its image after it was among three countries put on an oecd blacklist of " non-cooperative " tax havens .
the others were andorra and monaco .

german investigators launched a major probe into clients of the lgt banking group , which is controlled by liechtenstein 's royal family .
lgt bank claimed that german tax inspectors were basing their investigation on a stolen list with the names of 1,400 clients - 600 of whom were german nationals .
caving to international pressure international pressure to clamp down on tax havens has been growing in recent weeks with a summit of the g20 group of economic powers in london on april 2 due to discuss the blacklist .
liechtenstein 's de facto head of state , prince alois , said there is a " fundamental and rapid change at the global level in the direction of stronger cross-border cooperation and international regulation . "
" with today 's declaration , the liechtenstein government is sending a signal that it is participating actively in the regulatory dialogue of financial centers without giving up liechtenstein 's identity or the advantages of a reliable and well-regulated small state , " he said . dc / sp / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but others called for measures to protect children to be put in place . a day after a deadly school shooting , german politicians said they would refrain from making any rash decisions on gun control or school safety .
the first thing to do was collect facts about the shooting which left 16 dead , including the teenaged gunman , politicians said .
the scene in front of the school in winnenden was pure emotion on thursday , march 12 .
students had tears streaming down their faces as they held each other , trying to come to terms with the horrible killings .
" i do n't know if i can stay at this school .
every time you enter , the memories come back , " student christin pluengel told reuters .
the 17-year-old gunman , identified as tim k. , fired 112 rounds , 60 in the school , and had 109 unused rounds with him when his body was found by police .
many of the victims were shot at close range with a 9 millimeter beretta pistol .

" whoever points denounces addiction to computer games or an infatuation with weapons as the cause for these kinds of terrible acts hinders the search for the complex problems and reasons that precede such crimes , " he said in berlin on thursday . laws ca n't prevent violence german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble said lawmakers are not able to completely protect against every possible threat . " absolute security does not exist , " he said in berlin , adding that germany needed to look at " what is going on in our society . " schaeuble , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union , said the country needed to concentrate on strengthening the role of the family and teaching moral values to children rather than calling for tighter restrictions on gun ownership . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blaming computer games is too easy an answer , von der leyen said " i ca n't see how a change in weapons rules would contribute anything to solving the problem , " schaeuble told reuters . calls for stricter gun control laws were issued after police said they suspected the gunman got the pistol he used in wednesday 's massacre from his parents ' bedroom . father could face charges his father , reportedly a member of a local shooting club , is said to own over a dozen guns , all locked away except the nine-millimeter beretta that caused the carnage .
german authorities said they are considering whether to press charges against his father . " everything here points to negligence on the part of the father as far as the storage of this weapon is concerned , " said police spokesman ralf michelfelder . germany tightened its gun control laws twice since a 2002 school shooting in the city of erfurt , but politicians said the restrictions could not have prevented wednesday 's events or a 2006 school shooting . preventative measures needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police said the teenager 's father could face charges sebastian edathy , an interior affairs expert for the social democratic party , agreed with schaeuble on the impossibility of absolute safety .
instead , he said , germany should consider preventative ways to deal with violence in schools . " here in germany we have significantly fewer school psychologists for students than in other european countries , " he told german television channel phoenix , adding that schools should consider adding trained mental-health workers to their staffs . leaders of the greens said wednesday 's tragic events should be analyzed by experts in order to uncover " hidden signals from students with problems . " " we need a culture that pay attention and recognizes problems , " party heads claudia roth and cem ozdemir said . german family minister ursula von der leyen made a similar statement , saying that most acts of violence are preceded by warnings .

both favor tighter regulation of financial markets instead of increased spending measures . the heads of france and germany came out against a call from the united states that they increase spending to counteract the global economic crisis .
instead they said more regulation of financial markets needed to be the focus of a g20 meeting next month . " we consider that in europe we have already invested a lot for the recovery , and that the problem is not about spending more , but putting in place a system of regulation so that the economic and financial catastrophe that the world is seeing does not reproduce itself , " sarkozy told reporters in berlin on thursday , march 12 . when g20 leaders meet april 2 in london , merkel said they should look to pledges made by european union members last month in the german capital to regulate all financial markets , crack down on tax havens and increase funding for the international monetary fund . merkel said economic rescue packages " can under no circumstances replace the necessary regulation " of the financial markets . us treasury secretary timothy geithner said wednesday that he wanted the g20 to make a " substantial , sustained commitment to stimulus " as a way of stemming the global economic downturn . britain veering from eu position ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is brown going to side with washington at the g20 meeting ?

but a new charm offensive launched by the berlin senate hopes to spread an aura of friendliness about the capital . grumpy , sarcastic , and none too shy about piping up with a flippant comeback - that 's the attitude known as the berlin " schnauze " or " snout " to use its literal english translation .
the berlin senate is hoping to counteract its residents ' innate churlishness by appointing 4,000 civil servants , including police officers , public transport workers , waiters and trade fair hostesses to be " good-mood ambassadors . "
they 'll receive red buttons singling them out as friendly sources of information for newcomers and visitors to the capital .
the goal is " to make the city a little more friendly , " said rene gurka of berlin partner , the company behind the campaign , which kicked off this week in conjunction with the start of the annual itb tourism trade fair . " a few years ago , we did a study that showed that non-germans considered berlin a place full of grumpy people , " senate spokesman richard meng told news agency afp .
" we need to show the world that this is n't true . "
confronting stereotypes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's police officers are being encouraged to lighten up a little as part of the campaign , which is expected to cost 200,000 euros -lrb- $ 255,000 -rrb- , civil servants will also hand out postcards printed with prime examples of berliners ' unique brand of sarcasm - and written in the local dialect , of course .
the phrases are meant to be a light-hearted poke in the ribs of the stereotypical berliner , while also showing that it is possible to do service with a smile .
" these cards are fantastic , they show we do n't always take ourselves too seriously and that we can laugh at ourselves , too , " said meng .
berlin is visited by more than eight million tourists annually , and is expecting an increase in tourism this year as it celebrates the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall .
it 's not the first time officials have been after locals to put a shine on the city 's image .
when germany hosted the soccer world cup in 2006 , berlin taxi drivers were offered extra training in english and courteous service as part of a national friendliness campaign .
and a multi-million-euro campaign launched last year under the motto " be berlin " encouraged locals to project a more positive image to foreigners and tourists .
as yet , there are no statistics to attest to whether or not such campaigns bring about lasting , real change .
but organizers such as gurka say there 's not really much changing to do : beneath their rough exterior , most berliners already are " service-oriented , hospitable and cosmopolitan people .

bucharest has already asked the european commission to save it from a possible financing crisis .
hungary and latvia have grabbed at lifelines from the imf . thomas mirow , the head of the european bank for reconstruction and development , explained the situation in various eastern european countries and how they can move forward . deutsche welle : romania has joined hungary and latvia in requesting emergency loans from the european union .
how serious is the economic situation in central and eastern europe ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : each country needs to determine its own ideal way through the crisis , mirow said thomas mirow : the situation is certainly difficult .
talks have not yet been concluded , but romania has long been seen as a country that has been at particular risk because of very high debts in foreign currencies .
its own currency has been under pressure for a long time , which makes the decision to look for help from the imf a logical step that will contribute to stabilizing the country . are you afraid of the problem spreading to other countries via the domino effect ? no , i am not .
the situation in other countries is completely different .
i am , however , of the opinion that it makes sense to get in touch with the imf in a timely manner .
international investors usually know to respect that .
when such contact is necessary , it makes more sense to do it early than to wait and , for example , have to accept longer phases of devaluation of one 's own currency . how can the situation be diffused ?
what 's the best way forward ? that 's not easy to say because the causes of the problems are different .
in some countries it 's just the financial sector that is suffering from a weak framework , vulnerable and susceptible to sudden crises .
other countries have a relatively robust financial sector , such as poland , and are affected more by developments in the real economy , like the development in western european auto industry . should the eu emergency funds be built up in the manner some politicians are calling for ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there appears to still be enough eu money to aid countries looking for help the european council of finance ministers debated that issue on tuesday .
first of all , i think it is important that the funds are available to the countries that want to make use of them .
should they be exhausted , then it would certainly be a good idea to have additional resources .
but there are apparently still enough resources available . do you think the current support for eastern europe is sufficient ? no , i think more could and should be done - each within its own area .
most of all , i think it is important that heads of state and government of the eu , possibly when they meet in a little over a week , as well as at the g20 meeting in london in april , make it absolutely clear they are determined to represent the countries of central and eastern europe . it sounds as though you expect action in addition to politicians ' words .
what action ? the resources of the eu that have been mentioned are one element .
a second element is that the imf , the world bank and we , as a bank that has been and continues to be active in eastern europe , give our encouragement and support to help these countries .

yes in the sense that the perspective of membership in the euro zone is a positive signal .
no in the sense that i do not believe the criteria for entry should be weakened , that would hurt confidence in the stability of the euro as a whole .
i think one would be well-advised to think about whether , for example , certain terms of time could be shortened .
but the hard criteria should remain . you have been talking about stability .
how big is the danger of a state in the region going bankrupt ? based on current evidence , this is not a danger . how did eastern europe get into this situation ?
many of the states reformed their financial systems according to the theories set out by western financial experts . eastern europe is , in terms of markets , every highly integrated .
it has , for example , opened its borders to western european banks , but it has not advanced as far in term of politics and its opening to the euro zone .
political integration is lagging behind market integration .
the second reason is that central and eastern europe , in real economic terms , are very dependent on certain key industries , such as the western european automobile industry .

leaders said they would begin negotiations on information exchanges wtih germany tomorrow , and with britain next month .
" liechtenstein commits to and will implement the global standards of transparency and exchange of information as developed by the oecd , " read the statement , referring to the organization for economic cooperation and development .
lichtenstein would also " go beyond these standards in order to better meet the concerns and tax claims of other jurisdictions . "
it would however maintain its " modern and solid " banking secrecy laws .
the principality said it would be ready to negotiate with the eu and others on anti-fraud agreements and taxation deals .
such agreements would be modeled on a landmark deal reached with the united states in december , and which will come into force at the start of 2010 .
brushing up its image " with the new agreements , the partner state concerned will receive more efficient tax application with respect to foreign assts ; the clients of the liechtenstein financial center will receive a sustainable legal framework for meeting their tax obligations , " said prime-minister elect klaus tschuetscher .
the announcement represents a major step by the tiny principality to improve its image after it was among three countries put on an oecd blacklist of " non-cooperative " tax havens .
the others were andorra and monaco .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lgt bank was at the heart of german tax evasion scandal last year it comes a year after a major tax evasion scandal in germany put the spotlight on its secretive banking sector .
german investigators launched a major probe into clients of the lgt banking group , which is controlled by liechtenstein 's royal family .
lgt bank claimed that german tax inspectors were basing their investigation on a stolen list with the names of 1,400 clients - 600 of whom were german nationals .
caving to international pressure international pressure to clamp down on tax havens has been growing in recent weeks with a summit of the g20 group of economic powers in london on april 2 due to discuss the blacklist .
liechtenstein 's de facto head of state , prince alois , said there is a " fundamental and rapid change at the global level in the direction of stronger cross-border cooperation and international regulation . "
" with today 's declaration , the liechtenstein government is sending a signal that it is participating actively in the regulatory dialogue of financial centers without giving up liechtenstein 's identity or the advantages of a reliable and well-regulated small state , " he said . dc / sp / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i 'm serious … i have weapons here and tomorrow morning i am going to go to my old school and really fry them .
keep the name winnenden in mind , " the teenager wrote . the teenager went on a rampage in his former secondary school in the small town of winnenden in the state of baden-wuerttemberg in southwestern germany on wednesday morning , shooting nine students between the ages of 15 and 16 , as well as three teachers .
three bystanders were also killed as the gunman attempted to flee police . tim k. was pursued by hundreds of armed police officers and snipers , assisted by helicopters and dogs .
less than three hours after his rampage began , he turned his weapon on himself after being injured in an exchange of fire with police . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police commandos leave the albertville school on wednesday german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble ordered flags across the country to be flown at half mast on thursday . a first memorial service was held on wednesday evening in a church in the town of 27,000 people .
mourners lit candles at the altar , and created a makeshift memorial of candles and flowers outside the albertville school , where the shooting spree occurred .
psychologists advise long-term care the albertville secondary school has been closed until further notice , and at least one psychologist has advised that it should remain closed permanently , as students would otherwise be forced to relive the trauma .
a team of psychologists and spiritual advisors are in winnenden to care for the victims ' family members , the students and their teachers .
according to spiritual advisor ralf radix , the community will need long-term care if they are to come to terms with wednesday 's tragic events .
" each person affected needs something different , " he told germany 's protestant church press service , epd .
" one person might need some peace and quiet , which we then have to create in the midst of all this hectic activity , and someone else might need a partner to talk to . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel offered her sympathy to the family members of the victims in her initial comments on the shooting , a visibly shaken chancellor angela merkel on wednesday described the crime as " incomprehensible . "
" it is a day of mourning for the whole of germany , " she said .
" our thoughts go out to the families and the friends .
we are thinking of you and we are praying for you . "
politicians call for action in the meantime , politicians have begun to voice their opinions on ways to better protect germany 's students and prevent such massacres from happening in the future .
the head of the parliamentary interior committee , sebastian edathy -lrb- spd -rrb- said he thought the case could be made to install metal detectors at select schools .
while such measures have become commonplace at schools in the united states in the wake of the columbine school shooting in 1999 , germany has so far resisted tougher security systems in its schools .
bavarian interior minister , joachim herrmann -lrb- csu -rrb- , has also spoken out in favor of a ban on violent computer games after it emerged that tim k. had killer games such as counterstrike on his computer at home .
criminologist hans-dieter schwind said the government must act to tighten germany 's gun laws .
tim k. got the pistol he used in wednesday 's massacre from his parents ' bedroom .
his father , reportedly a member of a local shooting club , is said to own over a dozen guns , all locked away except the nine-millimeter beretta that caused the carnage .
other experts , including psychologists , say it 's up to school officials to become more sensitive to the early warning signals sent out by troubled youths such as tim k. , who reportedly was an outsider at the albertville school with few friends .
" one alarm signal is when young people strongly isolate themselves from their environment and spend hours each day in front of their computers , " said joerg fegert , psychiatrist at the university clinic for child and youth psychology in ulm . he noted that gunmen like tim k. often hint at their plans in online diaries or chatrooms , but that parents and teachers often remain oblivious , or react too late . dc / sp / dpa / epd send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

first , let me extend my deepest sympathy to all the families of those killed .
i thought germany already had very strict gun laws , stricter than the us .
why did this young man 's father have a gun in the first place ?
all countries need stricter gun laws .
but , will this really stop tragedies like this from happening .
unfortunately , man-made laws do not change a persons heart and therefore , can not stop this completely from happening . - elizabeth hughes , us in reference to such incidents as recent school shootings in germany this question itself completely misses the mark .
it wrongly implies that -lrb- legal -rrb- weapon sales are to be questioned as a " cause " of this behavior .
germany presently has some of the strictest gun control laws in the world with respect to sales and ownership , yet such incidents still occur .
ironically , this may , at least partially , be a legitimate cause .
we also see in the us these shootings most often happening in so-called " gun free zones . "
strict gun control is a double-edged sword .
the only gun use it ever succeeds in reducing is legal legitimate non-threatening gun use by the law abiding while simultaneously raising the black market for illegal guns and also raising the status of these illegal guns in the eyes of the embittered and disenfranchised who sometimes lash out in an environment where they know their tirade will have maximum effect , in a totally unarmed group of people . - gerald morris , canada bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the total death toll rose to 16 it seems to me this mass murder was a " copy cat " of the american high schools that have had similar catastrophes .
in the american killing they found out the use of marijuana in the killers was an important issue , and possible cause .
there are now many new articles associating the use of marijuana -lrb- and hashish -rrb- to becoming psychotic .
many new publications have been appearing .
it would be interesting to have data on the autopsy of this killer and find out if there are marijuana chemicals in his brain -lrb- they stay for several months -rrb- . - jose carranza , us there is shocking news coming from germany today .
i hope that it will push german regulators towards more strict rules concerning possession of weapons for private use . - wojtek , poland i hope that gun laws in germany are not as bad as in finland and the united states of america .
the last major shooting incident in australia that occurred in tasmania back in 1996 made the australian federal government tighten gun laws - surprisingly by former prime minister john howard .
i believe this fellow in germany -lrb- the gunman in question -rrb- committed suicide after what he had done .
he must have had a guilt complex .
my advice is to tighten gun law like what happened in australia last time in 1996 . - stuart john pearson , australia your entire article on the school shootings does not include one reference about the parents , except that the gun may have come from the father 's collection .
you state what everyone else thinks society should do .

give a little more balance to your reporting . - barbara dreher , us just check the baggage of all german students ! - kathe herberg , brazil i was shocked to read of the terrible news of the albertville school shooting in winnenden , germany .

benedict said the vatican failed to be " sufficiently clear " in explaining the reasons for lifting the excommunication of four bishops .
he said he was told after the crisis exploded that better use of the internet would have revealed some of the problems .
he added that he " draws the lesson " from the matter and that in the future the vatican must " pay more attention to this source of information , " news agency reuters reported .
in january , the pope lifted the excommunication of richard williamson and three other bishops .
williamson said in an interview broadcast several days earlier that he believed there were no gas chambers and that no more than 300,000 jews perished in nazi concentration camps , rather than the 6 million accepted by most historians .
the vatican said it was not aware of williamson 's views on the holocaust , but critics have pointed out that internet-based material written by williamson on the matter has existed for some time .
the vatican said the letter would be published thursday with copies available in english , italian , french , german , portuguese and spanish .
world anger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british-born cleric richard williamson has stirred anger worldwide williamson 's comments stirred anger in jewish communities throughout the world , as well as in catholic circles .
several european leaders , including german chancellor angela merkel , called on the germany-born pope to explain the vatican 's decision to waive the excommunications .
it is extremely rare in church history for a pope to explain his actions to his bishops after the fact and to acknowledge any error on his behalf .
the pope said that in the future the vatican body charged with negotiating with the sspx - the pontifical commission ecclesia dei - would work more closely with the congregation for the doctrine of the faith , the church 's watchdog on orthodoxy and disciplinary matters .
the views espoused by the sspx are controversial in catholic circles .
the group rejects modernization of the church through a set of reforms created under the second vatican council in the 1960s .
benedict , who took part in the council , said in his letter that sspx clerics would remain suspended from holding any official positions in the church until they fully subscribed to the reforms . dfm / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

leaders said they would begin negotiations on information exchanges wtih germany tomorrow , and with britain next month .
" liechtenstein commits to and will implement the global standards of transparency and exchange of information as developed by the oecd , " read the statement , referring to the organization for economic cooperation and development .
lichtenstein would also " go beyond these standards in order to better meet the concerns and tax claims of other jurisdictions . "
it would however maintain its " modern and solid " banking secrecy laws .
the principality said it would be ready to negotiate with the eu and others on anti-fraud agreements and taxation deals .
such agreements would be modeled on a landmark deal reached with the united states in december , and which will come into force at the start of 2010 .
brushing up its image " with the new agreements , the partner state concerned will receive more efficient tax application with respect to foreign assts ; the clients of the liechtenstein financial center will receive a sustainable legal framework for meeting their tax obligations , " said prime-minister elect klaus tschuetscher .
the announcement represents a major step by the tiny principality to improve its image after it was among three countries put on an oecd blacklist of " non-cooperative " tax havens .
the others were andorra and monaco .

caving to international pressure international pressure to clamp down on tax havens has been growing in recent weeks with a summit of the g20 group of economic powers in london on april 2 due to discuss the blacklist .
liechtenstein 's de facto head of state , prince alois , said there is a " fundamental and rapid change at the global level in the direction of stronger cross-border cooperation and international regulation . "
" with today 's declaration , the liechtenstein government is sending a signal that it is participating actively in the regulatory dialogue of financial centers without giving up liechtenstein 's identity or the advantages of a reliable and well-regulated small state , " he said . dc / sp / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
first , let me extend my deepest sympathy to all the families of those killed .
i thought germany already had very strict gun laws , stricter than the us .
why did this young man 's father have a gun in the first place ?
all countries need stricter gun laws .
but , will this really stop tragedies like this from happening .
unfortunately , man-made laws do not change a persons heart and therefore , can not stop this completely from happening . - elizabeth hughes , us in reference to such incidents as recent school shootings in germany this question itself completely misses the mark .
it wrongly implies that -lrb- legal -rrb- weapon sales are to be questioned as a " cause " of this behavior .
germany presently has some of the strictest gun control laws in the world with respect to sales and ownership , yet such incidents still occur .
ironically , this may , at least partially , be a legitimate cause .
we also see in the us these shootings most often happening in so-called " gun free zones . "
strict gun control is a double-edged sword .
the only gun use it ever succeeds in reducing is legal legitimate non-threatening gun use by the law abiding while simultaneously raising the black market for illegal guns and also raising the status of these illegal guns in the eyes of the embittered and disenfranchised who sometimes lash out in an environment where they know their tirade will have maximum effect , in a totally unarmed group of people . - gerald morris , canada bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the total death toll rose to 16 it seems to me this mass murder was a " copy cat " of the american high schools that have had similar catastrophes .
in the american killing they found out the use of marijuana in the killers was an important issue , and possible cause .
there are now many new articles associating the use of marijuana -lrb- and hashish -rrb- to becoming psychotic .
many new publications have been appearing .
it would be interesting to have data on the autopsy of this killer and find out if there are marijuana chemicals in his brain -lrb- they stay for several months -rrb- . - jose carranza , us there is shocking news coming from germany today .
i hope that it will push german regulators towards more strict rules concerning possession of weapons for private use . - wojtek , poland i hope that gun laws in germany are not as bad as in finland and the united states of america .
the last major shooting incident in australia that occurred in tasmania back in 1996 made the australian federal government tighten gun laws - surprisingly by former prime minister john howard .
i believe this fellow in germany -lrb- the gunman in question -rrb- committed suicide after what he had done .
he must have had a guilt complex .
my advice is to tighten gun law like what happened in australia last time in 1996 . - stuart john pearson , australia your entire article on the school shootings does not include one reference about the parents , except that the gun may have come from the father 's collection .
you state what everyone else thinks society should do .
have you totally absolved the parents from responsibility ?
perhaps his problem was at home not at the school .
give a little more balance to your reporting . - barbara dreher , us just check the baggage of all german students ! - kathe herberg , brazil i was shocked to read of the terrible news of the albertville school shooting in winnenden , germany .
please accept my deepest condolences to all the families affected by this horrendous tragedy .
my thoughts and prayers go with you in your time of need .

leaders said they would begin negotiations on information exchanges wtih germany tomorrow , and with britain next month .
" liechtenstein commits to and will implement the global standards of transparency and exchange of information as developed by the oecd , " read the statement , referring to the organization for economic cooperation and development .
lichtenstein would also " go beyond these standards in order to better meet the concerns and tax claims of other jurisdictions . "
it would however maintain its " modern and solid " banking secrecy laws .
the principality said it would be ready to negotiate with the eu and others on anti-fraud agreements and taxation deals .
such agreements would be modeled on a landmark deal reached with the united states in december , and which will come into force at the start of 2010 .
brushing up its image " with the new agreements , the partner state concerned will receive more efficient tax application with respect to foreign assts ; the clients of the liechtenstein financial center will receive a sustainable legal framework for meeting their tax obligations , " said prime-minister elect klaus tschuetscher .
the announcement represents a major step by the tiny principality to improve its image after it was among three countries put on an oecd blacklist of " non-cooperative " tax havens .
the others were andorra and monaco .

lgt bank claimed that german tax inspectors were basing their investigation on a stolen list with the names of 1,400 clients - 600 of whom were german nationals .
caving to international pressure international pressure to clamp down on tax havens has been growing in recent weeks with a summit of the g20 group of economic powers in london on april 2 due to discuss the blacklist .
liechtenstein 's de facto head of state , prince alois , said there is a " fundamental and rapid change at the global level in the direction of stronger cross-border cooperation and international regulation . "
" with today 's declaration , the liechtenstein government is sending a signal that it is participating actively in the regulatory dialogue of financial centers without giving up liechtenstein 's identity or the advantages of a reliable and well-regulated small state , " he said . dc / sp / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but others called for measures to protect children to be put in place . a day after a deadly school shooting , german politicians said they would refrain from making any rash decisions on gun control or school safety .
the first thing to do was collect facts about the shooting which left 16 dead , including the teenaged gunman , politicians said .
the scene in front of the school in winnenden was pure emotion on thursday , march 12 .
students had tears streaming down their faces as they held each other , trying to come to terms with the horrible killings .

the 17-year-old gunman , identified as tim k. , fired 112 rounds , 60 in the school , and had 109 unused rounds with him when his body was found by police .

first , let me extend my deepest sympathy to all the families of those killed .
i thought germany already had very strict gun laws , stricter than the us .
why did this young man 's father have a gun in the first place ?
all countries need stricter gun laws .
but , will this really stop tragedies like this from happening .
unfortunately , man-made laws do not change a persons heart and therefore , can not stop this completely from happening . - elizabeth hughes , us in reference to such incidents as recent school shootings in germany this question itself completely misses the mark .
it wrongly implies that -lrb- legal -rrb- weapon sales are to be questioned as a " cause " of this behavior .
germany presently has some of the strictest gun control laws in the world with respect to sales and ownership , yet such incidents still occur .
ironically , this may , at least partially , be a legitimate cause .
we also see in the us these shootings most often happening in so-called " gun free zones . "
strict gun control is a double-edged sword .
the only gun use it ever succeeds in reducing is legal legitimate non-threatening gun use by the law abiding while simultaneously raising the black market for illegal guns and also raising the status of these illegal guns in the eyes of the embittered and disenfranchised who sometimes lash out in an environment where they know their tirade will have maximum effect , in a totally unarmed group of people . - gerald morris , canada bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the total death toll rose to 16 it seems to me this mass murder was a " copy cat " of the american high schools that have had similar catastrophes .
in the american killing they found out the use of marijuana in the killers was an important issue , and possible cause .
there are now many new articles associating the use of marijuana -lrb- and hashish -rrb- to becoming psychotic .
many new publications have been appearing .
it would be interesting to have data on the autopsy of this killer and find out if there are marijuana chemicals in his brain -lrb- they stay for several months -rrb- . - jose carranza , us there is shocking news coming from germany today .
i hope that it will push german regulators towards more strict rules concerning possession of weapons for private use . - wojtek , poland i hope that gun laws in germany are not as bad as in finland and the united states of america .
the last major shooting incident in australia that occurred in tasmania back in 1996 made the australian federal government tighten gun laws - surprisingly by former prime minister john howard .
i believe this fellow in germany -lrb- the gunman in question -rrb- committed suicide after what he had done .
he must have had a guilt complex .
my advice is to tighten gun law like what happened in australia last time in 1996 . - stuart john pearson , australia your entire article on the school shootings does not include one reference about the parents , except that the gun may have come from the father 's collection .
you state what everyone else thinks society should do .
have you totally absolved the parents from responsibility ?
perhaps his problem was at home not at the school .
give a little more balance to your reporting . - barbara dreher , us just check the baggage of all german students ! - kathe herberg , brazil i was shocked to read of the terrible news of the albertville school shooting in winnenden , germany .

i hope that it will push german regulators towards more strict rules concerning possession of weapons for private use . - wojtek , poland i hope that gun laws in germany are not as bad as in finland and the united states of america .
the last major shooting incident in australia that occurred in tasmania back in 1996 made the australian federal government tighten gun laws - surprisingly by former prime minister john howard .
i believe this fellow in germany -lrb- the gunman in question -rrb- committed suicide after what he had done .
he must have had a guilt complex .
my advice is to tighten gun law like what happened in australia last time in 1996 . - stuart john pearson , australia your entire article on the school shootings does not include one reference about the parents , except that the gun may have come from the father 's collection .
you state what everyone else thinks society should do .
have you totally absolved the parents from responsibility ?
perhaps his problem was at home not at the school .
give a little more balance to your reporting . - barbara dreher , us just check the baggage of all german students ! - kathe herberg , brazil i was shocked to read of the terrible news of the albertville school shooting in winnenden , germany .

but a new charm offensive launched by the berlin senate hopes to spread an aura of friendliness about the capital . grumpy , sarcastic , and none too shy about piping up with a flippant comeback - that 's the attitude known as the berlin " schnauze " or " snout " to use its literal english translation .
the berlin senate is hoping to counteract its residents ' innate churlishness by appointing 4,000 civil servants , including police officers , public transport workers , waiters and trade fair hostesses to be " good-mood ambassadors . "
they 'll receive red buttons singling them out as friendly sources of information for newcomers and visitors to the capital .
the goal is " to make the city a little more friendly , " said rene gurka of berlin partner , the company behind the campaign , which kicked off this week in conjunction with the start of the annual itb tourism trade fair .

the phrases are meant to be a light-hearted poke in the ribs of the stereotypical berliner , while also showing that it is possible to do service with a smile .
" these cards are fantastic , they show we do n't always take ourselves too seriously and that we can laugh at ourselves , too , " said meng .
berlin is visited by more than eight million tourists annually , and is expecting an increase in tourism this year as it celebrates the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall .
it 's not the first time officials have been after locals to put a shine on the city 's image .
when germany hosted the soccer world cup in 2006 , berlin taxi drivers were offered extra training in english and courteous service as part of a national friendliness campaign .
and a multi-million-euro campaign launched last year under the motto " be berlin " encouraged locals to project a more positive image to foreigners and tourists .
as yet , there are no statistics to attest to whether or not such campaigns bring about lasting , real change .

bucharest has already asked the european commission to save it from a possible financing crisis .
hungary and latvia have grabbed at lifelines from the imf . thomas mirow , the head of the european bank for reconstruction and development , explained the situation in various eastern european countries and how they can move forward . deutsche welle : romania has joined hungary and latvia in requesting emergency loans from the european union .
how serious is the economic situation in central and eastern europe ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : each country needs to determine its own ideal way through the crisis , mirow said thomas mirow : the situation is certainly difficult .
talks have not yet been concluded , but romania has long been seen as a country that has been at particular risk because of very high debts in foreign currencies .
its own currency has been under pressure for a long time , which makes the decision to look for help from the imf a logical step that will contribute to stabilizing the country . are you afraid of the problem spreading to other countries via the domino effect ? no , i am not .
the situation in other countries is completely different .
i am , however , of the opinion that it makes sense to get in touch with the imf in a timely manner .
international investors usually know to respect that .
when such contact is necessary , it makes more sense to do it early than to wait and , for example , have to accept longer phases of devaluation of one 's own currency . how can the situation be diffused ?
what 's the best way forward ? that 's not easy to say because the causes of the problems are different .
in some countries it 's just the financial sector that is suffering from a weak framework , vulnerable and susceptible to sudden crises .
other countries have a relatively robust financial sector , such as poland , and are affected more by developments in the real economy , like the development in western european auto industry . should the eu emergency funds be built up in the manner some politicians are calling for ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there appears to still be enough eu money to aid countries looking for help the european council of finance ministers debated that issue on tuesday .

no in the sense that i do not believe the criteria for entry should be weakened , that would hurt confidence in the stability of the euro as a whole .

talks have not yet been concluded , but romania has long been seen as a country that has been at particular risk because of very high debts in foreign currencies .
its own currency has been under pressure for a long time , which makes the decision to look for help from the imf a logical step that will contribute to stabilizing the country . are you afraid of the problem spreading to other countries via the domino effect ? no , i am not .

but a new charm offensive launched by the berlin senate hopes to spread an aura of friendliness about the capital . grumpy , sarcastic , and none too shy about piping up with a flippant comeback - that 's the attitude known as the berlin " schnauze " or " snout " to use its literal english translation .
the berlin senate is hoping to counteract its residents ' innate churlishness by appointing 4,000 civil servants , including police officers , public transport workers , waiters and trade fair hostesses to be " good-mood ambassadors . "
they 'll receive red buttons singling them out as friendly sources of information for newcomers and visitors to the capital .
the goal is " to make the city a little more friendly , " said rene gurka of berlin partner , the company behind the campaign , which kicked off this week in conjunction with the start of the annual itb tourism trade fair . " a few years ago , we did a study that showed that non-germans considered berlin a place full of grumpy people , " senate spokesman richard meng told news agency afp .
" we need to show the world that this is n't true . "
confronting stereotypes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's police officers are being encouraged to lighten up a little as part of the campaign , which is expected to cost 200,000 euros -lrb- $ 255,000 -rrb- , civil servants will also hand out postcards printed with prime examples of berliners ' unique brand of sarcasm - and written in the local dialect , of course .
the phrases are meant to be a light-hearted poke in the ribs of the stereotypical berliner , while also showing that it is possible to do service with a smile .
" these cards are fantastic , they show we do n't always take ourselves too seriously and that we can laugh at ourselves , too , " said meng .
berlin is visited by more than eight million tourists annually , and is expecting an increase in tourism this year as it celebrates the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall .
it 's not the first time officials have been after locals to put a shine on the city 's image .
when germany hosted the soccer world cup in 2006 , berlin taxi drivers were offered extra training in english and courteous service as part of a national friendliness campaign .
and a multi-million-euro campaign launched last year under the motto " be berlin " encouraged locals to project a more positive image to foreigners and tourists .
as yet , there are no statistics to attest to whether or not such campaigns bring about lasting , real change .
but organizers such as gurka say there 's not really much changing to do : beneath their rough exterior , most berliners already are " service-oriented , hospitable and cosmopolitan people .

but a new charm offensive launched by the berlin senate hopes to spread an aura of friendliness about the capital . grumpy , sarcastic , and none too shy about piping up with a flippant comeback - that 's the attitude known as the berlin " schnauze " or " snout " to use its literal english translation .
the berlin senate is hoping to counteract its residents ' innate churlishness by appointing 4,000 civil servants , including police officers , public transport workers , waiters and trade fair hostesses to be " good-mood ambassadors . "
they 'll receive red buttons singling them out as friendly sources of information for newcomers and visitors to the capital .
the goal is " to make the city a little more friendly , " said rene gurka of berlin partner , the company behind the campaign , which kicked off this week in conjunction with the start of the annual itb tourism trade fair .

the phrases are meant to be a light-hearted poke in the ribs of the stereotypical berliner , while also showing that it is possible to do service with a smile .
" these cards are fantastic , they show we do n't always take ourselves too seriously and that we can laugh at ourselves , too , " said meng .
berlin is visited by more than eight million tourists annually , and is expecting an increase in tourism this year as it celebrates the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall .
it 's not the first time officials have been after locals to put a shine on the city 's image .
when germany hosted the soccer world cup in 2006 , berlin taxi drivers were offered extra training in english and courteous service as part of a national friendliness campaign .
and a multi-million-euro campaign launched last year under the motto " be berlin " encouraged locals to project a more positive image to foreigners and tourists .
as yet , there are no statistics to attest to whether or not such campaigns bring about lasting , real change .

but a new charm offensive launched by the berlin senate hopes to spread an aura of friendliness about the capital . grumpy , sarcastic , and none too shy about piping up with a flippant comeback - that 's the attitude known as the berlin " schnauze " or " snout " to use its literal english translation .
the berlin senate is hoping to counteract its residents ' innate churlishness by appointing 4,000 civil servants , including police officers , public transport workers , waiters and trade fair hostesses to be " good-mood ambassadors . "
they 'll receive red buttons singling them out as friendly sources of information for newcomers and visitors to the capital .
the goal is " to make the city a little more friendly , " said rene gurka of berlin partner , the company behind the campaign , which kicked off this week in conjunction with the start of the annual itb tourism trade fair . " a few years ago , we did a study that showed that non-germans considered berlin a place full of grumpy people , " senate spokesman richard meng told news agency afp .
" we need to show the world that this is n't true . "
confronting stereotypes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's police officers are being encouraged to lighten up a little as part of the campaign , which is expected to cost 200,000 euros -lrb- $ 255,000 -rrb- , civil servants will also hand out postcards printed with prime examples of berliners ' unique brand of sarcasm - and written in the local dialect , of course .
the phrases are meant to be a light-hearted poke in the ribs of the stereotypical berliner , while also showing that it is possible to do service with a smile .
" these cards are fantastic , they show we do n't always take ourselves too seriously and that we can laugh at ourselves , too , " said meng .
berlin is visited by more than eight million tourists annually , and is expecting an increase in tourism this year as it celebrates the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall .
it 's not the first time officials have been after locals to put a shine on the city 's image .
when germany hosted the soccer world cup in 2006 , berlin taxi drivers were offered extra training in english and courteous service as part of a national friendliness campaign .
and a multi-million-euro campaign launched last year under the motto " be berlin " encouraged locals to project a more positive image to foreigners and tourists .
as yet , there are no statistics to attest to whether or not such campaigns bring about lasting , real change .
but organizers such as gurka say there 's not really much changing to do : beneath their rough exterior , most berliners already are " service-oriented , hospitable and cosmopolitan people .

but a new charm offensive launched by the berlin senate hopes to spread an aura of friendliness about the capital . grumpy , sarcastic , and none too shy about piping up with a flippant comeback - that 's the attitude known as the berlin " schnauze " or " snout " to use its literal english translation .
the berlin senate is hoping to counteract its residents ' innate churlishness by appointing 4,000 civil servants , including police officers , public transport workers , waiters and trade fair hostesses to be " good-mood ambassadors . "
they 'll receive red buttons singling them out as friendly sources of information for newcomers and visitors to the capital .
the goal is " to make the city a little more friendly , " said rene gurka of berlin partner , the company behind the campaign , which kicked off this week in conjunction with the start of the annual itb tourism trade fair . " a few years ago , we did a study that showed that non-germans considered berlin a place full of grumpy people , " senate spokesman richard meng told news agency afp .
" we need to show the world that this is n't true . "
confronting stereotypes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's police officers are being encouraged to lighten up a little as part of the campaign , which is expected to cost 200,000 euros -lrb- $ 255,000 -rrb- , civil servants will also hand out postcards printed with prime examples of berliners ' unique brand of sarcasm - and written in the local dialect , of course .
the phrases are meant to be a light-hearted poke in the ribs of the stereotypical berliner , while also showing that it is possible to do service with a smile .
" these cards are fantastic , they show we do n't always take ourselves too seriously and that we can laugh at ourselves , too , " said meng .
berlin is visited by more than eight million tourists annually , and is expecting an increase in tourism this year as it celebrates the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall .
it 's not the first time officials have been after locals to put a shine on the city 's image .
when germany hosted the soccer world cup in 2006 , berlin taxi drivers were offered extra training in english and courteous service as part of a national friendliness campaign .
and a multi-million-euro campaign launched last year under the motto " be berlin " encouraged locals to project a more positive image to foreigners and tourists .
as yet , there are no statistics to attest to whether or not such campaigns bring about lasting , real change .
but organizers such as gurka say there 's not really much changing to do : beneath their rough exterior , most berliners already are " service-oriented , hospitable and cosmopolitan people .

benedict said the vatican failed to be " sufficiently clear " in explaining the reasons for lifting the excommunication of four bishops .
he said he was told after the crisis exploded that better use of the internet would have revealed some of the problems .
he added that he " draws the lesson " from the matter and that in the future the vatican must " pay more attention to this source of information , " news agency reuters reported .
in january , the pope lifted the excommunication of richard williamson and three other bishops .
williamson said in an interview broadcast several days earlier that he believed there were no gas chambers and that no more than 300,000 jews perished in nazi concentration camps , rather than the 6 million accepted by most historians .
the vatican said it was not aware of williamson 's views on the holocaust , but critics have pointed out that internet-based material written by williamson on the matter has existed for some time .
the vatican said the letter would be published thursday with copies available in english , italian , french , german , portuguese and spanish .
world anger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british-born cleric richard williamson has stirred anger worldwide williamson 's comments stirred anger in jewish communities throughout the world , as well as in catholic circles .
several european leaders , including german chancellor angela merkel , called on the germany-born pope to explain the vatican 's decision to waive the excommunications .
it is extremely rare in church history for a pope to explain his actions to his bishops after the fact and to acknowledge any error on his behalf .
the pope said that in the future the vatican body charged with negotiating with the sspx - the pontifical commission ecclesia dei - would work more closely with the congregation for the doctrine of the faith , the church 's watchdog on orthodoxy and disciplinary matters .
the views espoused by the sspx are controversial in catholic circles .
the group rejects modernization of the church through a set of reforms created under the second vatican council in the 1960s .
benedict , who took part in the council , said in his letter that sspx clerics would remain suspended from holding any official positions in the church until they fully subscribed to the reforms . dfm / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

both favor tighter regulation of financial markets instead of increased spending measures . the heads of france and germany came out against a call from the united states that they increase spending to counteract the global economic crisis .
instead they said more regulation of financial markets needed to be the focus of a g20 meeting next month . " we consider that in europe we have already invested a lot for the recovery , and that the problem is not about spending more , but putting in place a system of regulation so that the economic and financial catastrophe that the world is seeing does not reproduce itself , " sarkozy told reporters in berlin on thursday , march 12 . when g20 leaders meet april 2 in london , merkel said they should look to pledges made by european union members last month in the german capital to regulate all financial markets , crack down on tax havens and increase funding for the international monetary fund . merkel said economic rescue packages " can under no circumstances replace the necessary regulation " of the financial markets . us treasury secretary timothy geithner said wednesday that he wanted the g20 to make a " substantial , sustained commitment to stimulus " as a way of stemming the global economic downturn . britain veering from eu position ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is brown going to side with washington at the g20 meeting ?
his british counterpart , alistair darling , said he agreed with washington 's spending policy , setting the stage for an inter-european feud . merkel went above darling 's head on thursday saying that british prime minister gordon brown agreed with his european partners during meetings on the berlin plan .
she added that she was " very optimistic that the european position is unchanged . " merkel is scheduled to meet with brown in britain for talks on friday that are likely to address the issue of additional stimulus measures . meanwhile , to keep deficit spending in the eu in check , french and german finance ministers on thursday reiterated their support for the bloc 's stability and growth pact , which restricts public deficits to 3 percent of annual output . ministers from the two countries issued a joint statement saying they would pursue policies to strengthen public finances . eu must fight protectionism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel are back to seeing eye-to-eye merkel and sarkozy also used their meeting to launch joint industrial projects in the energy and automobile sectors .
the plans cover innovations in the renewable energy sector and research into new methods of propulsion for motor vehicles . the joint projects come after the two countries were at odds over sarkozy 's decision to provide financial support to the french car industry .
both leaders , however , agreed thursday that all eu members should eschew any protectionist measures while coming to the aid of national industries . in addition , sarkozy offered his condolences to the victims of a school shooting which left 16 dead in southern germany wednesday .

leaders said they would begin negotiations on information exchanges wtih germany tomorrow , and with britain next month .
" liechtenstein commits to and will implement the global standards of transparency and exchange of information as developed by the oecd , " read the statement , referring to the organization for economic cooperation and development .
lichtenstein would also " go beyond these standards in order to better meet the concerns and tax claims of other jurisdictions . "
it would however maintain its " modern and solid " banking secrecy laws .
the principality said it would be ready to negotiate with the eu and others on anti-fraud agreements and taxation deals .
such agreements would be modeled on a landmark deal reached with the united states in december , and which will come into force at the start of 2010 .
brushing up its image " with the new agreements , the partner state concerned will receive more efficient tax application with respect to foreign assts ; the clients of the liechtenstein financial center will receive a sustainable legal framework for meeting their tax obligations , " said prime-minister elect klaus tschuetscher .
the announcement represents a major step by the tiny principality to improve its image after it was among three countries put on an oecd blacklist of " non-cooperative " tax havens .
the others were andorra and monaco .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lgt bank was at the heart of german tax evasion scandal last year it comes a year after a major tax evasion scandal in germany put the spotlight on its secretive banking sector .
german investigators launched a major probe into clients of the lgt banking group , which is controlled by liechtenstein 's royal family .
lgt bank claimed that german tax inspectors were basing their investigation on a stolen list with the names of 1,400 clients - 600 of whom were german nationals .
caving to international pressure international pressure to clamp down on tax havens has been growing in recent weeks with a summit of the g20 group of economic powers in london on april 2 due to discuss the blacklist .
liechtenstein 's de facto head of state , prince alois , said there is a " fundamental and rapid change at the global level in the direction of stronger cross-border cooperation and international regulation . "

bucharest has already asked the european commission to save it from a possible financing crisis .
hungary and latvia have grabbed at lifelines from the imf . thomas mirow , the head of the european bank for reconstruction and development , explained the situation in various eastern european countries and how they can move forward . deutsche welle : romania has joined hungary and latvia in requesting emergency loans from the european union .
how serious is the economic situation in central and eastern europe ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : each country needs to determine its own ideal way through the crisis , mirow said thomas mirow : the situation is certainly difficult .
talks have not yet been concluded , but romania has long been seen as a country that has been at particular risk because of very high debts in foreign currencies .
its own currency has been under pressure for a long time , which makes the decision to look for help from the imf a logical step that will contribute to stabilizing the country . are you afraid of the problem spreading to other countries via the domino effect ? no , i am not .
the situation in other countries is completely different .
i am , however , of the opinion that it makes sense to get in touch with the imf in a timely manner .
international investors usually know to respect that .
when such contact is necessary , it makes more sense to do it early than to wait and , for example , have to accept longer phases of devaluation of one 's own currency . how can the situation be diffused ?
what 's the best way forward ? that 's not easy to say because the causes of the problems are different .
in some countries it 's just the financial sector that is suffering from a weak framework , vulnerable and susceptible to sudden crises .
other countries have a relatively robust financial sector , such as poland , and are affected more by developments in the real economy , like the development in western european auto industry . should the eu emergency funds be built up in the manner some politicians are calling for ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there appears to still be enough eu money to aid countries looking for help the european council of finance ministers debated that issue on tuesday .
first of all , i think it is important that the funds are available to the countries that want to make use of them .
should they be exhausted , then it would certainly be a good idea to have additional resources .
but there are apparently still enough resources available . do you think the current support for eastern europe is sufficient ? no , i think more could and should be done - each within its own area .
most of all , i think it is important that heads of state and government of the eu , possibly when they meet in a little over a week , as well as at the g20 meeting in london in april , make it absolutely clear they are determined to represent the countries of central and eastern europe . it sounds as though you expect action in addition to politicians ' words .
what action ? the resources of the eu that have been mentioned are one element .
a second element is that the imf , the world bank and we , as a bank that has been and continues to be active in eastern europe , give our encouragement and support to help these countries .
additional steps by the european central bank could also be a topic of discussion . is it a good idea to accelerate the adoption of the euro to provide added security ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro zone ca n't afford to weaken its entry criteria yes and no .
yes in the sense that the perspective of membership in the euro zone is a positive signal .
no in the sense that i do not believe the criteria for entry should be weakened , that would hurt confidence in the stability of the euro as a whole .
i think one would be well-advised to think about whether , for example , certain terms of time could be shortened .
but the hard criteria should remain . you have been talking about stability .
how big is the danger of a state in the region going bankrupt ? based on current evidence , this is not a danger . how did eastern europe get into this situation ?
many of the states reformed their financial systems according to the theories set out by western financial experts . eastern europe is , in terms of markets , every highly integrated .
it has , for example , opened its borders to western european banks , but it has not advanced as far in term of politics and its opening to the euro zone .
political integration is lagging behind market integration .
the second reason is that central and eastern europe , in real economic terms , are very dependent on certain key industries , such as the western european automobile industry .
since in addition to the financial crisis and the overall economic crisis we are also dealing with a structural crisis in the global auto industry , countries like hungary , the czech republic and slovakia are hard hit because they live from exports in general and especially from the auto industry . is there a feeling among eastern europeans that they are being neglected by their western neighbors ? i do not think that 's the case , at the moment .
but in western europe , i believe , we have a reason to watch the situation and not allow such development to occur .
it is a symbolic year that we are living in .
twenty years ago the berlin wall fell , and we all remember the contribution hungary made to that event .
we can not allow the impression you mentioned to arise . interview : andreas noll -lrb- sms -rrb- editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the group rejects modernization of the church through a set of reforms created under the second vatican council in the 1960s .
benedict , who took part in the council , said in his letter that sspx clerics would remain suspended from holding any official positions in the church until they fully subscribed to the reforms . dfm / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bucharest has already asked the european commission to save it from a possible financing crisis .
hungary and latvia have grabbed at lifelines from the imf . thomas mirow , the head of the european bank for reconstruction and development , explained the situation in various eastern european countries and how they can move forward . deutsche welle : romania has joined hungary and latvia in requesting emergency loans from the european union .
how serious is the economic situation in central and eastern europe ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : each country needs to determine its own ideal way through the crisis , mirow said thomas mirow : the situation is certainly difficult .
talks have not yet been concluded , but romania has long been seen as a country that has been at particular risk because of very high debts in foreign currencies .
its own currency has been under pressure for a long time , which makes the decision to look for help from the imf a logical step that will contribute to stabilizing the country . are you afraid of the problem spreading to other countries via the domino effect ? no , i am not .
the situation in other countries is completely different .
i am , however , of the opinion that it makes sense to get in touch with the imf in a timely manner .
international investors usually know to respect that .
when such contact is necessary , it makes more sense to do it early than to wait and , for example , have to accept longer phases of devaluation of one 's own currency . how can the situation be diffused ?
what 's the best way forward ? that 's not easy to say because the causes of the problems are different .
in some countries it 's just the financial sector that is suffering from a weak framework , vulnerable and susceptible to sudden crises .
other countries have a relatively robust financial sector , such as poland , and are affected more by developments in the real economy , like the development in western european auto industry . should the eu emergency funds be built up in the manner some politicians are calling for ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there appears to still be enough eu money to aid countries looking for help the european council of finance ministers debated that issue on tuesday .
first of all , i think it is important that the funds are available to the countries that want to make use of them .
should they be exhausted , then it would certainly be a good idea to have additional resources .
but there are apparently still enough resources available . do you think the current support for eastern europe is sufficient ? no , i think more could and should be done - each within its own area .
most of all , i think it is important that heads of state and government of the eu , possibly when they meet in a little over a week , as well as at the g20 meeting in london in april , make it absolutely clear they are determined to represent the countries of central and eastern europe . it sounds as though you expect action in addition to politicians ' words .
what action ? the resources of the eu that have been mentioned are one element .
a second element is that the imf , the world bank and we , as a bank that has been and continues to be active in eastern europe , give our encouragement and support to help these countries .
additional steps by the european central bank could also be a topic of discussion . is it a good idea to accelerate the adoption of the euro to provide added security ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro zone ca n't afford to weaken its entry criteria yes and no .
yes in the sense that the perspective of membership in the euro zone is a positive signal .
no in the sense that i do not believe the criteria for entry should be weakened , that would hurt confidence in the stability of the euro as a whole .
i think one would be well-advised to think about whether , for example , certain terms of time could be shortened .
but the hard criteria should remain . you have been talking about stability .
how big is the danger of a state in the region going bankrupt ? based on current evidence , this is not a danger . how did eastern europe get into this situation ?
many of the states reformed their financial systems according to the theories set out by western financial experts . eastern europe is , in terms of markets , every highly integrated .
it has , for example , opened its borders to western european banks , but it has not advanced as far in term of politics and its opening to the euro zone .
political integration is lagging behind market integration .
the second reason is that central and eastern europe , in real economic terms , are very dependent on certain key industries , such as the western european automobile industry .
since in addition to the financial crisis and the overall economic crisis we are also dealing with a structural crisis in the global auto industry , countries like hungary , the czech republic and slovakia are hard hit because they live from exports in general and especially from the auto industry . is there a feeling among eastern europeans that they are being neglected by their western neighbors ? i do not think that 's the case , at the moment .
but in western europe , i believe , we have a reason to watch the situation and not allow such development to occur .
it is a symbolic year that we are living in .
twenty years ago the berlin wall fell , and we all remember the contribution hungary made to that event .
we can not allow the impression you mentioned to arise . interview : andreas noll -lrb- sms -rrb- editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but a new charm offensive launched by the berlin senate hopes to spread an aura of friendliness about the capital . grumpy , sarcastic , and none too shy about piping up with a flippant comeback - that 's the attitude known as the berlin " schnauze " or " snout " to use its literal english translation .
the berlin senate is hoping to counteract its residents ' innate churlishness by appointing 4,000 civil servants , including police officers , public transport workers , waiters and trade fair hostesses to be " good-mood ambassadors . "
they 'll receive red buttons singling them out as friendly sources of information for newcomers and visitors to the capital .
the goal is " to make the city a little more friendly , " said rene gurka of berlin partner , the company behind the campaign , which kicked off this week in conjunction with the start of the annual itb tourism trade fair . " a few years ago , we did a study that showed that non-germans considered berlin a place full of grumpy people , " senate spokesman richard meng told news agency afp .
" we need to show the world that this is n't true . "
confronting stereotypes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's police officers are being encouraged to lighten up a little as part of the campaign , which is expected to cost 200,000 euros -lrb- $ 255,000 -rrb- , civil servants will also hand out postcards printed with prime examples of berliners ' unique brand of sarcasm - and written in the local dialect , of course .
the phrases are meant to be a light-hearted poke in the ribs of the stereotypical berliner , while also showing that it is possible to do service with a smile .
" these cards are fantastic , they show we do n't always take ourselves too seriously and that we can laugh at ourselves , too , " said meng .
berlin is visited by more than eight million tourists annually , and is expecting an increase in tourism this year as it celebrates the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall .
it 's not the first time officials have been after locals to put a shine on the city 's image .
when germany hosted the soccer world cup in 2006 , berlin taxi drivers were offered extra training in english and courteous service as part of a national friendliness campaign .
and a multi-million-euro campaign launched last year under the motto " be berlin " encouraged locals to project a more positive image to foreigners and tourists .
as yet , there are no statistics to attest to whether or not such campaigns bring about lasting , real change .
but organizers such as gurka say there 's not really much changing to do : beneath their rough exterior , most berliners already are " service-oriented , hospitable and cosmopolitan people .

but others called for measures to protect children to be put in place . a day after a deadly school shooting , german politicians said they would refrain from making any rash decisions on gun control or school safety .
the first thing to do was collect facts about the shooting which left 16 dead , including the teenaged gunman , politicians said .
the scene in front of the school in winnenden was pure emotion on thursday , march 12 .
students had tears streaming down their faces as they held each other , trying to come to terms with the horrible killings .
" i do n't know if i can stay at this school .
every time you enter , the memories come back , " student christin pluengel told reuters .
the 17-year-old gunman , identified as tim k. , fired 112 rounds , 60 in the school , and had 109 unused rounds with him when his body was found by police .
many of the victims were shot at close range with a 9 millimeter beretta pistol .
as police closed in , he eventually killed himself .
oversimplifying problem wo n't help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians will debate whether to tighten gun laws while there were general warnings against knee-jerk reactions , some politicians did call for measures to be taken to prevent such a shooting in the future . individual politicians and police groups pointed to metal detectors in school doorways , a ban on violent video games and stricter gun laws as potential ways to keep kids from falling victim to future violence . but such steps oversimplify a complex problem , according to joachim von gottberg , vice president of the children 's charity of germany . " whoever points denounces addiction to computer games or an infatuation with weapons as the cause for these kinds of terrible acts hinders the search for the complex problems and reasons that precede such crimes , " he said in berlin on thursday . laws ca n't prevent violence german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble said lawmakers are not able to completely protect against every possible threat . " absolute security does not exist , " he said in berlin , adding that germany needed to look at " what is going on in our society . " schaeuble , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union , said the country needed to concentrate on strengthening the role of the family and teaching moral values to children rather than calling for tighter restrictions on gun ownership . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blaming computer games is too easy an answer , von der leyen said " i ca n't see how a change in weapons rules would contribute anything to solving the problem , " schaeuble told reuters . calls for stricter gun control laws were issued after police said they suspected the gunman got the pistol he used in wednesday 's massacre from his parents ' bedroom . father could face charges his father , reportedly a member of a local shooting club , is said to own over a dozen guns , all locked away except the nine-millimeter beretta that caused the carnage .
german authorities said they are considering whether to press charges against his father . " everything here points to negligence on the part of the father as far as the storage of this weapon is concerned , " said police spokesman ralf michelfelder . germany tightened its gun control laws twice since a 2002 school shooting in the city of erfurt , but politicians said the restrictions could not have prevented wednesday 's events or a 2006 school shooting . preventative measures needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police said the teenager 's father could face charges sebastian edathy , an interior affairs expert for the social democratic party , agreed with schaeuble on the impossibility of absolute safety .
instead , he said , germany should consider preventative ways to deal with violence in schools . " here in germany we have significantly fewer school psychologists for students than in other european countries , " he told german television channel phoenix , adding that schools should consider adding trained mental-health workers to their staffs . leaders of the greens said wednesday 's tragic events should be analyzed by experts in order to uncover " hidden signals from students with problems . " " we need a culture that pay attention and recognizes problems , " party heads claudia roth and cem ozdemir said . german family minister ursula von der leyen made a similar statement , saying that most acts of violence are preceded by warnings . " we have to learn what the typical warning signs are , " she told the neue presse newspaper on thursday . sms / th / ap / dpa / afp / retuers send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bucharest has already asked the european commission to save it from a possible financing crisis .
hungary and latvia have grabbed at lifelines from the imf . thomas mirow , the head of the european bank for reconstruction and development , explained the situation in various eastern european countries and how they can move forward . deutsche welle : romania has joined hungary and latvia in requesting emergency loans from the european union .
how serious is the economic situation in central and eastern europe ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : each country needs to determine its own ideal way through the crisis , mirow said thomas mirow : the situation is certainly difficult .
talks have not yet been concluded , but romania has long been seen as a country that has been at particular risk because of very high debts in foreign currencies .
its own currency has been under pressure for a long time , which makes the decision to look for help from the imf a logical step that will contribute to stabilizing the country . are you afraid of the problem spreading to other countries via the domino effect ? no , i am not .
the situation in other countries is completely different .
i am , however , of the opinion that it makes sense to get in touch with the imf in a timely manner .
international investors usually know to respect that .
when such contact is necessary , it makes more sense to do it early than to wait and , for example , have to accept longer phases of devaluation of one 's own currency . how can the situation be diffused ?
what 's the best way forward ? that 's not easy to say because the causes of the problems are different .
in some countries it 's just the financial sector that is suffering from a weak framework , vulnerable and susceptible to sudden crises .
other countries have a relatively robust financial sector , such as poland , and are affected more by developments in the real economy , like the development in western european auto industry . should the eu emergency funds be built up in the manner some politicians are calling for ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there appears to still be enough eu money to aid countries looking for help the european council of finance ministers debated that issue on tuesday .
first of all , i think it is important that the funds are available to the countries that want to make use of them .
should they be exhausted , then it would certainly be a good idea to have additional resources .
but there are apparently still enough resources available . do you think the current support for eastern europe is sufficient ? no , i think more could and should be done - each within its own area .
most of all , i think it is important that heads of state and government of the eu , possibly when they meet in a little over a week , as well as at the g20 meeting in london in april , make it absolutely clear they are determined to represent the countries of central and eastern europe . it sounds as though you expect action in addition to politicians ' words .
what action ? the resources of the eu that have been mentioned are one element .
a second element is that the imf , the world bank and we , as a bank that has been and continues to be active in eastern europe , give our encouragement and support to help these countries .
additional steps by the european central bank could also be a topic of discussion . is it a good idea to accelerate the adoption of the euro to provide added security ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro zone ca n't afford to weaken its entry criteria yes and no .
yes in the sense that the perspective of membership in the euro zone is a positive signal .
no in the sense that i do not believe the criteria for entry should be weakened , that would hurt confidence in the stability of the euro as a whole .
i think one would be well-advised to think about whether , for example , certain terms of time could be shortened .
but the hard criteria should remain . you have been talking about stability .
how big is the danger of a state in the region going bankrupt ? based on current evidence , this is not a danger . how did eastern europe get into this situation ?
many of the states reformed their financial systems according to the theories set out by western financial experts . eastern europe is , in terms of markets , every highly integrated .
it has , for example , opened its borders to western european banks , but it has not advanced as far in term of politics and its opening to the euro zone .
political integration is lagging behind market integration .
the second reason is that central and eastern europe , in real economic terms , are very dependent on certain key industries , such as the western european automobile industry .
since in addition to the financial crisis and the overall economic crisis we are also dealing with a structural crisis in the global auto industry , countries like hungary , the czech republic and slovakia are hard hit because they live from exports in general and especially from the auto industry . is there a feeling among eastern europeans that they are being neglected by their western neighbors ? i do not think that 's the case , at the moment .
but in western europe , i believe , we have a reason to watch the situation and not allow such development to occur .
it is a symbolic year that we are living in .
twenty years ago the berlin wall fell , and we all remember the contribution hungary made to that event .
we can not allow the impression you mentioned to arise . interview : andreas noll -lrb- sms -rrb- editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

leaders said they would begin negotiations on information exchanges wtih germany tomorrow , and with britain next month .
" liechtenstein commits to and will implement the global standards of transparency and exchange of information as developed by the oecd , " read the statement , referring to the organization for economic cooperation and development .
lichtenstein would also " go beyond these standards in order to better meet the concerns and tax claims of other jurisdictions . "
it would however maintain its " modern and solid " banking secrecy laws .
the principality said it would be ready to negotiate with the eu and others on anti-fraud agreements and taxation deals .
such agreements would be modeled on a landmark deal reached with the united states in december , and which will come into force at the start of 2010 .
brushing up its image " with the new agreements , the partner state concerned will receive more efficient tax application with respect to foreign assts ; the clients of the liechtenstein financial center will receive a sustainable legal framework for meeting their tax obligations , " said prime-minister elect klaus tschuetscher .
the announcement represents a major step by the tiny principality to improve its image after it was among three countries put on an oecd blacklist of " non-cooperative " tax havens .
the others were andorra and monaco .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lgt bank was at the heart of german tax evasion scandal last year it comes a year after a major tax evasion scandal in germany put the spotlight on its secretive banking sector .

lgt bank claimed that german tax inspectors were basing their investigation on a stolen list with the names of 1,400 clients - 600 of whom were german nationals .
caving to international pressure international pressure to clamp down on tax havens has been growing in recent weeks with a summit of the g20 group of economic powers in london on april 2 due to discuss the blacklist .
liechtenstein 's de facto head of state , prince alois , said there is a " fundamental and rapid change at the global level in the direction of stronger cross-border cooperation and international regulation . "
" with today 's declaration , the liechtenstein government is sending a signal that it is participating actively in the regulatory dialogue of financial centers without giving up liechtenstein 's identity or the advantages of a reliable and well-regulated small state , " he said . dc / sp / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but a new charm offensive launched by the berlin senate hopes to spread an aura of friendliness about the capital . grumpy , sarcastic , and none too shy about piping up with a flippant comeback - that 's the attitude known as the berlin " schnauze " or " snout " to use its literal english translation .
the berlin senate is hoping to counteract its residents ' innate churlishness by appointing 4,000 civil servants , including police officers , public transport workers , waiters and trade fair hostesses to be " good-mood ambassadors . "
they 'll receive red buttons singling them out as friendly sources of information for newcomers and visitors to the capital .
the goal is " to make the city a little more friendly , " said rene gurka of berlin partner , the company behind the campaign , which kicked off this week in conjunction with the start of the annual itb tourism trade fair . " a few years ago , we did a study that showed that non-germans considered berlin a place full of grumpy people , " senate spokesman richard meng told news agency afp .
" we need to show the world that this is n't true . "
confronting stereotypes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's police officers are being encouraged to lighten up a little as part of the campaign , which is expected to cost 200,000 euros -lrb- $ 255,000 -rrb- , civil servants will also hand out postcards printed with prime examples of berliners ' unique brand of sarcasm - and written in the local dialect , of course .
the phrases are meant to be a light-hearted poke in the ribs of the stereotypical berliner , while also showing that it is possible to do service with a smile .
" these cards are fantastic , they show we do n't always take ourselves too seriously and that we can laugh at ourselves , too , " said meng .
berlin is visited by more than eight million tourists annually , and is expecting an increase in tourism this year as it celebrates the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall .
it 's not the first time officials have been after locals to put a shine on the city 's image .
when germany hosted the soccer world cup in 2006 , berlin taxi drivers were offered extra training in english and courteous service as part of a national friendliness campaign .
and a multi-million-euro campaign launched last year under the motto " be berlin " encouraged locals to project a more positive image to foreigners and tourists .
as yet , there are no statistics to attest to whether or not such campaigns bring about lasting , real change .
but organizers such as gurka say there 's not really much changing to do : beneath their rough exterior , most berliners already are " service-oriented , hospitable and cosmopolitan people .

but a new charm offensive launched by the berlin senate hopes to spread an aura of friendliness about the capital . grumpy , sarcastic , and none too shy about piping up with a flippant comeback - that 's the attitude known as the berlin " schnauze " or " snout " to use its literal english translation .
the berlin senate is hoping to counteract its residents ' innate churlishness by appointing 4,000 civil servants , including police officers , public transport workers , waiters and trade fair hostesses to be " good-mood ambassadors . "
they 'll receive red buttons singling them out as friendly sources of information for newcomers and visitors to the capital .
the goal is " to make the city a little more friendly , " said rene gurka of berlin partner , the company behind the campaign , which kicked off this week in conjunction with the start of the annual itb tourism trade fair . " a few years ago , we did a study that showed that non-germans considered berlin a place full of grumpy people , " senate spokesman richard meng told news agency afp .
" we need to show the world that this is n't true . "
confronting stereotypes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's police officers are being encouraged to lighten up a little as part of the campaign , which is expected to cost 200,000 euros -lrb- $ 255,000 -rrb- , civil servants will also hand out postcards printed with prime examples of berliners ' unique brand of sarcasm - and written in the local dialect , of course .
the phrases are meant to be a light-hearted poke in the ribs of the stereotypical berliner , while also showing that it is possible to do service with a smile .
" these cards are fantastic , they show we do n't always take ourselves too seriously and that we can laugh at ourselves , too , " said meng .
berlin is visited by more than eight million tourists annually , and is expecting an increase in tourism this year as it celebrates the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall .
it 's not the first time officials have been after locals to put a shine on the city 's image .
when germany hosted the soccer world cup in 2006 , berlin taxi drivers were offered extra training in english and courteous service as part of a national friendliness campaign .
and a multi-million-euro campaign launched last year under the motto " be berlin " encouraged locals to project a more positive image to foreigners and tourists .
as yet , there are no statistics to attest to whether or not such campaigns bring about lasting , real change .
but organizers such as gurka say there 's not really much changing to do : beneath their rough exterior , most berliners already are " service-oriented , hospitable and cosmopolitan people .

both favor tighter regulation of financial markets instead of increased spending measures . the heads of france and germany came out against a call from the united states that they increase spending to counteract the global economic crisis .
instead they said more regulation of financial markets needed to be the focus of a g20 meeting next month . " we consider that in europe we have already invested a lot for the recovery , and that the problem is not about spending more , but putting in place a system of regulation so that the economic and financial catastrophe that the world is seeing does not reproduce itself , " sarkozy told reporters in berlin on thursday , march 12 . when g20 leaders meet april 2 in london , merkel said they should look to pledges made by european union members last month in the german capital to regulate all financial markets , crack down on tax havens and increase funding for the international monetary fund . merkel said economic rescue packages " can under no circumstances replace the necessary regulation " of the financial markets . us treasury secretary timothy geithner said wednesday that he wanted the g20 to make a " substantial , sustained commitment to stimulus " as a way of stemming the global economic downturn . britain veering from eu position ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is brown going to side with washington at the g20 meeting ?
his british counterpart , alistair darling , said he agreed with washington 's spending policy , setting the stage for an inter-european feud . merkel went above darling 's head on thursday saying that british prime minister gordon brown agreed with his european partners during meetings on the berlin plan .
she added that she was " very optimistic that the european position is unchanged . " merkel is scheduled to meet with brown in britain for talks on friday that are likely to address the issue of additional stimulus measures . meanwhile , to keep deficit spending in the eu in check , french and german finance ministers on thursday reiterated their support for the bloc 's stability and growth pact , which restricts public deficits to 3 percent of annual output . ministers from the two countries issued a joint statement saying they would pursue policies to strengthen public finances . eu must fight protectionism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel are back to seeing eye-to-eye merkel and sarkozy also used their meeting to launch joint industrial projects in the energy and automobile sectors .
the plans cover innovations in the renewable energy sector and research into new methods of propulsion for motor vehicles . the joint projects come after the two countries were at odds over sarkozy 's decision to provide financial support to the french car industry .
both leaders , however , agreed thursday that all eu members should eschew any protectionist measures while coming to the aid of national industries . in addition , sarkozy offered his condolences to the victims of a school shooting which left 16 dead in southern germany wednesday . " france was overwhelmed , " by the attack , the french president said , adding that it could have happened " anywhere in the world .

benedict said the vatican failed to be " sufficiently clear " in explaining the reasons for lifting the excommunication of four bishops .
he said he was told after the crisis exploded that better use of the internet would have revealed some of the problems .
he added that he " draws the lesson " from the matter and that in the future the vatican must " pay more attention to this source of information , " news agency reuters reported .
in january , the pope lifted the excommunication of richard williamson and three other bishops .
williamson said in an interview broadcast several days earlier that he believed there were no gas chambers and that no more than 300,000 jews perished in nazi concentration camps , rather than the 6 million accepted by most historians .
the vatican said it was not aware of williamson 's views on the holocaust , but critics have pointed out that internet-based material written by williamson on the matter has existed for some time .
the vatican said the letter would be published thursday with copies available in english , italian , french , german , portuguese and spanish .
world anger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british-born cleric richard williamson has stirred anger worldwide williamson 's comments stirred anger in jewish communities throughout the world , as well as in catholic circles .
several european leaders , including german chancellor angela merkel , called on the germany-born pope to explain the vatican 's decision to waive the excommunications .
it is extremely rare in church history for a pope to explain his actions to his bishops after the fact and to acknowledge any error on his behalf .
the pope said that in the future the vatican body charged with negotiating with the sspx - the pontifical commission ecclesia dei - would work more closely with the congregation for the doctrine of the faith , the church 's watchdog on orthodoxy and disciplinary matters .
the views espoused by the sspx are controversial in catholic circles .
the group rejects modernization of the church through a set of reforms created under the second vatican council in the 1960s .
benedict , who took part in the council , said in his letter that sspx clerics would remain suspended from holding any official positions in the church until they fully subscribed to the reforms . dfm / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

both favor tighter regulation of financial markets instead of increased spending measures . the heads of france and germany came out against a call from the united states that they increase spending to counteract the global economic crisis .
instead they said more regulation of financial markets needed to be the focus of a g20 meeting next month . " we consider that in europe we have already invested a lot for the recovery , and that the problem is not about spending more , but putting in place a system of regulation so that the economic and financial catastrophe that the world is seeing does not reproduce itself , " sarkozy told reporters in berlin on thursday , march 12 . when g20 leaders meet april 2 in london , merkel said they should look to pledges made by european union members last month in the german capital to regulate all financial markets , crack down on tax havens and increase funding for the international monetary fund . merkel said economic rescue packages " can under no circumstances replace the necessary regulation " of the financial markets . us treasury secretary timothy geithner said wednesday that he wanted the g20 to make a " substantial , sustained commitment to stimulus " as a way of stemming the global economic downturn . britain veering from eu position ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is brown going to side with washington at the g20 meeting ?
his british counterpart , alistair darling , said he agreed with washington 's spending policy , setting the stage for an inter-european feud . merkel went above darling 's head on thursday saying that british prime minister gordon brown agreed with his european partners during meetings on the berlin plan .
she added that she was " very optimistic that the european position is unchanged . " merkel is scheduled to meet with brown in britain for talks on friday that are likely to address the issue of additional stimulus measures . meanwhile , to keep deficit spending in the eu in check , french and german finance ministers on thursday reiterated their support for the bloc 's stability and growth pact , which restricts public deficits to 3 percent of annual output . ministers from the two countries issued a joint statement saying they would pursue policies to strengthen public finances . eu must fight protectionism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel are back to seeing eye-to-eye merkel and sarkozy also used their meeting to launch joint industrial projects in the energy and automobile sectors .
the plans cover innovations in the renewable energy sector and research into new methods of propulsion for motor vehicles . the joint projects come after the two countries were at odds over sarkozy 's decision to provide financial support to the french car industry .
both leaders , however , agreed thursday that all eu members should eschew any protectionist measures while coming to the aid of national industries . in addition , sarkozy offered his condolences to the victims of a school shooting which left 16 dead in southern germany wednesday . " france was overwhelmed , " by the attack , the french president said , adding that it could have happened " anywhere in the world .

but a new charm offensive launched by the berlin senate hopes to spread an aura of friendliness about the capital . grumpy , sarcastic , and none too shy about piping up with a flippant comeback - that 's the attitude known as the berlin " schnauze " or " snout " to use its literal english translation .
the berlin senate is hoping to counteract its residents ' innate churlishness by appointing 4,000 civil servants , including police officers , public transport workers , waiters and trade fair hostesses to be " good-mood ambassadors . "
they 'll receive red buttons singling them out as friendly sources of information for newcomers and visitors to the capital .
the goal is " to make the city a little more friendly , " said rene gurka of berlin partner , the company behind the campaign , which kicked off this week in conjunction with the start of the annual itb tourism trade fair . " a few years ago , we did a study that showed that non-germans considered berlin a place full of grumpy people , " senate spokesman richard meng told news agency afp .
" we need to show the world that this is n't true . "
confronting stereotypes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's police officers are being encouraged to lighten up a little as part of the campaign , which is expected to cost 200,000 euros -lrb- $ 255,000 -rrb- , civil servants will also hand out postcards printed with prime examples of berliners ' unique brand of sarcasm - and written in the local dialect , of course .

" these cards are fantastic , they show we do n't always take ourselves too seriously and that we can laugh at ourselves , too , " said meng .
berlin is visited by more than eight million tourists annually , and is expecting an increase in tourism this year as it celebrates the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall .
it 's not the first time officials have been after locals to put a shine on the city 's image .
when germany hosted the soccer world cup in 2006 , berlin taxi drivers were offered extra training in english and courteous service as part of a national friendliness campaign .
and a multi-million-euro campaign launched last year under the motto " be berlin " encouraged locals to project a more positive image to foreigners and tourists .
as yet , there are no statistics to attest to whether or not such campaigns bring about lasting , real change .
but organizers such as gurka say there 's not really much changing to do : beneath their rough exterior , most berliners already are " service-oriented , hospitable and cosmopolitan people .

leaders said they would begin negotiations on information exchanges wtih germany tomorrow , and with britain next month .
" liechtenstein commits to and will implement the global standards of transparency and exchange of information as developed by the oecd , " read the statement , referring to the organization for economic cooperation and development .
lichtenstein would also " go beyond these standards in order to better meet the concerns and tax claims of other jurisdictions . "
it would however maintain its " modern and solid " banking secrecy laws .
the principality said it would be ready to negotiate with the eu and others on anti-fraud agreements and taxation deals .
such agreements would be modeled on a landmark deal reached with the united states in december , and which will come into force at the start of 2010 .
brushing up its image " with the new agreements , the partner state concerned will receive more efficient tax application with respect to foreign assts ; the clients of the liechtenstein financial center will receive a sustainable legal framework for meeting their tax obligations , " said prime-minister elect klaus tschuetscher .
the announcement represents a major step by the tiny principality to improve its image after it was among three countries put on an oecd blacklist of " non-cooperative " tax havens .
the others were andorra and monaco .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lgt bank was at the heart of german tax evasion scandal last year it comes a year after a major tax evasion scandal in germany put the spotlight on its secretive banking sector .
german investigators launched a major probe into clients of the lgt banking group , which is controlled by liechtenstein 's royal family .
lgt bank claimed that german tax inspectors were basing their investigation on a stolen list with the names of 1,400 clients - 600 of whom were german nationals .
caving to international pressure international pressure to clamp down on tax havens has been growing in recent weeks with a summit of the g20 group of economic powers in london on april 2 due to discuss the blacklist .
liechtenstein 's de facto head of state , prince alois , said there is a " fundamental and rapid change at the global level in the direction of stronger cross-border cooperation and international regulation . "
" with today 's declaration , the liechtenstein government is sending a signal that it is participating actively in the regulatory dialogue of financial centers without giving up liechtenstein 's identity or the advantages of a reliable and well-regulated small state , " he said . dc / sp / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but a new charm offensive launched by the berlin senate hopes to spread an aura of friendliness about the capital . grumpy , sarcastic , and none too shy about piping up with a flippant comeback - that 's the attitude known as the berlin " schnauze " or " snout " to use its literal english translation .
the berlin senate is hoping to counteract its residents ' innate churlishness by appointing 4,000 civil servants , including police officers , public transport workers , waiters and trade fair hostesses to be " good-mood ambassadors . "
they 'll receive red buttons singling them out as friendly sources of information for newcomers and visitors to the capital .
the goal is " to make the city a little more friendly , " said rene gurka of berlin partner , the company behind the campaign , which kicked off this week in conjunction with the start of the annual itb tourism trade fair . " a few years ago , we did a study that showed that non-germans considered berlin a place full of grumpy people , " senate spokesman richard meng told news agency afp .
" we need to show the world that this is n't true . "
confronting stereotypes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's police officers are being encouraged to lighten up a little as part of the campaign , which is expected to cost 200,000 euros -lrb- $ 255,000 -rrb- , civil servants will also hand out postcards printed with prime examples of berliners ' unique brand of sarcasm - and written in the local dialect , of course .
the phrases are meant to be a light-hearted poke in the ribs of the stereotypical berliner , while also showing that it is possible to do service with a smile .
" these cards are fantastic , they show we do n't always take ourselves too seriously and that we can laugh at ourselves , too , " said meng .
berlin is visited by more than eight million tourists annually , and is expecting an increase in tourism this year as it celebrates the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall .
it 's not the first time officials have been after locals to put a shine on the city 's image .
when germany hosted the soccer world cup in 2006 , berlin taxi drivers were offered extra training in english and courteous service as part of a national friendliness campaign .
and a multi-million-euro campaign launched last year under the motto " be berlin " encouraged locals to project a more positive image to foreigners and tourists .
as yet , there are no statistics to attest to whether or not such campaigns bring about lasting , real change .
but organizers such as gurka say there 's not really much changing to do : beneath their rough exterior , most berliners already are " service-oriented , hospitable and cosmopolitan people .

both favor tighter regulation of financial markets instead of increased spending measures . the heads of france and germany came out against a call from the united states that they increase spending to counteract the global economic crisis .
instead they said more regulation of financial markets needed to be the focus of a g20 meeting next month . " we consider that in europe we have already invested a lot for the recovery , and that the problem is not about spending more , but putting in place a system of regulation so that the economic and financial catastrophe that the world is seeing does not reproduce itself , " sarkozy told reporters in berlin on thursday , march 12 . when g20 leaders meet april 2 in london , merkel said they should look to pledges made by european union members last month in the german capital to regulate all financial markets , crack down on tax havens and increase funding for the international monetary fund . merkel said economic rescue packages " can under no circumstances replace the necessary regulation " of the financial markets . us treasury secretary timothy geithner said wednesday that he wanted the g20 to make a " substantial , sustained commitment to stimulus " as a way of stemming the global economic downturn . britain veering from eu position ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is brown going to side with washington at the g20 meeting ?
his british counterpart , alistair darling , said he agreed with washington 's spending policy , setting the stage for an inter-european feud . merkel went above darling 's head on thursday saying that british prime minister gordon brown agreed with his european partners during meetings on the berlin plan .
she added that she was " very optimistic that the european position is unchanged .

bucharest has already asked the european commission to save it from a possible financing crisis .
hungary and latvia have grabbed at lifelines from the imf . thomas mirow , the head of the european bank for reconstruction and development , explained the situation in various eastern european countries and how they can move forward . deutsche welle : romania has joined hungary and latvia in requesting emergency loans from the european union .
how serious is the economic situation in central and eastern europe ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : each country needs to determine its own ideal way through the crisis , mirow said thomas mirow : the situation is certainly difficult .
talks have not yet been concluded , but romania has long been seen as a country that has been at particular risk because of very high debts in foreign currencies .
its own currency has been under pressure for a long time , which makes the decision to look for help from the imf a logical step that will contribute to stabilizing the country . are you afraid of the problem spreading to other countries via the domino effect ? no , i am not .
the situation in other countries is completely different .
i am , however , of the opinion that it makes sense to get in touch with the imf in a timely manner .
international investors usually know to respect that .
when such contact is necessary , it makes more sense to do it early than to wait and , for example , have to accept longer phases of devaluation of one 's own currency . how can the situation be diffused ?
what 's the best way forward ? that 's not easy to say because the causes of the problems are different .
in some countries it 's just the financial sector that is suffering from a weak framework , vulnerable and susceptible to sudden crises .
other countries have a relatively robust financial sector , such as poland , and are affected more by developments in the real economy , like the development in western european auto industry . should the eu emergency funds be built up in the manner some politicians are calling for ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there appears to still be enough eu money to aid countries looking for help the european council of finance ministers debated that issue on tuesday .
first of all , i think it is important that the funds are available to the countries that want to make use of them .
should they be exhausted , then it would certainly be a good idea to have additional resources .
but there are apparently still enough resources available . do you think the current support for eastern europe is sufficient ? no , i think more could and should be done - each within its own area .
most of all , i think it is important that heads of state and government of the eu , possibly when they meet in a little over a week , as well as at the g20 meeting in london in april , make it absolutely clear they are determined to represent the countries of central and eastern europe . it sounds as though you expect action in addition to politicians ' words .
what action ? the resources of the eu that have been mentioned are one element .
a second element is that the imf , the world bank and we , as a bank that has been and continues to be active in eastern europe , give our encouragement and support to help these countries .
additional steps by the european central bank could also be a topic of discussion . is it a good idea to accelerate the adoption of the euro to provide added security ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro zone ca n't afford to weaken its entry criteria yes and no .
yes in the sense that the perspective of membership in the euro zone is a positive signal .
no in the sense that i do not believe the criteria for entry should be weakened , that would hurt confidence in the stability of the euro as a whole .
i think one would be well-advised to think about whether , for example , certain terms of time could be shortened .
but the hard criteria should remain . you have been talking about stability .
how big is the danger of a state in the region going bankrupt ? based on current evidence , this is not a danger . how did eastern europe get into this situation ?
many of the states reformed their financial systems according to the theories set out by western financial experts . eastern europe is , in terms of markets , every highly integrated .
it has , for example , opened its borders to western european banks , but it has not advanced as far in term of politics and its opening to the euro zone .
political integration is lagging behind market integration .
the second reason is that central and eastern europe , in real economic terms , are very dependent on certain key industries , such as the western european automobile industry .
since in addition to the financial crisis and the overall economic crisis we are also dealing with a structural crisis in the global auto industry , countries like hungary , the czech republic and slovakia are hard hit because they live from exports in general and especially from the auto industry . is there a feeling among eastern europeans that they are being neglected by their western neighbors ? i do not think that 's the case , at the moment .
but in western europe , i believe , we have a reason to watch the situation and not allow such development to occur .
it is a symbolic year that we are living in .
twenty years ago the berlin wall fell , and we all remember the contribution hungary made to that event .
we can not allow the impression you mentioned to arise . interview : andreas noll -lrb- sms -rrb- editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

leaders said they would begin negotiations on information exchanges wtih germany tomorrow , and with britain next month .
" liechtenstein commits to and will implement the global standards of transparency and exchange of information as developed by the oecd , " read the statement , referring to the organization for economic cooperation and development .
lichtenstein would also " go beyond these standards in order to better meet the concerns and tax claims of other jurisdictions . "
it would however maintain its " modern and solid " banking secrecy laws .
the principality said it would be ready to negotiate with the eu and others on anti-fraud agreements and taxation deals .
such agreements would be modeled on a landmark deal reached with the united states in december , and which will come into force at the start of 2010 .
brushing up its image " with the new agreements , the partner state concerned will receive more efficient tax application with respect to foreign assts ; the clients of the liechtenstein financial center will receive a sustainable legal framework for meeting their tax obligations , " said prime-minister elect klaus tschuetscher .
the announcement represents a major step by the tiny principality to improve its image after it was among three countries put on an oecd blacklist of " non-cooperative " tax havens .
the others were andorra and monaco .

lgt bank claimed that german tax inspectors were basing their investigation on a stolen list with the names of 1,400 clients - 600 of whom were german nationals .
caving to international pressure international pressure to clamp down on tax havens has been growing in recent weeks with a summit of the g20 group of economic powers in london on april 2 due to discuss the blacklist .
liechtenstein 's de facto head of state , prince alois , said there is a " fundamental and rapid change at the global level in the direction of stronger cross-border cooperation and international regulation . "

but a new charm offensive launched by the berlin senate hopes to spread an aura of friendliness about the capital . grumpy , sarcastic , and none too shy about piping up with a flippant comeback - that 's the attitude known as the berlin " schnauze " or " snout " to use its literal english translation .
the berlin senate is hoping to counteract its residents ' innate churlishness by appointing 4,000 civil servants , including police officers , public transport workers , waiters and trade fair hostesses to be " good-mood ambassadors . "
they 'll receive red buttons singling them out as friendly sources of information for newcomers and visitors to the capital .
the goal is " to make the city a little more friendly , " said rene gurka of berlin partner , the company behind the campaign , which kicked off this week in conjunction with the start of the annual itb tourism trade fair . " a few years ago , we did a study that showed that non-germans considered berlin a place full of grumpy people , " senate spokesman richard meng told news agency afp .
" we need to show the world that this is n't true . "
confronting stereotypes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's police officers are being encouraged to lighten up a little as part of the campaign , which is expected to cost 200,000 euros -lrb- $ 255,000 -rrb- , civil servants will also hand out postcards printed with prime examples of berliners ' unique brand of sarcasm - and written in the local dialect , of course .
the phrases are meant to be a light-hearted poke in the ribs of the stereotypical berliner , while also showing that it is possible to do service with a smile .
" these cards are fantastic , they show we do n't always take ourselves too seriously and that we can laugh at ourselves , too , " said meng .
berlin is visited by more than eight million tourists annually , and is expecting an increase in tourism this year as it celebrates the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall .
it 's not the first time officials have been after locals to put a shine on the city 's image .
when germany hosted the soccer world cup in 2006 , berlin taxi drivers were offered extra training in english and courteous service as part of a national friendliness campaign .
and a multi-million-euro campaign launched last year under the motto " be berlin " encouraged locals to project a more positive image to foreigners and tourists .
as yet , there are no statistics to attest to whether or not such campaigns bring about lasting , real change .
but organizers such as gurka say there 's not really much changing to do : beneath their rough exterior , most berliners already are " service-oriented , hospitable and cosmopolitan people .

bucharest has already asked the european commission to save it from a possible financing crisis .
hungary and latvia have grabbed at lifelines from the imf . thomas mirow , the head of the european bank for reconstruction and development , explained the situation in various eastern european countries and how they can move forward . deutsche welle : romania has joined hungary and latvia in requesting emergency loans from the european union .
how serious is the economic situation in central and eastern europe ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : each country needs to determine its own ideal way through the crisis , mirow said thomas mirow : the situation is certainly difficult .
talks have not yet been concluded , but romania has long been seen as a country that has been at particular risk because of very high debts in foreign currencies .
its own currency has been under pressure for a long time , which makes the decision to look for help from the imf a logical step that will contribute to stabilizing the country . are you afraid of the problem spreading to other countries via the domino effect ? no , i am not .
the situation in other countries is completely different .
i am , however , of the opinion that it makes sense to get in touch with the imf in a timely manner .
international investors usually know to respect that .
when such contact is necessary , it makes more sense to do it early than to wait and , for example , have to accept longer phases of devaluation of one 's own currency . how can the situation be diffused ?
what 's the best way forward ? that 's not easy to say because the causes of the problems are different .
in some countries it 's just the financial sector that is suffering from a weak framework , vulnerable and susceptible to sudden crises .
other countries have a relatively robust financial sector , such as poland , and are affected more by developments in the real economy , like the development in western european auto industry . should the eu emergency funds be built up in the manner some politicians are calling for ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there appears to still be enough eu money to aid countries looking for help the european council of finance ministers debated that issue on tuesday .
first of all , i think it is important that the funds are available to the countries that want to make use of them .
should they be exhausted , then it would certainly be a good idea to have additional resources .
but there are apparently still enough resources available . do you think the current support for eastern europe is sufficient ? no , i think more could and should be done - each within its own area .
most of all , i think it is important that heads of state and government of the eu , possibly when they meet in a little over a week , as well as at the g20 meeting in london in april , make it absolutely clear they are determined to represent the countries of central and eastern europe . it sounds as though you expect action in addition to politicians ' words .
what action ? the resources of the eu that have been mentioned are one element .
a second element is that the imf , the world bank and we , as a bank that has been and continues to be active in eastern europe , give our encouragement and support to help these countries .
additional steps by the european central bank could also be a topic of discussion . is it a good idea to accelerate the adoption of the euro to provide added security ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro zone ca n't afford to weaken its entry criteria yes and no .
yes in the sense that the perspective of membership in the euro zone is a positive signal .
no in the sense that i do not believe the criteria for entry should be weakened , that would hurt confidence in the stability of the euro as a whole .
i think one would be well-advised to think about whether , for example , certain terms of time could be shortened .
but the hard criteria should remain . you have been talking about stability .
how big is the danger of a state in the region going bankrupt ? based on current evidence , this is not a danger . how did eastern europe get into this situation ?
many of the states reformed their financial systems according to the theories set out by western financial experts . eastern europe is , in terms of markets , every highly integrated .
it has , for example , opened its borders to western european banks , but it has not advanced as far in term of politics and its opening to the euro zone .
political integration is lagging behind market integration .
the second reason is that central and eastern europe , in real economic terms , are very dependent on certain key industries , such as the western european automobile industry .
since in addition to the financial crisis and the overall economic crisis we are also dealing with a structural crisis in the global auto industry , countries like hungary , the czech republic and slovakia are hard hit because they live from exports in general and especially from the auto industry . is there a feeling among eastern europeans that they are being neglected by their western neighbors ? i do not think that 's the case , at the moment .
but in western europe , i believe , we have a reason to watch the situation and not allow such development to occur .
it is a symbolic year that we are living in .
twenty years ago the berlin wall fell , and we all remember the contribution hungary made to that event .

leaders said they would begin negotiations on information exchanges wtih germany tomorrow , and with britain next month .
" liechtenstein commits to and will implement the global standards of transparency and exchange of information as developed by the oecd , " read the statement , referring to the organization for economic cooperation and development .
lichtenstein would also " go beyond these standards in order to better meet the concerns and tax claims of other jurisdictions . "
it would however maintain its " modern and solid " banking secrecy laws .
the principality said it would be ready to negotiate with the eu and others on anti-fraud agreements and taxation deals .
such agreements would be modeled on a landmark deal reached with the united states in december , and which will come into force at the start of 2010 .
brushing up its image " with the new agreements , the partner state concerned will receive more efficient tax application with respect to foreign assts ; the clients of the liechtenstein financial center will receive a sustainable legal framework for meeting their tax obligations , " said prime-minister elect klaus tschuetscher .
the announcement represents a major step by the tiny principality to improve its image after it was among three countries put on an oecd blacklist of " non-cooperative " tax havens .
the others were andorra and monaco .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lgt bank was at the heart of german tax evasion scandal last year it comes a year after a major tax evasion scandal in germany put the spotlight on its secretive banking sector .
german investigators launched a major probe into clients of the lgt banking group , which is controlled by liechtenstein 's royal family .
lgt bank claimed that german tax inspectors were basing their investigation on a stolen list with the names of 1,400 clients - 600 of whom were german nationals .
caving to international pressure international pressure to clamp down on tax havens has been growing in recent weeks with a summit of the g20 group of economic powers in london on april 2 due to discuss the blacklist .
liechtenstein 's de facto head of state , prince alois , said there is a " fundamental and rapid change at the global level in the direction of stronger cross-border cooperation and international regulation . "
" with today 's declaration , the liechtenstein government is sending a signal that it is participating actively in the regulatory dialogue of financial centers without giving up liechtenstein 's identity or the advantages of a reliable and well-regulated small state , " he said . dc / sp / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but a new charm offensive launched by the berlin senate hopes to spread an aura of friendliness about the capital . grumpy , sarcastic , and none too shy about piping up with a flippant comeback - that 's the attitude known as the berlin " schnauze " or " snout " to use its literal english translation .
the berlin senate is hoping to counteract its residents ' innate churlishness by appointing 4,000 civil servants , including police officers , public transport workers , waiters and trade fair hostesses to be " good-mood ambassadors . "
they 'll receive red buttons singling them out as friendly sources of information for newcomers and visitors to the capital .
the goal is " to make the city a little more friendly , " said rene gurka of berlin partner , the company behind the campaign , which kicked off this week in conjunction with the start of the annual itb tourism trade fair . " a few years ago , we did a study that showed that non-germans considered berlin a place full of grumpy people , " senate spokesman richard meng told news agency afp .
" we need to show the world that this is n't true . "
confronting stereotypes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's police officers are being encouraged to lighten up a little as part of the campaign , which is expected to cost 200,000 euros -lrb- $ 255,000 -rrb- , civil servants will also hand out postcards printed with prime examples of berliners ' unique brand of sarcasm - and written in the local dialect , of course .
the phrases are meant to be a light-hearted poke in the ribs of the stereotypical berliner , while also showing that it is possible to do service with a smile .
" these cards are fantastic , they show we do n't always take ourselves too seriously and that we can laugh at ourselves , too , " said meng .
berlin is visited by more than eight million tourists annually , and is expecting an increase in tourism this year as it celebrates the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall .
it 's not the first time officials have been after locals to put a shine on the city 's image .
when germany hosted the soccer world cup in 2006 , berlin taxi drivers were offered extra training in english and courteous service as part of a national friendliness campaign .
and a multi-million-euro campaign launched last year under the motto " be berlin " encouraged locals to project a more positive image to foreigners and tourists .
as yet , there are no statistics to attest to whether or not such campaigns bring about lasting , real change .
but organizers such as gurka say there 's not really much changing to do : beneath their rough exterior , most berliners already are " service-oriented , hospitable and cosmopolitan people .

" i 'm serious … i have weapons here and tomorrow morning i am going to go to my old school and really fry them .
keep the name winnenden in mind , " the teenager wrote . the teenager went on a rampage in his former secondary school in the small town of winnenden in the state of baden-wuerttemberg in southwestern germany on wednesday morning , shooting nine students between the ages of 15 and 16 , as well as three teachers .
three bystanders were also killed as the gunman attempted to flee police . tim k. was pursued by hundreds of armed police officers and snipers , assisted by helicopters and dogs .
less than three hours after his rampage began , he turned his weapon on himself after being injured in an exchange of fire with police . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police commandos leave the albertville school on wednesday german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble ordered flags across the country to be flown at half mast on thursday . a first memorial service was held on wednesday evening in a church in the town of 27,000 people .
mourners lit candles at the altar , and created a makeshift memorial of candles and flowers outside the albertville school , where the shooting spree occurred .
psychologists advise long-term care the albertville secondary school has been closed until further notice , and at least one psychologist has advised that it should remain closed permanently , as students would otherwise be forced to relive the trauma .
a team of psychologists and spiritual advisors are in winnenden to care for the victims ' family members , the students and their teachers .
according to spiritual advisor ralf radix , the community will need long-term care if they are to come to terms with wednesday 's tragic events .
" each person affected needs something different , " he told germany 's protestant church press service , epd .
" one person might need some peace and quiet , which we then have to create in the midst of all this hectic activity , and someone else might need a partner to talk to . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel offered her sympathy to the family members of the victims in her initial comments on the shooting , a visibly shaken chancellor angela merkel on wednesday described the crime as " incomprehensible . "
" it is a day of mourning for the whole of germany , " she said .
" our thoughts go out to the families and the friends .
we are thinking of you and we are praying for you . "
politicians call for action in the meantime , politicians have begun to voice their opinions on ways to better protect germany 's students and prevent such massacres from happening in the future .
the head of the parliamentary interior committee , sebastian edathy -lrb- spd -rrb- said he thought the case could be made to install metal detectors at select schools .
while such measures have become commonplace at schools in the united states in the wake of the columbine school shooting in 1999 , germany has so far resisted tougher security systems in its schools .
bavarian interior minister , joachim herrmann -lrb- csu -rrb- , has also spoken out in favor of a ban on violent computer games after it emerged that tim k. had killer games such as counterstrike on his computer at home .
criminologist hans-dieter schwind said the government must act to tighten germany 's gun laws .
tim k. got the pistol he used in wednesday 's massacre from his parents ' bedroom .
his father , reportedly a member of a local shooting club , is said to own over a dozen guns , all locked away except the nine-millimeter beretta that caused the carnage .
other experts , including psychologists , say it 's up to school officials to become more sensitive to the early warning signals sent out by troubled youths such as tim k. , who reportedly was an outsider at the albertville school with few friends .
" one alarm signal is when young people strongly isolate themselves from their environment and spend hours each day in front of their computers , " said joerg fegert , psychiatrist at the university clinic for child and youth psychology in ulm . he noted that gunmen like tim k. often hint at their plans in online diaries or chatrooms , but that parents and teachers often remain oblivious , or react too late . dc / sp / dpa / epd send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

first , let me extend my deepest sympathy to all the families of those killed .
i thought germany already had very strict gun laws , stricter than the us .
why did this young man 's father have a gun in the first place ?
all countries need stricter gun laws .
but , will this really stop tragedies like this from happening .
unfortunately , man-made laws do not change a persons heart and therefore , can not stop this completely from happening . - elizabeth hughes , us in reference to such incidents as recent school shootings in germany this question itself completely misses the mark .
it wrongly implies that -lrb- legal -rrb- weapon sales are to be questioned as a " cause " of this behavior .
germany presently has some of the strictest gun control laws in the world with respect to sales and ownership , yet such incidents still occur .
ironically , this may , at least partially , be a legitimate cause .
we also see in the us these shootings most often happening in so-called " gun free zones . "
strict gun control is a double-edged sword .
the only gun use it ever succeeds in reducing is legal legitimate non-threatening gun use by the law abiding while simultaneously raising the black market for illegal guns and also raising the status of these illegal guns in the eyes of the embittered and disenfranchised who sometimes lash out in an environment where they know their tirade will have maximum effect , in a totally unarmed group of people . - gerald morris , canada bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the total death toll rose to 16 it seems to me this mass murder was a " copy cat " of the american high schools that have had similar catastrophes .
in the american killing they found out the use of marijuana in the killers was an important issue , and possible cause .
there are now many new articles associating the use of marijuana -lrb- and hashish -rrb- to becoming psychotic .
many new publications have been appearing .
it would be interesting to have data on the autopsy of this killer and find out if there are marijuana chemicals in his brain -lrb- they stay for several months -rrb- . - jose carranza , us there is shocking news coming from germany today .
i hope that it will push german regulators towards more strict rules concerning possession of weapons for private use . - wojtek , poland i hope that gun laws in germany are not as bad as in finland and the united states of america .
the last major shooting incident in australia that occurred in tasmania back in 1996 made the australian federal government tighten gun laws - surprisingly by former prime minister john howard .
i believe this fellow in germany -lrb- the gunman in question -rrb- committed suicide after what he had done .
he must have had a guilt complex .
my advice is to tighten gun law like what happened in australia last time in 1996 . - stuart john pearson , australia your entire article on the school shootings does not include one reference about the parents , except that the gun may have come from the father 's collection .
you state what everyone else thinks society should do .
have you totally absolved the parents from responsibility ?
perhaps his problem was at home not at the school .
give a little more balance to your reporting . - barbara dreher , us just check the baggage of all german students ! - kathe herberg , brazil i was shocked to read of the terrible news of the albertville school shooting in winnenden , germany .

first , let me extend my deepest sympathy to all the families of those killed .
i thought germany already had very strict gun laws , stricter than the us .
why did this young man 's father have a gun in the first place ?
all countries need stricter gun laws .
but , will this really stop tragedies like this from happening .
unfortunately , man-made laws do not change a persons heart and therefore , can not stop this completely from happening . - elizabeth hughes , us in reference to such incidents as recent school shootings in germany this question itself completely misses the mark .
it wrongly implies that -lrb- legal -rrb- weapon sales are to be questioned as a " cause " of this behavior .
germany presently has some of the strictest gun control laws in the world with respect to sales and ownership , yet such incidents still occur .
ironically , this may , at least partially , be a legitimate cause .
we also see in the us these shootings most often happening in so-called " gun free zones . "
strict gun control is a double-edged sword .
the only gun use it ever succeeds in reducing is legal legitimate non-threatening gun use by the law abiding while simultaneously raising the black market for illegal guns and also raising the status of these illegal guns in the eyes of the embittered and disenfranchised who sometimes lash out in an environment where they know their tirade will have maximum effect , in a totally unarmed group of people . - gerald morris , canada bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the total death toll rose to 16 it seems to me this mass murder was a " copy cat " of the american high schools that have had similar catastrophes .
in the american killing they found out the use of marijuana in the killers was an important issue , and possible cause .
there are now many new articles associating the use of marijuana -lrb- and hashish -rrb- to becoming psychotic .
many new publications have been appearing .
it would be interesting to have data on the autopsy of this killer and find out if there are marijuana chemicals in his brain -lrb- they stay for several months -rrb- . - jose carranza , us there is shocking news coming from germany today .
i hope that it will push german regulators towards more strict rules concerning possession of weapons for private use . - wojtek , poland i hope that gun laws in germany are not as bad as in finland and the united states of america .
the last major shooting incident in australia that occurred in tasmania back in 1996 made the australian federal government tighten gun laws - surprisingly by former prime minister john howard .
i believe this fellow in germany -lrb- the gunman in question -rrb- committed suicide after what he had done .
he must have had a guilt complex .
my advice is to tighten gun law like what happened in australia last time in 1996 . - stuart john pearson , australia your entire article on the school shootings does not include one reference about the parents , except that the gun may have come from the father 's collection .
you state what everyone else thinks society should do .
have you totally absolved the parents from responsibility ?
perhaps his problem was at home not at the school .
give a little more balance to your reporting . - barbara dreher , us just check the baggage of all german students ! - kathe herberg , brazil i was shocked to read of the terrible news of the albertville school shooting in winnenden , germany .

benedict said the vatican failed to be " sufficiently clear " in explaining the reasons for lifting the excommunication of four bishops .
he said he was told after the crisis exploded that better use of the internet would have revealed some of the problems .
he added that he " draws the lesson " from the matter and that in the future the vatican must " pay more attention to this source of information , " news agency reuters reported .
in january , the pope lifted the excommunication of richard williamson and three other bishops .
williamson said in an interview broadcast several days earlier that he believed there were no gas chambers and that no more than 300,000 jews perished in nazi concentration camps , rather than the 6 million accepted by most historians .
the vatican said it was not aware of williamson 's views on the holocaust , but critics have pointed out that internet-based material written by williamson on the matter has existed for some time .

several european leaders , including german chancellor angela merkel , called on the germany-born pope to explain the vatican 's decision to waive the excommunications .
it is extremely rare in church history for a pope to explain his actions to his bishops after the fact and to acknowledge any error on his behalf .
the pope said that in the future the vatican body charged with negotiating with the sspx - the pontifical commission ecclesia dei - would work more closely with the congregation for the doctrine of the faith , the church 's watchdog on orthodoxy and disciplinary matters .
the views espoused by the sspx are controversial in catholic circles .
the group rejects modernization of the church through a set of reforms created under the second vatican council in the 1960s .
benedict , who took part in the council , said in his letter that sspx clerics would remain suspended from holding any official positions in the church until they fully subscribed to the reforms . dfm / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de cities -pipe- 12.03.2009 berlin launches charm offensive großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin wants to welcome visitors with a smile people heading to berlin are often warned to brace themselves for the locals ' rather abrasive demeanor .
but a new charm offensive launched by the berlin senate hopes to spread an aura of friendliness about the capital . grumpy , sarcastic , and none too shy about piping up with a flippant comeback - that 's the attitude known as the berlin " schnauze " or " snout " to use its literal english translation .
the berlin senate is hoping to counteract its residents ' innate churlishness by appointing 4,000 civil servants , including police officers , public transport workers , waiters and trade fair hostesses to be " good-mood ambassadors . "
they 'll receive red buttons singling them out as friendly sources of information for newcomers and visitors to the capital .
the goal is " to make the city a little more friendly , " said rene gurka of berlin partner , the company behind the campaign , which kicked off this week in conjunction with the start of the annual itb tourism trade fair . " a few years ago , we did a study that showed that non-germans considered berlin a place full of grumpy people , " senate spokesman richard meng told news agency afp .
" we need to show the world that this is n't true . "
confronting stereotypes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's police officers are being encouraged to lighten up a little as part of the campaign , which is expected to cost 200,000 euros -lrb- $ 255,000 -rrb- , civil servants will also hand out postcards printed with prime examples of berliners ' unique brand of sarcasm - and written in the local dialect , of course .
the phrases are meant to be a light-hearted poke in the ribs of the stereotypical berliner , while also showing that it is possible to do service with a smile .
" these cards are fantastic , they show we do n't always take ourselves too seriously and that we can laugh at ourselves , too , " said meng .
berlin is visited by more than eight million tourists annually , and is expecting an increase in tourism this year as it celebrates the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall .
it 's not the first time officials have been after locals to put a shine on the city 's image .
when germany hosted the soccer world cup in 2006 , berlin taxi drivers were offered extra training in english and courteous service as part of a national friendliness campaign .
and a multi-million-euro campaign launched last year under the motto " be berlin " encouraged locals to project a more positive image to foreigners and tourists .
as yet , there are no statistics to attest to whether or not such campaigns bring about lasting , real change .
but organizers such as gurka say there 's not really much changing to do : beneath their rough exterior , most berliners already are " service-oriented , hospitable and cosmopolitan people .

bucharest has already asked the european commission to save it from a possible financing crisis .
hungary and latvia have grabbed at lifelines from the imf . thomas mirow , the head of the european bank for reconstruction and development , explained the situation in various eastern european countries and how they can move forward . deutsche welle : romania has joined hungary and latvia in requesting emergency loans from the european union .
how serious is the economic situation in central and eastern europe ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : each country needs to determine its own ideal way through the crisis , mirow said thomas mirow : the situation is certainly difficult .
talks have not yet been concluded , but romania has long been seen as a country that has been at particular risk because of very high debts in foreign currencies .
its own currency has been under pressure for a long time , which makes the decision to look for help from the imf a logical step that will contribute to stabilizing the country . are you afraid of the problem spreading to other countries via the domino effect ? no , i am not .
the situation in other countries is completely different .
i am , however , of the opinion that it makes sense to get in touch with the imf in a timely manner .
international investors usually know to respect that .
when such contact is necessary , it makes more sense to do it early than to wait and , for example , have to accept longer phases of devaluation of one 's own currency . how can the situation be diffused ?
what 's the best way forward ? that 's not easy to say because the causes of the problems are different .
in some countries it 's just the financial sector that is suffering from a weak framework , vulnerable and susceptible to sudden crises .
other countries have a relatively robust financial sector , such as poland , and are affected more by developments in the real economy , like the development in western european auto industry . should the eu emergency funds be built up in the manner some politicians are calling for ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there appears to still be enough eu money to aid countries looking for help the european council of finance ministers debated that issue on tuesday .
first of all , i think it is important that the funds are available to the countries that want to make use of them .
should they be exhausted , then it would certainly be a good idea to have additional resources .
but there are apparently still enough resources available . do you think the current support for eastern europe is sufficient ? no , i think more could and should be done - each within its own area .
most of all , i think it is important that heads of state and government of the eu , possibly when they meet in a little over a week , as well as at the g20 meeting in london in april , make it absolutely clear they are determined to represent the countries of central and eastern europe . it sounds as though you expect action in addition to politicians ' words .
what action ? the resources of the eu that have been mentioned are one element .
a second element is that the imf , the world bank and we , as a bank that has been and continues to be active in eastern europe , give our encouragement and support to help these countries .
additional steps by the european central bank could also be a topic of discussion . is it a good idea to accelerate the adoption of the euro to provide added security ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro zone ca n't afford to weaken its entry criteria yes and no .
yes in the sense that the perspective of membership in the euro zone is a positive signal .
no in the sense that i do not believe the criteria for entry should be weakened , that would hurt confidence in the stability of the euro as a whole .
i think one would be well-advised to think about whether , for example , certain terms of time could be shortened .
but the hard criteria should remain . you have been talking about stability .
how big is the danger of a state in the region going bankrupt ? based on current evidence , this is not a danger . how did eastern europe get into this situation ?
many of the states reformed their financial systems according to the theories set out by western financial experts . eastern europe is , in terms of markets , every highly integrated .
it has , for example , opened its borders to western european banks , but it has not advanced as far in term of politics and its opening to the euro zone .
political integration is lagging behind market integration .
the second reason is that central and eastern europe , in real economic terms , are very dependent on certain key industries , such as the western european automobile industry .
since in addition to the financial crisis and the overall economic crisis we are also dealing with a structural crisis in the global auto industry , countries like hungary , the czech republic and slovakia are hard hit because they live from exports in general and especially from the auto industry . is there a feeling among eastern europeans that they are being neglected by their western neighbors ? i do not think that 's the case , at the moment .
but in western europe , i believe , we have a reason to watch the situation and not allow such development to occur .
it is a symbolic year that we are living in .
twenty years ago the berlin wall fell , and we all remember the contribution hungary made to that event .
we can not allow the impression you mentioned to arise . interview : andreas noll -lrb- sms -rrb- editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

both favor tighter regulation of financial markets instead of increased spending measures . the heads of france and germany came out against a call from the united states that they increase spending to counteract the global economic crisis .
instead they said more regulation of financial markets needed to be the focus of a g20 meeting next month . " we consider that in europe we have already invested a lot for the recovery , and that the problem is not about spending more , but putting in place a system of regulation so that the economic and financial catastrophe that the world is seeing does not reproduce itself , " sarkozy told reporters in berlin on thursday , march 12 . when g20 leaders meet april 2 in london , merkel said they should look to pledges made by european union members last month in the german capital to regulate all financial markets , crack down on tax havens and increase funding for the international monetary fund . merkel said economic rescue packages " can under no circumstances replace the necessary regulation " of the financial markets . us treasury secretary timothy geithner said wednesday that he wanted the g20 to make a " substantial , sustained commitment to stimulus " as a way of stemming the global economic downturn . britain veering from eu position ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is brown going to side with washington at the g20 meeting ?
his british counterpart , alistair darling , said he agreed with washington 's spending policy , setting the stage for an inter-european feud . merkel went above darling 's head on thursday saying that british prime minister gordon brown agreed with his european partners during meetings on the berlin plan .
she added that she was " very optimistic that the european position is unchanged . " merkel is scheduled to meet with brown in britain for talks on friday that are likely to address the issue of additional stimulus measures . meanwhile , to keep deficit spending in the eu in check , french and german finance ministers on thursday reiterated their support for the bloc 's stability and growth pact , which restricts public deficits to 3 percent of annual output . ministers from the two countries issued a joint statement saying they would pursue policies to strengthen public finances . eu must fight protectionism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel are back to seeing eye-to-eye merkel and sarkozy also used their meeting to launch joint industrial projects in the energy and automobile sectors .
the plans cover innovations in the renewable energy sector and research into new methods of propulsion for motor vehicles . the joint projects come after the two countries were at odds over sarkozy 's decision to provide financial support to the french car industry .
both leaders , however , agreed thursday that all eu members should eschew any protectionist measures while coming to the aid of national industries . in addition , sarkozy offered his condolences to the victims of a school shooting which left 16 dead in southern germany wednesday .

leaders said they would begin negotiations on information exchanges wtih germany tomorrow , and with britain next month .
" liechtenstein commits to and will implement the global standards of transparency and exchange of information as developed by the oecd , " read the statement , referring to the organization for economic cooperation and development .
lichtenstein would also " go beyond these standards in order to better meet the concerns and tax claims of other jurisdictions . "
it would however maintain its " modern and solid " banking secrecy laws .
the principality said it would be ready to negotiate with the eu and others on anti-fraud agreements and taxation deals .
such agreements would be modeled on a landmark deal reached with the united states in december , and which will come into force at the start of 2010 .
brushing up its image " with the new agreements , the partner state concerned will receive more efficient tax application with respect to foreign assts ; the clients of the liechtenstein financial center will receive a sustainable legal framework for meeting their tax obligations , " said prime-minister elect klaus tschuetscher .
the announcement represents a major step by the tiny principality to improve its image after it was among three countries put on an oecd blacklist of " non-cooperative " tax havens .
the others were andorra and monaco .

lgt bank claimed that german tax inspectors were basing their investigation on a stolen list with the names of 1,400 clients - 600 of whom were german nationals .
caving to international pressure international pressure to clamp down on tax havens has been growing in recent weeks with a summit of the g20 group of economic powers in london on april 2 due to discuss the blacklist .
liechtenstein 's de facto head of state , prince alois , said there is a " fundamental and rapid change at the global level in the direction of stronger cross-border cooperation and international regulation . "

but a new charm offensive launched by the berlin senate hopes to spread an aura of friendliness about the capital . grumpy , sarcastic , and none too shy about piping up with a flippant comeback - that 's the attitude known as the berlin " schnauze " or " snout " to use its literal english translation .
the berlin senate is hoping to counteract its residents ' innate churlishness by appointing 4,000 civil servants , including police officers , public transport workers , waiters and trade fair hostesses to be " good-mood ambassadors . "
they 'll receive red buttons singling them out as friendly sources of information for newcomers and visitors to the capital .
the goal is " to make the city a little more friendly , " said rene gurka of berlin partner , the company behind the campaign , which kicked off this week in conjunction with the start of the annual itb tourism trade fair . " a few years ago , we did a study that showed that non-germans considered berlin a place full of grumpy people , " senate spokesman richard meng told news agency afp .
" we need to show the world that this is n't true . "
confronting stereotypes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's police officers are being encouraged to lighten up a little as part of the campaign , which is expected to cost 200,000 euros -lrb- $ 255,000 -rrb- , civil servants will also hand out postcards printed with prime examples of berliners ' unique brand of sarcasm - and written in the local dialect , of course .
the phrases are meant to be a light-hearted poke in the ribs of the stereotypical berliner , while also showing that it is possible to do service with a smile .
" these cards are fantastic , they show we do n't always take ourselves too seriously and that we can laugh at ourselves , too , " said meng .
berlin is visited by more than eight million tourists annually , and is expecting an increase in tourism this year as it celebrates the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall .
it 's not the first time officials have been after locals to put a shine on the city 's image .
when germany hosted the soccer world cup in 2006 , berlin taxi drivers were offered extra training in english and courteous service as part of a national friendliness campaign .
and a multi-million-euro campaign launched last year under the motto " be berlin " encouraged locals to project a more positive image to foreigners and tourists .
as yet , there are no statistics to attest to whether or not such campaigns bring about lasting , real change .
but organizers such as gurka say there 's not really much changing to do : beneath their rough exterior , most berliners already are " service-oriented , hospitable and cosmopolitan people .

benedict said the vatican failed to be " sufficiently clear " in explaining the reasons for lifting the excommunication of four bishops .
he said he was told after the crisis exploded that better use of the internet would have revealed some of the problems .
he added that he " draws the lesson " from the matter and that in the future the vatican must " pay more attention to this source of information , " news agency reuters reported .
in january , the pope lifted the excommunication of richard williamson and three other bishops .
williamson said in an interview broadcast several days earlier that he believed there were no gas chambers and that no more than 300,000 jews perished in nazi concentration camps , rather than the 6 million accepted by most historians .
the vatican said it was not aware of williamson 's views on the holocaust , but critics have pointed out that internet-based material written by williamson on the matter has existed for some time .
the vatican said the letter would be published thursday with copies available in english , italian , french , german , portuguese and spanish .
world anger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british-born cleric richard williamson has stirred anger worldwide williamson 's comments stirred anger in jewish communities throughout the world , as well as in catholic circles .
several european leaders , including german chancellor angela merkel , called on the germany-born pope to explain the vatican 's decision to waive the excommunications .
it is extremely rare in church history for a pope to explain his actions to his bishops after the fact and to acknowledge any error on his behalf .
the pope said that in the future the vatican body charged with negotiating with the sspx - the pontifical commission ecclesia dei - would work more closely with the congregation for the doctrine of the faith , the church 's watchdog on orthodoxy and disciplinary matters .
the views espoused by the sspx are controversial in catholic circles .
the group rejects modernization of the church through a set of reforms created under the second vatican council in the 1960s .
benedict , who took part in the council , said in his letter that sspx clerics would remain suspended from holding any official positions in the church until they fully subscribed to the reforms . dfm / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bucharest has already asked the european commission to save it from a possible financing crisis .
hungary and latvia have grabbed at lifelines from the imf . thomas mirow , the head of the european bank for reconstruction and development , explained the situation in various eastern european countries and how they can move forward . deutsche welle : romania has joined hungary and latvia in requesting emergency loans from the european union .
how serious is the economic situation in central and eastern europe ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : each country needs to determine its own ideal way through the crisis , mirow said thomas mirow : the situation is certainly difficult .
talks have not yet been concluded , but romania has long been seen as a country that has been at particular risk because of very high debts in foreign currencies .
its own currency has been under pressure for a long time , which makes the decision to look for help from the imf a logical step that will contribute to stabilizing the country . are you afraid of the problem spreading to other countries via the domino effect ? no , i am not .
the situation in other countries is completely different .
i am , however , of the opinion that it makes sense to get in touch with the imf in a timely manner .
international investors usually know to respect that .
when such contact is necessary , it makes more sense to do it early than to wait and , for example , have to accept longer phases of devaluation of one 's own currency . how can the situation be diffused ?
what 's the best way forward ? that 's not easy to say because the causes of the problems are different .
in some countries it 's just the financial sector that is suffering from a weak framework , vulnerable and susceptible to sudden crises .
other countries have a relatively robust financial sector , such as poland , and are affected more by developments in the real economy , like the development in western european auto industry . should the eu emergency funds be built up in the manner some politicians are calling for ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there appears to still be enough eu money to aid countries looking for help the european council of finance ministers debated that issue on tuesday .
first of all , i think it is important that the funds are available to the countries that want to make use of them .
should they be exhausted , then it would certainly be a good idea to have additional resources .
but there are apparently still enough resources available . do you think the current support for eastern europe is sufficient ? no , i think more could and should be done - each within its own area .
most of all , i think it is important that heads of state and government of the eu , possibly when they meet in a little over a week , as well as at the g20 meeting in london in april , make it absolutely clear they are determined to represent the countries of central and eastern europe . it sounds as though you expect action in addition to politicians ' words .
what action ? the resources of the eu that have been mentioned are one element .
a second element is that the imf , the world bank and we , as a bank that has been and continues to be active in eastern europe , give our encouragement and support to help these countries .
additional steps by the european central bank could also be a topic of discussion . is it a good idea to accelerate the adoption of the euro to provide added security ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro zone ca n't afford to weaken its entry criteria yes and no .
yes in the sense that the perspective of membership in the euro zone is a positive signal .
no in the sense that i do not believe the criteria for entry should be weakened , that would hurt confidence in the stability of the euro as a whole .
i think one would be well-advised to think about whether , for example , certain terms of time could be shortened .
but the hard criteria should remain . you have been talking about stability .
how big is the danger of a state in the region going bankrupt ? based on current evidence , this is not a danger . how did eastern europe get into this situation ?
many of the states reformed their financial systems according to the theories set out by western financial experts . eastern europe is , in terms of markets , every highly integrated .
it has , for example , opened its borders to western european banks , but it has not advanced as far in term of politics and its opening to the euro zone .
political integration is lagging behind market integration .
the second reason is that central and eastern europe , in real economic terms , are very dependent on certain key industries , such as the western european automobile industry .
since in addition to the financial crisis and the overall economic crisis we are also dealing with a structural crisis in the global auto industry , countries like hungary , the czech republic and slovakia are hard hit because they live from exports in general and especially from the auto industry . is there a feeling among eastern europeans that they are being neglected by their western neighbors ? i do not think that 's the case , at the moment .
but in western europe , i believe , we have a reason to watch the situation and not allow such development to occur .
it is a symbolic year that we are living in .
twenty years ago the berlin wall fell , and we all remember the contribution hungary made to that event .
we can not allow the impression you mentioned to arise . interview : andreas noll -lrb- sms -rrb- editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i 'm serious … i have weapons here and tomorrow morning i am going to go to my old school and really fry them .
keep the name winnenden in mind , " the teenager wrote . the teenager went on a rampage in his former secondary school in the small town of winnenden in the state of baden-wuerttemberg in southwestern germany on wednesday morning , shooting nine students between the ages of 15 and 16 , as well as three teachers .
three bystanders were also killed as the gunman attempted to flee police . tim k. was pursued by hundreds of armed police officers and snipers , assisted by helicopters and dogs .
less than three hours after his rampage began , he turned his weapon on himself after being injured in an exchange of fire with police . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police commandos leave the albertville school on wednesday german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble ordered flags across the country to be flown at half mast on thursday . a first memorial service was held on wednesday evening in a church in the town of 27,000 people .
mourners lit candles at the altar , and created a makeshift memorial of candles and flowers outside the albertville school , where the shooting spree occurred .
psychologists advise long-term care the albertville secondary school has been closed until further notice , and at least one psychologist has advised that it should remain closed permanently , as students would otherwise be forced to relive the trauma .
a team of psychologists and spiritual advisors are in winnenden to care for the victims ' family members , the students and their teachers .
according to spiritual advisor ralf radix , the community will need long-term care if they are to come to terms with wednesday 's tragic events .
" each person affected needs something different , " he told germany 's protestant church press service , epd .
" one person might need some peace and quiet , which we then have to create in the midst of all this hectic activity , and someone else might need a partner to talk to . "

" our thoughts go out to the families and the friends .
we are thinking of you and we are praying for you . "
politicians call for action in the meantime , politicians have begun to voice their opinions on ways to better protect germany 's students and prevent such massacres from happening in the future .
the head of the parliamentary interior committee , sebastian edathy -lrb- spd -rrb- said he thought the case could be made to install metal detectors at select schools .
while such measures have become commonplace at schools in the united states in the wake of the columbine school shooting in 1999 , germany has so far resisted tougher security systems in its schools .
bavarian interior minister , joachim herrmann -lrb- csu -rrb- , has also spoken out in favor of a ban on violent computer games after it emerged that tim k. had killer games such as counterstrike on his computer at home .
criminologist hans-dieter schwind said the government must act to tighten germany 's gun laws .
tim k. got the pistol he used in wednesday 's massacre from his parents ' bedroom .

all but one of the nine students , aged between 14 and 16 , were girls , and the three teachers gunned down were all women . heribert rech , interior minister of the german state of baden-wuerttemberg , where the crime was committed , said he did n't want to draw conclusions , telling journalists that could have been based on how the classes were drawn up . however , rech did admit that the fact that most of the victims were killed with a shot to the head indicated that they were not random targets . portrait of a killer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police are examining the gunman 's computer looking for answers the perpetrator , identified only as tim k. , was described by school officials as being an unremarkable student . he had achieved average marks on his school leaving certificate and had then enrolled in a course to become a salesman .
tim k. also regularly worked out at the gym and belonged to a sports club . however , a 19-year-old neighbor , who identified himself as michael and said he used to play table tennis with the gunman , told the reuters news agency that tim k. was a loner who had a big collection of horror films . germany has strict gun control laws .
yet police say the gunman had used a nine millimeter pistol registered to his father , a member of a gun club who has a collection of 15 guns at home . emergency plans in place after a school shooting in germany in 2002 , many schools have implemented plans laying out what to do in the event that a gunman should attack the school . authorities are reporting that once the gunman entered the school , the principal announced a coded message on the public address system , saying , " frau koma is coming . " one student , identified only as kim s. , told zdf television that their teacher shut the door and told them to close the windows and sit on the floor . focus on prevention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say students are often best able to identify potential attackers in addition to finding the motive of the killer , many in germany are wondering how these types of attacks can be prevented in the future . wilhelm heitmeyer , a sociologist who specializes in school violence , told deutsche welle that the best people to identify a potential attacker are fellow students . " we see that a lot of the perpetrators are very isolated and they speak out about violent acts , " he says , " and it 's the peers , and not the teachers , who are going to notice this the most . " heitmeyer warns , however , that what actually triggers these people to finally act out is a mystery .
talking about these attacks more openly with students of all ages is the best way to prevent them in the future , he says . mrm / th / ap / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i 'm serious … i have weapons here and tomorrow morning i am going to go to my old school and really fry them .
keep the name winnenden in mind , " the teenager wrote . the teenager went on a rampage in his former secondary school in the small town of winnenden in the state of baden-wuerttemberg in southwestern germany on wednesday morning , shooting nine students between the ages of 15 and 16 , as well as three teachers .
three bystanders were also killed as the gunman attempted to flee police . tim k. was pursued by hundreds of armed police officers and snipers , assisted by helicopters and dogs .
less than three hours after his rampage began , he turned his weapon on himself after being injured in an exchange of fire with police . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police commandos leave the albertville school on wednesday german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble ordered flags across the country to be flown at half mast on thursday . a first memorial service was held on wednesday evening in a church in the town of 27,000 people .
mourners lit candles at the altar , and created a makeshift memorial of candles and flowers outside the albertville school , where the shooting spree occurred .
psychologists advise long-term care the albertville secondary school has been closed until further notice , and at least one psychologist has advised that it should remain closed permanently , as students would otherwise be forced to relive the trauma .
a team of psychologists and spiritual advisors are in winnenden to care for the victims ' family members , the students and their teachers .
according to spiritual advisor ralf radix , the community will need long-term care if they are to come to terms with wednesday 's tragic events .
" each person affected needs something different , " he told germany 's protestant church press service , epd .
" one person might need some peace and quiet , which we then have to create in the midst of all this hectic activity , and someone else might need a partner to talk to . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel offered her sympathy to the family members of the victims in her initial comments on the shooting , a visibly shaken chancellor angela merkel on wednesday described the crime as " incomprehensible . "

" our thoughts go out to the families and the friends .
we are thinking of you and we are praying for you . "
politicians call for action in the meantime , politicians have begun to voice their opinions on ways to better protect germany 's students and prevent such massacres from happening in the future .
the head of the parliamentary interior committee , sebastian edathy -lrb- spd -rrb- said he thought the case could be made to install metal detectors at select schools .
while such measures have become commonplace at schools in the united states in the wake of the columbine school shooting in 1999 , germany has so far resisted tougher security systems in its schools .
bavarian interior minister , joachim herrmann -lrb- csu -rrb- , has also spoken out in favor of a ban on violent computer games after it emerged that tim k. had killer games such as counterstrike on his computer at home .
criminologist hans-dieter schwind said the government must act to tighten germany 's gun laws .
tim k. got the pistol he used in wednesday 's massacre from his parents ' bedroom .
his father , reportedly a member of a local shooting club , is said to own over a dozen guns , all locked away except the nine-millimeter beretta that caused the carnage .
other experts , including psychologists , say it 's up to school officials to become more sensitive to the early warning signals sent out by troubled youths such as tim k. , who reportedly was an outsider at the albertville school with few friends .
" one alarm signal is when young people strongly isolate themselves from their environment and spend hours each day in front of their computers , " said joerg fegert , psychiatrist at the university clinic for child and youth psychology in ulm . he noted that gunmen like tim k. often hint at their plans in online diaries or chatrooms , but that parents and teachers often remain oblivious , or react too late . dc / sp / dpa / epd send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bucharest has already asked the european commission to save it from a possible financing crisis .
hungary and latvia have grabbed at lifelines from the imf . thomas mirow , the head of the european bank for reconstruction and development , explained the situation in various eastern european countries and how they can move forward . deutsche welle : romania has joined hungary and latvia in requesting emergency loans from the european union .
how serious is the economic situation in central and eastern europe ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : each country needs to determine its own ideal way through the crisis , mirow said thomas mirow : the situation is certainly difficult .
talks have not yet been concluded , but romania has long been seen as a country that has been at particular risk because of very high debts in foreign currencies .
its own currency has been under pressure for a long time , which makes the decision to look for help from the imf a logical step that will contribute to stabilizing the country . are you afraid of the problem spreading to other countries via the domino effect ? no , i am not .
the situation in other countries is completely different .
i am , however , of the opinion that it makes sense to get in touch with the imf in a timely manner .
international investors usually know to respect that .
when such contact is necessary , it makes more sense to do it early than to wait and , for example , have to accept longer phases of devaluation of one 's own currency . how can the situation be diffused ?
what 's the best way forward ? that 's not easy to say because the causes of the problems are different .
in some countries it 's just the financial sector that is suffering from a weak framework , vulnerable and susceptible to sudden crises .
other countries have a relatively robust financial sector , such as poland , and are affected more by developments in the real economy , like the development in western european auto industry . should the eu emergency funds be built up in the manner some politicians are calling for ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there appears to still be enough eu money to aid countries looking for help the european council of finance ministers debated that issue on tuesday .
first of all , i think it is important that the funds are available to the countries that want to make use of them .
should they be exhausted , then it would certainly be a good idea to have additional resources .
but there are apparently still enough resources available . do you think the current support for eastern europe is sufficient ? no , i think more could and should be done - each within its own area .
most of all , i think it is important that heads of state and government of the eu , possibly when they meet in a little over a week , as well as at the g20 meeting in london in april , make it absolutely clear they are determined to represent the countries of central and eastern europe . it sounds as though you expect action in addition to politicians ' words .
what action ? the resources of the eu that have been mentioned are one element .
a second element is that the imf , the world bank and we , as a bank that has been and continues to be active in eastern europe , give our encouragement and support to help these countries .
additional steps by the european central bank could also be a topic of discussion . is it a good idea to accelerate the adoption of the euro to provide added security ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro zone ca n't afford to weaken its entry criteria yes and no .
yes in the sense that the perspective of membership in the euro zone is a positive signal .
no in the sense that i do not believe the criteria for entry should be weakened , that would hurt confidence in the stability of the euro as a whole .
i think one would be well-advised to think about whether , for example , certain terms of time could be shortened .
but the hard criteria should remain . you have been talking about stability .
how big is the danger of a state in the region going bankrupt ? based on current evidence , this is not a danger . how did eastern europe get into this situation ?
many of the states reformed their financial systems according to the theories set out by western financial experts . eastern europe is , in terms of markets , every highly integrated .
it has , for example , opened its borders to western european banks , but it has not advanced as far in term of politics and its opening to the euro zone .
political integration is lagging behind market integration .
the second reason is that central and eastern europe , in real economic terms , are very dependent on certain key industries , such as the western european automobile industry .
since in addition to the financial crisis and the overall economic crisis we are also dealing with a structural crisis in the global auto industry , countries like hungary , the czech republic and slovakia are hard hit because they live from exports in general and especially from the auto industry . is there a feeling among eastern europeans that they are being neglected by their western neighbors ? i do not think that 's the case , at the moment .
but in western europe , i believe , we have a reason to watch the situation and not allow such development to occur .
it is a symbolic year that we are living in .
twenty years ago the berlin wall fell , and we all remember the contribution hungary made to that event .
we can not allow the impression you mentioned to arise . interview : andreas noll -lrb- sms -rrb- editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but a new charm offensive launched by the berlin senate hopes to spread an aura of friendliness about the capital . grumpy , sarcastic , and none too shy about piping up with a flippant comeback - that 's the attitude known as the berlin " schnauze " or " snout " to use its literal english translation .
the berlin senate is hoping to counteract its residents ' innate churlishness by appointing 4,000 civil servants , including police officers , public transport workers , waiters and trade fair hostesses to be " good-mood ambassadors . "
they 'll receive red buttons singling them out as friendly sources of information for newcomers and visitors to the capital .
the goal is " to make the city a little more friendly , " said rene gurka of berlin partner , the company behind the campaign , which kicked off this week in conjunction with the start of the annual itb tourism trade fair . " a few years ago , we did a study that showed that non-germans considered berlin a place full of grumpy people , " senate spokesman richard meng told news agency afp .
" we need to show the world that this is n't true . "
confronting stereotypes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's police officers are being encouraged to lighten up a little as part of the campaign , which is expected to cost 200,000 euros -lrb- $ 255,000 -rrb- , civil servants will also hand out postcards printed with prime examples of berliners ' unique brand of sarcasm - and written in the local dialect , of course .
the phrases are meant to be a light-hearted poke in the ribs of the stereotypical berliner , while also showing that it is possible to do service with a smile .
" these cards are fantastic , they show we do n't always take ourselves too seriously and that we can laugh at ourselves , too , " said meng .
berlin is visited by more than eight million tourists annually , and is expecting an increase in tourism this year as it celebrates the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall .
it 's not the first time officials have been after locals to put a shine on the city 's image .
when germany hosted the soccer world cup in 2006 , berlin taxi drivers were offered extra training in english and courteous service as part of a national friendliness campaign .
and a multi-million-euro campaign launched last year under the motto " be berlin " encouraged locals to project a more positive image to foreigners and tourists .
as yet , there are no statistics to attest to whether or not such campaigns bring about lasting , real change .
but organizers such as gurka say there 's not really much changing to do : beneath their rough exterior , most berliners already are " service-oriented , hospitable and cosmopolitan people .

benedict said the vatican failed to be " sufficiently clear " in explaining the reasons for lifting the excommunication of four bishops .
he said he was told after the crisis exploded that better use of the internet would have revealed some of the problems .
he added that he " draws the lesson " from the matter and that in the future the vatican must " pay more attention to this source of information , " news agency reuters reported .
in january , the pope lifted the excommunication of richard williamson and three other bishops .
williamson said in an interview broadcast several days earlier that he believed there were no gas chambers and that no more than 300,000 jews perished in nazi concentration camps , rather than the 6 million accepted by most historians .
the vatican said it was not aware of williamson 's views on the holocaust , but critics have pointed out that internet-based material written by williamson on the matter has existed for some time .
the vatican said the letter would be published thursday with copies available in english , italian , french , german , portuguese and spanish .
world anger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british-born cleric richard williamson has stirred anger worldwide williamson 's comments stirred anger in jewish communities throughout the world , as well as in catholic circles .
several european leaders , including german chancellor angela merkel , called on the germany-born pope to explain the vatican 's decision to waive the excommunications .
it is extremely rare in church history for a pope to explain his actions to his bishops after the fact and to acknowledge any error on his behalf .
the pope said that in the future the vatican body charged with negotiating with the sspx - the pontifical commission ecclesia dei - would work more closely with the congregation for the doctrine of the faith , the church 's watchdog on orthodoxy and disciplinary matters .
the views espoused by the sspx are controversial in catholic circles .
the group rejects modernization of the church through a set of reforms created under the second vatican council in the 1960s .
benedict , who took part in the council , said in his letter that sspx clerics would remain suspended from holding any official positions in the church until they fully subscribed to the reforms . dfm / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the bus was attacked by roma fans after the driver became lost near the olympic stadium , the british embassy said .
the victim was treated inside the stadium for a cut to his leg .
prior to the match , english fans had been advised to avoid areas where roma 's hooligan following , the ultras , are known to congregate .
an arsenal spokeswoman said : " a male arsenal fan was believed to be stabbed outside the stadium .
" roma fans threw stones at a bus , smashing windows , and an individual allegedly entered the bus and stabbed a fan . "

spencer kelly looks at how hackers use hijacked home pcs to send out millions of spam e-mails software used to control thousands of home computers has been acquired online by the bbc as part of an investigation into global cyber crime .
the technology programme click has demonstrated just how at risk pcs are of being taken over by hackers .
almost 22,000 computers made up click 's network of hijacked machines , which has now been disabled .
the bbc has now warned users that their pcs are infected , and advised them on how to make their systems more secure .
concerted attack click managed to acquire its own low-value botnet - the name given to a network of hijacked computers - after visiting chatrooms on the internet .
the programme did not access any personal information on the infected pcs .
if this exercise had been done with criminal intent it would be breaking the law .
but our purpose was to demonstrate botnets ' collective power when in the hands of criminals .
click ordered its pcs to send out spam to two specific test e-mail addresses set up by the programme .
cyber gangs use botnets to support crimes such as fraud and theft within hours , the inboxes started to fill up with thousands of junk messages .
but a botnet can also be used to launch a concerted attack on commercial websites to take them out of action .
hefty ransom by prior agreement , click launched a distributed denial of service -lrb- ddos -rrb- attack on a backup site owned by security company prevx .
click then ordered its slave pcs to bombard its target site with requests for access to make it inaccessible .
amazingly , it took only 60 machines to overload the site 's bandwidth .
ddos attacks are used by extortionists who threaten to knock a site offline unless a hefty ransom is paid .
jacques erasmus from prevx said that high-traffic websites with big revenues are a " massive target " for this kind of attack .
" cyber criminals are getting into contact with websites and threatening them with ddos attacks .
" the loss of trade is very substantial so a lot of these websites just pay-up to avoid it , " he explained .
evolving threat click has now destroyed its botnet , and no longer controls any hijacked machines .
however , the owners of unprotected pcs have been made aware that they are vulnerable to future attacks .
how a botnet works in graphics in addition , click advised them on what steps to take to make their systems more secure .
most computers have protection systems that need to be switched on and kept updated to protect them against the evolving threat from hackers .
machines can be compromised simply by visiting an infected web page or opening an e-mail containing a virus as an attachment .
' very professional ' hackers exploit unprotected computers for valuable data such as banking and credit card details .
criminals use botnets to send out thousands of spam messages , store stolen data , and fraud .
for instance , " phishing " e-mails which attempt to trick people into revealing their bank details are often routed through a botnet .
users are normally unaware that their pcs are being controlled remotely by cyber criminals because there are almost no symptoms .
greg day from security firm mcafee explained that the people who control botnets are " very skilled professionals . "
" we 've seen this move from what used to be a hobbyist bit of fun into something now that is very professional , " he said .
hackers are keen to recruit new pcs to a botnet to create a resource that they sell or hire out to other cyber criminals .
but some networks of hijacked computers are of " much more value " than others , according to mr erasmus .
" computers from the us and the uk go for about $ 350 to $ 400 -lrb- £ 254- £ 290 -rrb- for 1,000 because they 've got much more financial details , like online banking passwords and credit cards details , " he said .
this report will be broadcast in this week 's edition of click on saturday 14 march at 1130 gmt on the bbc news channel .

spencer kelly looks at how hackers use hijacked home pcs to send out millions of spam e-mails software used to control thousands of home computers has been acquired online by the bbc as part of an investigation into global cyber crime .
the technology programme click has demonstrated just how at risk pcs are of being taken over by hackers .
almost 22,000 computers made up click 's network of hijacked machines , which has now been disabled .
the bbc has now warned users that their pcs are infected , and advised them on how to make their systems more secure .
concerted attack click managed to acquire its own low-value botnet - the name given to a network of hijacked computers - after visiting chatrooms on the internet .
the programme did not access any personal information on the infected pcs .
if this exercise had been done with criminal intent it would be breaking the law .
but our purpose was to demonstrate botnets ' collective power when in the hands of criminals .
click ordered its pcs to send out spam to two specific test e-mail addresses set up by the programme .
cyber gangs use botnets to support crimes such as fraud and theft within hours , the inboxes started to fill up with thousands of junk messages .
but a botnet can also be used to launch a concerted attack on commercial websites to take them out of action .
hefty ransom by prior agreement , click launched a distributed denial of service -lrb- ddos -rrb- attack on a backup site owned by security company prevx .
click then ordered its slave pcs to bombard its target site with requests for access to make it inaccessible .
amazingly , it took only 60 machines to overload the site 's bandwidth .
ddos attacks are used by extortionists who threaten to knock a site offline unless a hefty ransom is paid .
jacques erasmus from prevx said that high-traffic websites with big revenues are a " massive target " for this kind of attack .
" cyber criminals are getting into contact with websites and threatening them with ddos attacks .
" the loss of trade is very substantial so a lot of these websites just pay-up to avoid it , " he explained .
evolving threat click has now destroyed its botnet , and no longer controls any hijacked machines .
however , the owners of unprotected pcs have been made aware that they are vulnerable to future attacks .
how a botnet works in graphics in addition , click advised them on what steps to take to make their systems more secure .
most computers have protection systems that need to be switched on and kept updated to protect them against the evolving threat from hackers .
machines can be compromised simply by visiting an infected web page or opening an e-mail containing a virus as an attachment .
' very professional ' hackers exploit unprotected computers for valuable data such as banking and credit card details .
criminals use botnets to send out thousands of spam messages , store stolen data , and fraud .
for instance , " phishing " e-mails which attempt to trick people into revealing their bank details are often routed through a botnet .
users are normally unaware that their pcs are being controlled remotely by cyber criminals because there are almost no symptoms .
greg day from security firm mcafee explained that the people who control botnets are " very skilled professionals . "
" we 've seen this move from what used to be a hobbyist bit of fun into something now that is very professional , " he said .
hackers are keen to recruit new pcs to a botnet to create a resource that they sell or hire out to other cyber criminals .
but some networks of hijacked computers are of " much more value " than others , according to mr erasmus .
" computers from the us and the uk go for about $ 350 to $ 400 -lrb- £ 254- £ 290 -rrb- for 1,000 because they 've got much more financial details , like online banking passwords and credit cards details , " he said .
this report will be broadcast in this week 's edition of click on saturday 14 march at 1130 gmt on the bbc news channel .

machines can be compromised simply by visiting an infected web page or opening an e-mail containing a virus as an attachment .
' very professional ' hackers exploit unprotected computers for valuable data such as banking and credit card details .
criminals use botnets to send out thousands of spam messages , store stolen data , and fraud .
for instance , " phishing " e-mails which attempt to trick people into revealing their bank details are often routed through a botnet .
users are normally unaware that their pcs are being controlled remotely by cyber criminals because there are almost no symptoms .
greg day from security firm mcafee explained that the people who control botnets are " very skilled professionals . "
" we 've seen this move from what used to be a hobbyist bit of fun into something now that is very professional , " he said .
hackers are keen to recruit new pcs to a botnet to create a resource that they sell or hire out to other cyber criminals .
but some networks of hijacked computers are of " much more value " than others , according to mr erasmus .
" computers from the us and the uk go for about $ 350 to $ 400 -lrb- £ 254- £ 290 -rrb- for 1,000 because they 've got much more financial details , like online banking passwords and credit cards details , " he said .
this report will be broadcast in this week 's edition of click on saturday 14 march at 1130 gmt on the bbc news channel .

the parents may be keen to bring closure to this very sad case with some dignity " lead investigator phil james the carrier bag had printed on its side : " bath street wine cellar , quality wine merchant , jersey ci . "
crime review officer , phil james , who is leading the cold case investigation , said : " dorset police has a duty to bring this unsolved historic case to a conclusion and is committed to doing so .
" i would appeal to the mother or father of the baby to contact me .
" they may be keen to bring closure to this very sad case and may wish to do this with some dignity , rather than live in fear of receiving that unexpected call .
" advances in forensic science now provide investigative opportunities to obtain a dna profile of the baby girl and , potentially , the mother and father .

the council of mortgage lenders said : " lending criteria have been tightened on new-build properties . "
iranian-born mr kaveh , 51 , who trained as an architect before becoming a property developer in malvern , said he believed the drop in property values " has or will flatten out very soon " .
he said he had noticed an improvement in sales and rentals among his portfolio of more than 100 properties in the west midlands .
a bulk-buy discount with builder barratt homes on cardiff properties in dumballs road , cardiff bay , and ty glas square , llanishen , allowed him to give tenants the rent-to-buy option , he said .
given the current economic climate we would be supportive of any measure that provides opportunities to inject fluidity into the housing market vikki hiscocks , chartered institute of housing cymru he said : " we are setting the sale price now .
we certainly believe that in 18 months time the flats will be priced higher than they will be today .
" obviously , the worst case scenario for the tenant in 18 months time is that they have just rented a flat .
" from our point of view , if we sell them , then we would still have made a profit on the sale in 18 months time , because of our purchasing powers by buying in bulk .
" if tenants do n't buy , the most important thing is that tenants look after the place for us .
the first 18 months ' rent can be used as a deposit , says mr kaveh " people tend to stay because they realise -lsb- the rent -rsb- is money in the bank for them , whether or not they decide to take up the offer . "
the 90-flat purchase deal was brokered by estate agency thomas and rose , whose co-proprietor sean mcmahon , said : " with the pressure on the banks now to start lending , we 're hoping that in 18 months time people will be able to secure funding .
" this way it is a true refund of their money . "
vikki hiscocks , of chartered institute of housing -lrb- cih -rrb- cymru , said : " given the current economic climate we would be supportive of any measure that provides opportunities to inject fluidity into the housing market .
' larger deposit ' " the scheme would appear to be a win-win opportunity offering benefits to both the developer and tenants / potential owners . "
however , she said tenants should not be left in a vulnerable position if they later decided not to purchase .
sarah robson , of the council of mortgage lenders , said the tenants may need a larger deposit than 10 % because lending criteria had been tightened on new-build properties .
she said : " there are a number of incentives being offered by developers with criteria aimed at developers looking at trying to create interest in their properties .
" i have n't heard of this -lsb- scheme -rsb- but it 's to be expected .
it 's a good thing for the developer if they can sell their properties .
" from a lender 's perspective it 's going to be a matter of assessing the individual property and its value and making a decision . "

bbc news -pipe- uk -pipe- wales -pipe- tenants offered rent-to-buy deal bbc news / wales graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- uk contents : england -pipe- northern ireland -pipe- scotland -pipe- wales -pipe- uk politics -pipe- magazine 06:58 gmt , thursday , 12 march 2009 tenants offered rent-to-buy deal a developer says he is offering to help tenants beat the credit crunch and become home owners by taking their first 18 months ' rent as a deposit .
hekmat kaveh , based in worcestershire , has bought 90 one-bedroom flats at two locations in cardiff which he plans to rent out at £ 500- £ 525 per month .
he said tenants have an option to buy the new build apartments for £ 99,950 .
the council of mortgage lenders said : " lending criteria have been tightened on new-build properties . "
iranian-born mr kaveh , 51 , who trained as an architect before becoming a property developer in malvern , said he believed the drop in property values " has or will flatten out very soon " .
he said he had noticed an improvement in sales and rentals among his portfolio of more than 100 properties in the west midlands .
a bulk-buy discount with builder barratt homes on cardiff properties in dumballs road , cardiff bay , and ty glas square , llanishen , allowed him to give tenants the rent-to-buy option , he said . "
given the current economic climate we would be supportive of any measure that provides opportunities to inject fluidity into the housing market " vikki hiscocks , chartered institute of housing cymru he said : " we are setting the sale price now .
we certainly believe that in 18 months time the flats will be priced higher than they will be today .
" obviously , the worst case scenario for the tenant in 18 months time is that they have just rented a flat .
" from our point of view , if we sell them , then we would still have made a profit on the sale in 18 months time , because of our purchasing powers by buying in bulk .
" if tenants do n't buy , the most important thing is that tenants look after the place for us .
" people tend to stay because they realise -lsb- the rent -rsb- is money in the bank for them , whether or not they decide to take up the offer . "
the 90-flat purchase deal was brokered by estate agency thomas and rose , whose co-proprietor sean mcmahon , said : " with the pressure on the banks now to start lending , we 're hoping that in 18 months time people will be able to secure funding .
" this way it is a true refund of their money . "
vikki hiscocks , of chartered institute of housing -lrb- cih -rrb- cymru , said : " given the current economic climate we would be supportive of any measure that provides opportunities to inject fluidity into the housing market .
' larger deposit ' " the scheme would appear to be a win-win opportunity offering benefits to both the developer and tenants / potential owners . "
however , she said tenants should not be left in a vulnerable position if they later decided not to purchase .
sarah robson , of the council of mortgage lenders , said the tenants may need a larger deposit than 10 % because lending criteria had been tightened on new-build properties .
she said : " there are a number of incentives being offered by developers with criteria aimed at developers looking at trying to create interest in their properties .
" i have n't heard of this -lsb- scheme -rsb- but it 's to be expected .
it 's a good thing for the developer if they can sell their properties .
" from a lender 's perspective it 's going to be a matter of assessing the individual property and its value and making a decision . "

the 54-year-old , who is said to be the head of one of mexico 's most powerful drug cartels , is 701st on the list with an estimated fortune of $ 1bn -lrb- £ 722m -rrb- .
mr guzman , who escaped from a mexican prison in 2001 , is understood to be at large in mexico or central america .
mexican officials blame much of the recent violence in the north of the country on mr guzman .
' charismatic ' forbes estimates that last year mexican and colombian traffickers made between $ 18bn -lrb- £ 13bn -rrb- and $ 39bn -lrb- £ 28bn -rrb- .
mr guzman 's slice of that pie comes from his assumed control of the sinaloa cartel , which is named after the mexican state in which it is based .
billionaires in 2009 total number : 793 -lrb- 1,125 in 2008 -rrb- net worth : $ 2.4tn -lrb- $ 4.4tn in 2008 -rrb- women : 72 -lrb- 99 in 2008 -rrb- average age : 63.7 -lrb- 61 in 2008 -rrb- youngest billionaires lose money for over a year the sinaloa cartel has been trying to oust a rival gang from the border city of ciudad juarez ; the turf war has left more than 2,000 people dead .
those who have met mr guzman , who stands at just 5 feet tall -lrb- 152cm -rrb- , describe him as a man of extraordinary charisma and intelligence .
in 2001 , he escaped from a mexican jail in a laundry truck , having apparently charmed , and bribed the entire prison staff .
his wedding in 2007 to his 18-year-old wife was so heavily guarded that the mexican army did not attempt to arrest the groom .
mr guzman is not the first alleged drug runner to have made it into the illustrious ranks of the forbes list of billionaires .
in 1989 , colombia 's pablo escobar was ranked the 7th richest man in the world , with $ 25bn -lrb- £ 18bn -rrb- to his name .
there is no sign that global drug consumption is falling .
and as long as the demand remains , fortunes will be made .

jim haggerty is a true believer .
he is a 50-something civil-servant who speaks pashtu with a geordie accent .
he is a little like those people who sidle up to you on the high street with a beaming smile borne from salvation , lean in close , clasp your hand and ask : " have you heard the good news ? "

the job of the ' stabad ' , is to try to help bring stability and security to an area and encourage development and construction to take place .
in helmand that is a challenge that would faze most people .
the province is home to a virulent insurgency , poverty is endemic , conservative islam is entrenched and there is long tradition of distrust of foreigners , especially in uniform .

it is a sign of the affection and respect that jim has earned here -lrb- even if he objects to being designated " older " than habibullah -rrb- .
the men embrace and we are taken to see the market .
on one level it is unremarkable ; the usual bustling collection of ramshackle sheds selling bread and tea and clothes and cheap plastic goods made in china .
but as this town was a taliban stronghold just a few weeks ago and the market was a shuttered-up shooting gallery , the market is in every way remarkable .
now there are 300 stalls doing a healthy business and both men insist economic life is coming back to the town .
we also visit the new clinic , which is doing a bristling trade in sickness .
more than 100 people-a-day are coming from across the district to receive treatment at this newly refurbished and equipped centre .
' ripple effect ' it has cost about $ 40,000 -lrb- £ 28,900 -rrb- of british tax-payers ' money .

jim believes these developments will have a " ripple effect " in an area where a contest for influence with the taliban is a daily struggle .
his post is funded by the ministry of defence , foreign office and department for international development .
they spend millions of pounds every year on helmand and although there are achievements like nad-i-ali , they are limited .
judging success in helmand depends entirely on perspective .
although the market here has 300 stalls , there were actually 800 a year ago , before the british took on the taliban in operation red dagger in late 2008 .
then , people fled the town and the bazaar was closed .
the taliban have now fled but that has come at a price .
similarly at the clinic , where long queues are forming , progress comes with a caveat .
the doctors and patients worry for their own safety because of the fighting in the area .
travelling here runs the risk of arriving with an injury far worse than the one you left home with .
but the most important caveat of all is geographic .
the progress that has been made is in small , restricted areas and the rest of the province is either ' no-man 's land ' or belongs to the taliban .
at 55 years old , jim haggerty could be doing many other things with his retirement .
but he has signed-on until the end of this year , far longer than almost anyone else spends in helmand .
he thinks of what his own wife and children , back at home in north yorkshire , want from life and he asks for similar things here .
not shopping malls and street lights but a basic , decent quality of life .
" you do n't have to see great things happening to be happy in the job " but what keeps him here is the belief that the british effort is making small steps forward .
the military work hard and take daily risks to try to increase the size of the land it controls .
but it is only small steps forward and in practice there are only a few areas where the kind of progress made in nad-i-ali is being replicated .
the challenge is to create far larger safe-havens in many more parts of the province .
for now the tipping point , where the tide turns against the insurgency , is still far off .
